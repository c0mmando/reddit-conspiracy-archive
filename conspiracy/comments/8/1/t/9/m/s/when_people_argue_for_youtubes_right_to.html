       Exactly, it would take some time, but another video-hosting service could replace Youtube eventually if a couple bigger channels simultaneously transitioned over to the same new service while advocating for it based on its principles of free speech/thought and its usability/functionality being similar to Youtube (i.e. scalable service, free, easy UI, search capabilities, etc.). With the right service marketing, initial incentive for users (no censorship based on opinions, no relation to Google, optional user-tracking, AI-predicted content suggestions, etc.), and eventual MSM coverage from the conversion effort, it'd turn into a domino effect and before long, Youtube would be obsolete for newer content creators (it'd take a couple years before older videos would be migrated to the new hosting system)
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'd like to see a new service that has designated categorical sections/realms while considering better functionality for facilitating and sharing discussions/collaborations, i.e sections for music/music videos, news-related broadcasts or analyses, movies/movie trailers &amp; reviews, video games-gameplay &amp; reviews, etc... essentially, individual categories/genres of hosted content similar to but not as precise as subreddits, but with a similar and generalized high-level architecture with a focus on discussion/content sharing (the Youtube comment section is a cesspool of stupidity, the lack of focus on discussion hinders the quality of visible comments and the experience for me).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm envisioning a service with similar functionality and architecture as Reddit. It's a video hosting platform, each video has its own comment thread associated with it (better functionality than Youtube's), but there are also specific content sections that function similar to forums where people share videos and users vote the best to the top, but you can also search site or section-wide for particular videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if this exists already to some degree, lol. I hardly ever use Youtube, but when I do, I always imagine it'd be a better experience if it had a similar structure as reddit in terms of having individual forums for sharing related content. Lots of conspiracy threads here already link to a video to facilitate discussion... imagine a service that directly hosts the content while also providing a user friendly interface for conversation. Content sharing and collaboration quality would increase. Reddit and Youtube would be merged into one new, single service.

       You do nothing. I mean unless someone is posting a hanging corpse or a gore video then you remove that shit along with the channel, but if it's just hate speech who cares let them have their free speech and flag it as adult and inappropriate so people know/have an idea on what the video is about.

       Actually that's the best argument they made. If it came down to it, I'm almost certain YouTube would be determined to be a monopoly, in the same sense that IE was in the 90s.

       That's besides the point. They might have a
       <em>
        defacto
       </em>
       monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what happened to Microsoft when they integrated their browser in the OS back in the 90s. They got slapped with massive fines from the EU because they were creating a
       <em>
        defacto
       </em>
       monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to have an absolute monopoly to be in violation of anti monopoly laws.

       So YouTube, the largest free video host, can choose to discriminate against speech they don’t agree with and refuse to associate with their brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the small time cake shop is required, enforced by the courts, that they not only associate their business with speech that they disagree with, but also speech that goes against their religion, because....?

       Because of existing anti-discrimination laws.  YouTube couldn’t ban all black people or all gay people from posting videos simply because of their race or sexuality.  They can ban people from posting videos for reasons that aren’t protected by discrimination laws though.

       No because you aren’t a YouTube employee just because you post a video on YouTube.  They don’t send you a W2 at the end of the year.  It’s similar to how if you’re in a band and you play a show at a local bar and they pay you 500 bucks you aren’t considered an employee of that bar just because you got a paycheck from them.

       Clearly those laws needs to be expanded to internet monopolies when it comes to political disagreement. As one of the largest companies in the world, i would say google have an extra responsibility to treat people fairly.  Theres some bad companies out there. Just because they "stick to the law" doenst mean what they are doing are morally right. I would think people on the left would be the first to admit this? I mean who are you to critizice a company that doesnt pay a living wage, as long as what they are doing is legal?

       Well I think the problem here is that you are attributing what is happening at YouTube to "political disagreements" when there were liberal channels that were also terminated and there are plenty of conservative channels that weren't terminated.  It isn't like if you have a conservative channel you were banned and if you have a progressive channel you were OK.  It was more dependent on your content.  So I'm not sure how you would craft a law for that?  Private businesses can't discriminate against YouTube content creators who post conspiracy videos even if those videos defame individuals in the videos by calling them actors and saying they are lying about having family members die in tragic events?

       First of all, what liberal channels have been banned?

       We have the right to criticise public figures harshly. And some of the people in Florida chose to take part of the public political debate, by going on every TV show out there, spewing out political statements into american homes and worldwide.  If you chose to do that, you are subject to scrutiny. People will talk about you, and some will be negative towards you, If he didnt stick his head out there, i would absolutely agree with you.

       Right.. people can scrutinize all they want.  YouTube is under no obligation to allow anyone to post videos on their website though so people may have to scrutinize the shooting survivors on other websites aside from YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one liberal channel that I saw that was terminated was Atheism-is-Unstoppable.  He's a liberal/Hillary supporter and his account was banned in the same timeframe that this was all happening.  It looks like his account has since been restored but his account gets banned pretty frequently resulting in him having to challenge the bans to be reinstated  because, even though he's a liberal, he posts "controversial content" that ends up flagged all the time.

       No, but they should be, as long as it doesnt go against federal law. We are increasingly living our lives on the internet, and if we dont have free speech on the sites that 90% of the population is using, do we really have free speech anymore?  Times are changing drastically, but laws to protect free speech is lagging behind. Now if youtube removed and banned everyone critical to Trump, would you say thats a fair and responsible thing to do, or would you keep insisting "They are in their right, its their site." ?

       Facebook does have every right to ban them.  It's a decision a company has to make.  If YouTube bans so many people that enough users decide they no longer trust YouTube or want to use YouTube then YouTube loses a large enough amount of users that advertisers are no longer interested in advertising there and they go out of business or they have to change the way they do business.  That's how markets work.  Instead of being outraged and complaining "YouTube (which is a free website that I don't have to pay to use) shouldn't be allowed to prevent me from uploading videos no matter what.. they need to let me freeload on their website" some of these people should be working to develop a competing website or moving over to an existing website.  The problem is that everyone wants the built-in user base that YouTube already has but they also don't believe they should have to follow any of the terms of use that YouTube institutes.  So basically people want the government to come in and tell a private company "Hey, here is how you have to operate."  So basically, communism.

       Again, just because they operate within current law doesnt necessarily make it right. Liberals are criticizing companies left and right, even though they operate within the law and it is "their right".  If you point to a company that uses child labour, working 16 hours a day for 2 dollars, (and its legal where they are doing it) my response wont be "its legal, its their right - the kids can just quit the job!" When companies are chopping down large portions of rain forrest, i dont think its a good thing, even if its legal. I DONT think they are in their right, and that laws need to change to stop it.

       to be fair, the cake guy could have refused to bake the cake flat out without giving a reason and there would have been nothing done to him. but he chose to make it perfectly clear he was refusing because of who the customers were. more than civil rights, there was a don't be a dick factor to the court's ruling.

       Two questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contract law is in play, it may not apply but that might change this situation and it might protect users.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the government funding in anyway google/youtube?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're providing funding in some way, that might be grounds for 1A violations.

       Freedom of speech isn't the right to stand everywhere and talk. It's just the right to talk. You'd still be arrested if you walked into a random person's house and started going off about politics. Businesses aren't public places and so you can be removed for being disruptive as described by the business. Being a homosexual is different because that's just who they are. Kicking them out because they are who they are is discrimination. It's not because a person is a white supremacist that they get removed from sites, it's that white supremacists are assholes to those they look down on which isn't okay.

       There is no game but the one you play on yourself, for I support no illusion of superiority. We are all human and humans are inherently flawed. No one said there weren't supremacists among other groups, I only used white supremacists as an example as it applied to the over all discussion. Until everyone learns to work together and replace hate with understanding, these petty squabbles will persist from all sides.

       Is this concept of censorship really that fucking hard to understand?  Any society that begins to censor dissenting viewpoints that don't follow the ideological narrative of either those in their state media, or one of their major political platforms, is inevitably headed towards dictatorship and tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supporting the censorship of dissenting viewpoints is the epitome of dumbassery.

       I think government should keep their noses out of private industry, I have no problem with that.  What is very problematic is that Google has embedded itself with government, the same government that actively selects winners and losers in the private industry, based on political ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, Youtube censoring conservatism is Orwellian, it is EXACTLY the pattern of behavior that warns of future tyranny.  Googe does it with search results, "fact checkers" do it now, there is a blatant effort in the mainstream media all over Earth to suppress conservative viewpoints and promote globalism and aggressive political correctness.

       The US Government is so Republican that the DoJ, FBI, and CIA actively worked to subvert the US election so that a Democrat could win, inventing a false Russian narrative, violating the civil rights of US citizens, and spreading misinformation with their media allies for over 1 year...
      </p>
      <p>
       GTFO with that "the government is Republican", the media is Democrat, and every Democrat in the USA actively works to not only obstruct this administration, they actively work to collapse it.  This is not a functioning republic because the Democrat Party has aligned itself with big government coercion.

       Alex Jones has over 1 MILLION listeners, Trump would be a fool not to use that platform to obtain votes, especially when a corrupt intelligence apparatus is hard at work to bring him down 24-7.

       I agree. I think it's almost scary the censorship beginning to take place today, but as a private business they should have that right. It's our responsibility to stop using their platform and force their hand.

       The sad part is how many people agree with censorship because it aligns with their views not realizing that if censorship just becomes the norm it's only a matter of time before they're the ones being censored.  It's also particularly bad when you can easily block a channel or dislike it's content so you see less but instead people would rather just make censorship the go to response in any situation where they disagree with an opposing view.

       They have to apply ToS standards/sanctions equally.  YT is clearly targeting certain points of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its also worth noting, much of what YT has been removing is income-producing content.  The creators' investment in that content was made on a good-faith assumption that certain political views would
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be targeted by the platform's operators.

       There's not equally false statements coming from other points of view?  What about anti-vaxxers, holocaust deniers, white supremacists and religious cult leaders?  Mainstream thought considers those POV's to be not just lies but also harmful to various degrees.  Was there ever a sudden wave of anti-vaxx vids being scrubbed?  As for harmful, let's peruse YouTube's selection of chemistry &amp; engineering video options.

       A nice rule to follow on people like him is: if they are pushing products and trying to sell you stuff they're pushing bullshit verbally and physically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now on his site there is an "unprecedented" sale. You can't scroll even a few paragraphs without seeing ads for his products. It's like a mobile cancer porn site.

       You need to separate your clear and obvious hacks from your good ones. To fight every battle in a war is futile. Pick the worthy ones. Alex Jones makes people look gullible and stupid. r/conspiracy doesn't need that kind of bullshitter. You cut the gangrene out.

       Jones may not be the best to represent all of us, but he has his role. I wonder how many people he has brought into the conspiracy world, i feel like his videos brought me here to

       Basically my point. I don't have to agree with every conspiracy theory to appreciate that people are at least trying to find their own truth instead of gobbling up what the Gov or MSM is spoon feeding them. And I don't want to sit on the sidelines saying "well at least they're shutting up the crazies that make us look bad" because that's a very, very slippery slope.

       But there are legit people who get sucked into this bullshit. In the same way people are trying to warn people about stuff in this sub, they need to be warning people about the obvious horseshit of AJ. He is not a conspiracy theorist. He and his fans are what have made this sub look like a total joke over the past year and a half.

       That's the whole point. Let the viewers evaluate what is and isn't credible. It really is a slippery slope when you accept Google's curation of information, as they have political alliances and interests that can be served by controlling what's "true".

         If something is wrong, it can't be ok just because of who it happens to... it is a slippery slope between "it's ok that it happened to that guy" and "why is it now happening to me".

       Point is, I don't agree with most here, but don't be ok with something just because the person punished is a prick.

       YouTube can delete who they want. If they want. They are a private company. They have advertisers to appease. A business to run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how people can be crying about this and then wanting free enterprise. Is it just because it's a whack job who is claiming it's about freedom of speech which is absolutely showing a severe lack of basic knowledge on that subject? And then people are buying it? There is zero freedom of speech being taken away down a "slippery slope" here. If this was an account about about ramen noodles and foot fetish and YouTube deleted it no one here would care, but because it's a certified showman of sheep shit it's some big deal? It's not. He still has the freedom of speech to host his own videos absolutely ANYWHERE else. And that platform will have the ability to delete him too. Again, without any freedom of speech being restricted. And without any slippery slope starting.

       Few things:
      </p>
      <p>
       Because YouTube is a private company, they have a right to set their
       <strong>
        terms and services how they want
       </strong>
       .  I'm unsure if the people who they host are considered "employees", but to stay on the safe side of the law they should ensure they have a just reason to ban the channel... in this case they clearly do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this were
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       the case, then we would have an issue.  It could be argued that YouTube has too much influence to simply ban someone because they want to.  Rightfully we should be against this.  Since they are so influential to the voice of the people, we should demand transparency on the reason that they ban sites... even if it is an asshat like Alex Jones.

       I think WE give them (YT AND FB etc)) that pedestal. Same with Facebook. I look at them all like clubs. Social clubs. There are ones where you can get away with anything and ones where you can't. If you had a social club and let everyone run wild it would be chaos and people wouldn't come.

       Alex Jones isnt good. At all. He is just straight up lying and riling people up. The only time someone has bothered to ask him to shut up or they will sue was a little shop. He rolled over and did that and apologized. Unfortunately the US government and it's various branches like the FBI can't just sue him for bullshitting. Because that's all he's doing. Lying and bullshitting and selling snake oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       In court his defense to keep his kids was that it's all just a character. He knows what he does is fucking ridiculous but hey, it's paying the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he does isn't good. It is pushing bullshit that he's trying to convince people is the truth. It's uneducating people. It's dangerous. As much as he loves to hear people claim it is so. If I had a platform like YouTube and i had someone like him on there I'd tell him he's going in the satire section or he's going in the deleted selection.

       Yeah!  We do!  And we (not the government) have the ability to take it away!  I don't like how FB is being run... I haven't logged into it in over 3 years.  They don't get any profits from me.  I don't expect others to do the same... if they like it then FB has a good business model (even though I think it is causing the collapse of intelligent discussion.. but that's just me).  This is how the free market is SUPPOSED to work!

       I'm not disagreeing.  Like I said at the beginning, Alex Jones should have been banned.  This isn't because he's a malicious actor that preys on the ignorant, nor because he systematically perpetuates hate and fear.  It is because he repeatedly went against their t&amp;c.

       Idiotic is looking at Jones attacking victims of a school shooting and concluding that he's not bullying anyone. You're defending his bullying. That's the system. He's not just enabled by his most ardent supporters, he's enabled by people like you who look at perhaps the clearest example of bullying and harassment in history and say, "No, that's not bullying."

       There isn't censorship. He gets deleted. For breaking their terms and services. He can go to a YouTube competitor and do this thing there. His fans would just move over to there. It's that simple. He just wants to claim he's some victim here. He isn't. He's the drunk guy making a scene in the bar and getting kicked out. And good riddance.

       Ethically, maybe not, but legally, I think you'd have a hard case to make. At least federally, the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination against a protected class in places of "public accommodation," such as restaurants, hotels, etc. I think you'd have a hard time arguing in court that this would apply to a website.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd have to see what the actual Colorado statute concerning the bakery says, but I imagine it's modeled after the 1964 CRA, and merely adds sexual orientation as a protected class. Either way, as long as YT/Google/FB's policy is not designed to discriminate against a particular protected class, and is enforced consistently, then they're likely acting within the law. Political views or affiliations aren't protected classes either.

       You're right, "meetings" doesn't describe the relationship with their best customer. Alphabet was formed to parent Google so they aren't thrown under the bus whenever it's mentioned. Not even a conspiracy theory. Search Google CIA ... Not even kind of a secret.

       Your hypocrisy meter is spot on, which is why it’s so ridiculous for people to be railing against YouTube when they were defending the baker.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also not really the same thing. YouTube isn’t a retail business open to the public where you pay for goods. It’s a free service where you have to sign up and accept their terms of use, terms which specifically state your account can be terminated for any reason and they can remove any videos they want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, conspiracy theorists aren’t a protected class.

       I strongly encourage homophobic bakery owners to openly discriminate against LGBT people so the rest of us can decide to bring our business elsewhere. I also strongly encourage anyone who thinks that Google should allow organizations like Infowars to continuously break their guidelines with impunity to have some courage in your convictions and stop using Google products and platforms.

       It's as MLK said, judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. In this case, sexual orientation is akin to race, as it's something that has nothing to do with character and the person has no real choice about.

       The difference is protected classes. If they were banning channels because of race, sex, age, disability, etc. then it is different. If you want to argue sexual orientation isn’t a protected class, fine, but that’s the difference.

       The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) forbids age discrimination against people who are age 40 or older. It does not protect workers under the age of 40, although some states have laws that protect younger workers from age discrimination.

       The drinking age in America is 21. That is a law. The law also states you can purchase a gun at age 18. But Dicks Sporting Goods is not following the law and has raised the age to people allowed to buy guns in their store.

       The only difference may be that alcohol is not a right protected under the constitution.  Bearing arms is a right, and with no age law on rifles/shotguns for 21 on the books, Dicks may be denying people their right.  There may be a legal piston here.  Just red to research.

       In the 2008 Supreme Court case Heller vs D.C. the court ruled that citizens had the right to bear arms and that handgun prohibitions were unconstitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, stated that while they believe the constitution to provide that right, they also believe that reasonable exceptions can and should be made. Essentially the ruling is anti
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       pro gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be no standing for a case in that you’d have to provide evidence that no other recourse would be available to a consumer. And with as many different guns that are on the market that’s clearly not the case. Handguns, shotguns, muskets, compound bows, rifles, etc., are readily available elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless, the court ruled that exceptions can be made if deemed reasonable. What a company deems in it’s best interest you would then have to successfully argue it to be unreasonable. And what is or isn’t
       <em>
        reasonable
       </em>
       is dependent on whatever governing body we’re referring to whether it be a state House of Representatives or the boardroom of Dick’s. And it’s extremely difficult to argue that.

       Yes, they're banned by the

       . The government didn't freeze Infowars' youtube channel. Youtube can't stop people from posting just because they're gay, straight, black, a woman, etc. But they can stop you from posting if you break the rules you agreed to follow.

       They also shouldnt stop people from posting, using their 2 amendment. Also, many of the accounts that got banned hadnt even broken "youtube rules". They massed banned half of conservative posters, and restored basically all accounts a few days later. Why? Was it just a power display?

       Not really the height of the information age then, right? Honestly she makes me pause from time to time. Has there ever been a height of the information age? Pick a time when people weren't full of shit and trying to control others' reality.

       The only non-protected class these days is a white male. As a white woman I never used my gender to try to get ahead. Matter of fact, I've had a boss of mine make remarks like, after saying I got a TV for my birthday from my SO, "good way to watch pornography." Or coming to my work area where I sit (not addressing me in front of my desk, but coming over to the side) and sticking his dick in my shoulder. Or even earlier, I had a co-worker who was harassing another worker (even playing "Be with You" by Firehouse all the time at his desk) and he grabbed my tits (BOTH) from behind after a meeting. The litigious society we live in now is causing so many problems, and there should be NO protected classes!! Government should not be in the business of legislating morality. We used to have shame and shunning but now with this EVERYONE is special generation, we've lost the natural methodology of how society as a whole addresses the aberrant and abhorrent. Now we MUST accept EVERYONE as long as they are in lock-step with "progress!"

       Race and gender cover both white and male. I’m sorry you were harassed. That is shitty. And you don’t have to accept everyone, you can still call assholes asshole, and you don’t have to hire them or bake them a cake, you just can’t do it just because they are gay, or white, or a woman, or old, or a military vet, etc. they have to actually be an asshole. Shame away, nothing’s stopping you. (I also agree our society is too litigious, but basic legal protections don’t fit that bill for me, suing a toy maker because your idiot child swallowed something is more where I draw the line).

       This is the narrative, but we all know of that it's much less aggressive and serious, socially speaking, to deny a cake for a wedding than to censorship ideas in the biggest communication mean in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument for "property right" is much more absurd in the censorship cases than in the bakery one.

       I don't see people suffeeing because a bakery didn't want to make them a cake. They can be upset at the time, but suffering is a little different than being temporarily upset. I think these minority policies are predicated heavily on the lack of proportion sense in people today.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me it's fair to downplay it, specially when we are talking about a person not wanting to participate in something he doesn't believe by its.relogoon, it's a moral option and I really see it as an individual choice. What is conscious freedom if you can't even refuse to make a cake based in it?

       Are you dense?Protected classes don't exist because of cake.They exist because they otherwise would be unfairly treated.Hiring policies,renting or buying a house etc.

       In what sense should they be protected? You say I'm not dense but you come here with concept like "minorities", "being protected" without even realizing that there's a huge amount of aspects to be discussed in what kind of protection, to what degree, what classes, and a lot of stuff. You simplify the discussion and put it under an ideological narrow prospective, while the reality is far more complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't see the bake case as fair. I think this is not a legit "protection" and we should talk about it. I think the protection stuff is somewhat creating a lot of tension today that didn't exist in the past, the consequences are worse than in the past. I think that these policies serves as tools to power growth.. So the discussion is not like "minorities should be protected". This phrase is empty.

Is it always possible to prove if a person acted based in discrimination? If the person shows a good reason for a discrimination, based on his religion or worldview, can we accept it or not?

No person should be treated unfairly because of race,religion or sexuality.
In practice that means no one should deny you a job because you are,for example,black,gay or a mormon.

       I don't even live in us. And quoting the declaration is still useless, since you have infinite different ways to interpret that.

       In what sense all men are equal? What is de degree of equality the declaration is talking about? What would constitute, in specific terms, the right to the pursuit of happiness? So a baker that wants to follow his consciousness in order to preserve his faith shouldnt be protected, while minorities should be protected of "being upset" because the baker didn't want to make their will?  Is this reasonable? Is this fair? What's protection? Who should be protected from what? What's happiness and what constitutes a true barrier for the pursuit of it? The questions remain my friend.

       The two lesbians were tricked by a politician to drag the baker's name through the mud because the politician was going to use it to secure more votes by appearing compassionate to the homosexuals. The main takeaway is that politicians are slimy pieces of shit.

       It can still be hypocritical, but recognizing that there is a difference, even if only one of nuance, should be what this sub is about. If OP had included that nuance in their post, my comment probably wouldn’t be upvoted, but OP’s post didn’t clarify on the legality, so I added the nuance, added to the discussion, and people felt it was relevant. It’s a pretty benign comment to attract bots, liberals maybe, but not bots.

       Obviously the Civil Rights Act doesn't apply to social media platforms discriminating against users based on political beliefs. However, there is a legitimate legal gray area emerging regarding the right to free speech in the context of social media. A strong argument can be made that social media companies may be infringing individual rights by discriminating based on personal and political beliefs. In many ways this is analogous to the discrimination which was allowed to occur based on race and sex, leading to the civil rights movement. Just to be clear, I am not attempting to conflate these two issues, but rather point out that there is a legitimate emerging concern about civil rights. I understand that social media suppression is a relative triviality compared to the horrors which lead to the civil rights movement and eventually the Civil Rights Act. However, we now live in a world where the primary speech platforms are owned by corporations, and this raises new concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Disclaimer: I wrote most of the following a few minutes ago in a conversation in a different post, but I think that it is even more relevant here. Please pardon some copy-paste with edits.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget Youtube and Infowars for a moment. The larger problem we are facing is the question of whether social media services should be allowed to discriminate based on social and political views. You can make the argument that they are a private company, so they should be free to make that choice. You can also make the argument that banning certain views is not restricting speech because there are plenty of other social media platforms which we are free to choose. The problem with that argument is that there is no legal protection against the possibility that all or most social media services would make the same or similar choices about which views they want to allow. Because of the corporate structure of ownership of social media platforms by traditional media platforms, there is a strong possibility for coordination to suppress certain ideas. This opens up a huge number of legal questions. For example:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If holding a certain view (political or otherwise) excludes an individual or group from the majority of social media services, then it could be argued that those people have had their right to free speech substantially limited. Social media has changed the notion of public discourse on a fundamental level, and those with "acceptable" views would have more access to the primary speech platforms that exist today. Imagine if big companies somehow bought up all the town squares 200 years ago and were allowed to pick and choose who could or couldn't stand out there and express themselves. Nobody is required to listen to them, but because there is an existing standard, primary platform for speech, there is a strong argument in the US legal system that everyone should have essentially equal access.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now suppose that we reject the argument above and accept the premise that free speech is not limited, because "unacceptable" views can always find a voice on a different platform. Banning certain speech from one platform and telling them to join another is somewhat similar to the "separate but equal" segregation laws, which were one part of the fuel for the civil rights movement. One of many problems with this doctrine is that the separate accommodations are almost never equal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Due to the large share of the social media market controlled by Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Reddit, there is a legitimate national security concern about allowing these platforms to operate and discriminate based on their own political and social agendas. They have more than enough influence to create their own false reality using propaganda in order to manipulate voters, and by extension, influence the government even more than they already do through political contributions and lobbying. There is no explicit legal protection against the possibility that their agendas amount to foreign or domestic subversion of the American system.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Eventually, we will need something like a "Free Speech Act" which establishes conditions for when a social media platform is or is not allowed to restrict speech. Obviously they should be allowed to set rules and standards as long as those standards are enforced uniformly without regard to the beliefs of an individual. For example, it should be fine for a social media platform to ban specific behaviors such as making personal attacks against other users or using extreme profanity, as long as they enforce this uniformly. This is similar to a dinner club requiring ties or dress clothes. In that setting, discrimination occurs when a person of one race is served while a person of another race is not, even if they are both wearing exactly the same clothing and following the dress code. Likewise, free speech discrimination would occur if a social media company used their rule against profanity as a selective excuse to ban people with certain beliefs. Furthermore, rules should not be designed to explicitly target or restrict expression of certain beliefs. Of course, there is a more subtle conversation to be had about the distinction between the social media platform itself and the individual sub-communities and user pages created therein. It is perfectly reasonable to allow greater liberty for individuals to curate and discriminate in those contexts, because the creation of the sub-community and the curation itself can be regarded as an act of public expression. However, this last comment raises all kinds of additional questions about the problem of very large sub-communities with a great deal of influence. How much autonomy should they have within the larger social media platform? These questions open their own chapter of discussion, but at least it's clear to me that top-level social media companies like Reddit, Twitter, or Facebook should not be allowed to manipulate or suppress content or sanction users based entirely on beliefs and opinions that conflict with the political or social agenda coming from the corporate ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that social media platforms operate like public accommodations for free speech, and so it is reasonable to expect that anyone who follows the rules should be allowed to use the service. Making this an explicit legal protection would mostly fix the problem of needing to appease advertisers to prevent them from leaving your platform due to the beliefs of your users. Right now, advertisers can make the argument that allowing certain ideas on the platform is akin to an endorsement of those ideas, because they could simply ban those views from their platform. With a Federal law in place, this argument would fall flat. Likewise, sometimes businesses used to exclude people of certain races not because the business owners were racist, but rather because their investors and suppliers were. The Civil Rights Act took the choice away from the business owner, and so the investors, suppliers, and other big money movers no longer had influence over discriminatory practices.

       I appreciate the well thought out reply. I can see your side of it, but I’m also concerned that that leads to anyone that gets banned saying it’s because they’re conservative or liberal. I see it enough now, and to it add it to a protected class seems like an easy cop out for people that don’t want to be held according notable for their speech.

       I understand your point. An employer can still choose not to hire someone based on race or sex, but they have to make some excuse to get away with it. Social media platforms could do a lot of manipulative shit under the guise of other excuses too. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't make it harder for them. It's wrong what they are doing and bad for society, so at least make them break the law while they are at it. If a pattern emerges, investigations could expose their manipulative behavior as a criminal conspiracy. That sounds like a better alternative than the current situation where they can act with impunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as people complaining about discrimination, that much is already happening all the time. I'm just saying make the language more precise and make this a well-defined issue rather than some vague problem. People are going to bitch about it either way.

       I guess when it comes down to it I have two main issues.

      <p>
       I don’t think conservative or liberal deserve to be a protected class, especially since they are very vaguely defined and change over time.

       I do think a platform should have the right to choose what message it broadcasts, especially since we live in a society that is unfortunately very litigious.

       I'm not saying beliefs should constitute a protected class in the sense of the Civil Rights Act. The entire premise of my post was to say that social media has changed the nature of social interaction so much that there is a legitimate legal argument to extend first amendment protections to those networks.

       What I'm suggesting is that social media companies need to make a choice between being content curators or a platform through which users curate content. They could even be both in two separate ways. But the point is if you claim to give a platform for speech to users, then you are not broadcasting any message at all. The users are broadcasting the message. This is an important distinction. In fact, what I am advocating would
       <em>
        protect
       </em>
       social media companies from lawsuits. I think they should be liable for what is said over their networks
       <em>
        only if
       </em>
       and only to the extent that they choose to manage and curate the organic efforts of their users. Of course, they need to deal with explicitly illegal content, such as certain kinds of pornography or open threats of violence. But other than these obvious issues, they should have to make a public choice regarding what kind of role they play in content curation. If the vast majority of their revenue comes from activity associated with user-generated content, then they have made that choice already.

       As said already, you can't discriminate because of someone's inherent qualities (sexuality, race, sex, ect).  YouTube has never done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they "discriminate", we all do.  But unlike the baker, they clearly are showing who they discriminate against and all of their terms are within the law.  To defend InfoWars on this agruement is the same as saying that their terms of services can't disallow anything... which is just dumb.

       The only problem with that argument, and I say this as someone who leans toward a more libertarian philosophy, is that companies like YouTube almost operate as if it were a public utility. Can you imagine AT&amp;T disconnecting your line because you said something hateful to your ex over the phone?

       This is the

       OK with this, but I'm not going to commit to it because I don't know enough about satellite phone coverage, availability, affordability, nor a slew of other items that are vital to the discussion.

       I agree that there are some hypocrites on here.  I try not to be one.  But honestly there is a big difference in my eyes between the right to deny a pie or a platform for speaking out and the right to deny a necessary service.  In that light (with exception of the illegality of discrimination for the sake of sexuality) the baker should have more right to turn someone away than AT&amp;T or Comcast.

       Yup.  That's why I was always against the smoking ban in bars/restaurants.  I hate, hate, hate cigarette smoke but it should be up to the business to decide if they want patronize smokers or not.  If you're concerned for your health with second hand smoke, patronize another business that doesn't have it.  It should have been left to the business owners in my humble opinion.

       That's a poor comparison to make. Second-hand smoke is well known to be detrimental to everyone's health. Saying that it should be up to a business to let people smoke indoors is like saying it should be up to a business to give alcohol to minors.

       That's specifically known as "fraud". Although censorship is a method of committing it, that's nigh-impossible to accomplish without bribing investigators, which in this case would be the IRB and FDA. And pushing quiet settlements to any and all victims and private investigators, but that's not actually illegal.

       "Physical well-being" and "psychological well-being" have been shown to be deeply interconnected. "Health", by its very meaning, means both.

       No, it's not.  The business should be able to chose who it wants to patronize.  If you don't like the smoke, go patronize a business that doesn't allow smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minors can't be served alcohol because it's illegal so that's not up to the business.  Smoking in businesses wasn't banned until fairly recently.  So your comoarison is a poor one.

       I'm all for private enterprises having as little government influence as possible, but we kind of need protected classes. "Separate but equal" is no good.

       If everyone is divided between protected and unprotected classes than they are separate but NOT equal because only one side gets extra protections. The gov just needs to get out of our hair and let the free market handle it.

       Ok when you put it that way I see where the law is coming from, and would agree with it. But is there a point when it becomes unnecessary? I can't even imagine that that sort of thing would happen nowadays, i mean no one would ever go there and the biz would bankrupt themselves because people now arent going to support that sort of evil. I guess i truly am naive about these things.

       No one's getting extra protections. If the American government lets the "free" market discriminate a category of people, they're failing to enforce liberties they claim to provide to all.

       Youtube has a 1st amendment right to pick and choose its standards of communication.  The government cannot force a company to either communicate or facilitate communication of any form.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only opposition to that is the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, and its been repeatedly found to be limited to protected classes -otherwise it could be used to destroy the 1st amendment.

       Not only is it more expensive, but it is more addictive and carries more legal penalties. And if you think black communities were not targeted and flooded with crack cocaine by the US government for racist and other nefarious reasons, then you've never heard of Gary Webb.

       Depends on the level if public support they receive. Let's say someone builds their own house and they say "I don't want YOU'RE people on my property"...It's their property and we have to respect that. Now, if a company, which benefits on the public's tax dollars says the same; there may be some argument against it. But now we have to decide where the l one between private ownership and public business resides. Further, decide if it's better to allow full free-speech for private companies to says shit like "Whites-Only", because in our modern market, that's a business death-sentence. But it wouldn't have been back in the 1950's. So many variables to consider.

       Whatever the case may be, it still astounds me with how much veracity and force people will protect the rights of corporations such as Google and their baby YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       These corporations might not have to allow everything on their platforms, but corporations like that, ranging from Google, to Facebook, to Bayer, Monsanto. ...and so many more... are everpresent in our lives and our society. They should be called out and rightfully so when using methods that creep us ever so deeper into an Orwellian dystopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think it's OK. That's fine. But I wonder how you would react if a controversial topic YOU supported would suddenly start being censored on major media platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube might not have what is officially called a monopoly, but it's range of influence is vast. And that range has been created through years of lack of censorship and the gaining of people's trust. Now, when the time is right, they might just start pulling the plug on any freedom of expression on their platform and start banning those that are deemed to controversial for then to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fine, YouTube can do what it wants. But the outcry should still be there! The awareness of what is happening on YouTube should be spread far and wide, so that the people that were once supporters of YouTube start to abandon that platform. Over time, if this is a success,  YouTube will start getting legitimate rivals and the port to other platforms will be complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean you can't still support the content creators you love on YouTube, but it does mean that considering, visiting and supporting (with your presence if nothing else) another platform is something we should all be striving for and thinking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nothing else, the awareness of what YouTube is doing should be spread far and wide. People should know about it in order to make an informed decision on whether YouTube should retain the popularity it still has, or whether we should all be considering alternative solutions and platforms.

       Cool. Thanks for the totally out of place attach on Obama. I said nothing about him. Just pointing out the absolute irony of Right wingers going on about how business should be forced to host people's content.

       But I guess if that makes you upset and want to deflect about to Obama, then go ahead. I'm not going to comment on that however.

       I doubt your forum is popular or large enough to be considered a public forum. The thing about entities like Facebook or Youtube is hundreds of millions if not billions of people use them. It's a much different scenario when you're talking about a small private forum or subreddit to a massive social media platform that is considered one of the best ways to reach a large audience. These platforms are not just censoring the content of Alt-right people or conspiracy theorists, but people who are simply considered conservative as well.

       What makes it public? What's the number of posters? It took Russia 6 months to farm 50000 accounts across Facebook etc. I mean shit, bots have been a plague on the internet for years. If I flood a website with a million users could I effectively own that website? Is this really what you want? Forced speech?

       You are missing the legal point of a protected class. I can refuse to serve you because I think you're an was. I can refuse to serve you based on age, gender, race, or sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, this is more difficult than a single baker. Prre-segregstion we had the issue of an entire society excluding a race. That issue isn't present any longer with homosexuality. But it did exist. However, it's not as easily identified by skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, you are not in a protected class. And because I find you largely vile in your use of words, I wouldn't want you around. But, I would take your money. Then invite all the good people to a party after work.

       It's not freedom of association. It's if your selling goods and participating in interstate commerce, then you're not allowed to discriminate against people based on race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being treated equally isn't being treated favorably.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry to tell you, but you don't know what the words you're saying mean in a legal context. Baker can not invite gay people to his house. He can't prohibit gay people from his stores that participate in interstate commerce.

       Jim Crow laws tried it. This has been resolved for decades. And if you don't like it, then you don't like America and you should move to Russia. Or, I should say, stay there.

       Jim Crow wasn't freedom of association, btw.  Democrats literally passed laws that FORBADE citizens to offer services to blacks.  So... same ol' tricks, different angle of attack.  We don't know why Democrats switched from forcing people to not serve to forcing people to serve, but it's immaterial, since the core issue is freedom of association.

       You're missing a key concept. It's not freedom of association when you are offering services for sale to the public generally. At that point, you are participating in interstate commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the part you are refusing to listen to, that's the part of America you don't like even as that's been the law for decades, and that's the reason you should go to a country that does allow discrimination against such minorities. Russia would love to have a comrade like yourswlf.

       The baker can open a private club. And exclude whomever he wants. He can't operate openly to the public, and then exclude members of the public based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Augusta National is the perfect example of how when you're a private club, then you can associate as you please.

       I'm also confused as to why you think I have any issues living up to my own standards. I have no issue complying with this standard: to the extent I offer goods or services for sale to the public generally, I will not discriminate based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will actually go above that as I will not discriminate against those classes in my private life as well.

       You only are (not really) willing to live up to your standards because you agree with the direction.  I.E. they're not really standards for you, they're self interest.

       It's not freedom of association.  You're being intentionally dense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom of Association is what you get to do in your free time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements of non-discrimination apply to those operating in interstate commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding a lemonade stand, you're raising a good point of whether government resources should be spent on ensuring a neighborhood child doesn't discriminate and on whether a lemonade stand is interstate commerce.  As interesting as those false equivalencies may be, that's not the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you don't mind, please research what is freedom of association.  The reason I keep bringing up legal issues is because those words have specific legal definitions.  You should learn their meaning before you attempt to make an argument based on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to South Africa, that's a different country with different laws.  If it were the U.S.A., that would be unconstitutional.  Which is why America is fantastic.  And which is why I implore you to stop attacking America and the Constitution in the name of discrimination.

       Good comment. I think in these discussions there tends to be a lack of nuance, where people either decide YT is perfectly within their rights and should not be criticized, or that YT is wrong and therefore we should have government intervention. The way I see it, there are a number of facts and a number of normative/ethical positions that make sense, and we need to be able to view these positions simultaneously.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        YT is likely acting within the law in censoring who they are (i.e. not violating the 1A or public accommodation laws)
       </li>
       <li>
        YT
        <em>
         is
        </em>
        censoring content based on political viewpoints, and does go against the concept of free speech, which is broader than the 1A
       </li>
       <li>
        We
        <em>
         should
        </em>
        be speaking out against YT censorship, either to compel them to change their policy or to get people to support a better service,
        <em>
         even if
        </em>
        content that we support is not currently being censored. The "left," very broadly speaking, is missing this point IMO because it's their political opponents currently being censored.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I would still maintain that we should be seeking and promoting alternative platforms and protocols, not just ones that are currently not censoring, or committed to not censoring, but that have anti-censorship as a core component of their platform. To me, this means distributed and decentralized platforms, as any service with a centralized model has a single point of failure that allows owners and their agents to censor the entire platform. That means choosing services like BitChute or DTube over services like vimeo.

       I get you point, but it's apples and oranges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wedding cakes aren't a critical service during an emergency and you can get one at any grocery store. I don't think there are a lot of cake baker's getting big government subsidies and cakes don't enable people to communicate en masse on a global scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube, Facebook, Amazon and Google are all government supported monopolies providing platforms for mass communication that no other company can provide because of the fact they are all government sponsored monopolies. In case of an emergency or some other tumultuous event, they provide critical communication services that cannot be found anywhere else. Their status as "private companies" is a sham perpetrated to allow themselves and the government to circumvent all kinds of restrictions and regulations that would otherwise be placed on the platforms and associated technologies were they properly classified as government sponsored monopolies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: Nah man, just kidding, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Just threw that shit out there off the cuff. Sounded kinda clever in my head I guess, but now I'm reading it and realizing I probably just smoked too much reefer madness. Peace out.

       I certainly hope not. It's a pretty terrifying idea that a group of Nazis or whatever could lay claim to a big website by flooding it and driving people away with the Company not being able to do anything about it.

       Then what defines offering to the "public" then? Your judgement again? Simply having a Public WAN IP could be interpreted as "offering to the public" under your vague definition.

       Buh...buh...buh...buh, what if the courts disagree with pieohmy25 "muh feelings" and they get offended? Will pieohmy25 be able to sue the court system because they hurt his "muh feelings" because he can't block peoples free speech that offends him/her/it/bot?

       Well then, you seem to be ignorant of the phenomenon then. Private places have been determined to be public forums by the members of the judiciary in the past. Youtube can remove Nazi signs that is unless a court tells them they are a public forum and that Nazis are allowed to congregate there. Youtube is fucking itself by not just removing the truly extreme content, by mixing in conservatives and Alex Jones types they are just opening the door to a ruling that will lose them power over their platform.

       While I believe private companies retain the right to restrict who they do business with, as long as it does not violate any laws protected classes, I feel that once a government has provided some financial backing or is benefiting from the information in any way (ahem, I'm talking about the government's alphabet orgs), then the space SHOULD be treated like a government managed public space.

       Source 1 is vague as fuck. Source 2 does not contain references to Google, Alphabet, or YouTube at all. Source 3 rather unimpressively makes the case that Google benefits from internet infrastructure and links to a nonexistent webpage. Which I suppose is true in the same way that they also benefit from public roads and the FDA. But it's not a subsidy in the traditional sense of the word, only in a metaphorical sense of the word. The government isn't cutting Google a check each month to keep their business going like we do with a lot agricultural industries.

       Here's my stance on the baker situation.  We'll focus strictly on the Oregon one, as 'a certain baker' could imply any number of them in several states:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Oregon baker received their license post-an update to discrimination laws that stated that businesses could not discriminate based on sexual preference.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the law in place when they got their license.  At that time, they could have chosen to locate to another state.  They chose to stay in Oregon, and therefore were aware--or supposed to be aware--of the law.  If they weren't aware, that's no fault of anyone but them.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if it was a case of them either not having that law, or the law updating after they became licensed, they might've actually won.

       The baker broke state law by discriminating against a protected class, sexual orientation, which is not federally protected by the Civil Rights Act but is protected in some states.
      </p>

       What group would you suggest YouTube is targeting? As discrimination requires a group be targeted. Now I think you may be referring to a site's terms of use which do allow users to be banned and are kinda like how a bakery could kick out two men because one was sucking the other's cock. Not because they are homosexuals but because their actions break the bakery's terms of use.

       Big, big difference between a company discriminating against someone who is a member of a protected class because they are a member of a protected class and a company discriminating against someone because of their political views or the things they say.

       Your meters out of wack. The difference here is akin to a customer/viewer and content/baked goods provider. The store and customer dont have an arrangement, the store and provider of goods do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue here is you agree to terms to use their platform, abuse terms, get banned. Still are free to bake cakes online to your hearts content.

       First you would need to convince us baking a cake for money is equivalent with the bakery allowing you to set up your own table on their property for free, to sell anything you choose; dog carcasses, meth, dead fish, t-shirts advertising the bakery down the street, etc. The only thing they get n return, is the ability to stick their own label on the merchandise.

       The point is even with internet “slow lanes” old style boards would be extremely fast because of lack of excessive media and flash and advertisements...  hell even with images and videos advertisements and trackers add up to 20% of the bandwidth usage.

       I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this, but to those reading these posts that are interested in a compelling perspective of Google and, therefore YouTube, please check out Google is Not What it Seems by Julian Assange. Fast and interesting read. And in that spirit I will say that these massive communication entities that so many call "private companies" are often within arm's reach of the government - and perhaps much closer.

       your meter is a little out of whack. They refused service on the grounds of discrimination, something the customers can't control: being gay. Alex Jones isn't being taken off Youtube because of something he can't control. Youtube didn't deny service. they allowed Alex Jone's post videos. They gave him two strikes. He didn't correct the behavior. I'm not saying the cake situation was handled well or that the baker's didn't have the right to deny service. I'm pointing out that the two scenarios are inherently different.

       If you owned the servers and paid the engineers and lawyers you might see it differently. I wouldn’t want to host half the crap people put (and try to put) up. That said, the movement of the Internet becoming a corporate Intranet blows. Not sure the answer.

       I hate the idea that people are hypocrites because different groups get mad. If someone can be referenced as having two conflicting opinions that's a hypocrite, but one group getting upset and then the opposite group getting upset for the contradicting reason that's just how those groups work.

       Wow... are you stupid or what? You just took the hypocrisy meter and broke it. People are doing exactly what people did under that circumstance. The difference is more people cared about the cake issue. No-one is stopping you from complaining about YouTube blocking King Idiot but I have a feeling you aren't going to have as many people for as against.

       The federal government already control these sites bro. If you think Facebook or Google are somewhat private beyond the narrow sense of the law aspect, you are naive. What I'm trying to discuss is whether we could, to some degree, utilize the state machine in our favor at least in some cases. Because if you think that letting Google do whatever it wants is, somehow, taking the government out of the equation, you are completely off the discussion, sorry.

       There is no justification for allowing websites such as youtube, twitter, reddit, facebook and any other large social media platform used by millions to censor, hide and manipulate opinion for the benefit of their preferred political parties/candidates/paying corporations(astroturfing)/personal agenda.
      </p>

       absolutely none.

       you have to understand, these websites can and DO shape the political beliefs and opinions of MILLIONS, the lies these admins and moderators push, and the information they delete so we cannot see it are vital to understanding out political reality.

       So when these companies manipulate opinion: THEY MANIPULATE ELECTIONS.

       Not so much YouTube but I can clearly remember, that just a few years ago, Facebook and Twitter were being held up (by media and general population) for their platforms being used in countries where tyranny and war were ongoing. They were bastions of free speech and both sides could be heard. Citizens were able to communicate their desires for unity and peace. Now, here at home, they are silencing voices in what some consider to be a somewhat real information war. A virtual war on freedom. I realize this is one opinion (of mine) but appearances carry a lot of weight and often times, consequences.

       All people defending the rights of a big company as YouTube in way of:  "it's MY house, MY rules", try to see it this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       You defending YouTube is like saying; You have all rights to Your personal houserules if You host a party in Your house and on Your property.
      </p>
      <p>
       If You invite all people from one small city into Your house for a party, pretend to be a perfect host, give them free drinks and food for the evening and let them be on their own afterwards as normal. Then you Your "full rights and rules" in Your own house, all people are actually guests here in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now You are very rich and you loved the party and the responses You got and You decide to host another party. Well oke, the same rules and rights apply once again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now You go big and host a party every other weekend. Most people will be enthousiast becouse of the free drinks, food, easy company. An easy escape from reality is within reach for everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well ask Yourself, who would be the people "crying wolf" in the background? Could it be the owners of the 2 local bars?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oke, they complain and You see no problem becouse "money rules all" and You have a lot. So, instead of letting Yourself get less attention You buy out the bars and the owners come work for You as extra "hosts" during the 2 weekends when one of the bars is now closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great, problem solved, nobody seems unhappy and You have still got all rights on your side... But maybe not all people are happy and they have no voice left becouse all other people are shouting louder... Could the persons who used to work in the bars be out of a job now becouse one bar is closed more often?
      </p>
      <p>
       No problem, if they like they are welcome in Your house and do some little tasks while staying there. Actually, You were thinking of breaking down one bar completely to make room for some new gasts at the parties. In fact, You start to give parties every weekend, the whole weekend long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the whole town is happy, free food and drinks for all and when someone is complaining they just need to join You. And if they don't, well, there is the door of Your house, it is a free world after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is getting expensive now, somehow there seem to be a lot of people from outside the city and while they don't play according to Your houserules, they keep within the limits of the law. Oke, no problem, You switch from beer from the local brewery to a cheap brand and start to buy food and other supplies from other suppliers a town over for much cheaper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, problem solved, oh shit... Now the brewery and local shops are getting way less income and they all start to go bankrupt slowly. Oke, You decide to buy them out, but according to Your rules You only comensate those people living in Your city. Slowly but surely many people start to complain more and more, but the majorety of residents still don't see or have any problem with You and Your parties. And hey, it is Your house, they are able to leave, You have Your rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more of the residents become dependent of You and the ones that don't want that for whatever reason are moving to the next town becouse they can find a job there again without You involved somehow. Sure they get less payed or need to work much harder, but at least they still have their freedom. Right..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your party evolves further and futher, slowly Your old small city becomes a capital and there are now so many people you are forced to buy all your supplies over the internet directly from foreighn suppliers. Slowly but surely You are now changing the whole country and even the whole world with Your "privet" party...
      </p>
      <p>
       And one day you are wondering arround "your" party and start to wonder who all the people are who surround you and seem completely strangers to you and you decide You need to make a raddical decission becouse many guest became a threat to Your houserules and "stuff" so You decide to adjust Your houserules to get rid of some, in Your opinion, unwanted guests.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the point we are at right now, sure You have the right to change Your rules at Your party, but is is still just Your party if so many people became depended of You in one way or the other? Shoud it by now not be the Law of the country that needs to followed instead of only Your personal houserules?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine now why some people might be somewhat upset over the desicions You made, even when You made them always completly within all existant rights and laws..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere along the line YouTube went from being a privet party to being an public event. And while many people still see the party a single, local event and defend the rights of the host and their houserules, many people also forget or don't recognise the impact YouTube made on all their lives. This until it is sudenly gone, just as is happening right now and while the houserule changes may not seem to have any impact on you directly at this moment, you can see they actually impact Humanity and it's future as a whole if you are able and willing to look deeper.

       Um, people are protected by federal and state laws from being discriminated against based on race, religion, gender, nation of origin. I'm sorry, but believing 9/11 was an inside job does not guarantee you the same protections. Sadly, most people I've met here are white men. You won't ever know what it feels like to actually have to reference the aforementioned protections just to be treated like a human.

       Good point. You could start every youtube post by stating you are gay and you will not be discriminated against and then you could go on to say whatever and then if they ban you there's your lawsuit.

       The thing that really gets me is that the request to bake the cake came across as politically motivated, if this is about the gay couples who got refused to have their cake baked by a bakery that had Christian values.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure that the couples in question who do this tripped over a bunch of other bakeries before they decided to go to the Christian one you know? It just seemed like they wanted to make drama by choosing that particular bakery and because of that I have no sympathy for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the whole thing is ridiculous because it's just about a cake blah blah blah, but business owners have a right to run their business how they see fit. If they want to run it with archaic strict religious views they are entitled to do that because you don't have to give them your business. You can choose a more liberally-minded business instead. This isn't the 18th Century, it's not like they didn't have the choice to go elsewhere, you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       So it actually angers me that there was this drama about this. I'm anger at all the parties involved. But more angry at the couple for starting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for YouTube... Well I don't know about that. I really don't like how the whole Logan Paul thing was handled. That really painted YT in a negative light for me.

       Youtube has the right to do it and I don't see any lawsuits happening, but what it does is confirm the idea in many people's minds that there is an organized agenda to push a certain social narrative while censoring and/or eliminating any counter narratives. The baker situation showed that people are bigoted and that they believe they have the right to discriminate.

       This argument is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cake was not made based on some kind of business philosophy or practice. Like the reasons YouTube cites for banning or not banning a video. That cake wasn't made because of religious beliefs. If YouTube banned a video because it "disagreed with there religion" then you bet your ass everyone and the best friend would go after YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a major difference between someone not serving another person because there shaky religious ideals are offended and someone who simply has a policy. Like what do you think would have happened if the CEO of Wal-Mart said they where no longer selling guns to children under 21 because it wasn't Christian, not because of school violence. It become this entire different thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a discrimination thing. You policy can not discriminate against and certain group of people. For example you can say "no one with backpacks allowed in the store" but you can't say "no black people with backpacks allowed in the store". That is kinda the whole reason why the came story hit the national news circuit.

       Ok but according to experts, conspiracy theorists are mentally disabled. So YouTube is discriminating against mentally disabled video-makers. Now as to whether the video(s) violate policy, that would depend on the content of each video of course.

       I thought that one of the main issues with the baker was doxxing. The couple left a bad review/sent an email after the baker refused to make the cake. Baker blasted the couple’s personal info everywhere and their home was vandalized and they received death threats.

       They will just say one "company" is has more "right" to do as they please over another.  Was this baker a small time mom and pop operation?  Youtube being what is perceived as something indispensable and all important?  Especially when attached to google, the all knowing and trustworthy business back by the Gov?

       In all realities the baker got screwed. I don't agree with his view, but we have the right to refuse service. The man got ib trouble because he talked too much. If he had just refused and then let it be nothing would have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he should have been allowed to do it. There are signs in all kinds of buildings proclaiming their right to refuse service. The man honestly got screwed for political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think this applies to youtube however, but that is because I think we need a new designation of inter et sight protected by freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like reddit Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, should not be allowed to censor things because they are a means of expressing your views,we need to ensure that people have the means to have these discussions unfettered, and thus they should be protected by freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       The baker is a homophobe and we will defend his rights to be such, and then tell him he's wrong to express those rights in his own business. So this is actually almost reversed, the baker should have been allowed to do what he wanted, but youtube shouldn't.

       Why are you assuming that everyone was in favor of them being forced to bake the cake?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't. I don't believe that someone is obligated to make a specific product for someone for any reason. If they were denying a cake in general then yes, that's not okay. But if they're willing to make a normal cake minus something that violates their belief structure then that's their call.

       The amendments are rules the government can't brake. The baker can also deny people their 2nd amendment right by not allowing weapons into the business, which is legal.

       But what about freedom of association? YouTube has a right not to let their platform be used for what they don’t want.

       Right.. people can scrutinize all they want.  YouTube is under no obligation to allow anyone to post videos on their website though so people may have to scrutinize the shooting survivors on other websites aside from YouTube.

       And one liberal channel that I saw that was terminated was Atheism-is-Unstoppable.  He's a liberal/Hillary supporter and his account was banned in the same timeframe that this was all happening.  It looks like his account has since been restored but his account gets banned pretty frequently resulting in him having to challenge the bans to be reinstated  because, even though he's a liberal, he posts "controversial content" that ends up flagged all the time.

       Yes, but you forgot the core issue: If a baker doesn't have the right to freedom of association, then neither do you have it on your forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim Crow wasn't freedom of association, btw.  Democrats literally passed laws that FORBADE citizens to offer services to blacks.  So... same ol' tricks, different angle of attack.  We don't know why Democrats switched from forcing people to not serve to forcing people to serve, but it's immaterial, since the core issue is freedom of association.
