       So, this article (among others) came out today that showed leaked documents proving that Reddit has been manipulated by Russian troll farms.  In this article, the Daily Beast (I know but bare with me) obtained leaked documents showing that Reddit has been compromised.

       This article was posted multiple times on
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       , but it is hidden every time for multiple hours so it won't collect any upvotes or downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Reddit is trying to hide the fact that they are actually compromised, just like Twitter and Facebook have already been proven to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only place this has gotten any traction is
       <a href="/r/inthenews">

       ,

       which is a small subreddit that is not visited often.  They refuse to let this go to a bigger sub and that's why I brought it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to get this out and make Reddit respond to these claims.  They can't keep getting away with this.

This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans. The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".

       Would have been more effective to straight link, if you'd like to confirm your hypothesis. Otherwise it's speculation. Maybe valid, but speculation nonetheless. It can easily be proven or disproven by including the direct link.

       Eh idk, if the link stays on this sub then that might just be the admins also trying to show that it actually isn't happening...they are smart.  That's why they won't let /politics post it or /news but some of the "crazy" subs will be allowed.

       Since Reddit refuses to provide the usernames it’s all meaningless speculation . Much like Hamilton 68, they don’t disclose their methods or which accounts are tracked. My guess is it would result in real people saying wtf I’m not Russian.

       This whole story is designed to censor the web and smear people as russian puppets.  Let's look at who has been smeared so far, there seems to be a common theme: Bernie, Jill Stein, BLM, Oil Pipe Line Protests, Trump... It's funny, there all non establishment movements (although I think Trump isn't an outsider anymore).  Then if you look at what these trolls were pushing, it was US MSM news articles, so it wasn't even Russian propaganda as it's being sold.  Remember when they smeared Donna Brazil for falling for Russian Propaganda because she was worried Hillary wasn't very healthy?  It's amazing they even claim that, like Russia was going around tripping Hillary and making her faint.

       This whole thing is being fabricated to censor the web, just like I think the Florida shooting is being used to attack conspiracy theorists.

       Yes, of course, this is nothing new, go check r/undelete... But what does it matter if some Russian trolls posted on reddit?  That's the point I speaking to.  There is the smearing that is going on and this call to hold Facebook / Twitter and now reddit responsibile for some Trolls posting on their sites, and if you look at what it was, the vast majority is MSM news articles.  This manufactured outrage is a joke and is going to be used to censor the web... Which has already started.

       I could see a push happening for regulating social media to verify identity (cuz of the whole troll disinfo concern), not unlike a banks KYC regulations. If that were to happen, social media could be effectively killed.

       Why on earth haven't I once heard of a US 'troll farm'? Common sense would tell you they existed, if they existed in Russia. Are the Russian troll farms anything like CTR? Do we know yet exactly what narrative, or information they pushed, and how they did it? Where are all the US hackers, and why haven't I heard about them in like a decade?

       If it was as simple as the name implies, why aren't there stories about the noble US citizens, fighting back against Russian trolls on social media, during the election? Seems like we're only ever getting a small fraction of the objective truth, and wayyyy too many subjective opinions. Doesnt seem like our current players are ever going to give the whole truth, but surely someone can. If not, the weaponizing of information just going to grow over the next 50 years. How can we hold the actual truth accountable

       That's not even clear. There is evidence that the company Mueller indicted was actually run by western intelligence as a

       "The story of how the IRA came to be an infamous “Putin-controlled troll farm” in the narratives of Western intelligence is an old and long one. We can say, definitively, that it is rewarmed British gruel, a British lie as poisonous as Christopher Steele’s dirty dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the beginning of 2014, an anti-Russian group of hackers, initially called “The Anonymous International,” and later, “Shaltay-Boltay,” claimed that the building at Saint Petersburg, Savushkina 55, housed a troll farm run by the Kremlin.1 Since then, this building has been photographed and highlighted endlessly by MI6, all of the British press and tabloids, the CIA, the FBI, NATO, the BBC, the State Department’s propaganda departments and NGOs, CNN, and most of the rest of the mainstream American media. Infiltration operations have been run and publicized by the same people. Actions against the alleged IRA have been filed by infiltrators in the Russian courts. Any intelligent observer would ask the first obvious question: Why, if this building and the alleged company occupying it has been so repeatedly targeted by Western intelligence, would Putin be stupid enough to run an influence operation from that location targeting the 2016 elections? The answer should be obvious—he did not...
      </p>
      <p>
       According to “The Saker” blog’s Russian account of the IRA,3 the company itself does not exist. It is a fiction created by Shaltay-Boltay, the successor to “Anonymous International” in conjunction with western intelligence agencies. Shaltay-Boltay, Russian for “Humpty-Dumpty,” conducted a systematic campaign of hacking, leaking, and extortion against Russian officials, according to accounts of its own activities published in the Guardian. Members of Shaltay-Boltay were arrested in November 2016 together with rogue Russian FSB officers said to control their activities. All were charged with treason by the Russian government, specifically some form of collaboration with the U.S.A. The British account of this affair, produced in the Feb. 9, 2017 Guardian, claims that the treason charges were based on the hackers and rogue FSB officials having confessed their trolling crimes to the CIA. According to a November 2017, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty article, the FSB “cyber” division where the arrested officers worked, had been in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement agencies for years."

       Reddit is not a zero-sum game of winners and losers in competition for the last word. Even to the point of following people around who already told you that they were no longer interested in continuing a conversation that was going nowhere except in circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you need to have the last word, then by all means go ahead. In fact you can have both the win
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the last word. You have been trying so hard that I don't want to be the one who deprive you of glorious reddit victory.

       Can you provide some proof of any of this?  You've adamantly claimed that Facebook and Twitter have proven to be compromised and reddit.  First i've heard of this.  Are you claiming the IRA is the organization that secretly controls or at least influences these platforms or these platforms are complicit?

       I did, I have found no such claims that reddit, facebook, and twitter have been compromised.   I would agree with you that, these platforms are susceptible to astroturfing by various analytic companies.  But compromised, that is a stretch.  So whom exactly has compromised these platforms?

       The voting on this thread looks manipulated. Sensationalists going along with MSM/DNC talking points as if Russian trolls had a significant amount of influence on the election and acting like Facebook and Twitter are "compromised" based on a pretty much still unproven claim of Russian manipulation. We have groups with suspicious funding claiming to have proof but the evidence is not really available to the public. Even the activity which is claimed by these groups is pretty insignificant. How do we even know the activity was politically motivated rather than financially motivated? Wouldn't Occam's razor say click-bait is just designed for ad revenue? They were just jumping into popular political discussions on both sides, which would be a perfect way to siphon off ad revenue from the internet frenzy surrounding the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, you are sitting here pointing out quite correctly that his claim is overblown and not supported by even what the MSM is reporting. You are downvoted to -3 as of the time of my reply when the other guy is upvoted for an asinine comment "you never heard about this??" as if his personal sensational take on the situation was in fact a concrete verifiable event rather than a developing story that has so far not proven itself to have real legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I know for sure whats happening here or who's causing it, but in my opinion it looks fishy.

       The problem I have is that every time a narrative gets debunked they change it. The narrative has changed so many times I just find it too hard to believe now. The foundation is rotten, so why should I think that the house is any good now?

       If i had 1000 upvotes to give... this is exactly it.  this thing started when they decided to claim the russians "hacked" the DNC and leaked the emails.  since theres no proof of that theyre down to blaming a fucking troll farm!??   weak ass fucks are grasping at anything they can to keep up with the EVIL RUSSIANS story and its laughable.

       fucking please dude. go look up the word evidence. then find yourself a source that is less than a year old.   if any of this shit was evidence dont you think somebody would have used it by now?  remember, literally everyone (except you) has given up the "russians hacked the election" narrative. they have boiled it down to some fucking spam bots and claim thats why the nasty cunt lost to a walking cheeto.

       Money.  A compromised information platform that is distrusted might result in less advertising revenue.  They're just protecting their wallets.

       I was pretty addicted to a popular mobile game back when the election was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember there was a ridiculous amount of pro trump spam in the chat channels, to the point i knew some of it had to be schills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest pointer to me was the sheer number of random pro trump one liners, not people actually staying to argue, it just wasn't like normal chat drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of channels were having legit arguments between real folks, but then so many accounts with one liners acting like bots.

       You seem to insinuate there is a conspiracy on Reddit to censor information or news that is critical of Donald Trump and/or links Russians &amp; Trump to campaign manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you are taking that position, I have to ask; do you have your head buried in the sand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, what is wrong with you? It is so illogical to me for people, like yourself, to be so totally deluded and ignorant, I want to understand how it happens, why it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like you are arguing there is no such thing as the sun. This type of ignorance is truly baffling to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article you linked is terrible. I find it hard to believe this is being taken seriously, by anyone, as being verified enough to be called "news" and reported on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to ask......Why are you in a sub reddit title
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , about conspiracy, posting what the government and MSM is stating as fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you reporting US govmnt. "news" tat clearly bears the US three letter agency stamp of approval?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since when did the official narrative of the US GOVt. covert agencies and MSM become a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is rather ironic, and personally frustrating for me when I point out to someone that believes the GOVT.'s account of events on 9/11, that even the govt. narrative is a conspiracy, and they argue with me and call me an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet here you are posting govt. approved, MSM lies and propaganda that the same 9/11 believers I cite above would claim is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the Government so easily, and powerfully manipulates and controls people like you and the 9/11 believers I cited above is truly disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, have not been compromised by anything other than The Owners, "TPTB", "Deep State," or whatever name you have for the elite powerful people that decide our fate.

       You have fallen for it hook, line, and sinker......and you don't even realize it.

       you're spot on pal.  it doesn't make sense to me either to see flagrant, scaremongering, blown out of proportion, contrived, mass media narratives by and for the establishment agenda getting pedaled around here.  might as well be claiming "conspiracies" of muslims attacking the world trade center.

       it's probably a backwards ploy to make the conspiracy seem more credible to anti establishment people of which there are growing mass numbers.  my guess is they think they need to make the narratives they want to spread look suppressed in order for them to seem legit and not like blatant propaganda, which is what everything straight from MSM tends to look like.  just speculating here.

       How about:
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a site with a wide left wing userbase, right wing management, and a vested interest in maintaining their advertising income?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say 'reddit is' in anything but the most general and incorrect senses, it is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is left leaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       No. Reddit's userbase is left leaning, the management and administration is largely right wing. The investors are largely right wing. Right wing subs drive the most steep engagement for advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you said is wrong in anything but a kindergarten-level sense.
