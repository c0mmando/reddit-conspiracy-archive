    <div class="md"><p>Limiting what guns are obtainable is not &quot;taking all guns,&quot; nor is it outside the realm of the second amendment. The Circuit Courts of Appeals have variously held that assault weapon bans and other limitations on what guns can be purchased are co situational. That doesn&#39;t defy Heller.</p>

<p>My point is any action to limit what guns are obtainable immediately is labeled as &quot;an attack on the constitution&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re taking our guns we cannot let this happen.&quot; Except that is totally wrong. People can still own guns. But why should they be able to own certain guns that have proven to be more deadly than others because they make it easier to cause mass destruction? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was just that I’ve always heard from the left that they don’t want to ban guns, they just want better background checks, close the loopholes etc but this bill shows that they would like to ban a large percentage of guns.

    <div class="md"><p>Well a lot of mass shootings still occurred after the assault weapons ban with non banned weapons. Mass shootings are an epidemic at this point. Something has to be done.

    <div class="md"><p>Mass shootings are done with guns that make it easy to do mass shootings with, if you have noticed by now, no one is doing a mass shooting with 1 pistol.</p>

<p>The left wants to ban those types of guns that make it easy, but they have faced extraordinary lobbying from the NRA and other special interest groups. They have not &quot;banned&quot; the guns like you imply, They have tried certainly, but to say they have successfully carried out the gun bans and whatnot is misleading at best.</p>

<p>Sure, there should be a debate on how far a ban on guns like the AR-15 and other cheap repeating rifles, but to say that the debate on it is over and we should abandon it entirely is harmful to the discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said you have to ban more. But the way our republic is set up, you can&#39;t just go and edit laws. You have to create new laws to adjust what&#39;s on the books. If lawmakers think that the initial law didn&#39;t ban the right weapons, then yeah, then have to make new legislation to ban more, or remove some weapons from the previous ban. It&#39;s how the republican system works in our country. </p>

<p>But banning more guns is beside your point. It&#39;s a separate issue. Your constitutional argument has no merit whatsoever. Courts have consistently found that your argument is flat out wrong. </p>

<p>To the other point, clearly certain guns are continually used in mass shootings. These are not weapons used for hunting. Responsible gun owners use them for recreation. I don&#39;t currently own a gun, but I do plan to get one. But I&#39;ll have no need whatsoever to own the guns that are proposed to be banned. If a responsible owner, like myself, wants to use such a gun, it&#39;d very likely be for recreation, so why not just allow gun ranges to keep these weapons on hand so they can be used at the range only. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a balance. The government&#39;s responsibility to maintain the safety of the citizenry must be measured against the the <em>privilege</em> of a citizen to own certain types of guns. Notice the use of privilege. Citizens have a <em>right</em> to own guns. They don&#39;t have a right to own any gun they want. They may have a privilege to use certain types of guns, which may be limited. That&#39;s what these bans can, and in my opinion, should do.</p>

<p>Let me preface this by saying that I don&#39;t own a gun. However, I don&#39;t agree with creating laws banning any weapon. Police departments use AR-15&#39;s, dont they? In the last few years we&#39;ve seen how bad corruption has gotten. Why would you want to willingly allow them to ban certain guns that they are using on their own citizens? We aren&#39;t talking about military soldiers in Iraq using said weapons, I&#39;m talking about our local PD. When the police are willing to do away with them, then maybe I&#39;d support such a bill. Until then, I see this as nothing more than an attempt to disarm our people.</p>

Which is my point. Officers have these weapons for incidents in which mass casualties occur and the suspects are using similar weapons. When SWAT is necessary, generally, is when these weapons get used. Not on regular citizens during routine stops or similar.</p>

<p>So yeah... no. If anything the articles you linked prove my point. I never said police don&#39;t have AR-15s. Just that they aren&#39;t using them on random people, which undercuts your point of there being a need not to &quot;disarm our people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, homie, you are missing my point. Or you&#39;re just ignoring it. Police can carry AR-15s. I&#39;ve never said that police shouldn&#39;t have access to AR-15s. But you&#39;re acting like the fact that they have access to them means that regular citizens must as well. But why...? Unless AR-15s are being used against regular citizens for little to no legitimate reason (outside of mass casualty or SWAT-type events), then why do citizens need them...? </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what im saying. The average citizen should have access to the same weapons to protect themselves from tyranny. I can&#39;t even believe im having this argument in the conspiracy sub-reddit of all places. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we need to do in America for point of sale gun control that actually makes sense is change the way we do it entirely. </p>

<p>Currently, we disallow anyone convicted of a crime punishable by 1 year or more incarceration from purchasing firearms. This made sense in the 1920s when that category was bank robbers, murderers, rapists, etc. Since then, it&#39;s gotten very easy to get hung out to dry and fall into this category and it no longer does anything but create a massive black market. </p>

<p>How it should be handled is through education, a basic psychiatric screening, and licensing at the federal level. No history of violence, no overt crazy, and demonstrate an understanding of general safety (guns go on your person or in a safe, the bang end makes things dead, etc.)</p>

<p>As for the more recent debate over school safety, I can&#39;t figure out why 9/11 happened and, almost the next day, airports were made into more hardened targets. I&#39;m not saying arming teachers is the right answer but it&#39;s being dismissed out of hand. I&#39;m not saying armed guards is the right answer but it&#39;s also being dismissed out of hand. </p>

<p>Maybe the answer might start with not, as the high school I went to had, sending the rejects from the police/ sheriff&#39;s department as resource officers. Maybe offer the job to some recently discharged military personnel and let them plain clothes CCW in the halls to keep an eye out for lunatics with guns, knives, bombs,  machetes, saw blades on a stick, etc. and let them be ROTC instructors, gym teachers, and trainers for sports teams while nothing is happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what Trump said should horrify anyone, and it would cause him to be a one-term president.</p>

<p>However, I think what he <em>probably</em> meant (no way to know for sure), is that the process for removing guns from people like school shooters should be faster. I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with the process being faster, but there&#39;s no telling where this would lead so I don&#39;t know for sure what I think about that, other than what Trump literally said is really bad.</p>

<p>What I personally think should happen right now is:</p>

<p>1) We don&#39;t need more regulations on guns and types of guns. Criminals don&#39;t follow laws anyways.</p>

<p>2) If any new regulation is warranted, it should not be about guns, but making it easier (I&#39;m probably not going to communicate this well) for the immediate family and/or friends of a person to have a person involuntarily held by mental facilities, but maybe for no more than two weeks at a time. I say immediate family and friends because those are the people who should know you best.</p>

<p>3) If we want something done, do it. Convince your local school districts to up security or put armed guards in schools. No need to wait for the federal government to write another law. The federal government messes up almost everything it puts its fat fingers into anyway. It already did or we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion.</p>

<p>4) If you&#39;re worried enough, just homeschool your kids. It worked when my mom convinced my dad she could homeschool me and my siblings. I think a school shooting was what convinced her. I&#39;m not judging people that don&#39;t homeschool, just throwing that out there as an option that works.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As a side not, anyone remember the school shooting in KY from January? I don&#39;t. Anyone remember those kids being used by the media pimps to be used as anti 2nd Amendment prostitutes? I don&#39;t. Probably because Kentuckians are probably vastly pro-gun.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is the media, I think obviously at this point, can&#39;t be trusted on issues, except to push what is probably wrong.</p>

<p>If the left pushes hard for gun control and wins, they won’t just be sticking it to the right, they will also be sticking it to themselves, giving up a freedom that would protect them from a tyrannical right leaning government.</p>

<p>If strong gun control is enacted, and if Trump pushes hard fascism as many are concerned, ie, rounding up immigrants, minorities, death camps, etc, then there will be little to be done to protect against it with a disarmed population.</p>

<p>Honestly, it is in the left’s best interest to protect their 2nd ammendment rights and resist any efforts to disarm them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cruel and unusual punishment and unjust sentencing isn&#39;t going to solve this. Killing drug dealers isn&#39;t going to address the underlying socio-economic issues that drive people towards becoming drug dealers or pursuing other illicit means of supporting themselves, and at best it would be a soggy, infected bandage on the problem that almost inevitably will make things worse.</p>

<p>When you have masses of people with limited access to opportunities and wealth plus a  plethora of policies that encumber folks with lifelong repercussions for mistakes and accidents (which often extends to their children and families) you&#39;re basically driving people towards illicit means to stay afloat. They have few reasonable alternatives. It doesn&#39;t make what they&#39;re doing and the decisions they are making right, but that also doesn&#39;t mean they deserve to be murdered for it.</p>

<p>And as for those complicit within the pharmaceutical companies, their actions and decisions were guided by pure greed. They should be separated from any ill gotten gains, forced to repay their debt to society, and removed of the privileges they took advantage of while neglecting their responsibilities. But death is far from a reasonable and constitutional punishment here.</p>

<p>You utter moron - there were <em>about</em> 6 million Jews living in Russia and Eastern Europe in the early twentieth century, which is what almost all of those references in your link are to. Yeah, plenty of them are a bit muddled, like attributing them all to Russia, because guess what: it was a bit harder to calculate precise population numbers a century ago, plus newspaper writers didn&#39;t have the internet to check what the latest consensus was on ethnic demographics on other continents. Get your head out of your arse.</p>

There isn&#39;t anything close to 100 different societies mentioned in your link, and in almost none of them had it ever been claimed that 6 million were expelled. Ignorant idiots like yourself are a major reason why society at large has difficulty taking well-researched and -argued narratives around conspiracies seriously.</p>

Get a damn grip and look at things realistically. Its not all black and white! There&#39;s always grey in the middle, this is real life.

<blockquote>
<p>The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,&quot; former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper&#39;s writer Dan Baumfor the April cover story published Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;You understand what I&#39;m saying? We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,&quot; Ehrlichman said. &quot;We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama just had 8 years in office. Do you have any examples of him attacking GOP as treasonous for not agreeing with or respecting him in a way that a king or dictator would demand? He had a GOP congressman yell AT HIM DURING HIS STATE OF THE UNION. Obama was cordial and made zero effort to reprimand the congressman. Fox News spent 247 attacking him. Never once did he threaten to have them removed from the air. </p>

<p>Trump would happily remove the two branches of government and the media. He openly marvels at the absolute power that some dictator-like leaders have. That is not an admirable quality. </p>

<p>To which you replied “as if Hillary and 0bama are any different.” (Nice touch on the 0bama. Very mature. </p>

<p>You brought up obama. You brought up Hillary. You’re obviously still mad at them. And I asked you why. And you told me to google things. There was nothing in Obama’s presidency that made anyone fearful of his following the basic principles of our democratic system. </p>

<p>Trump and his GOP are on a road to tyranny.. and it’s not even a conspiracy. Maybe that’s why it’s hard for you to see. It’s right in front of your face. But you hate the left so much, that you can’t even get on the right side of history. Get. It. Together. Buddy. </p>

<p>Rodrigo Duterte in my opinion is an ultimate right wing bad ass. </p>

<p>For the Indian audience, I can draw some parallels with Mr. Narendra Modi himself. Modi has done some remarkable stuff in Gujarat (leave the Godhra riots for this answer or the mediocre record of Gujarat with respect to HDI) which was his precedence to running for the Prime Minister chair.</p>

<p>On the same lines, Mr. Duterte has made Mindanao region (the most neglected southern part in Philippines) from being a fascist, murder capital to a vibrant, clean metropolis. No media can deny this fact and he wasn’t even getting greedy for the President chair. It’s the circumstances and opportunity that drove and made him the President.</p>

<p>There are several things I like about him:</p>

<p>He is a true patriot -
Philippines has suffered from the Spanish colonialism first, and then from American imperialism. I can’t think of any other country which has lost so much of its ethnic &amp; cultural roots in Asia other than Philippines (I mean, do you know that Enrique Iglesias is part Filipino? Or Bobby - the guy who made Snapchat is a half Filipino? - well that’s how diverse they have become).
Rodrigo will bring the pride that Filipinos deserve on the world table. Of course he shouldn’t curse or use cuss words against the other world leaders, but that’s his way of saying that he (and Philippines) can’t be bullied.
He is a bad-ass -
He is accused of extra-judicial killings of drug pushers, drug dealers and even drug addicts.
In Hinduism, there is a line called Sama Dana Beda Danda for resolving things. The first three stand for peaceful resolutions through explanation, money or diplomacy. When everything fails you go for Danda which is pure punishment.
Universally it is agreed that drugs are an evil. The judiciary system in Asian countries isn’t suave or quick like in US or UK or Europe. Poor people can be tricked into such activities. The west or the Amnesty International would never understand this.
If you thought Narcos was amazing, read about Philippine Drug War and there isn’t any DEA agents to finish it for Philippines here. I think in Philippines, drugs issue has gone too far which is why Duterte has become a vigilante. Killing could be bad, but then addiction is worse. What would you prefer?
He is really the right wing bad-ass but he is still very secular (imagine that in a full scale Catholic country) and also liberal to an extent.
He admitted his vices (he is open about his infidelity), he is very straightforward (not good for a politician) and obviously he has a big bad mouth.
All things put aside, if he achieves some economic goals as well added with his independent foreign policy I am sure he would make a second term and a loving president.
TL;DR: He is an ultimate right wing bad ass who will put Philippines first rather than anything else. Don’t fall for the western media tropes. They also called Narendra Modi, the muslim butcher and now they are the ones that have called him the rockstar that Madison Square has never seen. Talk about perspectives!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Duterte was a mayor in a town with high crime. He gained popularity by forming roving gangs that would go around and execute alleged drug dealers. My friend from PH told me that it basically turned into a witch hunt, where people could murder and mug anyone, then leave a note on the body claiming they were a drug dealer.</p>

<p>His reputation soared as someone tough on crime. Mostly poor, uneducated people supported him while the educated class saw him as a dictator. It was like the rise of Trump basically.</p>

<p>Once in office he compared he welcome comparisons of his purge to the Holocaust, bragged about killing criminals himself, and made himself judge, jury, and executioner. Police were allowed to execute people on the spot instead of formally charging them. From what I&#39;m told, a lot of the victims were not drug dealers.</p>

That is the main reason why governments have been slow to legalize it. There are too many bought off politicians. </p>

<p>A 2014 study <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1898878">showed</a> a significant decrease in deaths from opiates where marijuana was made legal. Marijuana puts a direct hit in the profits from pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/investigations/dea-drug-industry-congress/?utm_term=.42d91d09e9ea">pharmaceutical lobbies have also opposed DEA enforcement in the US against corrupt doctors and pharmaceutical companies.</a> What we basically have is &quot;legalized heroin&quot; in the US, and slow legalization of marijuana.

<p>Generally,  people give the execs much more credit for being devious than they deserve.  In reality it&#39;s a bunch of stodgy old white dudes who hate change and find it easier to stifle new things than try to adapt to changing market conditions. Also never underestimate the human capacity for self-serving self-delusion: most of these guys probably sincerely believe that they are providing a valuable service  , that society needs them and that weed is the larger evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Booze, Xanax, gambling, porn, video games... they can all be addictive and are legal and available. By your argument since alcohol is legal all mothers are at home getting drunk all day because it&#39;s available and numbing.

In fact in most places that have legalized drugs the per capita amount of users goes <em>down</em> not up, and other related crimes go down as well. Your argument is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in California weed is still dealed. Dispensaries are trash, they sell top shelf hella expensive and dumbasses with their medical cards are just throwing whatever fertilizer to make profits. I can provide source if you want but over 10% of CA&#39;s top shelf stuff was infected with e coli, bacteria, fungus, and banned fertilizers.</p>

<p>The legalization process was sloppy. And there are still drug dealers. Cartels ship em over here in bulk. It still comes out cheaper. Furthermore since this IS a conspiracy sub... here is my conspiracy.</p>

<p>The cartels were funded by the US gov. We know the gov has a past with cartels, look at colombia. Second search up operation fast and furious. Know also that the Zetas are believed to be ran by the Mexican gov. They have military training and the gov only really seems to go after their rival, La Familia.</p>

<p>The US Gove along with the corrupt as Mexican gov, now need a away to clean their money. Guess who is owning all these the dispensaries? I believe it is the cartels. Last year several were busted in California for selling other illegal substances.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying the cartels will be disbanded because they won&#39;t have profit and it&#39;s too dangerous to be a dealer for a tiny profits. First profits are not tiny. I know dealers that carry 5 inch rolls of 100s. Now look at the cartels and their luxurious lifestyle. Second why wouldn&#39;t they in response just fire back by turning their business into a legal one. Lastly what&#39;s more dangerous than a dealer that can easily snitch himself out of jail, being in competitor with the cartel is. You think they wouldn&#39;t infiltrate these business and own them?</p>

<p>Lastly the US is killing two bird with one stone. Using weed is still a schedule 1 substance. You can&#39;t own firearms with drug usage. And having a state issued medical card to your name is a big indicator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife got prescribed opioids after both our kids. She regulated her use and didn’t get hooked but that is how this addiction starts.</p>

<p>Legitimate doctors prescribe ‘everyday people’ drugs, ‘everyday people’ get hooked, then they do whatever necessary to feed that addiction.  With drugs being illegal they turn to illegitimate sources which lead to severe complications and consequences. If they were legal any conversation about addiction would be easier to have and would not be buried under shame and fear of legal prosecution. </p>

<p>As it stands now your wife could still get drunk out of her mind as soon as you leave the house.</p>

<p>p.s. I’m not going to touch the fact that you seem to think your wife is incapable of caring for her children without the law preventing her from becoming strung out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is more likely if drugs remain illegal. How the fuck do people not see this? Legalization leads to de-stigmatizing users, making it more likely for them to seek out treatment and education. It also leads to treatment and educational programs becoming better equipped and more widespread. Same goes for research programs. This will lower rates of addiction, increase exposure to facts instead of propaganda, and DRASTICALLY reduce injuries/death related to drug use.</p>

<p>The current policies are killing people, ripping families apart and proliferating crime. There doesn&#39;t need to be a &quot;war&quot; related to drugs. That&#39;s a made up term to excuse and distract from government and corporate greed and corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d guess that most alcoholics who refuse to admit they have a problem do it because of the stigma that goes along with having a problem. It&#39;s less that it&#39;s specifically related to alcohol and more about the cultural stigma toward addicts. I think that actually supports the point I&#39;m making, but I should have mentioned that I think legalization de-stigmatizes both casual users and addicts.</p>

<p>The end result is the same, meaning you need to rethink your argument. Also, you must never have heard of dirty doctors lol. Do some research, the countries that have legalized heroin have reduced the addiction rates/deaths related to heroin, which is contradictory to your argument.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, won the electoral college with the help of russian hackers removing the registration of key voters, and there is zero evidence that he is worth billions of dollars-  there is plenty of evidence to suggest that he&#39;s massively in debt. He only owns a few floors of Trump Tower, and his business at this point is almost exclusively putting his name on other people&#39;s property.</p>

<p>Trump was injected with massive amounts of cash from his father. His &quot;small loan of a million dollars&quot; line is a lie. His father showed up at one of his casinos, bought a few million dollars in chips, and left - that&#39;s at best a loan and at worst a gift.</p>

<p>All he has going for him is that he&#39;s so outrageously stupid that he appeals to the Republican party, a product of decades of Fox News dumbing down the population into thinking that science is political and truth is something you can decide on your own.</p>

People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That&#39;s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole.

<p>Example direct quote from Art of the Deal about giving the press controversy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One thing I’ve learned about the press is that they’re always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better. It’s in the nature of the job, and I understand that. The point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you. I’ve always done things a little differently, I don’t mind controversy, and my deals tend to be somewhat ambitious. Also, I achieved a lot when I was very young, and I chose to live in a certain style. The result is that the press has always wanted to write about me.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL if you&#39;ve read any of Trump&#39;s subsequent books written 100% by him you&#39;d know the co-author is full of shit. The co-author is not a businessman or a deal maker, he is a shadow writer that helps non-writers write. Has he ever written another book about &quot;deal making?&quot; Has the co-author ever published another business book under his own name that got any credibility? Or, is he what many writers do, but help others with ideas put them on to paper in a readable way.</p>

<p>These thoughts and ideas are all 100% Donald Trump and 100% the ideas of a real-estate tycoon.</p>

<p>The &quot;Fake news&quot; of it all is the story that somehow Trump didn&#39;t write this, but this other guy did and Trump just put his name to that. A story that only works for those who haven&#39;t actually read the book because so much of it is personal and 100% about real-world examples from Trump&#39;s business life that it literally makes ZERO sense that another author had some serious input other than being an editor to smooth it out to the reader.</p>

<p>The voice in the words is Trumps and in every subsequent book of his that he did not have a supporting writer, it is like an extension of The Art of the Deal. The same voice is still there. The same writing style. The same knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Maybe the &quot;co-author&quot; just wanted his 2 minutes of fame this election cycle again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example, I cannot remember the name, but one tactic you can do is frame the conversation in your favor. Trump proposed his border wall, but also said he was going to make Mexico pay for it. This caused a lot of conversation to be about whether or not Mexico will pay for it. Had he not mentioned Mexico paying for it, the discussion would have been more tightly centered on whether we should have a wall or not.</p>

<p>He still isn&#39;t probably getting a wall, but guaranteed when you frame a discussion like that, it plays to your favor. Whether he did it intentionally or not doesn&#39;t really matter. I suspect he didn&#39;t and he is just a natural grifter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ. Russians certainly were trolling us in the last election, but the reason that dude won was the full on Make America Great campaign. He sold his shit to the people who vote and won. Those people don&#39;t care about what is happening now, they voted on someone who could take them back in time (supposedly by his campaign message). He got that voting group super pumped. Just like Obama got the young pumped back in his first election. I think the Russians added to the idea, but I think most of the Trumpers were behind him from his message, not the false shit for Hillary from Russia. If anything, that stuff caused her voters to stay home and not vote. Sorry as I can&#39;t stand the guy but I just think people don&#39;t get how much his message resonated in the core voters of this nation. People ate his message up and passed it around. Drain the swamp, end government corruption, lower taxes, bring jobs back to the US. Fuck, that is what ALL people want and he spoke to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100%. Our best defense against this kind of warfare is to invest more into education. A more intelligent populace would be less inclined to fall for the kind of bullshit that Russia is spewing. Not only that, but it would help in all kinds of other ways too, cause it’s not just the Russians we have to be wary of. The mainstream media with all their sensational 24/7 bullshit, politicians that are all full of shit, and corporations who spew their own brand of bullshit in political TV ads. If we had smarter people, we’d have a smarter, more efficient, better government that works for the people. </p>

It is the responsibility of the patient to not abuse the drugs.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.....an intelligent response. Heaven forbid someone in this country takes personal responsibility for their actions. 
Blaming the pharmaceutical companies is such a cop out!!!  It’s America....if you have a product that works, you market it and sell it. Did you know that morphine used to be sold on the shelves of pharmacies, right in the open, in the 40s and 50s? It all comes down to societies ills, just like the gun debate. There is an addiction crisis in America, but there are also Veterans, disabled people, and pain patients that need these medications to have a dignified life, a quality life that are getting spat upon in this debate to the point of suicide. The illegal drugs definitely need to go. This administration is the first to stand up and tackle these issues with transparency, but if pain patients get swallowed in the process, how sadistic is that?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One reason that individual responsibility isn&#39;t having a great effect is that people keep trying to scapegoat their problem with big pharma for which there is some guilt. But it is the individual&#39;s responsibility to get rid of and/or control their addiction regardless of who had a hand in it.  Friends and family do it to not helping or motivating the addict towards sobriety, recovery, rehab etc every time they &#39;blame&#39; big pharma which is a variation of the &#39;not me&#39; syndrome or denial. </p>

<p>In the end the addicted individual has to deal with it. They can be forgiven or rehabilitated but they are responsible for obtaining that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once more, you are talking <em>on a person to person basis</em></p>

<p>Issues have to be looked at on a societal level. If suddenly the unemployment goes up by 10% in a population in a year, while the national average stays the same, you have to look at the reasons why. It isn&#39;t like people suddenly got lazy in that year. That doesn&#39;t happen in broad populations like that. Similarly if the death rate from drugs spirals to 400% what it was 10 years ago, you have to look into the reasons. People aren&#39;t just suddenly more genetically prone to addiction than 10 years ago. </p>

By the same token what took physical time like going to visit a doctor, counselor etc for advice can also be done much faster with technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People do come less responsible in less than a few years. There is peer pressure if one desires to be part of a particular peer group. A good example would be these freshman college students/frat pledges killing themselves by alcohol poisoning trying to be part of a group they want and/or chose to belong. Even though they are facilitated by older frat members the pledges also know those same members are committing a crime by giving alcohol to minors and making them do many things that would be a crime if sober in public.

<p>If that was the case, it might be because stores started selling liquor to minors more, or maybe a black market for alcohol has opened up. You cannot rely on people to become more responsible in broad populations. Broadly, people are stupid and prone to making terrible decisions. That&#39;s why we have laws.

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump truly wanted to end the opiod epidemic, he would go after the manufacturers. It is not too difficult to curb this opioid epidemic. You simply ban all opioids and actually enforce the ban. Initially there would be a panic among addicts, most of them would switch to heroin or something like that, and eventually they would end up using one of the substitutes, be it methadone or buprenorphine or whatever it may be. But with no opioids around for new addicts to get hooked on, there would be no new users. So the Jews don&#39;t want that. They want this illegal trade to continue. They want doctors to overperscribe oxycodone, so that people can get hooked and then live as slaves to pharmaceutical companies for the rest of their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Maine and Vermont, felons never lose their right to vote, even while they are incarcerated. </p>

<p>In 14 states and the District of Columbia, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated, and receive automatic restoration upon release.</p>

<p>In 22 states, felons lose their voting rights during incarceration, and for a period of time after, typically while on parole and/or probation. Voting rights are automatically restored after this time period. Former felons may also have to pay any outstanding fines, fees or restitution before their rights are restored as well. </p>

<p>In 12 states felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for some crimes, or require a governor’s pardon in order for voting rights to be restored, or face an additional waiting period after completion of sentence (including parole and probation) before voting rights can be restored. These states are listed in the fourth category on Table 1. Details on these states are found in Table 2 below.</p>

As a young dumb guy walking around Tijuana at night, the &quot;police&quot; have shaken me down for cash before, just screaming and taking out zip ties, until you take out a $20 bill american.

So instead of fighting a losing battle against our own people that isn&#39;t working and hasn&#39;t worked from the very beginning that we try something different like treating drug addiction as a disease, quit throwing people in jail and ruining their lives over it, and quit enabling a huge black market and even to not only exist but THRIVE in the process. We can also address drug manufacturers too in the process. </p>

<p>That may seem like a good idea, but vets with PTSD wouldn&#39;t tell it to anyone for the fear having their weapons seized or unable to buy anything.  A better idea would be making it less of a taboo to talk about their experience and actually treating PTSD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sure the hell is in the military.  If you get any mental issues on your medical files, you&#39;ll likely need a waiver to stay in.  Mental health issues are a huge catch-22 in the military.  Most people don&#39;t say anything for fear of getting kicked out.  They&#39;re slowly trying to change this, but it&#39;s nowhere close to where it needs to be.</p>

<p>Civilian-wise in the US, it&#39;s also slowly gaining more support, but most places you just don&#39;t talk about it.  The younger generation seems way more open to talking about it, especially in subs like <a href="/r/meirl">/r/meirl</a> and all the other subs that joke about their depression.  Hopefully, their generation can break through because mental health is as important as any other medical need.</p>

<p>When op said &quot;don&#39;t fall for it&quot; he is talking about the people who are heavily antidrug and live in areas in the middle of the opioid crisis who blame the small time users and dealers for the problem instead of the massive corporations making billions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heroin and Methamphetamine have simple POSSESSION as a first offense Class i felony, with probable jail time and at least a 1yr probation. Distribution, probably has aggravating and mitigating factors (gun posession=aggravating, feeding own addiction=mitigating) is most likely a G felony. It will get you a prison sentence either way. Trafficking is probably a C felony and will come with a lengthy prison sentence and kissing life goodbye.</p>

<p>I could have looked up sources but they vary by state law. All, and especially &quot;Conspiracy&quot; charges are often trumped up to garner a plea bargain. Especially because it&#39;s written into the law that a single party can engage in a unilateral conspiracy, which is simply &quot;intent.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump stuff was mostly brigaded to the top. As a European (that likely wouldn&#39;t have voted for Trump or Clinton if I was a US resident), I still vividly remember the obvious brigading and political lunacy that went on in this sub during the US election. Heck not only this sub, all of Reddit! There were parts of Reddit that were designated to be totally pro-Clinton and those posts were brigaded to the top, this sub here was seemingly designated as pro-Trump by the propagandists and anti-Clinton and pro-Trump posts would regulary and very obviously get thousands of upvotes and a disproportionately small amount of comments. It was such obvious brigading you could see it from a mile off. </p>

<p>Personally, I still like to believe the majority of this sub is not as easily tricked into the left/right dichotomy and petty political bickering and can see how various conspiracies and corruption are present on both sides of the playing field. And not only in the US, but throughout the world.</p>

<p>He was literally talking about the <em>very specific scenario</em> where someone is making <strong>open, explicit threats of violence against innocent people</strong> and we know they are armed. Yes, obviously, such a person should be disarmed swiftly and due process would come second in the form of criminal charges or involuntary commitment. He&#39;s not talking about taking all guns. I know every single one of you in this thread railing against his comments understand what I am saying.  </p>

<p>When someone is accused of committing a violent crime, they are usually arrested and held until they can stand trial. Their freedom is taken first and due process comes second. This is exactly the same kind of situation, but in the context of a well-armed individual making open plans for mass murder.  </p>

<p>All of you taking these cheap upvotes should be ashamed. You trade your dignity and honor to participate in the mass hate hypnosis. This is happening more and more frequently. Wake up and stop fanning these false flames before they burn down your own house. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a big list but I&#39;ll just put a few things. He paid three former terrorists who have killed troops on record a total of 31 million in settlements because their  human rights were &quot;violated&quot;. His budgets have been terrible, with the latest one being focused on gender issues and women&#39;s programs, basically spending a lot just to get the female vote this year. His most recent trip to India was embarrassing and arguably racist, basically cosplaying as a Bollywood actor the entire time while meeting India&#39;s politicians. There are  many things, and I guess every politician will have made mistakes, but Trudeau has spent like crazy with little payoff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a matter of perception mate. Paying out over human rights violations isn&#39;t his choice, thats, I assume, Geneva convention. We are all bound to it. </p>

<p>Doing more for women&#39;s rights and the like isn&#39;t just to &quot;get on the bangwagon&quot;, it&#39;s called an open minded progressive attitude, and we actually need more of it. </p>

<p>The India thing, while I haven&#39;t seen anything myself about it, I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and say it&#39;s most likely the &quot;accepting local culture&quot; act, you know, when people come to Scotland and wear kilts.. </p>

<p>Again, perception is reality. Unfortunately, we all perceive actions differently.. oh well. </p>

<p>Trump was sharing an idea, agreed.  Looking at <a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/san-francisco-diseased-streets-compared-worst-slums-world/">something like this</a> makes you wonder.</p>

<p>More stuff that you just invented now? So you’re saying someone wants internet points from trump so therefore doesn’t care? Weird how you can read their minds. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;You know, if you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty. These people can kill 2,000, 3,000 people and nothing happens to them,&quot; </p>

<p>So what’s that mean hmm? Oh he didn’t say it so he can’t mean it! </p>

Three quarter of the United States sells some form of drug to make just a tiny more than ends meet because minimum wage is jack dick. Its enough to get me groceries and my necessities for a week if tbat. Ir doesnt pay rent or jack shit. I&#39;m sure 95% of the people have been guilty of illegal barter in someway. Let&#39;s kill drug dealers and let the 100+ pedofile get less than 2 years of a sentence and than walk away like it never happened, when he violated a little girl/boy and takes her innocence but let&#39;s kill drug dealers simply because trump is mad that hes not getting his as much tax money from big pussy pharma as he would if he eliminated the street dealer&#39;s. Some people deal drugs because of our corrupt government some of the circumstances like having a felony or mental health issue prohibits you from having a job so you flip a little of your monthly prescription of whatever to make due and eat. Sure there are some dealers who may or may deserve some time for things like heroin or fentanyl but death....no no no...if you wanna kill drug dealers than atleast give a pedofile back what he did to his victim or an excruciating death to say the least. This is outrageous and I hope justice is brought to this fucking humiliating pussies sadistic thoughts and actions...</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, people could buy clean opiods (Oxy) in measured doses of known potency. Then the DEA cracked down, people could only get black tar... now they die from overdoses.</p>

<p>The problem is prohibition, not drugs. See this shit in retail packaging out of liquor stores and suddenly there&#39;s no more crackhouses or street corner sales. The cartels go bankrupt. No one will be shot over a deal gone bad... neither cops, nor drug dealers, nor bystanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last I checked it takes many years to pass a drug just to get to human trials so yes I am fine with pharmaceutical companies &quot;getting away&quot; with it since they spend millions of dollars and lots years of labour to hope that it can go on the market... There is guide lines that have to be met since you can&#39;t release a drug that would cure one person fully but harm two others even if it is possible to do tests to see if that one person would qualify... You need at least 75% or greater success rate on humans and that is not an easy thing to do when we all have different genetic coding</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But one did lead to the other. It’s rather well researched and documented. And anecdotally speaking, every single heroin addict I know (which is far more than it should be and a large enough sample size for at least some inferences) started on prescription pills, most legally obtained. Because doctors overprescribed them. I had carloads of friends making monthly trips to their doctor for ridiculous amounts of opiates and benzos. All legal. Then they put restrictions on those prescriptions and patients were left addicted with nowhere to turn. And now they’re all on heroin. If they’re even still alive. </p>

<p>Of course heroin has been around forever. But the spike in addiction rates and ODs occurring now can be directly traced back to big pharma lying to doctors and the mass prescriptions that followed, as well as the subsequent restrictions on said scripts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All i know is, under the Taliban, growing heroin poppies was outlawed and there was a worldwide heroin drought.  Then along comes the U.S. gets rid of the Taliban, &amp; now Afghanistan is producing more Heroin than ever before.  Look it up. I don&#39;t know where the heroin that winds up in America comes from. I&#39;m sort of out of the loop when it comes to worldwide drug cartels, but to think that Afghanistan is now producing a shit load of heroin, &amp; now the world has a new heroin epidemic, but its all coming from mexico......thats a bit like sticking your head in the sand and denying the truth. Do you think its possible that Afghani Heroin is being shipped to mexico, where its easier to bribe customs, then run it over the border into the U.S? What do you reckon?</p>

<p>How are we not doing this already...   well, fuck it, let&#39;s just throw endless amounts of our nations resources towards the &quot;war on drugs&quot; which obviously hasn&#39;t helped a god damn thing.

    <div class="md"><p>I heard a good analogy about the opiod epidemic and it goes like this: </p>

<p>A car is driving down the street and it suddenly falls into a sink-hole. The police come and rope off the area. The road crew fills in the hole and people start driving over it again. However, the car is still in the hole. </p>

<p>This car is analogous to what happened to people who were hooked on Codeine when legistlation passed to lower the rate of prescribing narcotics. They didn’t solve the problem with addiction (customers), they forced addicts (yes, narcotics are highly addictive, especially pain killers) to move into new drug areas like Heroin, Fentanil and Carfentil. </p>

<p>Lucky for us, China exports a shit-ton of it to keep the addicts going, but more people than ever are dying from drug-overdoses because of the strength of these new drugs. </p>

<p>That’s why we call bullshit on head-hunting the dealers. Let’s first find and treat the problem, which is opiod addiction at the fault of big pharma and the medical establishment for prescibing known addictive substances. </p>

<p>In other words, we need to remove the car from the sink-hole first, before we start to fix the road. </p>

<p>Oh wait, he simply said that countries with harsh penalties for drug dealers have less of a drug problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to nationally have a serious discussion about why there is suddenly and opoid epidemic.  Prescription painkillers weren&#39;t invented recently, and have been prescribed for a long time. Other countries have much more relaxed laws about them even.  What has changed:  We suddenly have a military occupation of the largest opium producer in the world.  Netflix is making shows about CIA drug running in the 80s.  Somehow people still roll their eyes at me when I say the CIA is likely behind the opioid epidemic now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget oxycontins role in all this. That&#39;s where this epidemic started. Late 90&#39;s early 2000&#39;s, I believe, Oxycontin (not to be confused with Oxycodone) was being handed out kike candy. Big pharma had most of the doctors convinced they had come up with an iPod formula that was less addictive and stringer than the competition. It was really just stronger. Over heard it called synthesized or legal heroin spot. I&#39;ve read reports of heroin junkies saying they&#39;d take Out before heroin because it&#39;s a better high. Its usually a lot cleaner, so safer in that respect, but a better high usually means more addictive. When legislation hit to start cracking down on painkillers and in particular Oxy&#39;s, people started losing their prescriptions and turning to street heroin. The fact that the U.S. just happened to be in Afghanistan is, in my opinion, is a coincidence that should not be ignored. From what I understand, the Taliban were a backwards people with a lot of backwards beliefs, but they had opium production damn near wiped out before we invaded. Now we want allies and Opium is a profitable crop. I&#39;m not sure how much are legal grows for pharmacies or not, but now Afghanistan provides the vast majority of heroin for the entire planet. </p>

<p>They say heroin bought in America is from Mexico mostly. I believe it maybe, but it&#39;s little consolation to anything. Bottom line is allies we protect in Afghanistan are responsible for an epidemic right now. Opiates/Opioids are a god send for those that really need them and pretty much irreplaceable. In 3rd world countries, I&#39;m sure a little morphine or heroin can be used instead of the pills we take for granted provided by big pharma here in the states. It&#39;s still little consolation. </p>

<p>Big government and big pharma made sure just growing and possessing a small amount of raw, edible opium goo cut straight from the pod was illegal and more trouble than it was worth to most. It creates a dependency on government and big pharma to provide the pills and the rules and of course to take the money. So we have unwittingly traded an all natural, much safer, less addictive alternative for pain management that can be grown in any one persons home or garden for the uber-synthesized, hyper addictive, monopolized pills bestowed upon our culture by tptb. But when that Rx is gone and you have a fucking habit that renders you useless without enough opioid in your blood to potentially kill an average person with no tolerance, your gonna be real tempted to turn to that good Afghani or Mexican dope as a replacement.</p>

In this particular instance, he was speaking to major pushers/dealers not having a harsh enough penalty. Probably without even knowing what the current penalties are. Saying that he suggested the death penalty is quite the stretch IMO. Guy is still a moron though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with OP. Killing or even jailing drug dealers makes zilch difference. People WANT drugs.
Might as well kill everyone.
The only way to stop drug related crime is to make them all legal. Then educate people about each drug in detail so that people who want to take any can at least make an educated choice.</p>

<p>I totally disagree with drugs that are highly addictive but even people on heroin can still function if they get that stuff instead of having to prostitute or commit crimes to get it.
Same for coke. Many high flyers in the 80s were only able to cope with the demanding world of finances on drugs.</p>

<p>You&#39;d then hope that after years of knowing a lot about these substances that most people would not chose heroin or crack as their number one choice. Like a lot of people have given up smoking nowadays.</p>

<p>Also the pharma industry could make them properly and avoid a lot of ill effects due to cutting with dangerous substitutes.</p>

<p>I swear that dealers would disappear, crime would go down and still not everyone would be on drugs. But we are not trusted as humans to make choices.</p>

<p>The worst thing is that one of the worst drugs on earth is totally legal: Alcohol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alcoholics are worse than murderers. They cause more destruction and chaos than any other behavior, but people think it&#39;s OK because they&#39;ve made it legal and you can find it in most households, &quot;It&#39;s acceptable&quot;.</p>

<p>I do believe most schools start teaching kids about drugs around grade 6. The teaching methodology was way off though, they brought in some cop with a suitcase filled with joints and pills and put them on display and asked: How many of you have done drugs? </p>

<p>They proceed to explain how aspirin would fall in the category of drugs, so we&#39;re all thinking: &quot;This guy&quot;.</p>

<p>The didn&#39;t show the depravity of heroin users, or meth-heads picking at their face, but why not? </p>

<p>But then they&#39;re OK with showing fatal car crashes to teach about drunk driving to dui traffic offenders.</p>

<p>They should find volunteers of once-addicted; now sober people who come and talk about real life choices. They should have field trips where they drive through areas where the depravity is rampant and obvious.</p>

<p>And finally, they should visit a hospital with users who overdose, to see their state and witness the aftermath of drug use gone awry.  </p>

Thank God we don&#39;t have to fight against the MSM anymore, since they are totally on our side now.
Also, let&#39;s get the vote out for anti-Trump politicians so we can stop this guy. This is what it is all about guys. All these years we should have known the MSM and establishment politicians were our friends-- but we didn&#39;t, and now we have to fight and resist Trump.

    <div class="md"><p>Why did opium production INCREASE under US occupation of Afghanistan, and the after the investment of billions of dollars to &quot;fight production&quot;? This was long before Trump... Should we assume that Trump is a tool of the forces that allowed opium production to INCREASE under the alleged regime of fighting it? Do we have a reason to assume that? Is the same regime that allowed opium production to INCREASE while claiming to fight it, also pushing anti-Trumpism? What does this tell us?
What does any of this have to do with comments about drug dealers? What does this have to do with the activities of all the agencies that were overseeing the opioid crisis pre-Trump?
If the whole MSM is anti-Trump, should r/conspiracy treat MSM talking points as fit subject matter? Why or why not?
If a propaganda regime were established that were pervasive and dominant, would such a regime seek to control a subreddit like r/conspiracy? Why or why not? Would it be likely to succeed? Why or why not? What technology would it have to do make the attempt?
If Trump were anti-establishment, would the establishment try to control media in order to stop him? Why or why not? 
If media were controlled, how would one know? If r/conspiracy were controlled, how would one know?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake, this isn&#39;t about getting rid of the drug problem... this is about getting rid of the competition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice thing about the US, is that the average -completely average American, who owns a gun - would never let that happen. The average US soldier, who has to take oaths to THE CONSTITUTION, make that an impossibility. </p>

<p>The Police, dont go around blasting people. I mean, expound on outliers all day, the POLICE DON&#39;T GO AROUND SHOOTING PEOPLE - relative the amount of LEO serving at all times/relative the dangers of the job/relative the frequency of escape violence.</p>

<p>Citizens will shoot, Military wont, Cops wont, and that leaves &#39;the national guard&#39; (and coast guard).</p>

<p>You think people who have families in the state will attack other members of the state, who also have families in the state(s)? </p>

<p>Who also happen to enforce US laws everyday, when every they operate, as per the last hundred and fifty years. . .</p>

<p>NO. They would not.</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s what I&#39;d ask:</p>

<p>How can trump do anything like the sort in a land of law and armed-Civilian, bound-military, and family man-police order?</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s one thing to say, he tells the police to kill people. </p>

<p>Well, wtf do police care about that. Only federal officers/agents and the D.C. PD are &#39;federal employees&#39;. The mailman is more federal than a cop.</p>

<p>Next, you take the soldier. WHO CANT BE DEPLOYED on US soil. </p>

<p>&quot;Posse Comitatus&quot;</p>

<p>The same act that allow(ed) a local sheriff to deputize anyone he saw fit.</p>

<p>&quot;Title 32 of the U.S. Code is not subject to the prohibitions on civilian law enforcement&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The intent of the Act is to prevent the military forces of the U.S. from becoming a national police force or guardia civil.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;the act prohibits the use of the military to &quot;execute the laws&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Execution of the laws is perceived to be a civilian police function, which includes the arrest and detention of criminal suspects, search and seizure activities, restriction of civilian movement through the use of blockades or checkpoints, gathering evidence for use in court, and the use of undercover personnel in civilian drug enforcement activities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a matter of policy Western nations have labeled terrorists as &quot;criminals&quot; to be prosecuted under domestic criminal laws&quot;.</p>

<p>This is why the labeling of &#39;terrorist&#39; is a HUGE deal. </p>

<p>Likewise, the label &#39;potential terrorist&#39; and &#39;terrorist&#39; are two different things. One&#39;s an intel-point, and the other an actor (who has acted against current laws which are pretty obvious. The first is not a crime, the later is a crime that has been committed. It&#39;s a charge.</p>

<p>Seriously, How many &#39;terrorism&#39; charges have you seen on the books by police? It&#39;s almost indistinguishable from a mass-shooting at first, and then, never found to actually be the case - unless Obama was in office (zing!).</p>

<p>Conclusion: There is a difference in faith in the government, and faith in your people, who for many years of your life, is the kindest police force outside the incompetent ones on this earth. </p>

<p>I have met police in many countries. I would rather have a Serbian or US cop responding to my distress, over a British, French, Russian, Japanese, or Chinese cop.</p>

<p>That being said, I never actually met an LADP or NYPD cop. I know only medium to small city and town cops. Streets they patrol everyday, and known everyone most people dont care to know. They also know most shop owners by appearance and stories, and most clergy in the area. They worked libraries, and schools, and bars and groceries, festivals and parades. </p>

<p>The reason is simple. </p>

<p>Those are men willing to meet criminals on their level to (safely to them), but not above the law, to fulfill the requirements of the law. </p>

<p>Criminals who are often armed to the teeth, but VERY reluctant to open fire on the shield. Which we call &#39;militarized&#39;. Compared to who?</p>

<p>China? Russia? France even?  The military dont have parades here, after all.</p>

<p>The police dont weild assault rifles as a primary weapon, or machine guns, when you step out of an airport and onto the tarmac. </p>

<p>Police here dont roll around in jeeps with a machine gun on the back, and face masks with ballistic helemts.</p>

<p>They just put those on when they crash a crack-house. </p>

<p>Common items include: Assault rifles, BF vests, handguns, and automatic sub-machine guns. Along with an average of 300 USD.</p>

<p>&#39;Gangsters&#39; armed to the teeth for other gangsters, and both types have to knock on the same door.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a cop. I &#39;cant&#39; be a cop.  </p>

<p>yet, Like men in uniform the world over, they dont do it to get a thrill kill. They do it because they generally value something they see the society lacks or might lose - like the value of law and order.</p>

<p>especially in countries were life expectancy for a cop is not so good.</p>

<p>You think those cops are national treasures, and not the nature of the policing profile? Every nation has its own heroes and villains, and in the west, we tempered out armies and police into heroes. </p>

<p>TIME ARE HARD: but to villinze the only groups the US government actually considers NOW when it does things, and to assume they would respond like drones, when they make drones to respond like drones, is kind of &#39;sensationalist&#39;. </p>

<p>It spreads fear.  NOT TERRORISM. but, not helping if those conditions are absent our culture, along with trust in it.  </p>

<p>I mean, imagine if terrorist did the unthinkable and radiation is all over the place. Who respond to that first.  The very same people you&#39;d some how assume are eager to kill you for &#39;law and order&#39;.</p>

<p>My cousin is actually a female staff sergeant on the NBC quarantine team. A soldier you&#39;d be dying to see if things went sour in the atmosphere. Come to think of it. . .</p>

<p>AKA. at what point is it just hate for authority or government to think this of the USA? Like, how many cops or soldiers have you met that would not immediately take up arms against the US for such a thing. </p>

<p>Then, HERE&#39;s the KICKER!!!!!</p>

<p>IN the US, I bet you, one out of every five (if not more) police officers HAVE A RELATIVE in prison or jail, or has been to such, for drug use.</p>

<p>Drugs are common in the US, and police know it. Military might be surprised. </p>

<p>Drug dealers are people also, who share just as much linage under the law as the police do.</p>

<p>So, outside court records and DNA, it&#39;s going to be hard to tell who is fit for killing country-men, when given an order to locally/nationally do so.</p>

<p>Who does not travel/ live in other states over their life.</p>

<p>Like you can transport NG to kill eachothers states?  NO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would really like to see a list of Trump’s advisors.
The death penalty is reserved for the worst cruel + heinous acts committed towards 1, or more victims.
      In every trial where a jury decides on a punishment of death it is upsetting to all involved because it is the taking of a life.
     How can Donald Trump so care freely state that all drug dealers should be sentenced to death?
   The same way he passed the bill into law that meant that cruel deaths to the beautiful animals of the Alaskan wilderness.
     These animals live on 6 sanctuaries-previously protected from hunters.
   There is an oil well in the area of the animals so Trump decides to suddenly allow hunters to invade their home + kill them according to a different bill he signed that would allow very cruel ,previously banned, methods to hunt.
   It was now OK to “bait” an animal- to put out food for them + then shoot them from a helicopter or small plane.
   Large steel traps could now be used as well as shooting bears + wolves, with their pups, right in the front of their den.
    There existed, previously, an area of government whose job it was to ensure that:
1) pet food sold in stores hadn’t been tampered with +,
2) exotic animals, + all animals really, would be visited by staff to make sure they weren’t being abused in any way + were being treated well.
   Trump signed a law that scrapped this job so that animals may be being abused + poisoned but there is no a group paid to check + make sure.
    Then , the other day, the debate over Trump
wanting to pass a law that would allow them to bring back, to the US, certain parts of exotic animals that they killed.
     Because of all these laws I feel that Trump does not have the ability to love + feel empathy for animals or humans- to the point that he would gladly make a law that would men death to numerous people + he has already signed laws that allow for the suffering + death of many many animals.
       Honestly- Trump scares me!!!!!
        He is very unpredictable + spontaneous in making decisions without fully considering all the factors that come into play.
     When making decisions by men in power one of the first factor is the effect on animals or humans. Trump is lacking in this area!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.....an intelligent response. Heaven forbid someone in this country takes personal responsibility for their actions. 
Blaming the pharmaceutical companies is such a cop out!!!  It’s America....if you have a product that works, you market it and sell it. Did you know that morphine used to be sold on the shelves of pharmacies, right in the open, in the 40s and 50s? It all comes down to societies ills, just like the gun debate. There is an addiction crisis in America, but there are also Veterans, disabled people, and pain patients that need these medications to have a dignified life, a quality life that are getting spat upon in this debate to the point of suicide. The illegal drugs definitely need to go. This administration is the first to stand up and tackle these issues with transparency, but if pain patients get swallowed in the process, how sadistic is that?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d guess that most alcoholics who refuse to admit they have a problem do it because of the stigma that goes along with having a problem. It&#39;s less that it&#39;s specifically related to alcohol and more about the cultural stigma toward addicts. I think that actually supports the point I&#39;m making, but I should have mentioned that I think legalization de-stigmatizes both casual users and addicts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife got prescribed opioids after both our kids. She regulated her use and didn’t get hooked but that is how this addiction starts.</p>

<p>Legitimate doctors prescribe ‘everyday people’ drugs, ‘everyday people’ get hooked, then they do whatever necessary to feed that addiction.  With drugs being illegal they turn to illegitimate sources which lead to severe complications and consequences. If they were legal any conversation about addiction would be easier to have and would not be buried under shame and fear of legal prosecution. </p>

<p>As it stands now your wife could still get drunk out of her mind as soon as you leave the house.</p>

<p>p.s. I’m not going to touch the fact that you seem to think your wife is incapable of caring for her children without the law preventing her from becoming strung out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Booze, Xanax, gambling, porn, video games... they can all be addictive and are legal and available. By your argument since alcohol is legal all mothers are at home getting drunk all day because it&#39;s available and numbing. And the people who will get into stuff like that will do it anyway, the legality of something like heroin hasn&#39;t stopped people from using. In fact in most places that have legalized drugs the per capita amount of users goes <em>down</em> not up, and other related crimes go down as well. Your argument is wrong.</p>

<p>The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,&quot; former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper&#39;s writer Dan Baumfor the April cover story published Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;You understand what I&#39;m saying? We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,&quot; Ehrlichman said. &quot;We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a developed nation labeling drug users as subhuman and worthy of death is bad.</p>

<p>I think that a government killing anyone who isnt an immediate danger without due process is bad.</p>

<p>I also think that the existence of cartels in the first place is a direct effect of prohibition. </p>

<p>I think that people ignoring the human rights violations that are happening before our eyes as some sort of &quot;nessicary evil&quot;  because you subscribe to an outdated, dogmatic, and mostly incorret understanding of drugs frankly disgusts me.</p>

<p>The point is, this would be indefensible even if the war on drugs was justified. And its not.</p>

<p>The Arizona law is an exact copy of the Federal law and since Obama refused to enforce laws duly passed by Congress, Arpaio enforced the laws enacted by the people of Arizona. </p>

<p>Arpaio was trying to the job he was elected to do. Trump pardoning him does not in any way make Trump a racist. </p>

<p>I beg to differ. They are toxic pieces of shit that have no place in civilized society. </p>

<p>Come to California and we can show you how good life can be without trumpturds. We drove them entirely out of our government (nunes is done this year, even in his trumpturd bubble in the sticks) and we are flush with cash and leading the world in technology among other things. </p>

<p>Or hang out with your trumpturd friends LOL!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a matter of perception mate. Paying out over human rights violations isn&#39;t his choice, thats, I assume, Geneva convention. We are all bound to it. </p>

<p>Doing more for women&#39;s rights and the like isn&#39;t just to &quot;get on the bangwagon&quot;, it&#39;s called an open minded progressive attitude, and we actually need more of it. </p>

<p>The India thing, while I haven&#39;t seen anything myself about it, I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and say it&#39;s most likely the &quot;accepting local culture&quot; act, you know, when people come to Scotland and wear kilts.. </p>

<p>Again, perception is reality. Unfortunately, we all perceive actions differently.. oh well. </p>
