       I heard of the sandy hook shooting about 24 hours after it happened because i was not online at all during my day off so when i heard of it the first thing i did was to google search for it and in the top 3 links on the first page there was already some nonsense about crisis actors/false flag paranoid conspiracy... they had as much visibility as legit channels of information. What does it mean, what to do about it.... hey i don't have the answers but i sure was disappointed by this turn of event: the shitbirds are hijacking the people's attention to lead them into some nonsensical wild goose chase that can only end up alienating them from themselves and their community since there is nothing substential in what they propose, they cannot get to the bottom any of their theories. it's like the concept of the "war on terror"... unless you cancel the whole concept it won't end because it's not made to end, it's made to be impossible to solve.

       Get past identity politics.  This isn't about liberalism any more than it is about any other "ism" since it wouldn't matter whether it's "conservative" or "democrat" or whatever whatever.  It's just TPTB elite power grab over and above the masses - masses that have been conditioned to remain separated, un-united, and easily manipulated as a result.

       No, that attitude is though.  We used to be capable of respectfully disagreeing with one another until you guys decided liberalism was a mortal sin.  See, even though I think you are thoroughly fucked up I don't want you to die and hope things work out for you.

       Liberalism is a means to a societal end. It’s a weapon, equisitley crafted to decay the host society at every level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the generations the host society becomes isolated and malleable. Having destroyed the town, the tribe, the family, and marriage there exists only the demoralized and ineffectual individual against the unlimited power of the state... itself a whore beholden only to the printers of fiat backing all things.

       Their children are rigorously trained to dominate, to cooperate, and to overcome all outside the group. Meanwhile yours are questioning their own gender/advocating their own destruction and are ideologically paralyzed.

       Of course it is. This is what Liberal elitism looks like. Stop trying to act "above it all" it's the greatest ruse of all. You basically ousted yourself from objectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look I don't hold any political party dear to my heart nor do I look to them for answers, but one thing is clear: Liberalism is a fucking cancer on this planet and on the hive-minds it infests and zombiefies. It's a destructive and unnatural force in humanity always going against the grain of instinct and survival. There's a reason its people are dying off-- natural selection is weeding them out of society, but it can't happen fast enough.

       Liberalism? This is what capitalism and free market looks like. Make no mistake they are a classic monopoly. They're also a corporation and as such have every right to control the content hosted on their servers. Ironically, liberal policies typically tens to want to regulate companies and put rules in place to prevent monopolies and anything that limits freedom of expression and speech. But that regulation is pushed back on tenfold by conservatives.

       But it is capitalism.. it is the free market.  A private business can do business with whoever they want.  YouTube can ban whoever they want from their platform.  They are privately owned.  That is free market.  Should we get a little communist and have the government take over YouTube and make them do business with people they don't want to do business with?
      </p>
      <p>
       What the fuck are conservatives waiting for?  Why aren't they developing their own video streaming service instead of relying on YouTube?  They want the benefit of YouTubes large user-base but then they want to complain when YouTube doesn't let them use their website (for free) to upload whatever they want to upload and make money off of it.  That's the sort of entitled attitude I'd expect from a libtard snowflake.. Not a free-market conservative.

       How is it cronyism?  Cronyism involves appointing friends or family to positions of power even if they aren't qualified.  What is going on at YouTube is 100% free market.  A private business is deciding who it wants to do business with unencumbered from force or influence from the government.

       Still proving my point, anyone who thinks either side is the solution doesn't understand at all how the world operates. Again both sides have the same goal, its just labeled and colored differently to catch as many people in its net as possible. Choice in politics is largely a marketing illusion. Again if the only thing your bringing to the table is political cheerleading, your still stuck in the designed path.

       Again, you don't have a point. I'm beginning to think this is going over your head. For one, you keep suggesting the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Still proving my point, anyone who thinks either side is the solution doesn't understand at all how the world operates.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yet I never once suggested anyone had the answer. I'm only suggesting that the left is inherently evil. But since you keep implying that I did, the onus is now on you to prove where you're getting these words in my mouth. Otherwise, since you can't, you've instantly forfeit the discussion because now we're all accepting that there's no basis for anything you're saying; rather, you're just vomiting out words that happen to form a basis for what you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to say, as opposed to what is appropriate or rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about choosing one side vs the other, this is about clearly identifying leftism for what it is: pure and corrupted authoritarian evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get it: You want to constantly remind everyone that you've fallen for the idea that you're immune to politics because you think it makes you high-minded. You keep trying to fly this flag that says, "I've ascended, I'm above it all." Yet you intentionally ignore truth, and so long as you ignore truth, you're no less of a useful idiot and pawn than the most hardcore idealogue. In fact, you
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       the "anyone" in your argument who "doesn't understand how the world operates."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you need to wise up.

       Of course you'd think that, your looking for superiority in a conversation &amp; thus a reason to dismiss what I'm saying. Never said I was immune to politics, or above it all. Simply that I don't fall into the notion that one side in more evil than another. Because again, the very idea that there is two side IS an illusion.

       Amazing that you literally contradict yourself in literally back to back sentences. Fucking incredible. Your type is recognizable from a mile away, and guess what, you're not above it all, you're just being suckered in a different way than everyone else. That makes you a bigger sucker.

      <p>
       Also, I'm not searching for anything I already possess. For the 3rd time, we all get what you're trying to say, and you only responded in the first place because that's your gambit -- you want to say that 24/7 and let everyone know you're "above it all." You're falling for a sham too, which is what's funny about it. Your illusion of reality has caused you to ignore obvious truths, and therefore as a consequence, you cannot be aligned with truth either.

       You've been duped.

       The left and right as political parties are both corrupt in their own ways and right down to their own individual-member basis, but they're certainly mutually exclusive. The left as an
       <em>
        ideology
       </em>
       is corrupt and degenerate. It has nothing to do with fucking politics. Get that stupid shit out of your head. It's about a way-of-thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leftist ideology is rooted in evil. Satan himself appears as an angel of light, a most handsome man with great charm. It's that simple.

       Liberalism is the power for Google to remove what they want.

      <p>
       But their choice is not controlled by liberalism... so whose agenda is being forced through via Google? Maybe anonymous totalitarian leftists are mobilizing advertisers against media giants... which is pretty much the actions taken by

       implying that both sides of politics aren't heavily brainwashed? lol the two party system in its current state is nothing more than a method to divide this countries people against each other and it works like a charm. People choose a color like a sports team, blame everything on the other side, and like planned, nothing is ever accomplished for the better.

       I don't know anything about these channels their creators or their content so this list means nothing. maybe they are breaking the rules of youtube? I am not standing up for censorship but I don't have all the details so maybe they were distributing child porn for all I know and you are just trying to paint youtube as a bad guy for censoring things. why are these channels being banned? what is the message that youtube is censoring? why would they risk losing viewers unless their was a legit reason? I need more details.

       I don't know what all of these channels are but I do know a lot of them, and they are about conspiracy theories and spritual/esoteric/occult topics. A lot of them have been targeted by youtube for awhile and received warnings and getting their videos demonitized for no legitimate reason, and are also not given answers to why their channels are getting shut down.

       This is purely censorship of alternative viewpoints.

       I don't mean liars, I mean channels about the thousands of other topics outside of news and current events and world afairs. I'm wondering if any gaming, craft, hobby, ect channels are being shut down. I know a lot of music/movie review channels often get shut down over complaints about copyright, even when they should be protected under fair use. What I'm wondering is if this censorship sweep is specifically targeting conspiracy channels or if it is across all different topics.

       Exactly. Wondering if the terms of service/rules are being applied fairly and uniformly. Supposedly, a lot of the channels were shut down over "bullying." Curious to know if it's one-sided, or if it's being applied fairly to all channels.

       they are not insinuations. please take note of the ? after each line indicating a question. seriously these channels could be for all anyone knows banned for good reasons. these channels could be absolutely just names you made up on the spot. how would I know? tell me more don't just start hating me out for being curious. what are your intentions? to inform and educate people about an issue or to push an agenda? don't stifle my curiosity.

       These are largely alternative political and health channels. Most relate to some kind of conspiracy or taboo subjects. But they aren't advocating violence or putting peoples lives at risk or anything like that. Many got banned for posting Florida shooting or  David Hogg related material suggesting some of the kids who came on T.V. were actors or coached to push an anti-gun agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       My intentions are to make people aware of the lengths YouTube is going to censor alternative viewpoints, hopefully promoting discussion about a move to more freedom oriented platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to put the names of these creators out there so that people can try to find their work on other platforms and decide for themselves if they like the material rather than having YouTube make that decision for them.

       don't tell me to stop talking about things I don't know about. I have already told you I don't know and im curious. if you don't know how do you learn? you fucking ask questions you twat. you are not bringing about awareness or promoting things by telling people who want to learn to be quiet.

       excuse my skepticism. the post was front page and often times front page of this sub has been put there for a reason. and the content of this post lacked any information other than exactly a list of names. anyway I am pretty over this whole topic. youtube is compromised, reddit is compromised, the internet is not free information for the people by the people it is all pushed propaganda. to no ones surprise at all youtube is censoring channels that give information that conflicts with TPTB. good game.

       I believe you can download all Richie Allen's broadcasts from his website.  I just learned how to do this today, because there's so many more I want to hear.  The format is longer though.  (I love his show which I originally found out about on this sub.)

       Yeah its an option but YouTube is the go-to place for most people to watch videos. And its concerning that YouTube would just pull peoples channels out from under them considering they didn't really do anything crazy and they spent all that time and effort building their subscriber base.

       Censorship is still bad when a business does it. Just like if some shitty food company selling shit food is bad.

      <p>
       People aren't calling for regulation  by merely pointing out bull shit unwarranted business practices. You call it out and hopefully the market shifts to better alternatives.

       I think its time to go report all of CNN, NBC etc videos and try to get them flagged.
      </p>
      <p>
       If their reporting and banning features include special protections for shithead MSM stuff, it would be an easy way to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just imagine if everyone subscribed to this subreddit went and flagged CNNs videos as spam or misleading all at once.

       Hey I discovered reallygraceful recently on youtube and ive seen its not on your list, just yesterday i watch a great video she did on the rothschilds that was already flagged. I think you should add it to the list, is a great channel.

       Call for an Uprising apparently has two strikes last I heard, not sure how or if possible for users to check a community strike amount. Though creator did post videos talking bout such on being striked with videos he already deleted.

       they are not insinuations. please take note of the ? after each line indicating a question. seriously these channels could be for all anyone knows banned for good reasons. these channels could be absolutely just names you made up on the spot. how would I know? tell me more don't just start hating me out for being curious. what are your intentions? to inform and educate people about an issue or to push an agenda? don't stifle my curiosity.
