        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings, </p>

<p>Many individuals of this subreddit are already well aware of the corrupting within our media and social networks. Truth tellers are being silenced on multiple platforms meanwhile it&#39;s difficult for creators to make any money if they are not supported by one of a few platforms. Professor Marshall McLuhan, a media theoriest of the 60s era predicted that world war three was going to be a media war with no division between civilian and military participation. If we take a look what is happening today, the fake news, the astroturfing, the division within people, I think this time has come. </p>

<p>Many months ago myself and a few other conspiracy theorist set sail to create a platform that would be a &quot;Reddit&quot; killer. After extensive research, speaking with creators, and going through all the issues we decided to go MUCH bigger. We&#39;re now building a media platform that&#39;s similar to a cross between Youtube and Medium. A platform that will allow creators of all formats, movies, TV, news, music, articles, whatever to be able to create a hub for themselves and their contents. We&#39;re also building in networking abilities that will allow creators to collaborate with others and to build actual &quot;Networks&quot;, &quot;Labels&quot;, etc for the digital age. </p>

<p>Distribution and monetization are the two biggest areas of importance for creators. We&#39;re building our app to port to everything, Web, mobile, smart TV, roku, etc. In the same note we&#39;re building monetization programs that allow creators to fully customize how they make money in an open &amp; transperent manner. </p>

<p>The worst part about these big platforms is they tend to become corrupted by the profits they reap. Instead of that we&#39;re building an entity that takes 90% of the profits and invests in back into the creators, product, and users in an open and transperent way facilitated by a blockchain protocol. </p>

<p>With all that being said we didn&#39;t want to advertise on conspiracy, but we&#39;re looking for more individuals to assist with the progession of the platform. We already have a team of 7 very experienced individuals in the startup world and just recently had a verbal commitment for funding. </p>

<p>We have a ton of documentation on the venture, and the experience to back it up. We&#39;re seeking individauls who just want to help or might actually like to be part of the team. We&#39;re not recruiting slave labour either...We&#39;re targeting people who could be community manager, engineers, growth hackers for this product because they have a passion for solving the issues. It&#39;s very difficult to recruit people who care about the same issues hence this post here. I feel like these times call for us to actually do something about our situation. Is media a problem or is it the people who control it? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in anyway please feel free to contract me and I can provide more info. </p>

<p>I believe both back up all posts and comments to a blockchain system rendering posts &quot;undeletable&quot;.... also people can get paid in cryptocurrency for their posts. Take a look at em if ya haven&#39;t already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen Bitchute, but I have huge probelms with Steemit. </p>

<p>A) This token release was very sketch. </p>

<p>B) The token system in place just allows users to tip other users with the token. But they are tied directly to value services on the platform so the economics will never work out for the long term. Just as long as crypto is being pumped. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll take a look at Bitchute, but many of the crypto companies don&#39;t have realistic models behind them. Simply pump and dumps.</p>

<p>Steemit sucks, it&#39;s worse than Reddit IMO. The coin will crash in 1-2 years because the voting on content sucks. The voting is shitty and so is the pay out. Seriously not worth the time of day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminder that the VERY FIRST post on Reddit was a conspiracy post! It was a link to the downing street memo.</p>

<p>Reddit was created as a vehicle for openness, collaboration, and free speech. It&#39;s little wonder why it&#39;s been scooped up and co-opted by corrupt media organizations, moderated to the point of blatant censorship, and shilled to oblivion.</p>

<p>What we need is decentralization. Its inevitable that a new platform will fall under attack in its infant stages. Look what happened to voat. First it was DDOS&#39;d to shit, corrupt reddit mods rushed in to create subverses and squat on them to establish their network of control, then it started getting spammed with borderline child porn and racist content.</p>

<p>So far nobody has found a way to solve the problems we see on reddit. We can&#39;t let small groups of people control the content, but at the same time we don&#39;t want it getting littered with child porn. What&#39;s the solution?</p>

<p>As far as monetization, we need smart contracts and crypto. If we are going to do this, we are going to have to stick up a middle finger at all forms of government control. It has to beat censorship, and it has to beat financial crackdowns. </p>

<p>P2P and smart contracts may be the only way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know some people who were involved in a similar venture a few years ago. They actually launched their product, and were almost instantly sued into oblivion by movie studios and other businesses whose current revenue streams would be adversely affected by their platform taking off. The reason YouTube made it is because Google had deep pockets and could withstand all the frivolous litigation. With all my heart I hope you can make your platform work because society desperately needs this. It was devastating for my friends to have to pull the plug on all their hard work simply because they were too small to fight &quot;the system.&quot; Good luck!</p>

<p>Your method in &quot;porting to everything&quot; is ideal to challenge youtube/facebook etc. Is this a difficult task? Would starting with a core/mobile save resources to begin with or not much difference?</p>
