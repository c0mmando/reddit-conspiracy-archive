        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Clinton campaign and main stream media were literally so sure that she would win the election up until the last minute. The &#39;polls&#39; showed her winning by a large majority leading up to the election.  Clearly, the American people did not want her as president.  Millions of people do not share the liberal views of her party.  Where can the people who voted for Trump and are trying to support his presidency go for facts?  I only see &#39;the_donald&#39; here on Reddit.  Seems that a country known for it&#39;s freedom is hugely responsible for propaganda.  The msm is an echo chamber.  I find it hard to believe &#39;Russia&#39; was responsible for the American voter&#39;s choice, especially seeing how these American companies are following the msm narrative.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is so frustrating to keep hearing the msm dig at Trump every single day, and the liberals on my social media parrot everything.  I have an open mind, and have and will cross party lines for the right candidate.  It seems that no matter what Trump does, it is wrong.  I like what he is trying to do, and in fact much of it NEEDS to get done.  Other leaders have tried to limit illegal immigration and were not called &#39;racist.&#39;  Just one example of how skewed the view is on msm.  But you already know that!  Will check those sites out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll be perfectly honestly with you. You’re not going to find the fact in any one place. Whenever something “huge” breaks on the front page I typically come here, to r/conspiracy first, and see what everyone is saying. It keeps me skeptical and I feel like is generally a good place to start gathering information to look at. Then I just check out the various news sights (whichever you prefer) and try to pick apart everything I read/see for some semblance of truth. </p>

<p>With the 24/7 news cycle pushing anything and everything for views it’s hard to really find the truth in any of it but just know that the truth is out there and sometimes it even comes from the MSM, but you really need to read between the lines and check out <em>everything</em> they ran for the day, not just the top headlines. When something big happens there’s usually something even bigger happening behind the scenes that doesn’t make the front page. Those are the stories you need to be chasing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don’t want us talking because they don’t see our points of view as valid. I don’t think TD or this sub will leave any time soon because there’s a pretty active user base for both subs and realistically TD is something that most other subs can point to as the bad guy. It’s too easy to keep it around so they won’t get rid of it. Plus it keeps all the “crazies” in one little known spot so they don’t need to “worry” about them. I’ve personally never been to TD because I’ve heard pretty bad things about it but I feel like everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I think it’s good that like minded people have an outlet to express themselves without having to worry about being shut down and shit on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason this has been such a big deal lately is most of the people getting in trouble that I have seen were talking about David Hogg, who is a fucking kid. If you want to add adults into a conspiracy theory then fine. Just don&#39;t put kids into it. The &quot;Theory&quot; part of this is always my main concern when kids are involved. Just because you think a kid is a plant, fed, crisis actor etc... doesn&#39;t make it true. If you are wrong, you have put a target on the kids back. Once the guy showed up at CPP with a gun, I think that these sites have taken a stand on what they will allow on their sites</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole Facebook, Youtube, and Google censorship fascinates me. </p>

<p>They have an absolute right to censor anything they want. They are a private company, and as such can operate however they like. I&#39;m a believer in the Constitution, as well as the free market. Eventually a competitor will appear that will either cater to those of a different view or provide a truly censorship-free outlet. </p>

<pre><code>That said, I find it extremely laughable that liberals are pointing to this fact, while simultaneously trying to stifle free speech in public schools, forcing companies to offer services or operate contrary to their beliefs (Gay Wedding Cakes), and calling everyone that disagrees with them as Nazis. 
</code></pre>

<p>Further, &quot;hate speech&quot; is still protected speech. This was reaffirmed as recently as June 19th, 2017, in which the Supreme Court UNANIMOUSLY ruled that hate speech is still free speech. </p>

<p><a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/laurettabrown/2017/06/19/supreme-court-unanimously-reaffirms-hate-speech-is-still-free-speech-n2343286">https://townhall.com/tipsheet/laurettabrown/2017/06/19/supreme-court-unanimously-reaffirms-hate-speech-is-still-free-speech-n2343286</a></p>

<pre><code>(Yes, I know the source, but the decision is the decision, no matter who is reporting it) 

So what is the solution? Conservatives need to stop whining about censorship and understand Freedom of Speech a little better. Liberals need to understand Freedom of Speech a little better as well and understand that they CAN&#39;T censor private businesses or speech they simply don&#39;t like. 

If we censor speech that we simply didn&#39;t like because it hurt our feelings, we don&#39;t have a society.

In case of an emergency or some other tumultuous event, they provide critical communication services that cannot be found anywhere else.

<p>The &#39;polls&#39; showed her winning by a large majority leading up to the election</p>

<p>The polls have been wrong, and that wrong, before. Like where Trump won the primary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the American people did not want her as president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She won the popular vote by 3 million votes. THREE MILLION. If each of those voters gave you $1, you would never have to work again. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where can the people who voted for Trump and are trying to support his presidency go for facts? I only see &#39;the_donald&#39; here on Reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TD is a hugely censored, anti-free speech forum. Dissent is not tolerated, nor is discussion. It&#39;s pretty much the definition of echo chamber. See the recent outcry over Trump&#39;s anti 2A comments. Many long time Trump supporters were banned and silenced.</p>

<p>I think only <a href="/r/Bitcoin">/r/Bitcoin</a> is worse for censorship.</p>

It only fuels the pro-Trump voters and others who happen upon the unfairness of it all, especially the Bernie voters.

<p>So, California has 39.54 million people living in it. A little over 12% of the US population total.</p>

<p>First of all, they will never single handedly elect the president. Second, why should their views be discounted just because they live in a dense environment? There is a lot of diverse cultures and views in California it is a huge state.</p>

<p>Bull. How does this system support Republican voters in California or New York? There is basically no incentive or reason for them to vote.</p>

<p>First, no this isn&#39;t true. What do you mean until the DNC cut him loose? They didn&#39;t cut him loose. The things the DNC did against Bernie were through the Media pushing that Bernie had less delegates and it was all over (super delegates). Also, potentially there was help with debate questions. However, the same thing happened with delegates to Obama and he overcame it.</p>

<p>The Clinton campaign and main stream media were literally so sure that she would win the election up until the last minute. </p>

<p>Then the Russians compromised the voting systems in at least 7 states. MSM was spot on with the exit polls. None of them accounted for an enemy messing with our elections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, Bernie had WAY more support than Clinton until the DNC cut him loose.  He was hugely popular.  So &#39;people&#39; did NOT think Bernie was too far left.  He is who they wanted for president.  It seems you are ok with the DNC doing your thinking for you.  How is that working out?</p>
