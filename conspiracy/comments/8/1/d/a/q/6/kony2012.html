       So I was talking to a friend and we started remembering how this video went suspiciously viral and after it, the creator was seen on TMZ naked and speaking non sense? Does anyone have more information on the subject or an explanation for the abnormal behaviour?

       From my understanding Kony2012 was complete bs.95 percent of the money raised wasn't donated don't quote me on the exact percentage but it was a very high number.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2012 Kony and his army were practically non existant I even remember watching a couple youtube videos consisting of people living in the region saying he was dead or gone at the time this "charity" exploded and went viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also after this went viral Obama decided to send troops to take care of Kony even though locals said his threat to them was no longer and funny enough at this exact same time news came about that the location Kony was in they found lots of oil and natural resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       So pretty much it was distract with some bullshit story as an excuse to go in and get take shit. Obama was praised for getting involved even though no one ever(msm) touched this story again until of course the guy went crazy running naked in the streets. Mkultra gone wrong maybe?

       His people came to my school and held an assembly where they presented kony 2012 to the whole school. Wtf was that? I didnâ€™t even question it during the moment but now that I think about it today something is really just off about that whole thing.

       That happened at my high school too, like 3-4 people who worked with the guy in San Diego came to talk about Kony2012 for an hour or so. It was after the naked incident too, and they said it was because the stress got to him or something like that.

       Thanks for the elaborate answer!

       It would be hilarious if he was already dead and was used just for the video, kind of remains me of Bin Laden hehe

       And yes, the naked thing was very strange and isolated, I think I heard somewhere that it was dehydration, but c'mon....

       "Its overall revenue for the year, made up from various sources including the Kony 2012 campaign, was $31.94 million. Its total expenses were $15.98 million. Of that, the company spent 81.48 per cent on "media, mobilisation, protection and recovery", according to the report.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 35 per cent was spent on "mobilisation", about 9 per cent on media, 10 per cent on protection, and 27 per cent on recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest increase in expenses was for mobilisation, which includes film tours and music tours, international events and advocacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The report also shows that almost all revenue raised by Invisible Children in the 2012 financial year was unrestricted, that is the funds could be spent on anything rather than just the program which generated the funds.

        Corbett Report actually did an episode on this.
       </a>

      <p>
       From the transcript:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These worst fears of Ugandans were lent further credence late last year, when President Obama announced he would be deploying US troops on the ground in Uganda, ostensibly to help capture Joseph Kony, the charismatic leader of a small rebel force that has been accused of murders, rapes and kidnaps in Uganda for decades. The timing of the deployment, however, coming at the exact same time as accusations that some of the highest officials in the Ugandan government were guilty of accepting bribes from international oil companies, only further confirmed that the deployment had less to do with Kony, an elusive figure who in fact left Uganda six years ago, and more to do with the securing of American oil interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        For years, American interests in Africa have been increasingly threatened by China, the resource-hungry fast-growing second-largest economy in the world. America and its allies have noted with increasing dismay Chinaâ€™s growing economic cooperation with Africa, including its vast investment in the infrastructure for oil exploration, drilling and transportation in countries like Libya and Sudan. In recent years, China has been building up its relations with Uganda, and just last month the newly-appointed Chinese ambassador to Uganda, Zhao Yali, announced a series of measures to increase ties with the soon-to-be oil-rich African nation, including the granting of tariff free exports, and investments in transportation projects, power plants, and infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        But now, just as China makes its overtures toward Uganda to gain a potential toehold in the region and access to the as-yet-untapped oil wealth, a new video about Joseph Kony has suddenly gone viral online, having been viewed 10s of millions of times in just a week, and changing the focus of the American foreign policy debate toward greater US military involvement in oil-rich Uganda. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it suggests that the only way to capture Kony is to maintain an American military presence in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It wasnâ€™t long before Ugandans themselves took to social media to try to inject their own voice into the debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        But such words of caution have fallen on the deaf ears of a public who believe that the problem of Kony is a simple one requiring an equally simple solution: more American troops. Just this week, a new bill was introduced in Congress that would see an expansion in regional forces in Africa.
       </p>
       <p>
        What the filmâ€™s well-meaning supporters, many of them youth activists rallying behind a political cause for the first time, donâ€™t realize, is that the Kony film, whether wittingly or not, is accomplishing what years of Pentagon propaganda could not muster: public support for an expanded American military role in Africa.

       It was just another trendy psuedo-activist bullshit event to make people who pretend to be aware of the world feel better when they post about it on facebook. You know, the "thoughts &amp; prayers" types. It was especially funny because Kony had likely been dead or inactive for a decade at that point, but lo and behold, Obama sent troops to find him.

       You know what was strange - that youtube video starts out saying that it's going to be a social experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone jumped on the bandwagon and starting sharing that video on social media (facebook and what not).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm convinced it was an experiment to see if the "masses" aka sheeple would jump on something just because it was trendy to do so. Which obviously was true since everyone started sharing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it was a social experiment. They now know that the sheeple will share/promote things just because everyone else is doing it. Do you think people actually cared? No.

       I lived in DR Congo when Kony2012 came out, near the large forest the LRA operated out of and to the people there the fear was very real and the threat actual. In fact there was a constant hunger because people were afraid to farm as many were abducted near the edge of the villages. Met a lot of kids who escaped the LRA.
      </p>
      <p>
       keep in mind these are villages so remote in the most underdeveloped nation in the world who have never heard of youtube or have electricity. It might as well be the 1800s there. Not surprising much news didn't get around. But the threat is absolutely real, and the toll on people in S Sudan and Congo is sadly great.

       I don't say the threat isn't real, but there are a lot more countries with issues, Kony2012 served a purpose of greedy interests by oligarchs.

       Is like saying Iran is terrible and stuck in the past but at the same time praise Saudi Arabia cause they are letting in 2018 women drive, and the thing is, people do it without any thought cause the media says so.

       I think I get you. In this case though the LRA had been kidnapping kids since the 80s, so from what I saw the new interested afterward from journalists that trickled into town was certainly better than him going another 20 years out of the spotlight. But yeah I hear you.
