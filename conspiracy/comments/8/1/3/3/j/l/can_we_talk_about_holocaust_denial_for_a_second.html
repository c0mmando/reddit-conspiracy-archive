        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Disclaimer: I am not a racist, antisemite, I don&#39;t hate Jews and this topic is pretty new for me, I only recently started really looking into it recently. My political leanings would be considered pretty &#39;far left &amp; liberal&#39; by my peers, so I don&#39;t believe I fall under the category of neo-nazi.</strong> </p>

<p>I recently started looking into Holocaust denial and was shocked to find that people would deny something so mainstream and what I thought was &#39;well documented&#39;.</p>

<p>My interest peaked after watching the movie &#39;Denial&#39; which lead me on to look up and research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving">David Irving</a>. WOW were my eyes opened!</p>

<p>I&#39;m inclined to believe what Mr Irving has to say, after listening and keeping an open mind and through some self-study I 100% do think that the Holocaust has at best, been exaggerated and at worst, is a complete and utter lie and nothing like what we&#39;re taught via our mainstream historians.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m still trying to keep an open mind on this BUT I was wondering has anyone else looked into this, what are your thoughts?</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to hearing all sides.</p>

<p>I find it odd that if you look on any YouTube video that tries to discredit Holocause deniers the comments section is always TURNED OFF silencing any debate or counter argument.</p>

<p>I always find it interesting as well that every TV interview David Irving has done with mainstream channels BBC, Channel 4 etc he&#39;s always mocked, disrespected and never interviewed with an unbiased attitude, heck the reporters just slate into him and call him a liar to his face without even listening to what he has to say. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1eV2Ufpy1M">Example here</a> again, interestingly, the comments on these videos are always turned off.</p>

<p>Also, Deborah Lipstadt the person who won in court against David Irving calling him a liar and falsifier of history, in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgPLG_1BvQo">Ted X talk</a>, rather than intelligently dismissing his claims and trying to give credible counter-arguments she just outright resorts to name calling refering to Mr Irving as a liar, wolf in sheep skin clothing etc etc and again, no surprise, comments turned off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting topic and don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not entirely won over yet by the Holocause deniers, what I find interesting is that this is the one topic where places will ban you, stop discussion heck in Germany you can even go to prison for denying the hollocaust.</p>

<p>That type of strict censorship is a HUGE red flag to me.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t think Hitler was a saintly good guy, I do believe that Jews were killed and mistreated in WW2, I just think that the official narrative may not be as black and white as we think it is and there&#39;s a good chance that what we do know has been highly exxagerated.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, the victors get to write the history books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we were on the wrong side of a war, and let a nefarious, and powerful group of people who had nearly complete control of the media dictate the narrative, and the actions against a country that was at was at war with that organization.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t get what they wanted Balfour Declaration from WW1 that the British government promised them, and orchestrated WW2 because a country that they hated picked itself up off the floor and rebuilt itself into a great country.</p>

<p>WW2 was fueled by hatred, and jealousy because they thought they had Germany in the bag, but were kicked out because of their sick, and perverted nature.</p>

<p>The work camps only got really bad when ALL the food ran out in Germany because the allies bombed the supply lines. Conditions outside the camps were just as bad as within the camps, maybe worse because the Red cross delivered food to the camps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In November 1943, the Red Cross received permission from Nazi German authorities to send Red Cross parcels to inmates of concentration camps, but only to those whose names and specific locations were known. By May 1945, 105,000 specific individuals had been identified. About 1,112,000 parcels containing 4,500 tons of food were ultimately sent to the camps,[31] including those at Dachau, Buchenwald, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. In addition to food, these parcels also contained clothing and pharmaceutical items.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My Uncle is still alive but remembers nothing from the experience. So he has never had much to say about it. </p>

<p>This may be a whole other conspiracy all-together, but I think it has something to do with &quot;Generational Trauma&quot; </p>

<p>For some reason the Polish Community doesn&#39;t really partake in it. But a lot of other groups do. </p>

<p>I have a lot of relatives here in the US, and some still living in Poland. And I have never once in my 40 some years every heard any of them ever blame WWII, Germans, Concentration Camps, or anything on any of their hardships or failures. Frankly, it never even comes up, and if it does in some very rare cases, it&#39;s either a off-colored joke or just a fact that is part of a story (but not any defining part of the story). </p>

<p>But other groups will very quickly take their young children to museums to <em>show</em> them the injustices that happened to their ancestors, they will continue the pain and suffering of their ancestors, and even straight up <em>put</em> that pain on their kids. </p>

<p>I have no idea how that helps the kids, or why the parents and the community make the kids witness that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to <em>know</em> history. It&#39;s another thing to force a child to define <em>their</em> life by the injustices done to their ancestors. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Sorry if this sounds scatterbrained. I just know that if I got into the &quot;Oppressed victim Olympics&quot; with my friends I could easily get the Silver. But it was just never part of my family or my community to &quot;care&quot; what happened in the past. So it&#39;s very confusing to me when people use their ancestors past to make any claim about their personal situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, thanks for the input.</p>

<p>I think the result of &quot;forcing a child to define their life by injustices done to their ancestors&quot; creates the situation we have in Israel today, where they are commiting a similar injustice that they claim was done to them in Germany. They justify the pain they are causing today by pulling the &quot;victim card&quot; from the past. Regardless of the truth in it.  </p>

<p>Even if there is truth in it I still think it&#39;s a bad idea. Look at blacks in the US. There is 100% truth in the fact that many of their ancestors were slaves. But you cannot blame every problem with your life and your community on a <em>real</em> thing that happened 150 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because in both scenarios you are blaming people who literally had nothing to do with it, as well as keeping the same hate alive by holding the grudge. </p>

<p>Holding grudges, whether during your day, or through the generations is never the right choice. Regardless of religion or doctrine, this is proof to me that the only way to truly kill the cycle of hate is forgiveness and is always a better choice in every scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost see it on a deeper level than that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s less about the knowledge or the &quot;grudge&quot; and more about literally making children experience the same trauma as their ancestors and then use that trauma as a means to identify themselves. </p>

<p>There is no reason to <em>not</em> tell little black kids about slavery, or little Polish kids about the holocaust. That is fine. </p>

<p>But to indoctrinate them with the ideology of oppression and victim-hood that they themselves have never experienced is wrong. And not only that, but then have them self-identify and define their life and purpose based on injustice that never actually happened to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t say that word for word, but there is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must “vanish” before the state of Israel can be formed. “You shall return minus 6 million.” That’s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the “6 million” is an attempt to transform the Holocaust story into state religion. Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in “burning ovens”, which the judicial version of the Holocaust now authenticates. As a matter of fact, Robert B. Goldmann writes: “. . . without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.” A simple consequence: Given six million Jews gassed at Auschwitz who ended up in the “burning ovens” (the Greek word holocaust means burned offerings), therefore, the prophecies have now been “fulfilled” and Israel can become a “legitimate state”.</p>

<p>Regarding the ‘six million’ number you should know the following: In the Hebrew text of the Torah prophesies, one can read “you shall return”. In the text the letter “V” or “VAU” is absent, as Hebrew does not have any numbers; the letter V stands for the number 6. Ben Weintraub, a religious scientist, learned from rabbis that the meaning of the missing letter means the number is ’6 million’. The prophesy then reads: You will return, but with 6 million less. See Ben Weintraub: “The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism”, Cosmo Publishing, Washington 1995, page 3. The missing 6 million must be so before the Jews can return to the Promised Land. Jahweh sees this as a cleaning of the souls of the sinful people. The Jews must, on the return to the Promised Land, be clean — the cleaning shall be done in burning stokes.</p>

Most are dead, but I believe what they bore witness to and I am disgusted with anyone lobbying for a painting over of the horror.  Victors right the history?  These were people I knew bearing witness with their very lives. It wasn’t history to them. It was the saddest, darkest part of their lives. I will not let their truth be dimmed. I am sixty, many people who were touched by WW2 were still very much alive and working when I was young.  I was a good listener, as I respected most of my elders, and they deserved that respect.

    <div class="md"><p>With the utmost respect to you I think your personal feelings and relations are clouding your views on the topic and I understand especially for the older generation that this is a very emotive and upsetting topic.</p>

<p>As I stated, I think it&#39;s undeniable that the attrocities were commited, labour camps were no good place to be and nobody would like to live and work in forced labour situations.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is I think the events were hugely exaggerated and I think there is ample evidence to show that not as many peopled died as suggested. The official numbers have been changed several times.</p>

<p>As others have pointed out there&#39;s other things such as the gas chambers having no holes in the roof, even to this day the rubble that is left from the gas chambers at auschwitz the roof that is still there has no holes which would have been needed to drop the gas into the columns that were apart of the building.</p>

<p>Not to mention that if your loved ones were being mass murdered around you, why would people not try and revolt in mass, I mean chances are you&#39;re going to die anyway?</p>

<p>If genocide was the plan all along why play silly games sparing some and not others why not just kill each and every jew possible. </p>

<p>If Nazi&#39;s would gas jews why didn&#39;t he use Chemical gas on the battlefield?</p>

<p>My aim isn&#39;t to cause offence but this is the very thing that makes it so difficult to believe the official narrative, people are so emotive over this subject that it has become tabboo, you&#39;re not even allowed to air questions and concerns about what happened because people claim you&#39;re racist, antisematic or are disrespecting those who fought and lost their lives.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m right, I will never know, I just think unless you&#39;re speaking from FIRST hand experience then third party stories are always going to be very, very biased.</p>

<p>Hitler wasn&#39;t a dictator, it was a Democracy, he can&#39;t have been PURE EVIL as many voted him into power. Things aren&#39;t as clear cut and there&#39;s always a different story this is what I meant by the victors right the history books.</p>

<p>I could be wrong but rather than people giving me credible counter arguments I&#39;m either dismissed and called a nazi or I&#39;m told that I&#39;ve offended them because they have a grandparent that was in a camp or their friend had a family member etc etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sympathetic towards everyones personal woes and there would have been just as many german citizens who were casualties of misfortune and dispair in the war, I sympathise all around BUT rather than people trying to guilt trip me my mind is much more likely to be changed by genuine, thought provoking, intelligent counter arguments and debate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m yet to hear any credible responses that counter the arguments above or of what David Irving has put forward.</p>

<p>Enlighten me, that may be the case if I&#39;m ignorant of something by the very definition that&#39;s often unintentional and unless you let me know what I&#39;m ignorant of then I shall never be any the wiser.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not claiming Hitler was a good person or even a leader for that matter, he had many flaws and did many wrong things, some of those things may be considered &#39;evil&#39; however PURE EVIL is a very strong statement to make and I fear people throw that phrase out due to misinformation and education which this whole discussion is based upon.</p>

<p>There are many other people who are more deserving of the title of being pure evil if we&#39;re basing it on FACTUAL HISTORY that is indisputable. </p>

<p>Regardless of your opinion and views on Hitler and this topic in general, I often look to the quote by Jacque Fresco - There are no good or bad people, humans are shaped by culture and circumstance. While I think there are universal evil and wrong that speaks to our very human nature, I still think this quote/notion holds a lot of truth....

<p>Germany <em>was</em> a democracy until about 3 months after the Nazi party took power (the Weimar Republic). </p>

<p>So Hitler was actually voted in democratically.. but then things started going badly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill make it real simple for you. You should be able to deduce my opinion.</p>

<p>You are Hitler. You are fighting a war and need munitions you can enslave jews to work for you pay them nothing barley feed them and work them to death. Or you can spend money to build gas chambers and have to move dead bodies and still dispose of them. I mean mass grave shoot throw burn save time and money. What would you do?</p>

<p>How many jews died? if you do the math how many Jews would be killed per day every day for 4+ years?</p>

<p>What gas did gas chambers use?</p>

<p>How does that Gas function when Airborne?</p>

<p>How did holocaust survivors say they removed the bodies?</p>

<p>For me I think the world needed a reason to create Isreal due to self-fulfilling prophecy. So they took an opportunistic situation and created a monster grandeur then he was.</p>

<p>Now the other question is.</p>

<p>If Nazi&#39;s would gas jews why didn&#39;t he use Chemical gas on the battlefield?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to address all of your points.</p>

<p>1: NAZI LEADER #1 lost the war. There were quite a few military leadership blunders that contributed to their defeat. Whether or not a Nazi victory could have been possible if these blunders were avoided is a debate for historians I will not touch. Prioritizing industrial capacity to murder part of the work force was one such blunder.</p>

<p>2: There is a significant psychological difference between ordering a person killed and personally pulling the trigger. They did try shooting them but the soldiers who witnessed this suffered severe psychological trauma. Himmler himself struggled to personally oversee these executions despite being the architect of the final solution. They couldn&#39;t exactly give the prisoners guns to shoot themselves. It was much easier to just round the prisoners into a room, pull a lever that kills them all but leaves you unable to personally observe what happens in the room and having other prisoners burns the bodies prevents you from seeing the corpses. This made the gas chamber method much more efficient in carrying out mass murder.</p>

<p>3: Millions of jews died though only a fraction of that would have been at Auschwitz via gas. A lot of other undesirables according to Aryan philosophy where also killed but jews were the largest minority group so they&#39;re the prime citation of groups killed. How these numbers are found is well documented and there isn&#39;t much reason to suspect something malicious in the methodology.</p>

<p>4: The gas chambers used Zyklon B. This is well documented.</p>

<p>5: Zyklon B was a pesticide. Fumigating a room to sterilize it of life isn&#39;t difficult to do. A lethal concentration of the gas was pumped into a room.</p>

<p>6: Bodies were removed after the concentration of gas in the room dropped below lethal levels. Airing out a gassy room isn&#39;t difficult. The architecture of the gas chambers is well documented and the mechanism for deliverying/removing gas is part of the documentaton.</p>

<p>And lastly</p>

<p>7: Engaging in chemical warfare is incredibly different from executing people in an enclosed space with gas. Germany used gas during WWI and the catastrophic effects it had are well documented. It was bad enough that all sides mutually agreed to not use gas in warfare. Hitler himself was a victim of gas attack and he was personally opposed to using chemical warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number one maybe Nazi leader may have lost the war but he also was very smart and efficient I mean he took a country that was in Ruins and was severely handicapped after fighting a World War and yet managed to build it up to do another fight against the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>Listen they had soldiers that would have felt nothing to shoot people okay my family were in concentration camps and some of the things some of the SS soldiers did just to torture people would make you throw up so if they have people that can watch people hang on a hook off their shoulder blades for hours upon hours while they&#39;re eating and drinking and making jokes those same soldiers would have no problem putting a bullet in someone&#39;s head. Unless you think the psychological trauma of watching someone being tortured screaming in agony while you&#39;re eating and joking around is less than putting a bullet in the head of someone.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also there are sociopaths and Psychopaths so really all you would need is a few of those to do all the killing and they wouldn&#39;t have no issues because they don&#39;t feel emotions.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s say they did have psychological trauma so why not put a bunch of people on a train and then have the train leave and then just light the whole train on fire and let them burn to death so you just saved a lot more time and then you can make the tracks go into a ditch and then you just push the train tracks into a ditch after they&#39;ve all burn to the ground there you go and even easier solution save more money than having to create a chamber and then having to create gas for the chamber and then having to use people to remove bodies from the chamber and then having to dig Mass Graves for those bodies.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I had family in Auschwitz none of them ever saw gas chambers.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes now go read about what happens when zyklon B is in a confined area and it&#39;s airborne and then go read  what kind of process is needed to fully remove the chemical contaminant because ventilations great but the chemicals still in the walls it&#39;s still on the bodies then go read about what would happen if a human being walked into a room that had people&#39;s bodies doused in that chemical and how their body would react after it came into some sort of contact.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And I asked you how did they remove the bodies</p>

<ol>
<li>So Hitler was opposed to using chemical warfare but he wasn&#39;t opposed to using chemical warfare on prisoners now if somebody wants to take over the world and they have no problem using chemical weapons to kill people why wouldn&#39;t they use chemical weapons to fight I mean imagine how much different World War II would be if on a windy day a German plane just dropped a chemical bomb in Britain somewhere and then let the wind spread and kill everybody and they just did that everyday instead of doing bombing runs they would do chemical runs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like I&#39;m sorry but they don&#39;t care about killing people because of dropping bombs on them but now you&#39;re telling me that they care enough to not use a chemical weapon because it&#39;ll hurt them too much even though they&#39;re using chemical weapons to kill people in their concentration camps so you want to believe me that they&#39;re morally against using chemical weapons in War but they&#39;re okay with killing people in war and they&#39;re okay with using chemical weapons to kill people in their concentration camps.</p>

<p>That&#39;s such a morality teeter-totter</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And then he lost that fight against the world in spectacular fashion and it took over 50 years for Germany to recover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen they had soldiers that would have felt nothing to shoot people okay my family were in concentration camps...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry for your loss but your personal anecdote is not a reputable citation. The recovered diary of Himmler however is. <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/himmlers-diary-gives-chilling-insights-mind-one-powerful-men-nazi-germany.html">&quot;During the execution, a Jewish man’s brain got splattered all over Himmler’s uniform as he was standing too close to the victim; Himmler vomited and shortly after that fainted for a few minutes.&quot;</a> This was a man who was pure evil yet he was still squeamish at the sight of blood. There are numerous research papers documenting the psychological effects of having to commit mass murder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why not put a bunch of people on a train</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be really inefficient and sounds like you&#39;re just trying to make up other methods of mass murder to justify your historical revisionism. And for the record they did try the train method. When Germany was rapidly loosing ground and scorched earth policies were being followed, prisoners were loaded onto trains and attempted to appear as military targets so that the allies would bomb those trains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had family in Auschwitz none of them ever saw gas chambers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve spoken to Holocaust survivors who were at Auschwitz and they said they did see gas chambers. My personal anecdote is as valid as yours. All the documentations says there were gas chambers there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the chemicals still in the walls it&#39;s still on the bodies then go read about what would happen if a human being walked into a room that had people&#39;s bodies doused in that chemical and how their body would react after it came into some sort of contact.</p>

<p>And I asked you how did they remove the bodies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The work done by the Sonderkommandos is well documented. They had these little things call <strong>gas masks</strong>. Sending people into a contaminated zone safely to work is trivial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they have no problem using chemical weapons to kill people why wouldn&#39;t they use chemical weapons to fight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what Germany&#39;s war goals were and why they tried to achieve them the way they did. Germany&#39;s war goals were to gain more living space for its citizens, not to indiscriminately conquer the world by killing everyone in it. The German Wehrmacht was not trying to exterminate as many people as possible in its war campaigns. The holocaust was organized by the SS, a separate organization in the German chain of command.</p>

<p>Also using run-on sentences doesn&#39;t help your poor argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Hillmer was squeamish. Doesnt mean every one was. It wouldnt be hard to find a psychopath who loves to kill and let him kill.</p>

<p>Do they have a copy of his original journal avalible? Did you authenticate the journal? Do you speak german? Was it translated properly?</p>

<p>Hold on putting people on a train is less efficent then building chambers with ventilation. Procuring chemical gas. Having them go into a chamber be gassed. Then carry the boddies from the chamber to a ditch. </p>

<p>Vs put them on a train say youre taking them to a nother camp. Then lighting it on fire and dropping it into a giant ditch.</p>

<p>Yeah sorry gas chambers are less efficent and a waste of rescources.</p>

<p>Plus if im a jew and see you kill people every day in a gas chamber... i revolt.</p>

<p>Or or. You just work them to death to fund your war machine. Why kill free labour? Thats not efficent.</p>

<p>You spoke to a stranger I spoke to family. Probably the og crisis actors gotta spread the propaganda. </p>

<p>If nazis were killing jews why did russians liberate jewish children even babies who had midwives? </p>

<p>The polish midwife also has testimony on record.</p>

<p>Why didnt jews revolt and fight? I mean they have no hope of surviving if they are being gassed. </p>

<p>Germany wanted to win the war. They had no problem killing as many people as they could. Why not use chemical weapons. What do they have to lose from using them? Especialy if they already use them on jews.</p>

<p>Please tell me how the holocaust survivors said they removed bodies. They had no protection and they used hooks. This is on record as testimoney during nazi war crime trials.</p>

<p>I also find it amazing that any mainstream reporter or journalist just lets their preconceptions get in the way of giving him a fair interview or say.

It was created in the late 1800&#39;s and has embellished and used by Zionists for many years to represent Jewish suffering as more significant and more deserving of our sympathies than suffering by people who are not Jewish.

The holocaust is one subject where there is more hidden than is known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well , some years ago, a survivor of Auschwitz came to my school. He was forced to work the Sonderkommando at the extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, and was in the camp for a big part of the war. He lost his entire family there, almost the first day after they arrived. The only reason he survived was because he lied about his age and looked a bit older, and was a strong young man, so he had to &#39;work&#39;. He had to dispose of the deaths.</p>

<p>Even after all these years , as an old man, you could see he was a broken man. </p>

<p>It kind of sounded real to me you know.</p>

<p>But, to each his own opinion i guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think it&#39;s exaggerated as propaganda. The First World War was over nothing, and was a senseless loss of life. The Second World War was caused by the Allies&#39; brutal terms in the treaty of Versailles, and the emergence of imperial Japan. Even with Japan, though, they only attacked the US because we were screwing with their economy through brutal sanctions. </p>

<p>Basically, we were begging for a fight, and we got it. WW2 was every bit as brutal and terrible as WW1. Knowing that they caused it from the mistakes after WW1, we knew we had to make the losers <em>genuinely</em> deserving of it this time. I have zero doubt that labor camps existed, and have zero doubt that thousands, if not millions, of Jews were executed. Antisemitism was dripping from Hitler and the Nazis. That said, imagine how much Jim Crow Democrats hated blacks. Yet...never any mass genocide. Oppression, sure. Police brutality, yeah. Targeted lynchings, yes. But never full blown genocide. In my opinion, the lack of documentation (which I was utterly stunned by, and which is why I think full blown denial is so easy of a position to jump to) is basically because the Nazis targeted Jews and mass enslaved them to feed the war effort. They made no serious efforts to stop disease, had to routinely put down uprisings through brutal means, worked people to death, and when supplies ran low, cut off the prisoners. It wouldn&#39;t shock me if mass execution happened near the end of the war, but I have trouble believing it went on from day 1.</p>

<p>The most realistic solution is best: it&#39;s not totally 100% true, but the substance is true. The Holocaust was undeniably the targeted enslavement, forced labor, oppression, and deliberate neglect of Jews. Even deniers can&#39;t disprove that (and America did similar with Japanese Americans). We know for a fact that people died in those camps. We know for a fact that the Nazis and Hitler despised the Jews and blamed them for both WW1 and WW2. Now, imagine you run a work camp with tens of thousands of people whom you think are directly responsible for the rape and plunder of your beloved homeland. What do you do when you know the end is near? </p>

<p>Also, if deniers are right, then there are a ton of missing families that just vanished out of thin air.</p>

<p>It happened. We might have exaggerated the numbers to further establish a moral cause for the war, and a moral justification for subjugating the Germans to prevent another &quot;uprising&quot; against peace terms, but it certainly happened. Don&#39;t fall in the trap of thinking it was all totally a lie, that Hitler was a good guy, and that the Nazis did absolutely nothing wrong. They either purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly caused the deaths of countless Jews, Poles, dissidents, and disabled people. Whether it was 1 million or 6 million is largely irrelevant. The lesson is the same: allowing people to &quot;otherize&quot; one another and allowing identity politics to continue to its natural conclusion is one of the gravest threats to freedom. Even if postwar propaganda (of which there undeniably was; after all, there was no trial for the people who ordered the nuking of 200,000+ civilians, or the firebombing of Tokyo and Dresden, and the brutality of the British Empire to its Bengali subjects conveniently goes unanswered) fudged the numbers, the repression, enslavement, and yes, deliberate murder, of Jews happened. Did it warrant the devastation that WW2 brought? Doubtful. But did it happen, and was it a heinous abuse of human rights that needed to be stopped? Yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t true. The Nazi&#39;s made the Typhus vaccine. The Nazi&#39;s even developed the microwave as a clothing delousing device in direct consequence of the crowded conditions of the work camps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During World War I typhus caused three million deaths in Russia and more in Poland and Romania. Delousing stations were established for troops on the Western front but the disease ravaged the armies of the Eastern front, with over 150,000 dying in Serbia alone. Fatalities were generally between 10 and 40 percent of those infected, and the disease was a major cause of death for those nursing the sick. Between 1918 and 1922 typhus caused at least 3 million deaths out of 20–30 million cases. In Russia after World War I, during a civil war between the White and Red armies, typhus killed three million, largely civilians. During World War II typhus struck the German Army as it invaded Russia in 1941.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s one of the biggest issues I have with Holocaust deniers. Hundreds of thousands non-Jewish ethnic Polish and Slavs were also taken into concentration camps and left to die. Do Slavs and Poles also lie that the they were rounded up by the Nazis for death?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think you were. No need to apologize. If we were talking face to face we wouldn&#39;t have had a misunderstanding. My language is often too direct because I want to get to the answer or the point as fast as possible.</p>

<p>This topic is a minefield. It&#39;s very easy to be insensitive and upset someone. But by sticking to what the man actually says, and not what other people claims he says - it&#39;s possible to have this discussion. That&#39;s sort of what I was getting at too. If we leave out the inflammatory language like denial and revisionism we can discuss the man and his work.</p>

<p>Irving is a fascinating character and a brilliant historian. I&#39;m convinced he has something like Aspergers that gives him this dogged and uncompromising approach. I think it&#39;s very unfortunate that he found himself in this particular topic. If he was ruffling feathers about Russian or British WWII atrocities he wouldn&#39;t have been character assassinated like he has been. You can see it really started when he debunked the so-called Hitler Diaries. Somebody produced those diaries for the purpose of re-writing history. He upset some powerful people by proving they were a fabrication. And his life has been hell ever since. I wouldn&#39;t even say he has over-reacted in his criticism of the people trying to suppress him. </p>

<p>I have a lot of admiration for anyone who will stand up and say &quot;look at this evidence and decide for yourself&quot; when the penalty is jail and bankruptcy. And he has been jailed and bankrupted, more than once. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I can offer some advice - you said you were new to this topic. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re new to &quot;alternative media&quot; in general but if you are, be aware it is heavily biased and loosely referenced. It&#39;s full of people trying to make a fast buck. And there is no shortage of people who will lap it up without question. And no shortage of people looking for an argument. It&#39;s very easy to fall into a non-productive rabbit hole or echo chamber. Sorry if you already knew that :)</p>

<p>A good source I found recently is Forum Borealis, and I will be very upset if Youtube ban that channel. I don&#39;t even want to link it in case there are bots scraping links in here. They have some good interviews about the odd stuff that happened in WWII, like Hess going to the UK and being imprisoned, and U-Boats leaving Spain for Argentina at the end of war. I don&#39;t think they have touched this topic but I bet you would find the channel interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holocaust deniers are some the most disingenuous people out there. Holocaust deniers don&#39;t care about any objective truth, they just want anything to justify their suspicion/hate of jews. Find me one historian who thinks the holocaust is fake who isn&#39;t also some kind of white supremacist, you won&#39;t be able to. What does that tell you?</p>

<p>The thing that gets me about these types is that they only want to &#39;debate the argument, not the person&#39; when they bring up their frankly retarded holocaust denial arguments. As soon you bring up anything like &#39;holocaust survivor&#39; then suddenly you&#39;ve &quot;bought into the ((narrative))&quot; and everything you say is suspect. Then they get mad when they&#39;re called out on it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as someone who studied history. The holocaust happened. It really is black and white as that. There was a systematic program to try and wipe out an entire race if people. We have photos, physical evidence, diaries, letters, witnesses and a whole raft of other evidence proving it happened.</p>

<p>Speaking as a decent human being. David Irving is a joke of a human being and a literal nazi who was rightful laughed out of acedemia and now makes a living selling Nazi Memorabilia </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet they did it in the least cost effective and efficient way possible.</p>

<p>They also would gas jews but not use chemical weapons in war. I guess they had some semblance of morality left eh?</p>

<p>Btw had family in camps... they were tortured, humiliated and worked yo the bone... but not one ever saw a gas chamber.</p>

<p>Why did nazis have midwifes taking care of jewish babies? We have a polish midwife who took care of children on record.</p>

<p>Why raise the babies you try and exterminate?</p>

<p>6mill jews ironically the exact number as their prophecy.</p>

<p>Ww2 was used as an excuse to fuel a self fuffiling prophecy which gave the jews british controlled jerusalem.</p>

<p>This is one of the most naive comments I&#39;ve ever read.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Hitler was pure evil, I&#39;m just saying you demonstrate a fundamental ignorance.</p>
