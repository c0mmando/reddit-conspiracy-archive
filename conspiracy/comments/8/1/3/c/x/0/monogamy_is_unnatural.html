<p>There would be WAAAY more sexual assault if everyone was constantly fucking, by the way. This isnâ€™t Ancient Rome and sexual abuse doesnâ€™t exist because of monogamy. Itâ€™s really horrible to think that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many different species that in their natural habitats form lifelong monogamous mating pairs.</p>

<p>From an evolutionary point of view one could argue it is better for men to have babies with as many women as possible, it gives their genetic material the best chance at propagation. </p>

<p>However, one can also argue that having children with just one woman means the man can better protect his offspring and ensure his lineage carries on. </p>

<p>If everyone was poly and women and men both reproduced with many others it causes problems. As non of the Fathers would be aware which of the children a particular sexual partners has is biologically theirs, why would they put in the effort to raise a child that is perhaps not even theirs. At least before the scientific advancements that now make this easy sort out.</p>

<p>Some people argue this was in fact the case in hunter-gatherer societies and children were raised by the entire familial group, with many mothers and fathers etc. That monogamy only began when people began to settle into Agrarian Farming. The reason being if you <em>own</em> land that you need in order to continue surviving then you want to make damn sure that the person you leave it too is you own biological child, therefore women were married to just one man who could control her, and ensure that all her children were his, and his property and belongings served to benefit only his genetic offspring after his death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive never known a polygamous relationship that works. Always ends in jealousy. Monagamy is the natural state. Love as a bond is achieved through work. The kind of work youd have to p ut in foe multiplle partners wpuld weaken the relationship betwren the other partners. Also, its an excercize in greed. Its less about being with another person, and more about a &#39;you&#39; or &#39;I&#39; that has multiple partners. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>with the current discoveries regarding epigenetics ... it apparently seems that monogamy (or even polygamy) are <em>better</em> than polyandry. Maybe it wasn&#39;t like this 100s of thousands of years ago, but battle of the sexes continues to be waged</p>
