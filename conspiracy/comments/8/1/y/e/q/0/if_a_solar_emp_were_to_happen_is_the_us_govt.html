    <div class="md"><p>It is and it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a very real possibility that something could knock out the grid but it could also never happen. Kinda like an asteroid being catastrophic. I think most people would quickly devolve into an every man for themselves state of mind. Military probably has protocols in place and will automatically start to lock stuff down. Farmers and ranchers might be ok for a little bit. A lot of people will die; either from another human, starvation, dehydration, infection (our medicines would quickly expire). </p>

CATASTROPHIC THREAT TO THE
HOMELAND</a></p>

<p>This research project was submitted in 2011.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transformers are the critical link in the electric power grid. They are large,
expensive, and custom built. None of these large transformers are built in the United
States and delivery times for newly built systems under normal conditions are from one
to three years. About 2,000 are in place throughout the Homeland, and only about 100
new ones are produced worldwide each year. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard a woman from the US Army War College on local public radio discussing this paper a few years ago, and her most important point was that it would take at least a year to manufacture the transformers to replace the blown ones.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s also this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in the case of a nuclear
weapon EMP the blast would create an electromagnetic pulse which, at a minimum,
would result in the overload and destruction of a significant number of electrical systems
and high technology microcircuits known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems. SCADAs are automated monitoring and control systems which, in
most cases, have replaced human supervisory control. Our reliance on SCADAs has
increased our vulnerability to an EMP because, if they become disabled, no back up
exists to replicate these essential functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondary impacts include loss of commercial trucking, therefore food distribution, loss of municipal water pumps and sanitation capabilities, loss of trash collection services, loss of healthcare services, and loss of communications (phone/internet).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit!  Great link - thank you.  Only on page 3 &amp; there is this...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The detonation of a single nuclear weapon at a high altitude above the United States, or a major solar geomagnetic storm, would create electromagnetic pulses which have the potential to catastrophically impact the survivability of the United States. The electrical power grid is fragile, and is extremely vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse. Its failure would result in the loss of almost all logistical functions necessary to support our modern society. This paper will examine the causes, threats, probable effects, and what measures can be taken to mitigate the potential impact to the Homeland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between self-reliance and 1750 level self-reliance. How do you plan the power grid pulling itself up by bootstraps? How do you feed 300 million people with sub-Amish farming technology? Protecting our national electrical infrastructure is not something private individuals can do, because it&#39;s just too big. Private companies won&#39;t do it because it&#39;s not profitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self-reliance is just that...you rely upon yourself.  Not the power grid, not the government, not the 300 million other people who need to be fed.  And I&#39;m not talking about privatization either. </p>

<p>What I am talking about with &#39;self-reliance&#39; is that no one has any better opportunity to take of you than you, yourself.  Buy seeds, learn how to farm, learn how to hunt, build shelter, make fire, learn how to generate power.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if people are too indoctrinated into the system to even realize that they can survive without it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most likely not, however cities will have emergency plans in place. </p>

<p>Also why is this even in conspiracy for a second time? This isn’t a conspiracy it’s a hypothetical situation (one in which you didn’t like the answers you got the first time you posted it), with something that has a very small chance of happening and save your articles I’ve read them. </p>

<p>Life would be very different, as it would be off the grid, The rich and powerful would run and hide, and the monetary system would turn to bartering. </p>

<p>I’m sure a lot of people will die, mainly from medical issues because of hospitals not being able to function and medicine not being able to be distributed. </p>

<p>At the end of the day though this is a HYPOTHETICAL. Which means that there are 5 million different scenarios that could change the outcome of this situation. </p>

<p>On the darker side, it could cause all the nukes to blow and everyone would be dead, the cdc could somehow blow up and a ton a viruses get loose and kill all of humanity, it could cause some shift in the earth and set volcanos off covering the earth in lava and ash, or cause hurricanes and crazy storms. </p>

<p>On a lighter side it could unite the people to rise up against a weak government whose electronic propaganda and money are now rendered useless and come into a new age, or cause a new harmonious living where communities form and start to learn how to live off the grid and from the land again, or it could bring all the greatest minds together to get the grid up and running in no time. Since it’s purely hypothetical it’s absolutely impossible to tell what would or wouldn’t happen. </p>

<p>Although one thing I’m sure of is it wouldn’t resemble the purge or the walking dead and everyone wouldn’t go around killing each other for some ramen :) </p>
