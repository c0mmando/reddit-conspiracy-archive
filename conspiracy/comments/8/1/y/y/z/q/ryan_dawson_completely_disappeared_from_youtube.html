        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a bunch of Ry videos saved in my favorites folder that I like to go back and watch and some that are unwatched, but today I go to my folder and all his videos said &quot;Deleted Video.&quot; So I went to manually search for his channel and nothing popped up except for other people&#39;s videos that he was featured on, he just completely disappeared from youtube and I have no idea wtf is going on and I&#39;m not sure if anyone else also noticed it too.</p>

<p>Either he deleted his channel (which I have no idea why he would do that since he is very passionate about his work and the desire to spread the truth) or somebody got to him... </p>

<p>His last online activities was an article he wrote on ANC Report about <a href="http://www.ancreport.com/report/new-revelations-attack-american-spy-ship/">new revelations of an American spy ship</a> on Feb.20.2018 and <a href="http://www.ancreport.com/podcast/interview-911-nelson-martin/">a podcast he did with Nelson Martin about 9/11</a> on Feb.26.2018. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been 6 days since his last activities and he usually doesn&#39;t go dark out of nowhere with a deleted channel... Does anyone know what&#39;s going on, how to contact him, or get him to make an update to his viewers? Because he seemed to be one of the very few out there who actually had merit to what they said and he always goes above and beyond with his research. I guess it was about time they cut him loose :/ </p>

<p>I had to quickly hit the full-screen icon when the smaller vid view showed up, because if I just played it normal style, the video displayed only the left half, like part of the page was covering it. But watching it full-screen worked.  Here&#39;s one example: <a href="http://www.getavideos.xyz/watch?v=23FnhrdLL1g">http://www.getavideos.xyz/watch?v=23FnhrdLL1g</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s explained everything, this happened while he was away, in the US. I think a lot of people will have saved his shit, I know I saved about 70 videos from him, cuz I&#39;m not a spotify and streaming kind of guy, I like to own the files, hence my 4 internal drives and dozens of externals. Should have saved more, some of my patreon people, I have 100% of what they ever put out, what&#39;s strange is that archive.org hasn&#39;t re-hosted some of his videos, like they do for many people. James Evans Pilato for example, he&#39;s got a great archive.org..archive for media from posts when mediamonarchy was a much smaller time gig, but he did way more interviews then, thank god they are all saved there. Anyways, can&#39;t wait for him to get on steemit, where he can monetize on DTube. Although the wait is long right now, I gotta say, I learned about DTube later than steemit, didn&#39;t know they basically were on the same blockchain platform. vimeo and bitchute and hell, dailymotion even, I found about a dozen videos from Ry I did not have over there. Turns out my policy of &quot;I save everything&quot; is the good one,  and also, I burn on double layer DVD&#39;s, ya know, in case of an EMP, DVD&#39;s and soon a blu-ray burner and just 5 rewritable blu-ray discs will be enough to backup a shitload of stuff and empty whole drives I have that contain only data.</p>
