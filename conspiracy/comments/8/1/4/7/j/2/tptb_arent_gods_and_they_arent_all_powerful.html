If you took the time to read my comment properly before going on the attack like a good little keyboard warrior, you would have realised that. &quot;How do I love someone that rapes my child&quot;... Simply I don&#39;t, as I&#39;ve stated, but thank you for taking it to extremes, giving me a horrid insight into your, clearly, sick mind. In the words of a great man, Love thy neighbour as thyself. The 10% I reffered to earlier, are people that, I believe, have been host to demonic entities, that have willed them to commit such atrocities, as raping children. Therefore will never be worthy of my love and are not &#39;human&#39; in nature at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are savior people out there. But, people are treating them like shit, using them for their own selfish aims, and draining these poor people of all of their light. People want to pipe dream and think that things will just magically be resolved, but no. It takes certain people with tremendous resilience and a balanced perspective to deliver the change needed for this new age. </p>

<p>The savior people are those people. They exist in small pockets throughout this world. However, society is killing them, and people are allowing it. And once we all give up, that is when the darkness will take everything. The savior people are the last hope of this world, and bit by bit they&#39;re all dying.</p>

<p>Tbh, I myself am starting to give up. It&#39;s not easy. You try, but people just don&#39;t give you a single damn thing to hold on to. They just hurt you and abuse you, and manipulate you. And what are you left with? Someone even had the nerve to think that I wanted to be saved? Bitch I&#39;m the one that saves you. You&#39;re the one that needs me not the other way around.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s how it is. People don&#39;t see the value in these saviors because they may not have the money, the looks, or the societal power that would make them appear valuable. Yet, these are people are invaluable, and by not making them feel the least bit happy, the least bit hopeful, it&#39;s just worsening their own lives. Without the savior people, there won&#39;t be anything left. They keep people from devolving, they change social paradigms. Whether it&#39;s at home or within a social movement, these people are instrumental for change.</p>

<p>Yet, this world is designed to extinguish them and the few people that can help them, just choose to punish them, and make them feel bad.</p>

<p>Let me go out on a limb and assume maybe you also see the homeless poverty class as problematic and less desirable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no, no. Not the rich at all. I&#39;m talking about TPTB. The INSANELY rich. The peopke that will kill innocent s just to gain more personal wealth. And again NO. Homeless people are just downon their luck. The U.K has a queen that spends millions of taxpayers money renovating her 100+ room mansion while the homeless sleep in freezing conditions with no food. If I was King, I don&#39;t want to be by the way. Then I would use that money to house and rejuvenate the homeless.</p>

Who you think rules is not what it seems. They worship the most evil and despicable beings and work in tandem with them. There is a war against light and dark. Although the darkness has been a part of the process for our conscious evolution; and has served its purpose. Yes they are afraid since they know their time is comig to an end. However, they are trying every tactic to keep us divided, in fear, and in the lower vibrations. We shall prevail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>of course.  :-)  even the gods they worship arent gods.  they are simply full of hate, not because they are born that way (is epigenetics still a thing?), but mostly b/c they were raised that way.  elite families are spanning centuries, intermarrying and raising their offspring using the same cruel principles with one aim in mind: to consolidate power.</p>

<p>eg, they lock (their own) child in a cage and then hand him/her a kitten asking to twist its head.  the child will refuse at first.  then they give the child an electroshock, a really bad one.  then they put the kitten back in the childs hands and ask to twist its head again.  the child will cry, but will do it. then you let the child out of the cage and praise it, saying how brave he/she was and show her love.  there are many methods and techniques employed during the childhood of an illuminati/satanist child some much worse than this (nglect, sexual violence, humiliation, dehumanization). so no wonder they turn out as they do.  they just dont know any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello; I greet you warmly this day.  The &quot;esoteric bullshit&quot; is literally a mechanism with which to function more efficiently.  Seeing as how the human lifespan is only so long, a massive amount of abstract wisdom needs contained within a platform of accessibility.  These operations in conjunction with the (speculative) concept of there being ancient, forgotten, obscured wisdom makes the pursuit of occulted esotericism a stringent discipline.  I urge you to reconsider your intentions on the matter and continue being inquisitive.  Oppose obfuscation of information, maintain an open mind for greater access.  I wish you all the best.</p>

How many of &quot;TPTB&quot; actually face real repercussions, or even the threat of such? I think there might be a slight divide between the real truth seekers in this sub on the question of &quot;If a world government conspiracy exists, are we closer to change for the better(I.e: overthrowing the current paradigm), or change for the worse(I.e: full police state/loss of human rights)? I hope most of us believe we are closer to the former. You almost have to have some sort of hope for the future to be able to read the content we post on here day-in-day-out. I feel like the one thing missing from this sub is &quot;kinetic energy&quot;, in a way. To me, the dialogue that occurs on here everyday, between posts and comments, represents &quot;potential energy&quot;. A lot of wasted potential energy that goes nowhere. There is no action, just a &quot;observer/narrator effect&quot;. Sorry to rant, but its rarely brought up on here how stressful it can be seeking truth especially when the truth is so ugly that only a criticized minority of the general world population dare face it. I hope there is more hope in this sub. </p>
