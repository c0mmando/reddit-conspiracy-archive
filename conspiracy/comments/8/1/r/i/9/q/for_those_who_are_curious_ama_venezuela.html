    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but since a lot of Venezuelans find it hard to get the different cryptos, Bitcoin is the one that is being used the most. The Venezuelans that got lucky to get into the cryptos make a shit load of money out of it, but most of us aren&#39;t so lucky. The ones that get used the most are (regular) bitcoins and Ethereum.</p>

<p>Maduro&#39;s petro is a complete failure, but that&#39;s to be expected!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maduro is working on using the petro that way, but it still hasn&#39;t been fully implemented.</p>

<p>Most markets can&#39;t take Bitcoins all at once, so we usually work online to gets USDs, then sell the USDs in Bitcoins or Ethereums and then sell them to Bolivares. We usually lose a lot of money in the process but this way we can win x10 the amounts of money we can gain by working regular jobs!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I was more or less screwed recently, but I&#39;m working on freelancing doing translations online, since I can get access to USDs this way, I can make it just fine. It&#39;s not enough like to live a &quot;normal life&quot; but considering other Venezuelans are dying I&#39;m relatively ok.</p>

<p>Speaking of that, Venezuelans who freelance doing all kinds of jobs online and have a good profile can live somewhat safely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. My studies are too advanced like to start over somewhere else. Besides, I want to get involved in politics as soon as I can so I can&#39;t waste time. Graduating will be a lot cheaper and quick for me if I stay in the country.</p>

<p>Besides, I&#39;m confident Maduro will go down in the next months.</p>

<p>I may do something like that later if people ask, but I can&#39;t right now and I don&#39;t think It&#39;s necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. Personally after living here I had a grudge against socialism because it has ended badly in other places. But after learning much more I&#39;ve come to respect a few socialist politicians. One of my favorite politicians is Romulo Betancourt, a Venezuelan socialist nationalist.</p>

<p>I still hate the latin american Castro communist left very badly and communist in general though.</p>

<p>If you could describe your current economy (as in, the quality and quantity of goods you can buy at the moment) how would you explain it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They share some policies, but I see communism as an ideology that seeks to destroy all aspects of society while socialism doesn&#39;t has to be that way.</p>

<p>Basically they share some policies like seeking equality, so communism can be considered a type of socialism in that aspect, but socialism doesn&#39;t necessarily leads to communism. If a politician says that he identifies himself as socialist, I would seek what policies he is trying to use and judge myself according to that, because I know politicians use both terms as being the same sometimes so it can be confusing.</p>

<p>Our economy is completely broke and stopped working so It&#39;s in the last stages of communism. The few products that are made, or in our case, imported, just can&#39;t be bought by regular Venezuelans. They barely have enough like to buy like three products at most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very legal. Freelance is mostly working online doing different things. I work with translations, other people work programing, some do 3D designs etc...</p>

<p>There is a bunch of sites where &quot;freelancers&quot; can find jobs, but you if you don&#39;t have experience and want a fresh start, you will have to struggle a lot at first.</p>
