<p>It should bring you to a comment that reads: &quot;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?db=PubMed&amp;amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;list_uids=23326202">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?db=PubMed&amp;amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;list_uids=23326202</a></p>

<p>&quot;We present histological observations and electron microscopic imaging from representative Morgellons disease samples revealing that dermal filaments in these cases are keratin and collagen in composition and result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. Spirochetes were detected in the dermatological specimens from our study patients, providing evidence that Morgellons disease is associated with an infectious process.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our study using multiple detection methods confirms that MD is a true somatic illness associated with Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment for this spirochete-associated dermopathy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Based on histological staining, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopic imaging and polymerase chain reaction, we report the detection of Borrelia spirochetes in dermatological tissue of four randomly-selected MD patients. The association of MD with spirochetal infection provides evidence that this infection may be a significant factor in the illness and refutes claims that MD lesions are self-inflicted and that people suffering from this disorder are delusional.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silver nitrate-based staining for spirochetes</p>

<p>MD dermatological sections</p>

<p>Warthin–Starry staining of MD dermatological sections from patients 1 and 2 revealed bacteria consistent with various morphological forms of Borrelia spp among epidermal cells (Figure 4A–C). These spiral or curved structures ranged from 0.1 μm to 0.5 μm in diameter and up to 30 μm long. They were present only in the interior areas of the sections and not in the stratum corneum. Numerous cocci were observed in the outermost layers of the stratum corneum of patient 2. Dieterle silver nitrate-based staining revealed bacteria consistent in size and shape with spirochetes in interior areas of histological sections in patients 1–4 &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;BDD samples</p>

<p>For comparison with MD samples, Warthin–Faulkner silver nitrate-based staining of proliferative-stage BDD samples was performed. Numerous spirochetes consistent in size with treponemes were detected among enlarged and ballooning keratinocytes (Figure 4F).&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3544355/figure/f3-ccid-6-001/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3544355/figure/f3-ccid-6-001/</a></p>

<p>This figure proves: &quot;Fontana-Masson-stained section from patient 3, demonstrating positive melanin staining of blue filament sections (arrow). 100× magnification.&quot; Melanocyte expression.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want more.</p>

<p>EDIT: IMPORTANT TO NOTE: All this concludes, at least simply, if testing is done to check for systematic spirochetal infection or check for borrelia spirochetes, and nothing is found to show anytype of spirochetal infection, then the &quot;sufferer&quot; can be passed off as delusional, but Borrelia burgdorferi compartmentalizes, which means there are components/pieces still present that would show spirochetal infection, so without any of those present, the person can be considered a &quot;delusional sufferer&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT: Not trying to be a douche, but did you seriously even look to check if there was a single peer reviewed study? Your apparently a flared professional on this sub but you didn&#39;t even check anything?</p>

<p>Like, scholar.google.ca is free to check, may not give you all the peer reviewed papers currently available, from all databases, but its a start.

<p>This is the beginning of the comment chain where I simply responded to someone saying something along the lines of &quot;wow, I can&#39;t believe the CDC is so up to date on everything&quot;. </p>

<p>PHealthy is a moderator of r/science and has taken it upon himself to hide information disproving his bias, he hid the comment. </p>

<p>r/science hides up to date peer reviewed papers that have significance to the way our society sees a specific condition (Morgellons/Filamentous Borrelial Dermatitis).</p>

<p>This is dark times we live in folks. </p>

<p>He fucking deleted it. </p>

<p>Are you serious? They still don&#39;t recognize Filamentous Borrelial Dermatitis although there is ample evidence that real sufferers of it have Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes present within dermal samples.</p>

<p>Its presence (edit: The borrelia spirochetes present within the epidermis) causes keratinocyte and fibroblast activation, leading to filaments/threads of keratin and collagen, and melanin staining has proven melanin expression, which means melanocytes are being activated in some way as well.</p>

<p>Check scholar.google.ca if you want, then check the controversial name for filamentous borrelial dermatitis on CDC&#39;s website.</p>

<p>They may do some cool research here and there, but they are ignoring an evolving bacteria.</p>
