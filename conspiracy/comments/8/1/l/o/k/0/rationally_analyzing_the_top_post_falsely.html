        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The OP of the post falsely claims Trump suggested killing drug dealers just as the propaganda outlet Politico does. The OP uses Politico for the &quot;quotes&quot;.</p>

<p>So what couple of sentences did Politico cherry pick to come to this wild conclusion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have pushers and drugs dealers, they are killing hundreds and hundreds of people,&quot; Trump said at a White House summit on opioid abuse. &quot;If you shoot one person, they give you life, they give you the death penalty. These people can kill 2,000, 3,000 people and nothing happens to them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does anyone disagree with that statement? I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Then they go on to this quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Some countries have a very, very tough penalty — the ultimate penalty — and by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do,&quot; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ok that&#39;s it.. Where did Trump say he wanted to impose death for drug dealers?????</strong></p>

<p>Oh, Politico goes on to back up there narrative by talking about an AXOIS article that claims an anonymous source said that Trump says in private..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He often jokes about killing drug dealers... He’ll say, &#39;You know the Chinese and Filipinos don’t have a drug problem. They just kill them.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More unnamed sources. Haven&#39;t we learned?</p>

<p>OK. What else? Politico goes on to ask some questions to a crime and justice guy from a University. Not really much comes out of that..</p>

<p><strong>So that&#39;s it. Trump never suggests killing drug dealers. We as a community have allowed blatantly false propaganda to be the very top post of our sub representing our very best thoughts. Shame on us for being the tools of propagandists.  Joseph Goebbels would be proud.</strong></p>

<p>This is what is killing this fucking website.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump gets himself into this shit time and time again by just saying dumb shit off the top of his head. In that moment he was saying &quot;hey look at the Philippines where they just straight up murder the drug dealers. Seems to work out pretty well for those guys because they don&#39;t have nearly the drug problem that we do.&quot;</p>

<p>Why say some dumb shit like that? It&#39;s like when he conplimented Kim Jong Un for becoming the leader of North Korea at age 27. He said &quot;A lot of people, I&#39;m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he&#39;s a pretty smart cookie.&quot;</p>

<p>What the fuck? Why is he casually complimenting brutal dictators for using violence to get what they want?</p>

<p>No he wasn&#39;t straight up suggesting we should murder drug dealers too. But praising the guy who does that is just a stupid ass thing to say. </p>

<p>Also I see you added to his quote words that were not there . you added &quot;Seems to work out pretty well for those guys because they don&#39;t have nearly the drug problem that we do.&quot;</p>

<p>That is not what he said, he said &quot;and by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do&quot;.   This statement can go 2 ways. Was he saying that was the result or was he saying they went to that extreme while not even having a problem as bad as us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is obviously fake news, but the disturbing part is that it currently has over 9000 upvotes, which is obvious manipulation. You could post a video of Dick Cheney activating the detonator on the WTC demolition and you wouldn&#39;t get 9000+ upvotes in this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conspiracy forum goddammit. We should really accept the only conspiracy the mainstream media hasn’t tried to immediately debunk or conflate with believing lizards rule the earth so it must be legit. It’s unacceptable that a foreign government would use social media platforms to promote their propaganda. Russia are bad ok because we’ve been told they’re bad by the media and career politicians who have only ever had our best interests at heart. Wow, some of the people here...you just refuse to accept the evidence even though it’s constantly promoted. I just thubj if you don’t believe in this conspiracy then you probably think the earth is flat yeah. That’s how crazy you have to be to not listen to the mainstream media. C’mon guys Wikileaks is run by Russia too so we should ignore everything they’ve released before. I’m starting to think the CIA only listens to us because they want to make sure that we’re safe from the Russian bots. Remember they hacked the election so just because nobody denies what was in the emails aren’t true it casts into doubt how legitimate they are really...</p>

<p>————
Side note: this is one of the forum takeover tactics where groups try to make the forum boring, unreadable and unrecognisable from what used to be posted. It’s a good tactic to be fair as I’ve definitely lost some interest in coming here since it’s been “Trump is amazing vs Trump is a Russian puppet” posts constantly. Not sure if there’s a way of turning back the tide to make it interesting again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I dislike having to defend Trump on any issue I think that him showing an appropriate degree of concern, anger, frustration, or sadness over the huge number of opioid deaths is only to his credit, as it would be coming from any normal person who stops to consider just how very many of those tragic and unnecessary deaths there have been and that are still being reported every day. </p>

<p>And as for considering whoever is actually responsible for all those unnecessary deaths or reflecting on what ought to be done about them, I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a single person that wouldn&#39;t understand or be shocked to hear anyone here say &quot;We ought to shoot the bastards or string them up.&quot; as a response to that and give them a shit-ton of up-votes for it, and you all damn well know that would be the case, too.</p>

<p>This is simply another example of just how far some people will go to try and misconstrue quite literally anything that Trump does or says in the worst possible light and run-off at the mouth about it.</p>

<p>By the way there is a carved wooden plaque of Draco the first lawgiver of Athens hanging prominently along with numerous others on the wall of the US Supreme Court. </p>

<p>That&#39;s also the same Draco that the term &quot;draconian&quot; came from. Draco only had two basic penalties for any crime, death or exile and they certainly reduced the amount of crime in Athens after that was introduced but witnessing the fate of the few who were still caught and punished those ways very quickly became far too much for anyone to bear. That plaque doesn&#39;t hang there out of any regard for the harsh and unforgiving nature of Draco&#39;s laws.</p>

<p>It&#39;s there because before Draco there were no laws at all and literally anything could happen or be done to anyone at all without the slightest provocation or fear of ever being held accountable for it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very far cry from what Trump actually said, even if it was somewhat tinged with that sentiment. Trump is often blunt, opinionated, and as expressive in as few words as possible, to say the very least about him. </p>

<p>Those too few words often leave a great deal else unsaid that anyone can imply whatever they like about, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily make it so. </p>

<p>So do many of us here when it comes to things that deliberately inflict a great deal of harm on any ordinary people, no matter who or where they happen to be.</p>
