<p>It is not okay to slowly contain everyone into the same few echo chambers and then once 95% of humanity is on them, to just start banning and censoring anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with your ideals or opinions. </p>

<p>The people defending these evil companies astound me. I can&#39;t believe how many people I see in this subreddit saying youtube mass censoring is just fine and if anyone has a problem with it they should find another website to post videos on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bullshit and you know it. It&#39;s like someone saying &quot;you don&#39;t have to drive cars, just walk everywhere.&quot; While technically you don&#39;t need to drive, walking everywhere is unrealistic.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not ok, but it&#39;s fucking brilliant in its simplicity and evil, and that&#39;s exactly why the Elites have pursued it.</p>

<p>I question the realness of many of those people. Check their comment histories...that is usually the big Tell. And it&#39;s also just something about American culture, for some reason people here are willing to let corporations do what they would never stomach the government doing, because they&#39;ve been brainwashed into thinking Corporations and Markets are somehow independent of humans and can do no wrong, and that Corporations are &quot;people&quot;.</p>

<p>Exactly. &quot;You don&#39;t have to use Google or FB or YT&quot;...yes, but 95% of people posting on social media or uploading videos or just searching the goddamned internet do, which means these companies need to be treated as monopolies...but we all know they won&#39;t be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My new canned response whenever this topic comes up:</p>

<p>YouTube, Facebook and Google are all government supported monopolies providing platforms for mass communication that no other company can provide because of the fact they are all government sponsored monopolies. In case of an emergency or some other tumultuous event, they provide critical communication services that cannot be found anywhere else. Their status as &quot;private companies&quot; is a sham perpetrated to allow themselves and the government to circumvent all kinds of restrictions and regulations that would otherwise be placed on the platforms and associated technologies were they properly classified as government sponsored monopolies.</p>

<p>Edit to add: Nah man, just kidding, I don&#39;t know what the fuck I&#39;m talking about. Just threw that shit out there off the cuff. Sounded kinda clever in my head I guess, but now I&#39;m reading it and realizing I probably just smoked too much reefer madness. Peace out.</p>

<p>The social interface corporations have become a separate level of government in the same way the media is the 4th estate. If you can monitor and alter the way a majority of humans communicate then you are one of the most powerful things in society in todays age. This is especially abhorrent when we now have concrete examples that these Companies promote not the best ideas but ideas based on &#39;diversity&#39; which has it&#39;s own host of complications and racist beliefs. It&#39;s a beast meant to squash the average person and it will soon be entirely run by people who were leveraged into a program because they had a certain look. What kind of society have we become where the &#39;top companies&#39; are promoting and giving preference to candidates based on qualities determined at birth? This is some Sci-Fi level BS! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The web of connections between government agencies and these large, powerful internet companies is fascinating for anyone interested in conspiracies. </p>

<p>In-Q-Tel - In-Q-Tel is a Virginia-registered corporation,[12] legally independent of the CIA or any other government agency. The corporation is bound by its Charter agreement and annual contract with the CIA, which set out the relationship between the two organizations. In-Q-Tel&#39;s mission to support the Intelligence Community&#39;s technical needs is promoted by the In-Q-Tel Interface Center (QIC), an office within the CIA that facilitates communication and relationships between In-Q-Tel and government intelligence organizations.</p>

<p>DARPA/ARPA - The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is an agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.</p>

<p>ARPANET - The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was an early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.</p>

<p>Regina Dugan -   Director DARPA - Head of Facebook’s hardware lab - Vice President of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects Google. Here she is discussing how to tempt young people into accepting micro-chipping with tattoos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6Onwg8wyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6Onwg8wyQ</a></p>

<p>DARPA LifeLog- &quot;LifeLog aims to compile a massive electronic database of every activity and relationship a person engages in. This is to include credit card purchases, web sites visited, the content of telephone calls and e-mails sent and received, scans of faxes and postal mail sent and received, instant messages sent and received, books and magazines read, television and radio selections, physical location recorded via wearable GPS sensors, biomedical data captured through wearable sensors. The high level goal of this data logging is to identify &quot;preferences, plans, goals, and other markers of intentionality&quot;. Lifelog was closed around about the same time the far more trendy and socially acceptable Facebook was started.</p>

<p>Total Information Awareness (note the logo with the pyramid/eye) - Total Information Awareness (TIA) was intended to be a five year long research project by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The goal was to integrate components from previous and brand new government intelligence and surveillance programs, including Genoa, Genoa II, Genisys, SSNA, EELD, WAE, TIDES, Communicator, HumanID and Bio-Surveillance with data mining knowledge gleamed from the private sector to create a resource for the intelligence, counterintelligence, and law enforcement communities.[11][12] These components consisted of information analysis, collaboration, decision-support tools, language translation, data-searching, pattern recognition, and privacy-protection technologies.</p>

<p>Boston Dynamics is an American[1] engineering and robotics design company that is best known for the development of BigDog, a quadruped robot designed for the U.S. military with funding from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). On 13 December 2013, the company was acquired by Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a big difference between saying &quot;they&#39;re a private company, they can do as they see fit to protect their business&quot; and saying &quot;they&#39;re a private company, they can do as they see fit to protect their business, and that&#39;s just hunky-dory&quot;</p>

<p>The first is an acknowledgement that corporations have the same legal status as a human being and it&#39;s a legal duty for the corporation to protect their bottom-line. The latter  is a passive acceptance of the situation and an acceptance of non-human entities being given the same rights as a human. Which is just weird. </p>

<p>So, It’s not so much that posting the video is a right, rather the act made by members of the private organization of removing and suppressing certain videos may have been done with prejudiced intent. It is also stunning how unequal the application of a private organizations ‘terms of service’ will be abused when censoring opposing or minority views.</p>

<p>This leads most to conclude that the suppression is due mainly to pressure from influential contacts requesting they be removed.</p>

<p>If I Imagine the argument you made were true, then every private organization has the right to choose how and when they enforce justice when something in their ecosystem happens.</p>

<p>It’s funny the same people who fought so hard for civil rights and the rights of minorities are now the same people trying to defend the right to censor and suppress opinions.</p>

<p>YouTube videos taken offline for political reasons.
Google search algorithms tweaked to ‘fix’ results in favor of political interests.
Google Executives personally overseeing Presidential Campaign strategy later learned to be highly fraudulent.</p>

<p>These are three major strikes in my opinion. You can do one of the three and get away with it, but leaning on this ‘we are a private org’ crap is nonsense when the big corporations have taken away the liberties and freedoms we supposedly deserve.</p>

<p>Good luck sheeple.</p>

<p>If YouTube was a place for anybody to put anything they want, the site would be mostly porn.  They don&#39;t allow porn, and its user base has accepted that.

    <div class="md"><p>A comment I posted in another thread:</p>

<hr/>

<p>I think in these discussions there tends to be a lack of nuance, where people either decide YT is perfectly within their rights and should not be criticized, or that YT is wrong and therefore we should have government intervention. The way I see it, there are a number of facts and a number of normative/ethical positions that make sense, and we need to be able to view these positions simultaneously. </p>

<ol>
<li>YT is likely acting within the law in censoring who they are (i.e. not violating the 1A or public accommodation laws)</li>
<li>YT <em>is</em> censoring content based on political viewpoints, and does go against the concept of free speech, which is broader than the 1A</li>
<li>We <em>should</em> be speaking out against YT censorship, either to compel them to change their policy or to get people to support a better service, <em>even if</em> content that we support is not currently being censored. The &quot;left,&quot; very broadly speaking, is missing this point IMO because it&#39;s their political opponents currently being censored.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would still maintain that we should be seeking and promoting alternative platforms and protocols, not just ones that are currently not censoring, or committed to not censoring, but that have anti-censorship as a core component of their platform. To me, this means distributed and decentralized platforms, as any service with a centralized model has a single point of failure that allows owners and their agents to censor the entire platform. That means choosing services like BitChute or DTube over services like vimeo. </p>

<hr/>

<p>We have a few options: put public pressure on YT to get them to change their policies (unlikely to work), put public pressure on the government to change the law or enforce laws already on the books (likely to have very unwanted side effects), or use alternative forms of communication. I advocate for the third. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I need to understand the difference between YT and FB deciding what content they as a company want to host, and a bakery not making a cake for a gay couple, or a flourish, or whatever.  I’ve been asked to leave places because my beard reminds them of the taliban(not kidding). Also, how does this turn into a 1A issue but my local mall not allowing me to open carry doesn’t turn into a 2A issue. I think, it’s just because of what they are censoring that this has blown into such a “conspiracy” if they were censoring left wing nut jobs out, how many of you would even know it, let alone be on this sub crying about it? I’m willing to bet a good margin of you would just downvote the post and continue scrolling.  There ARE other avenues, there ARE other companies. Just because these are the most popular doesn’t mean that they have to do anything you want them to, and in America, companies are people too.  They have more pull within our government than we do, which should be the main issue and not what the companies decide to host.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group">Protected classes</a> have protection.  These are classes of people that have historically been oppressed.  (sexual orientation is not protected)</p>

<p>So, if you have a bakery and you decide you don&#39;t want to make a cake for homos, you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a website and you are restricting service to a group and that group is not a member of a protected class, it&#39;s ok.  If youtube said no homos, they would be in trouble.  If they say no anti-anti-trump stuff, it&#39;s ok.</p>

<p>Now, on another note that I&#39;ve been pushing, I think that if a forum offers free membership to the public, and they control &gt;x percent of the online traffic (or some kind of test) (maybe &gt;50k members) then they are an online digital public forum, and public forums have protected speech. (think town center and someone yelling.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A problem I consistently fail to see mentioned is that it is collusion. Twitter, FB, YouTube, and Reddit have all been incrementally censoring users with right-leaning opinions at the same time, likely in collusion. I&#39;m not a lawfag but believe that in and of itself is illegal. Megacorps may be able to control their own &#39;private&#39; corporation, but when they work together to censor across platforms to create a  mass blanket of censorship that spans most channels of communication, that is a whole different matter. The issue is discovering how they colluded and who is behind it IMO.</p>
