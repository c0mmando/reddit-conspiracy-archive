<h1>EDIT: There are users i have blocked in this thread because it was recommended to me by <a href="/u/sabremesh">/u/sabremesh</a> that are claiming the US did a real investigation into Magnitsky’s death which isnt true.  The government made the decision based on information given to them by Bill Browder.  If you watch the Bill Browder deposition i linked above it is very long but you will see this.  The users I blocked said they didnt have the time or were not willing to watch it.</h1>

<p>I am Governor Jerry Brown
My aura smiles
And never frowns
Soon I will be president...</p>

<p>Carter Power will soon go away
I will be Fuhrer one day
I will command all of you
Your kids will meditate in school
Your kids will meditate in school!</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
California Uber Alles
California Uber Alles
Uber Alles California
Uber Alles California</p>

<p>Zen fascists will control you
100% natural
You will jog for the master race
And always wear the happy face</p>

<p>Close your eyes, can&#39;t happen here
Big Bro&#39; on white horse is near
The hippies won&#39;t come back you say
Mellow out or you will pay
Mellow out or you will pay!</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Now it is 1984
Knock-knock at your front door
It&#39;s the suede/denim secret police
They have come for your uncool niece</p>

<p>Come quietly to the camp
You&#39;d look nice as a drawstring lamp
Don&#39;t you worry, it&#39;s only a shower
For your clothes here&#39;s a pretty flower.</p>

<p>DIE on organic poison gas
Serpent&#39;s egg&#39;s already hatched
You will croak, you little clown
When you mess with President Brown
When you mess with President Brown</p>

<p>In response to this act, Russia put in place sanctions against the US that was putting a ban on adoption of US children. They did this in order to gain support in the US to remove sanctions on Russia.</p>

<p>Trump Jr. and Trump himself, have said that Russian adoption sanctions was talked about during the Trump tower meeting with Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize I needed to &quot;back it up.&quot; It&#39;s pretty well-known. Generation Z alone is overwhelmingly anti-leftist. They&#39;re not even pro-right, they&#39;re just anti-left. This is worldwide. It&#39;s a known fact. Elections like Trump, or Brexit, are happening constantly in defiance of the left and/or globalism. Look what&#39;s happening in Germany, or Italy. Are you under a rock?</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Liberal population itself is dwindling in numbers due to factors like abortion alone. They chop their dicks off and abort their babies -- it&#39;s safe to say that they&#39;re not long for this world. It&#39;s natural selection cleaning out the weak-links in society man. It&#39;s a naturally reoccurring process.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe you actually access the Internet and willingly share how ignorant you are with the entire planet all the while acting like you&#39;re making some kind of a point. This shit amazes me. </p>

<p>6 years ago the republican party put up another shit candidate despite romp-stomping liberals in every midterm election Obama was president. Republicans still kept control over congress 6 years ago. You can&#39;t even get your facts straight. Who said conservatism was dead, unless you (and let&#39;s be honest, this is probably what&#39;s happening) are getting your info from bad sources and are associating with dumb people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>California is a large state, with a lot of land-mass and a lot of citizens with several of America&#39;s largest cities and counties. The state of California has a culture of Liberalism, and is overwhelmingly so. The Democrat party in theory <em>should</em> win the popular vote every single election, but they don&#39;t, which is a testament in and of itself. This isn&#39;t rocket science. I can&#39;t believe I have to explain this to you. I can&#39;t believe you actually get online and share your opinions in public in front of the world, only to turn around and ask retarded questions like this. </p>

<p>Fucking amazing how dumb you people are. </p>

<p>The right isn&#39;t righteous, and the republicans are a shit party. The left is simply an ideologically evil, hypocritical and authoritarian regime with hive-minded sheep for voters. They get their information from proven fake-news sources, and continue to still vote for a party that <strong>literally</strong> stole an election from their own constituents. Instead of reforming their own corruption, these are the people who still show up rank and file to try to take Trump down instead. This is how fucking stupid leftists are. And it&#39;s obvious. The entire planet is laughing at the left, especially after all of that Russia bullshit. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s hard not to notice that you&#39;re not rebutting anything I&#39;m saying, you&#39;re just continually dancing with 1-2 line items you think you can make a quip about. If you have no argument or merit for the things you believe, how the fuck do you even believe them? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think corruption is a Establishment Left or Establishment Right issue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pile of corrupt politicians who want to stay on the establishment lobbyist/corp gravytrain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m registered independent.  So i’m not really 100% conservative or liberal.  Politically fluid.  I HATE corruption &amp; the people cheerleading Mueller are annoying because he has a history of covering shit up so even if Trump has done something i cant trust the investigation either way because of who they have put in charge of it.  Mueller could be targeting someone he is afraid will reveal his secrets or this could just be another case of the establishment covering up shady shit.  But i lean towards Trump didnt directly work with the Russians more &amp; more every day because if you look at the characters involved on the US side they have been fucking with Russia for the last 20+ years.  Impossible to know what is really going on behind the scenes because there isnt one source you can go to on the internet to uncover the whole truth.  You just have to read a bunch of shit &amp; start putting the puzzle together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that many of the users and probably even the moderators on several popular subreddits have both anti-conspiracy and left-leaning opinions.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m also fairly confident that isn&#39;t really the point of this post. I think it is to discredit the investigation into corruption in the executive branch and to do a fair amount of retconning to make the left the arch-villain.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the place to dispute the conspiracy theory itself. That can go unchallenged, but lets just also point out that George Bush, Dick Cheney, Robert Mueller, John Ashcroft and the majority of the FBI are Republicans.</p>
