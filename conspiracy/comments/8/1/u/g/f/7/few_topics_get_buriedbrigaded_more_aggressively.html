        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/81qiad/contradictions_in_seth_rich_murder_continue_to/">This morning I submitted this post</a> and was surprised when it received over a dozen upvotes in the first 30 minutes.</p>

<p>That might not sound like much, but discussing Seth Rich on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> these days almost guarantees that the post won&#39;t rise above 0.</p>

<p>After about 30 minutes, however, the post quickly went from 80% upvoted to less than 50% upvoted.</p>

<p>When these brigades occur, the post will often show anomalous karma for its position on the page, for example my post was still in the top 10 on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> yet had less than 5 link karma (unusually low for that position).</p>

<p>As you can see, the post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/81qiad/contradictions_in_seth_rich_murder_continue_to/">has amassed 129</a> comments and even a TMOR link for good measure.</p>

<p>I understand the need to remain skeptical concerning unsolved conspiracies like the murder of Seth Rich, but I&#39;m not alone in noticing an apparent coordinated effort to actually <em>prevent</em> a substantial and somewhat visible conversation from even taking place.</p>

<p>The dramatic pushback and condemnation leveled against those who want to see his murder solved is disturbingly partisan and predictable. </p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s the fervent denouncement of this particular conspiracy theory that keeps me even remotely interested in the subject.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear they&#39;re resorting to brigading and burying. But why?</p>

<p>Beyond assuming that there isn&#39;t significant variation between people who browse by new and people who browse by hot, there really isn&#39;t. That&#39;s how you would test the hypothesis that, given a post that would be upvoted at a 50-50 ratio, the first 11 would be upvotes.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a different, specific hypothesis requiring a specific test. I was merely pointing out that we can pretty confidently rule out normal voting, not attempting to prove any specific cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s disingenuous to say people that don&#39;t support the Seth Rich theories don&#39;t want his murder solved. If I said Donald Trump personally shot Rich I&#39;d get laughed out of here if I said &quot;you just don&#39;t want his murder solved&quot; when I got called out. People (including Rich&#39;s parents) don&#39;t support the theories because they haven&#39;t been given any evidence or reason to believe them. That doesn&#39;t make them okay with the fact he was murdered or that his murderer has gone unpunished. </p>

<p>Also he wasn&#39;t robbed because it was a botched robbery which, by definition, is unsuccessful. I feel like people completely take out the human element out of the situation and don&#39;t stop to think what a would-be-robber would actually do in the situation. I don&#39;t see them having the nerve to pry items off a man bleeding out in the street, likely begging for his life, while the gunshot detectors in the area have alerted police and have them coming to that scene as fast as they can. A person is more likely to panic and run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand where you&#39;re coming from with that but I disagree. I just don&#39;t think you can assume that because they could kill someone, they would also be able to take something from the dying body. Those are two massive leaps because, despite what people think, criminals aren&#39;t always okay with killing but do it when they think they need to. Even ignoring all of that I assume their first thought be &quot;I have to get as far away from here as possible because police are on their way.&quot; </p>

<p>I know in hindsight it&#39;s incredibly easy to say &quot;but it would only take a second to take something from the body&quot; and &quot;why wouldn&#39;t a robber steal anything&quot; but in the actual situation panic is likely to overrule all of that. </p>

Also how does your criminal, cf. hit team, know the police were &quot;on their way&quot;? they had access to police channels or something? also, what exactly would have summoned the police? has any neighbor reported gunshots? I heard of none.</p>

<p>just another point to add to the list for the botched cover-up (ie, should have had someone &quot;report&quot; shots, so police would arrive pronto).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are gunshot detectors in the area which would have alerted police. But it doesn&#39;t even matter if the police were coming at all, the robber just has to think they could turn up at any time and that they need to get out of the area. The robber not knowing when the police will get there is exactly why panicking and running would be the immediate response. </p>

<p>You&#39;re looking at this whole thing in hindsight with all the information we have instead of thinking about what a person would actually do in that situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this added bit on the &quot;profile&quot; of the robber. Now you claim to know what the &quot;robber(s)&quot; thinks and fears. So you  have added the &quot;panic&quot; element to the brave botching &quot;robber&quot; who is such a fearful chap that once he shoots Seth (in the back, mind you) not once, but twice, is overcome by &quot;panic&quot; and flees from a wounded man, presumably lying on the ground at his feet.</p>

<p>So, I need you to appraise me here of a little more psychology of robbers. WE know Seth was shot in the back. Why do you think the robber, who is apparently a venegeful fellow (might as well assume it was a fellow, right?), so vengeful that he&#39;d shoot a fleeing man, be also one subjected to panic attacks. Such overwhelming panic that he&#39;d shoot the victim and not check whether he was still alive and pick up a couple of valuables.</p>

<p>So, since we are on the posychologist&#39;s couch, let&#39;s peel this onion some with the following facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Robber&quot; tries to rob man (Seth) who presumably fights back and resists the attempt. Robber is apparently keen enough on booty to fight for it, rather than flee.  </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Robber&quot; fails to shoot man during assumed altercation (and assumed it is. Those few &quot;scrapes on Seth&#39;s hands were delivered to us courtesy of his parents who may or may not have seen them directly. So we know nothing of how serious them &quot;scrapes&quot; were and what kind. Could have, for example been acquired from just breaking a fall after being shot. So we don&#39;t know for a fact that Seth had a chance to fight back since the police did not share that bit with anyone that I know of. But for the moment let&#39;s assume it&#39;s true. Seth tried to defend himself with his hands but &quot;robber&quot; does not fire his weapon, which presumably he had pointed at the victim). Therefore, &quot;robber&quot; is either too wimpy to shoot an unarmed man who supposedly delivered some blows, or could not reach for his gun (meaning it wasn&#39;t already pointed at victim?), or the gun misfired, or? </p></li>
<li><p>Seth manages to break free and runs for it. &quot;Robber&quot; is, for whatever reason, really angry that the bait is getting away and fires at his back. So we then have ourselves an angry and vengeful &quot;robber&quot;. So angry that he is willing to risk a capital crime out of sheer spite. Indeed we should further accept that the &quot;robber&quot; is not only spiteful but also impulsive. The same one who had the presence of mind not to shoot the victim in the front when he started resisting.</p></li>
<li><p>This obviously very angry and impulsive &quot;robber&quot; immediately panics, as in &quot;oy vey, my, what have I done&quot;? and fails to take a single valuable off the incapacitated man that he despised enough to try and kill. Therefore, we have not only an easily angered, and a mighty impulsive &quot;robber&quot;, but also a highly rational one, who can weigh actions and consequences in the space of a minute. Unfortunately, not checking that the victim is dead and can&#39;t talk and tell tales, is still not very rational, so we must postulate a &quot;partly rational&quot; robber.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So to summarize, my psychological robber-profiling friend, how many robbers have you ever seen or heard of (including hollywood movies and TV shows) who are: (i) motivated enough to rob a young, strong looking man in a residential neighborhood, possibly at gun point, knowing there are camera around as you say, that might instantly alert police (ii) strong enough to fend off physical resistance yet weak enough to let their quarry get away (iii) smart enough to not shoot victim in the front DURING said altercation and/or not having gun pointed at victim in the first place, so couldn&#39;t reach for it (iv) given to irrational anger so strong that he impulsively shoots a running man in the back or perhaps fearful of the victim being able to identify him or something (v) rational enough to realize police may arrive any minute, therefore not worth the risk to pick up at least some of those valuables he craved so much as to shoot a man for,  (v) still irrational enough to not check whether victim who could identify him is indeed dead and would not get him hauled in for a capital crime.</p>

<p>So, both motivated to rob but not motivated enough, both fearful and brave, both given to impulsive behavior and panicky behavior yet also completely rational, and of course, so skillfull that he evades on-coming police with nary an evidence left behind.</p>

<p>Some &quot;robber&quot;, right?</p>

<p>Now, if the police would only share with us some little details of the shots that supposedly killed Seth (which we don&#39;t know, since no one bothered to tell us, the public, what he actually died from). Details such as - what presumed range was Seth shot from? that would help, no? what type bullets and where did they hit the victim? what was the victim&#39;s position when police arrived? how many bullet casings were found on the ground and at what distance away?</p>

<p>If only the police ever shared a single detail, that would help both you and me to pin down the pasychological profile of our panicky, fearful, rational, irrational and skillful &quot;robber&quot;. Come to think of it, this &quot;robber&quot; has such an amazing profile that DC would do well to hanker down in fear that he may strike again (but hasn&#39;t, as far as we know).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you automatically say Seth Rich wasn&#39;t robbed?</p>

<p>He was shot in a neighborhood that had a recent spate of armed robberies, with victims saying the robber had a silver gun.</p>

<p>The night he was murdered, a group of people had been robbed and pistol whipped a very short distance from where Seth Rich was murdered an hour later.</p>

<p>His watch strap was torn. </p>

<p>Seems to be a LOT of supporting evidence for a robbery gone wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the paid leftist trolls are trying to suppress the biggest story of our lifetime. </p>

<p>The DNC actively cheated the American public out of their primary. Their horse, Hillary Clinton, had her emails leaked revealing how corrupt she and the people around her are. DNC leaks + Hillary email + Podesta email = the media actively colludes and makes fake news on purpose to create propaganda to bolster the goals of the left. They rig everything and lie about everything and we know that for a fact. </p>

<p>Well, you can&#39;t let people talk about that everyday, so go make a fake narrative (scapegoat) about Russia. </p>

<p>*Russia hacked the DNC
*Then 13 Russian trolls were more successful on Facebook and Twitter with $1MM than Hillary was with the &quot;greatest campaign team of all time&quot; and $2 billion dollars. 
*Oh, and then Trump colluded with Russia the whole time. Right. </p>

<p><strong>But whatever you do don&#39;t talk about the fact that the DNC rigged their primary, stole an election, had a leaker expose their entire corrupt game, then had him killed as a result</strong> </p>

<p>Russia, Russia, Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie had 15 points over Trump in the polls during the primaries and Bernie only got more and more popular as 2016 went on. I&#39;m sure a Democrat would have pushed a third party to eat that huge margin up or attempted to sabotage Bernie like the Dems did with the &quot;anyone but McGovern&quot; campaign they ran to make their own candidate lose in 72. But in a direct contest between Bernie and Trump, I&#39;m pretty sure Bernie would have had about 20 points on Trump. Young people would have actually shown up to vote if their candidate wasn&#39;t criminally cheated off the ballot. And don&#39;t forget, if you look at primary votes for people under 30, Bernie got more votes than Hillary and Donald COMBINED. If only people under 30 were allowed to vote, Bernie could win a three-way contest with more votes than both of his competitors combined. That&#39;s how much young people wanted Bernie to win. </p>

I didn’t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights,” she wrote. “With all I knew now about the Russians’ hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly one version of getting inside the mind of the author...but Occam&#39;s razor pretty clearly spells out Rich was wikileaks&#39; source and the dangers to the IC of that narrative shift was too much.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not open to both sides of that situation you have no place in this subreddit, as gratuitously peddling narratives sans critical insight is antithetical to the mission of this forum. </p>

<p>In the past year alone, the radical transparency group has published medical files belonging to scores of ordinary citizens while many hundreds more have had sensitive family, financial or identity records posted to the web. In two particularly egregious cases, WikiLeaks named teenage rape victims. In a third case, the site published the name of a Saudi citizen arrested for being gay, an extraordinary move given that homosexuality can lead to social ostracism, a prison sentence or even death in the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think to, with the added bonus of promoting a conspiracy theory about the person he hates most in the world:  Hillary Rodham Clinton.    That&#39;s probably KDC&#39;s motive too.  I think Clinton was Secretary of State when his house in NZ was raided, and his bank accounts frozen.  </p>

<p>Something, that in and of itself that was as indicative of the same kind of an effort to put the fix in for Clinton by a mainstream media that as it turned out actually was working with and alongside those very same people behind Hillary Clinton at the top the DNC all along.</p>

<p>I suspect all of Bernie&#39;s followers, like Seth Rich before them, have all finally managed to face up to all those very unpleasant and disconcerting facts about the DNC. Not sure that any of them even think of themselves belonging to a party that disenfranchised and betrayed them and their own candidate behind their backs the way that was done but getting to the bottom of Rich&#39;s murder may be an even more bitter pill for them to swallow when it comes to just how far that corruption and criminality may actually go.</p>

<p>The general public is in something of the same kind of a quandry on what to believe and what they&#39;d rather not have to believe about any of it. </p>

<p>Investigating Rich&#39;s murder and the possibility that it was politically motivated because he either was or else was suspected to be the one that leaked the damning information about how the nomination was rigged for Clinton from the very outset can&#39;t avoid being another element and aspect of it.</p>

<p>lol. few calories were expended getting this Bernie-supportin&#39; Stein-voter to that point :) To those active in or following Bernie&#39;s campaign, by June of &#39;15, it was clear Team Clinton was being Team Clinton.  Around October &#39;15, Team Clinton started ramping up the crazy.  Given Team Clinton&#39;s level of intellectual dishonesty, by May of &#39;16, most of us BernieBros<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> were primed and unsurprised at the WL releases.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of regulars at <a href="/r/WayOfTheBern">/r/WayOfTheBern</a> want justice for Seth Rich and have recognized the enormity of the WL releases since day one :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posts about Seth Rich get brigaded and elicit nonsensical targeted comments on other subreddits too, not just this one.</p>

<p>I agree with your question - why the effort to bury the conversations? what is it about Seth that is apparently so disturbing to certain elements?</p>

<p>I sort of have an answer to this one question, namely that it wasn&#39;t so much a botched robbery but a botiched cover-up of what really happened the morning of July 10.</p>

<p>It obviously is not a conspiracy to raise doubts about a robbery in which nothing was taken, and one where the manner of the victim&#39;s death was apparently hardly investigated and certainly what little investigation was done, was not disclosed. To no one. Possibly not even to the family. </p>

<p>To maintain that there is evidence of poorly executed cover-up is nothing to do with conspiracy theorizing. There are too many details that don&#39;t add up, and too many odd behaviors by the police that are not exactly typical.</p>

<p>How was the cover-up botched, you ask? for starters, by failing to make it look like a &quot;proper&#39; robbery, where something valuable WAS taken. For another, the paramedic spoke up about Seth&#39;s lucid state as did the neighbour who saw him, and such testimonies actually saw the light of day. That&#39;s pretty botched, I&#39;d say. A bicycle rack in tribute to a dedicated worker. how very generous! how silly! Can go down the list and find another 10 items consistent with a botched cover-up but not with a botched robbery.</p>

<p>Since this is evident to anyone who cares to read about this case, the less it is discussed or even mentioned, the better for those who realize the &quot;job&quot; was sloppy.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#39;s not about truth, or justice to the victim here.It&#39;s about desperation to keep the tracks from becoming visible to ever more people.</p>

<p>Simple, really.</p>

<p>I just did a search for &quot;Seth Rich&quot; on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and almost all are over 0, with many being upvoted to the front page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Seth+rich&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Seth+rich&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on</a></p>

<p>Just yesterday there was a Seth Rich post with over 30 upvotes, the day before that there were two Seth Rich posts on the front page with ~200 each, and two weeks ago there were two submissions for the Joe Rogan talk about Rich which both got nearly 800 upvotes.</p>

<p>Do you have any evidence that this is being &quot;buried&quot;, other than the single example of your own post? Because I&#39;m not really seeing it. In fact, if anything for a story that&#39;s had little to no development for over year it actually seems to get upvoted more frequently than expected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t downvoted a single Seth Rich post because I come by asking simple questions.</p>

<p>Like how did he have access to emails? You can&#39;t and will not answer that simple question. This is not a conspiracy when you find the crime first and then try to put together supporting evidence.</p>

<p>This is pretty sad to see from the mods. Also with mods recently calling people shills in the open, it&#39;s pretty clear people are on to your propaganda. Which is a good thing.</p>

It means that we&#39;ve succeeded in getting the facts out there in such a way that they felt they cannot counter it in any way but trying to bury it.

<p>As for Hersh, I swear he explained it elsewhere but I can’t find it with a quick search.</p>
