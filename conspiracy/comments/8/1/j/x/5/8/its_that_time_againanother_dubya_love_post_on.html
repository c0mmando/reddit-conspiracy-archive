<p>Sorry Donna..I understand very much that you encourage positive thoughts and the results of those..but the situation in the middle east stinks to high heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, seen a lot of attempts to make Dubya likeable lately. He says he doesn&#39;t like Trump, and he&#39;s supposed to suddenly not as bad as people remember. I had this conversation with my dad a few months after Trump got elected. He said Trump&#39;s a thousand times worse than Dubya. And I was like... &quot;The man&#39;s just been elected... Dubya had 8 years, a war based on false pretenses that cost so many lives and ramped up terrorism all over the world, not to mention Cheney running the show from behind the scene with Haliburton and Blackwater...&quot; and my yeah was like &quot;Well yeah, but Trump is way worse.&quot; My dad is not a stupid guy. And I&#39;m no die-hard Trump lover. But it&#39;s fucking shady what the news is doing lately playing on people&#39;s emotions and manipulating them to ridiculous and illogical thinking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the old trick from the early days of 2000. Remember how people did not think GWB should be president but they&#39;d like to have a beer with him? He was somehow &quot;likeable&quot;? Never seemed likeable to me -- not someone I would want to do anything with. It was junk then, it&#39;s junk now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you&#39;re saying. Jury&#39;s out on who&#39;s worse, but there&#39;s definitely some ploy to make people feel generous towards Dubya these days. To what end? I have no clue. It&#39;s annoying as fuck, though. Perhaps some attempt to get people to forget the terrible shit Dubya&#39;s administration pulled, destroying the 4th ammendment, which was ramped up under Obama? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I say jury&#39;s out because there&#39;s a slim possibility that in 8 years Trump might do something terrible... and I&#39;d say the same thing if it were Obama, Clinton, anyone else, because I&#39;m just talking purely about possibility. Dubya is everything you said. His administration was a nightmare. He&#39;s responsible  deaths, while at the same time stripping away the rights of American citizens, and spying on us, and setting up the middle class for financial ruin.. And then Obama did nothing to undo any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump is kind of blatantly worse though, right? Every president for a while has been a puppet for this or that private interest, W was a piece of shit but he didn’t blatantly represent scumbag rich sociopath behavior has part of his platform...this particular president we have now is a a goddamn loony though, he’s actually a bumbling moron, he’s dumber than Reagan and that guy had Alzheimer’s. Hes worse because he’s <em>openly</em> sleazy and shitty and a rat fink liar and he doesn’t care. And he’s the president ,which means that’s the mindset of a large group of people, they think that shit is the bee’s knees. </p>

<p>Shitloads of people don’t care about admitting they’re pieces of shit, they’re refusing to go along with social changes and they have a powerful person saying gibberish on tv that jerks them off. That’s insane. That’s the worst thing to happen in a long time, and he’s certainly representative of this whole anti-intellectual, anti-progress, pro-powers-that-be mindset that infects politics and television and internet communities and school, so on and so forth. Shit sucks. But at least W seems like he wouldn’t cheat at golf, he probably thinks he has a moral compass he’s been following, you know what I mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, just look at most of reddit.  People act like Trump is somehow the worst president ever.  Fuck, based off what we know, it appears Obama spied on Trump.  Whether you agree with that intrepretation, or not, would you be OK with Trump being able to do what Obama did in 2020 against the guy running against him?  That&#39;s what this fight is about.</p>

<p>I feel like a majority of people are very susceptible to media influence about what to think.  Is Trump a great guy?  Probably not.  Should we trust politicians and media that has repeatedly lied to us and tried to mislead us when they say he&#39;s a bad guy?  I&#39;m not sold.  Funny how so many people we used to hate also &quot;hate&quot; trump.  Yadda, Yadda, Enemy of my Enemy!  </p>

<p>Fuck it, if nothing else I love seeing Trump piss off all those terrible assholes on Capitol hill who has worked so fucking hard to take away freedoms guaranteed to citizens.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this exact same argument with my mother. She used to fucking hate GWB (and rightly so.) But now, she&#39;s convinced that Trump is way worse and GWB isn&#39;t that bad in retrospect. The establishment Democrats are cozying up with the neocons, so the &quot;left&quot; media are rehabilitating the neocons&#39; image. Bill Kristol is on MSNBC all the time bashing Trump. My mom watched MSNBC religiously and eats up all the propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought the whole GWB is a clown thing while he was in office. Sometime into Obama&#39;s tenure I caught a piece about him and he was seemingly speaking unscripted while showing the interviewer around his ranch or something like that. The contrast was so night and day compared to the guy who was president, now that I think about it, tis kinda weird. He was well-spoken, calm and collected and much more likable than I had ever seen him as president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I say jury&#39;s out because there&#39;s a slim possibility that in 8 years Trump might do something terrible... and I&#39;d say the same thing if it were Obama, Clinton, anyone else, because I&#39;m just talking purely about possibility. Dubya is everything you said. His administration was a nightmare. He&#39;s responsible  deaths, while at the same time stripping away the rights of American citizens, and spying on us, and setting up the middle class for financial ruin.. And then Obama did nothing to undo any of it.</p>
