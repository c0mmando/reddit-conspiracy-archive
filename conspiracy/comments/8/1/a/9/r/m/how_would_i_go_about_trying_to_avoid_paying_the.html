        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know not really a conspiracy.. But who better to ask than right here? The kind of thing I know alot of people don&#39;t like obamacare.  Sure health care is great but the prices and what if I&#39;m not sick and dont need it? I did my taxes and owed 500$! I make less than 20k a year but I had non taxed tips so thats why I owed sure fair enough I guess. </p>

<p>It is kind of a conspiracy when I get to this next part. So after I filed my taxes turbotax online, I get a letter saying I got to fill out some forms and send it to the IRS about my health care. I did have health care for like 3 months but I was supposed to log in every month and make the 1.00 payment for the obamacare. I would get email notifications at first but then I stopped getting them and I must have forgot to renew and no one reminded me about anything via email etc. So pretty much if you forget for 2 months you are going to owe a penalty.</p>

<p>So now I&#39;m being forced to pay for something I didn&#39;t use. Sounds alot like theft to me. I looked into a religious exemption but it&#39;s only for &quot;recognized religious sects&quot; You have to get a signature from the religious sect that is recognized since 1950. How absurd is that? </p>

<p>So they don&#39;t recognize my religious freedoms. I&#39;m going to talk to some christian scientists . I just dont agree with obamacare and choose not to participate. I think we should have that freedom now I&#39;m looking at the penalties page and I may owe up to 2000$? even though I only made about 19k</p>

<p>The real conspiracy is the websites to make payments. I remember it was complicated and I was trying to setup automatic payments but It wouldn&#39;t let me. Then I forgot about it since I have a life. I can&#39;t think of any other bills you have to pay that dont give you a reminder until a year later and you owe 2000$. Which I hope I dont actually owe that much.</p>

<p>But the payment process is ridiculous. I had to log into 2 websites each with complicated passwords and then the bill pay had it&#39;s own password too. I think I forgot all my passwords at some point and decided to write them all down. </p>

<p>Not as complicated as the form 8963  or whatever the irs made me mail in though. They know all this stuff already but they are making me do math. It&#39;s crazy. Forcing me to spend time on something. It&#39;s not like a hate math or anything , I just want to choose where my time goes. Not only am I forced to pay whatever fee they say, but also spend a lot of time filing out the forms. Time I don&#39;t get paid for. Thats slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criterion for the affordability exemption is the cost of insurance offered by workplace is more than 8.16% of income, AND cost of marketplace insurance after the tax credit subsidy is also more than 8.16% of income. The latter was not true for OP, because an ACA plan was available that cost only $1/month. In general, because of tax credits that help pay premiums, having ACA coverage or being eligible for it almost always means the coverage was affordable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way Obamacare is setup it’s not the best. There’s a hard line for the people to get a subsidy. If you make less than around $27k it’s super cheep for Obamacare, if you make more than $27k it’s pretty expensive. </p>

<p>I would have to pay the same in insurance making $46k as someone who makes 100k...but my work covers my insurance. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I get a letter saying I got to fill out some forms and send it to the IRS about my health care. I did have health care for like 3 months</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This letter is asking you to fill out Form 8962, which may reveal that you are owed even more tax credit than you got, if your income ended up being less than what you predicted when you enrolled. It&#39;s in your interest to fill it out, in case you find you are owed more money in your tax return. On the other hand, it could reveal that your income for the year was more than you predicted, and so the amount of subsidy that the IRS paid to your insurer was more than it should have been, so you square things up with the IRS who already fronted the money for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was supposed to log in every month and make the 1.00 payment for the obamacare. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was probably a mistake to drop your $1/month coverage heavily subsidized by other taxpayers, since it was providing you with health insurance all year for so little. </p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that you may face 3/4 of the penalty for having 9 months of no coverage. It&#39;s been the law for more than four years. The penalty in this case (maybe a little over $500) can be docked from refunds. </p>

<p>Too bad that in your case this penalty way exceeds what it would have cost you to keep your insurance all year, because your income being so low made you the perfect recipient of the subsidy.</p>
