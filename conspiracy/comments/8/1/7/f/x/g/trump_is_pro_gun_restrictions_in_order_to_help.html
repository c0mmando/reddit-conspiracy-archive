<p>Consider the following:</p>

<p>The gun lobby supports Republicans. People buy more guns when Democrats win. When Republicans win, gun owners feel complacent and don&#39;t panic buy.</p>

<p>If your preferred candidate wins, and gun sales go <em>down</em>, is that really winning?</p>

<p>Scared gun owners will give to the NRA. They will buy guns from manufacturers that donate to the NRA.</p>

<p>By scaring gun owners into panic buys, Trump is enriching the NRA for the 2018 midterms.</p>

<p>If so then what could he possibly due that doesn&#39;t help them? If he opposes legislation that they oppose, then he&#39;s a stooge for the NRA. If he supports legislation they oppose, as per your claim he&#39;s helping the NRA. </p>

<p>The result is a clusterfuck of logical fallacies: special pleading, moving the goalposts, catch-22, and the fallacy of relativism. </p>

<p>A better argument would be that the gun industry itself only loses when gun violence isn&#39;t publicized, so both &quot;sides&quot; are merely working from different ends at creating an environment conducive for high weapons sales.</p>

<p>Which is why your argument doesn&#39;t stand the tests of soundness and validity. You are presupposing his position on an issue and using that supposition to create a Catch-22 where any position Trump takes is proof (to you) of your original hypothesis. That&#39;s circular reasoning. It doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Ask yourself what evidence would indicate that trump is not attempting to bolster gun sales?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So which laws could be passed to hurt gun sales, as opposed to the ones that Trump has proposed that you feel will increase them? </p>

<p>Basically it seems that you are saying that certain gun laws supported by Trump will actually increase sales rather than decrease them. So then, what&#39;s the difference between those types of laws and the types that you believe would be necessary to disprove your claim, and that actually are effective?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way this train of thought could continue is if these laws were not actually passed. It is just posturing. Kinda the same with his stance on DACA , that many moderate republicans felt was to far left in regards to citizenship. But probably nothing will happen. This may be a re election tactic. Push republicans to your right making you seem more in the middle. I think this was the whole purpose of Steve Bannon also. Have conflict with the far right ( the whole reason the book situation was aloud to happen) so Trump isn’t as bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all fear mongering bull shit. The only thing Trump is really saying is that we should be careful about people who make <strong>openly violent threats against innocent people</strong>. That&#39;s it, if you are paying attention at all, and it&#39;s common sense. Yes, if you aren&#39;t guilty of the <strong>crime</strong> of making <strong>openly violent threats against innocent people</strong>, then you may be forfeiting your rights. In the same way, you forfeit your right to freedom when you commit violent crimes. If you make threats, your guns may be taken away and you may lose your right to purchase guns. This is common sense. This is not draconian.  </p>

<p>The big problem here is WHY are so many people reaching states of violent desperation. I have some ideas on this, but people are giving in to the usual media hysteria over Trump&#39;s comments over guns and mental health. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a strong suspicion that the new classes of antidepressants and antipsychotics introduced in the 1980&#39;s were one of several capstones of project MK Ultra. They were designed to exacerbate mental health problems which exist naturally in some small percentage of our population, triggering them into a mostly irreversible state of lifelong hopelessness, nihilism, and uncontrollable rage, simultaneously numbing their fear consequences.  </p>

<p>This is coupled with an intentionally unfair social structure which some people cannot cope with. At a root level, our prosperity is robbed from us at each and every step, tied directly to the monetary system. This is part of the international cabal control structure which may or may not be imploding presently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two outcomes if this is a correct theory. 1. His base stills supports him over any democrat when the choice is given. 
2. They don’t support him and it was a horrible miscalculation. </p>

<p>I have noticed that he may be calling the democrats bluff on issues. Giving them something they want but claiming it as a victory for himself. Because democrats are weak on any unified policy platform right now, anything positive for Trump may really hurt them. The vocal left hate him so much that resistance is their main unifier. Maybe he is looking to further splinter the left by making friends. Probably not. He is just probably falling into things. </p>
