    <div class="md"><p>You certainly may. I run an educational, history channel on YouTube. I was challenged by a subscriber of mine to do a video on the Bohemian Grove. I want to do my best to share the factual side of the grove first, but I also want to make sure to represent the various theories people have about the place. The video isn&#39;t meant to be an, &quot;open your eyes to the truth&quot; type video. Instead, I want to say, &quot;here are the facts, and here are the theories... it&#39;s up to you to decide what you believe.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I first started using reddit years ago, I misused it. I did not understand the reddit culture which resulted in my account being shadow banned. I appealed to reddit about a month ago and got my account ban removed. I&#39;m just a new redditor looking to dive into the platform and learn. I love learning about History, but Conspiracy topics also intrigue me. I recently started looking into the Bohemian Grove myself and have drawn a few conclusions. I just wanted to see how they compare to others&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should start with Mark Passio. 
A lot of elitist know about energies, spirit, mentality, intent and emotions, and how all this can be used for manipulation and control. Looks like the ultimate goal many times is selfish; to help them achieve what they want. It&#39;s not a stretch assume they believe in rituals as well and practice them. In the early part of the 17th century it was fashion that the elite and philosophers of the time would practice ritual magic, before the philosophies and practices became &quot;occult&quot;.  Look into ancient Semitic religions, western philosophy,  the Thelma, low/high magic, chaos magik, Neoplatonism, Temple of Set, LaVeyan satanism.. etc.   My theory is that a lot of them have accumulated some seriously bad karma through their business deals, political pull etc.. and need a way to excuse their actions in their mind. Some of this philosophies help justify this actions and even praise them like Laveyan basic tenets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s not a very popular position around here, but I don&#39;t think any crazy occult rituals or world planning happens at Bohemian Grove. I think the simplest and most likely answer is that it&#39;s a bunch of old, rich dudes getting together to do a fuckton of blow (and god knkwd what other crazy drugs they have access to) and fuck prostitutes/each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reply! Assuming it is just a party, I can see why there would still be focus on the event. There&#39;s a lot to gain politically by smearing those who attend - whether they participate in the crazier activities or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think blackmail is the key. These political and industry figures get together, do debaucherous  shit, and in the end they all have stuff to blackmail each other with. It&#39;s all about forging a tight knit group.</p>

<p>A group falls apart when loyalty to the group is less than a member&#39;s own self interest. I think activities like Bohemia Grove, are ultimately to help ensure that loyalty is to the group and not to the individual politician&#39;s self interest or, God forbid, the people they were elected to represent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know Nixon talked about Bohemian Grove. All I can find is a quote where he called it &quot;the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the comment I&#39;m referring to. There&#39;s a photo of Nixon and Ronald Reagan at the Bohemian Grove (if the image hasn&#39;t been doctored). I assumed that he went to Bohemian Grove and then decided that the whole affair was ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a mixture of rich exclusive club of world leaders are free to do as they please without the scrutiny of the public eye, mixed with some really horrific stuff. The testimony of Paul Bonacci in the lawsuit against Larry King really solidified for me that really fucked up shit happens there on a regular basis. A lot of it is probably for use in blackmail/control. A lot of it is probably out of sadistic urges needing to be satisfied. </p>

<p>The ritualistic stuff is probably 50/50 of those that think it is just &quot;tradition&quot; along with those that are actually 100% committed in their beliefs of the ritual/satanic benefit it&#39;s self. </p>

<p>A multi series could help break it into digestible parts: </p>

<p>Members list/influence on world stage and politics</p>

<p>Camp activities/dynamics </p>

<p>Symbolism/accusations surrounding/symbols found throughout US history stemming from BH. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Men were figuratively said to forget the name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities and burned incense to them on high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch&quot;  - Albert Pike. </p>

<p>For those of you who don&#39;t know he basically wrote the Freemason Bible called &#39;Morals and Dogma&#39;. </p>

<p>The only reason we have footage of this is because of Alex Jones when he &quot;snuck&quot; into the Bohemian grove. If you do a little more digging you find that the guy he went with (forgot his name) saying they were invited. </p>

<p>Moloch is actually a cow / bull faced deity, not an owl. So I think that the &quot;cremation of care&quot; ritual was meant for us to see. It&#39;s a profane ritual. They&#39;re also showing us a 30ft owl calling it &quot;Molech&quot; when I believe it&#39;s Minerva, the owl of wisdom. I think the whole thing was purposefully shown to us to keep in a loop of misinformation. It was a &quot;ritual&quot; but it was shown incorrectly on purpose keeping us talking about this distraction ritual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it isn&#39;t that, it&#39;s that they knew they were coming and prepare for it. There are head of states, high level Hollywood actors, Oil Giants at the Bohemian Grove. It blows my mind that Alex Jones snuck in or that the Grove had such little security. </p>

<p>Also, assuming most elite or high level players are Freemasons. They would follow the teachings of Pike, his detesting of the sacrifice to Molech, is red flag to me. In my opinion they showed us an ass backwards ritual. Showing an Owl while Molech is a bull faced deity. Almost as if it was a &#39;limited hangout&#39; they let us peak behind the curtain but still showing us a disinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prior to posting my question, I couldn&#39;t make sense of the Cremation of Care ritual. The ritual that Alex Jones filmed seemed too theatrical to be taken seriously. I figured the primary purpose of holding the gathering was to party and make deals behind closed doors... and for whatever reason they performed the satanic ritual stuff for traditions sake.</p>

<p>Since posting, I can definitely see how the intense partying and rituals could be used as a form of blackmail for the members. A way to keep any one person from betraying the group&#39;s plans for the world.</p>

<p>I still can&#39;t make the idea that the rituals would be taken seriously fit the narrative. Why would men who seemingly have all the resources in the world need a deity? If they are united, they shouldn&#39;t have much difficulty making their agenda happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a men only gathering (but afaik prostitutes are allowed) and we know that occult, homosexuality and pedofilia go hand in hand since time
immemoriam. </p>

<p>here is a quote from Tjeerd Andringa, prof of cognitive sciences at the uni of groningen:</p>

<p>&quot;Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic.
I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and,
as such, are highly capable.  Normally, deep and pervasive understanding leads to to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even.
But that is precisely not what the kakistokracy needs; it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter
ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.  Enter child abuse.  By abusing children you &quot;give&quot; them an attachment disorder by violating
or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering.
With this trust violated the child&#39;s world changes from a world of opportunities to a world of potential and actual threats.
And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats and in doing so giving their autonomy away for life ...
Aristocrats and priests must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually.
And while this is despicable to people with normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning and completely ruthless
psychopaths. ... Enter child abuse again.  If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding
their veneer of respectability, they are actually completely ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy.
Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves to become blackmailable because this gives them access to the
inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they proof themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive
access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own.  After a while they become fully accepted at a level that suits their capabilities and they
will help to maintain a system that gave them so much opportunities (and can end their respectability at any poin in time).&quot;</p>
