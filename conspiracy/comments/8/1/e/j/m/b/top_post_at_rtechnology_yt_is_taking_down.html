       What? Forgottenweapons is one of the only good firearms channels I've ever seen, and ridicously unfounded conspiracy theories like that are harmful. Like fuck yeah, believe the government is secretly tyrannical. I kinda do. But don't try and tell people the pollies are fuckin lizards ffs

       It’s adtually really bad for society if unfounded beliefs become widespread. Look at the Salem witch trials. It doesn’t matter if they believe the lies, those lies can really harm us. So it’s hard to balance our 1st amendment rights with what is best for our nation

       I completely agree with you, but I still don't feel that censorship is the answer. Again, the issue there is much bigger than lack of censorship, it's societal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Seth Rich leak has already been bastardized into a right wing vs left wing conspiracy theory, so you can't even bring it up without causing anger and partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy we all collectively should be focusing on is the Federal Reserve, international banks, and the petrodollar... About as bipartisan as you can get, because they are fucking every single one of us.

       It’s not necessarily a pro censorship argument. It’s more of a “how do we get rid of flat planet and reptilian theories” question, and using the Seth rich incident as just one of many conspiracies that we should learn about and be aware of. Lumping the flat planet/reptilian theories together with other far more valid ones like fed reserve, 9/11, dnc/Seth rich, etc. is a convenient way to discredit those that actually matter—which worries me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I initially thought censorship was a good way to get rid of these, but have been convinced otherwise due to the conversation on this thread. Unlike most people on this website I am able to think with reason and am happy to change my mind if I am wrong. With that said, I still don’t see a solution to this problem if censorship isn’t the answer. I’m too impatient to deal with flat planet proponents and David icke type Guys. Science disproves flat planet theory consistently, and the reptilian thing is so beyond—I can’t even believe people think there is an ounce of substance to this shit.

       I could say the same thing about kids looking up to pseudoscientists like Neil Degrass Tyson and Bill Nye the "science" guy.  They actually claim that they are authority figures on the subject say and it could be dangerous to not listen to them about their dogmas they push.

       I'm pretty sure the attitude that you have is what is making them more stupid.  Listening to peoples opinion/ideas, doing your own research and making your mind up for yourself is how you learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to ban a subject like FE that you have never even personally researched or studied.  Now how stupid is that?

       Wait are you actually saying Neil Tyson, an actual scientist who made a career off testing to see whether scientific theories can be proven as fact or not, has less credibility on the shape of the earth than a fucking nba point guard?

       Are you sure he has tested and proven theories to be facts?  Do you have any examples?  From what I see he is a government spokesperson who pushes agendas and other scientism dogmas that can not be proven with experiment and evidence.

       You are the perfect example of brainwashing.  The "science authority figure" vs "the stupid basketball player", just like the mainstream media designed it.  You do realize that many people (myself included) had been researching the subject for 2-3 years before Kyrie had ever even heard of the topic?  So trying to tie anyone that questions the spinning ball theory to Kyrie Irving and the "stupid basketball player" archetype just shows how easily you are manipulated and unable to think for yourself.

      <p>
       I actually completely agree with this (in some instances, obviously). The marketplace of free ideas should regulate which ideas are good or bad. If a conspiracy theorist can't back up their claims, then let their theory be dismantled by counter-evidence and reason. If someone doesn't like a conspiracy theory, but can't challenge the evidence put forward, then that's just censorship to get other people not to see it.

       Good point. Here's another thing besides social pressures: If the choice we are given contains bad or worse, bad is better. Here's why:

      <p>
       As bad as MSM is, taking advantage of that and pushing people to partisan oligarchy sites is worse.

       The super users of YT, the musicians; we really  need to get them on board. Once they understand the issue and migrate, millions of their viewers will follow.
      </p>

       But until the musicians on YT go against the grain, their viewers will use YT regardless.

       Not gonna happen, there very few big youtubers left that challenge the MSM. I used to watch Philip Defranco occasionally because he would entertain alternative points of view, then he recently made a video condemning anyone who challenges the narrative of the latest shooting. Fuck that guy.

       Every time a Democrat wins the presidency, gun sales go through the roof. For that reason I think the NRA and gun companies have funded Democrat candidates campaigns covertly. Even if the Dem politician supports gun control, they know there will never be any real impact on their industry because even if sales are restricted from a Democrat law, it gives the industry even more of a boom when people stock up and hoard even more guns after a law is passed. If some gun nut has 20 guns and a Democrat is elected president, he'll buy 20 more guns. Why would gun manufacturers ever want a Republican politician to win?

       NRA preaches about far more than just guns. They pretty much support the entire partisan Republican agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since gun manufacturers are owned by the same financial interests as business generally, a better theory would be that NRA is the gun front of a much broader agenda -- sort of like the abortion issue.

       It's crazy to me that people also now attack sciences for thinking outside of the mainstream box, and also push back against those that dream big in technology terms/ideas too. Not everything has to be fact, but the ability to think, discuss and rationalise rather than follow and judge is being driven from people rather quickly and will only lead to a generation of drones.

       In before the inevitable "YouTube is a private company, they can do what they want," comment. This is now my canned response to that canned response:
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube is a government supported monopoly providing a platform for mass communication that no other company can provide because of the fact YouTube is a government sponsored monopoly. In case of an emergency or some other tumultuous event, they provide critical communication services that cannot be found anywhere else. It's status as a "private company" is a sham perpetrated to allow themselves and the government to circumvent all kinds of restrictions and regulations that would otherwise be placed on the platform and associated technology were it properly classified as a government sponsored monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: Nah man, just kidding, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Just threw that shit out there off the cuff. Sounded kinda clever in my head I guess, but now I'm reading it and realizing I probably just smoked too much reefer tonight. Peace out.

       Thanks. It's gonna be my canned response for awhile anytime this issue pops up. I've tried to make this point before a few times, usually in the form of questions to anybody who would know the legal implications better than I. I've gotten zero traction until today posting it here. First time it's been voted above +2 and nobody has even bothered trying to answer me at all when I put it in the form of a question. Imagine my surprise, here I thought it would be a great conversation starter. Anyway, have a good weekend all.

       Oh my God, the "YouTube is a private company" comments! They are absolutely everywhere! It's unbelievable the mental hoops people will jump through in order to justify censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube has an enormous monopoly on the market, if nothing else it's their moral obligation to keep up free speech on such a platform.  But what kind of silly things am I saying? Corporations like YouTube or Facebook holding up to such standards? Not something we can hope for, sadly, not at this point in the evolution of human society.

       Shockingly aware comments there. This YT purge is waking a lot of people up. That's the good news. The bad news is.. TPTB know this; I fear we're nearing the end game.

       I completely agree with you, but I still don't feel that censorship is the answer. Again, the issue there is much bigger than lack of censorship, it's societal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Seth Rich leak has already been bastardized into a right wing vs left wing conspiracy theory, so you can't even bring it up without causing anger and partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy we all collectively should be focusing on is the Federal Reserve, international banks, and the petrodollar... About as bipartisan as you can get, because they are fucking every single one of us.

       It’s not necessarily a pro censorship argument. It’s more of a “how do we get rid of flat planet and reptilian theories” question, and using the Seth rich incident as just one of many conspiracies that we should learn about and be aware of. Lumping the flat planet/reptilian theories together with other far more valid ones like fed reserve, 9/11, dnc/Seth rich, etc. is a convenient way to discredit those that actually matter—which worries me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I initially thought censorship was a good way to get rid of these, but have been convinced otherwise due to the conversation on this thread. Unlike most people on this website I am able to think with reason and am happy to change my mind if I am wrong. With that said, I still don’t see a solution to this problem if censorship isn’t the answer. I’m too impatient to deal with flat planet proponents and David icke type Guys. Science disproves flat planet theory consistently, and the reptilian thing is so beyond—I can’t even believe people think there is an ounce of substance to this shit.

       Thanks. It's gonna be my canned response for awhile anytime this issue pops up. I've tried to make this point before a few times, usually in the form of questions to anybody who would know the legal implications better than I. I've gotten zero traction until today posting it here. First time it's been voted above +2 and nobody has even bothered trying to answer me at all when I put it in the form of a question. Imagine my surprise, here I thought it would be a great conversation starter. Anyway, have a good weekend all.
