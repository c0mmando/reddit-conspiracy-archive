I myself was taken in by what I now know was foreign influenced interference (specifically &quot;slab of beef&quot; - I bought into that hard, it actually made me reassess HRC as a candidate.) so I have a little bit of a axe to grind with them. Everyone has their own things that interest them. What are some non-Russian shill talking points and goals, so I can be on the look out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you can&#39;t see the trolls doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not out there.  When you&#39;re spending millions, you can put some of that towards research to find all of the techniques to go undetected.  And that&#39;s if they&#39;re even being active.  Simple stuff like downvoting undesired content and upvoting empty fluff pieces (aka sliding) can have a powerful effect at suppressing discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not familiar with that rivalry, but what I do know is that they wanted to make this election as polarizing as they possibly could:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/">http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/</a> this was in 2014 imagine after this eleciton.</p>

<p>The soros funded &lt;insert popular movement&gt; march against trump and BLM is just a small fraction of their efforts to divide further. The efforts I&#39;ve personally seen the most of is the increasing social media polarization making everything a partisan issue pinning team blue vs team red any chance they get. Obviously fueled by shills, originating from the same source. Spewing bullshit from both sides.</p>

<p>The players just move on.</p>

<p>Taxes and gay marriage mean nothing to somebody with $10,000,000 in the bank but mean a lot to a small business owner or a gay dude working a normal job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its like one-up-manship, each generation of TPTB has to outdo the previous generation</p>

<p>eventually the little people figure it out, thanks to the internets </p>

<p>and they are still operating under the old assumption that they can create reality with their tongues or their media </p>

<p>they drifted too far from the truth, and they hit a tipping point and the public began to reject their narratives en mass, </p>

<p>and not just the current narrative, but the previous narratives as well. </p>

<p>people are reflexively revolting against the establishment and the people haven&#39;t quite realized it yet, but the establishment has</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, corrected. it doesn&#39;t really affect the point, but while i can see how you might&#39;ve interpreted it as intentional i merely skimmed the article and read &quot;IRA spent $46,000 on pre-election day Facebook ads compared to $81 million spent by Clinton&quot; - yes i see now it goes on to say &quot;and Trump&quot;</p>

<p>46,000 to 40,000,000 is ~1000 to 1 and is only a drop compared to what was spent in total, especially considering that onliners are less susceptible to advertising than couch potatoes (where the vast majority was spent)</p>

<p>your indignation over $40M or whatever the ratio between clinton/trump in the $81M is, is a little trite in the face of the billions in play such as the Saudi money flowing in via the clingon foundation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, theres this company called &quot;field work quant work&quot; who has offices all around the world. </p>

<p>DO NOT click this link, or else they will harvest your data: <a href="http://fieldwork.com">http://fieldwork.com</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1680&amp;amp;bih=1111&amp;amp;ei=q0OaWp2_K4egtQWs1o34BQ&amp;amp;q=fieldwork+quantwork&amp;amp;oq=fieldwork+quantwork&amp;amp;gs_l=img">google image search</a>. scroll down to see the nice offices they work out of </p>

<p>on the front end, they are a marketing research group who polls moms about their diaper changing habits</p>

<p>on the back end, they are internet trolls, like those you may remember on twitter etc who were backing up the Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon Bombing, and doxxing users and getting users banned, sending threatening messages by various channels </p>

<p>these fieldwork offices typically employ local people to work on local issues, however if one office needs help, other offices can be brought in to help</p>

<p>for example, when the Waltham (Boston) office of FWQW got overwhelmed by the BMB, some trolls from other offices, including from Chicago (which has 2 offices)  </p>

<p>Waltham was also assigned to 9/11, which makes sense because 9/11 was so big, plus some of the airplanes departed from Boston</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i suspect a lot of people we consider to be shills or trolls are actually just useful idiots</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot</a></p>

<p>they come in here with some pre-concieved notion of what we would be talking about, like tips on making tin foil hats</p>

<p>but instead they find all of this interesting, engaging, relevant content that challenges their world view</p>

<p>but if they stick around long enough, they start to <em>think</em> like the local population, because they are exposing themselves to the same content, and its usually presented in a calm, collected way, as opposed to wild eyed conspiracy theorists like AJ </p>

<p>so we probably had in influx of new users when Bernie got hosed by HRC and the DNC</p>

<p>we probably had an influx of new users when Trump-Russia collusion allegations were on mainstream media, and anyone searching for that content found it on our sub</p>

<p>its like a chick emerging from an egg. they gotta peck away at one spot long enough to make a tiny crack in the shell, and then soon enough the whole shell is broken away and the chick emerges into a new world </p>

<p>A cover for failed ambitions and expensive promises when an entire city of entrenched career swamp dwellers were denied their destined harvest.</p>

<p>An election was rigged.</p>

<p>It was called the Democratic Primary.</p>

<p>Seth Rich gave DNC information to Wikileaks, no &quot;Russian trolls&quot; required.</p>

<p>John Podesta gave out his password, &quot;password&quot; to a phishing scam in his gmail, like your grandma.</p>

<p>Could have been &quot;Russian Trolls&quot;, the NSA, hired political operatives or you. </p>

<p>But is it <em>better to play dominoes on pizza or pasta</em>, you bent little goblin?</p>

<p>There are a bunch of troll farms in the US. Some manipulate foreign audiences, some manipulate domestic audiences, and I know at least one does both. And this is just what we know is going on. I guarantee there is a bunch of underground stuff. </p>

<p>There are also corporate &quot;troll farms.&quot; Several large corporations have been caught doing this because it&#39;s technically against the law for them, but the risk of getting caught is minimal and the punishment is a slap on the wrist.</p>

It&#39;s already bad enough that this doesn&#39;t get reported on very much in the press, so the vast majority of people will never find out about the scale of it, but what information is out there is almost certainly just scratching the surface. </p>

<p>The most frightening thing to think about on this topic is how the amount of shilling used to be limited to the number of personnel hired to perform the task. With advancements in AI, there will very soon be no limit to the amount of manipulation, and that&#39;s assuming we aren&#39;t at that point yet. </p>

<p>Yeah.....it couldn&#39;t possibly be that millions of Americans actually supported socialist Sanders &amp; Trump and then wrote passionately online about it during &amp; after the whole election season.</p>

<p>Nah it couldn&#39;t be that the US corporate networks plugged Trump constantly with only soft questioning until THE SOCIALIST dropped out. The networks then started slamming Trump daily.</p>

<p>Trump had UNPRECEDENTED access to the media as a presidential candidate measured in hours. Obama didn&#39;t even come close by comparison.</p>
