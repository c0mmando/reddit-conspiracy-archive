       Guy is wearing a "SCIENCE: You cant pray for knowledge" (or something similar, I couldn't give less of a fuck what it actually says) - and then later in his post he says "I stopped and deleted everything I "believed" or "felt"" - this guy sounds more like an atheist, trying to rub one out on conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked about theories, etc - he side stepped any examples of REAL conspiracy and just said "Milli Vanilli" - guy is obviously some kind of scientific fundamentalist/atheist trying to shit on things he doesn't have the time for anymore "since he has so much money from his entry level job and psychiatrist".

       But maaan...those comments! What is the deal with reddit? It all just seems so damn shilly. So the only way to be sane, according to these folks, is to accept the official story the gub-ment feeds you. Ok, I'll start with Vegas. Which official story would they like me to believe?

       Every human just wants to feel right, feel safe, and feel ideologically related/understood.  These are all essentially the same.  People will put up with a lot of logical fallacy to achieve or experience these feelings.

       You are so entirely right. It’s just such a shame. We could all be so much more if only we allowed ourselves the chance to stop and question the world around us. I encounter too many people who choose to agree to the perception of popular consensus over thinking for themselves. Like it’s more important to belong to a gang than it is to believe in what that gang stands for.

       It's unbelievable honestly. People are literally begging to be brainwshed, begging to not think critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously not all conspiracies are true, but who is saying that? However, if you think that literally ALL conspiracies are bullshit, then you need an incredible reality check, while it is very likely your naivety has reached levels yet unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very wiki of this sub has a list of proven conspiracies and that list is
       <em>
        vast

       Threads like that AMA just boggle my mind. It just makes me lose some hope for the human race...it's unfathomable really how dumb and sheepish people can be. It's just unbelievable.

       Maybe you have such a victim mentality that everything seems "shilly?" He's half right about the disenfranchised being more apt to believe conspiracies to blame for all their problems.

       Yeah love all the armchair psychologists stroking their chins and saying things like “conspiracy theorists are really just trying to make sense and order the world. They’re probably unhappy with their lives so they like to think it’s because people are trying to keep them down etc etc”
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say things like that I think of the Aldous Huxley quote that goes something like “we’ll teach them to love their servitude”
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think it’s more insane to believe that wealthy dynastic families who still marry to consolidate wealth and power wouldn’t work towards staying wealthy and powerful. It would actually be crazier to think they weren’t. Isn’t it pragmatic and logical from their perspective hold onto what they have and if possible accumulate more? No, apparently it’s delusional to think that. If you believe you’re a “sceptic” because you believe the official narrative without question then surely that’s actual crazy to automatically assume that side is telling the truth because they’ve told you they’re the authority. Questioning something based on available evidence doesn’t mean you’re mad or stupid especially when it’s often in the elite’s own words in the form of reports and books from think tanks, policy groups.

       The people in the thread argue with feeling not with facts. Because they can't argue against wikileaks and the kind of documents that show that there are microphones randomly placed in SMART TVs. Or that the facebook is recording all the time.All these things are official and known, even though they were conspiracies before.

       Off topic but about the TVs... I thought it was that the speakers could somehow be used as mics, and there was a code inserted to make the tv appear off but stay on to record?

       What is the argument? I read parts of the thread briefly and it seems that the argument is that conspiracy theorists are victims who blame outside forces for their own failures. If that’s the case the. I can say I’m all too aware that any failure in my life is of my own doing. I don’t consider myself to be a victim of anything but my own choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s enough evidence out there for people to come to the conclusion that the elite are out for themselves. I don’t agree that people believe the wealthy want to hold onto their wealth. Maybe in some abstract concept they agree but once names are given to the people with the money and the power people will shut down. They’ll believe that companies are greedy but think family dynasties are a fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course if you believe in something without proof based on what you feel to be true that’s a silly position to take. It’s equally silly to dismiss evidence because you don’t believe that people might work together against the masses. I’m not sure the argument to which you’re referring. I was just trying to point out a lot of the arguments made against conspiracy theorists is based on some patronising idea that were shaking our fists to the heavens because we have a victim mentality of the world conspiring to keep humanity down. Shouldn’t the mentality of always wanting to trust authority and dismiss questioning the off the official narrative be equally mocked? It’s only ever conspiracy theorists who are called morons etc

       You are basically doing a strawman. Everyone agrees that rich and powerful people will do things to benefit themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where people diverge is in the belief that everything bad happens for a reason and is controlled by those powerful people. That does not mean the same thing as believing everything you are told. That is another strawman.

       I think he's referring to how much value the guy places on identifying as an atheist. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with it. I used to call myself one, but I wasn't satisfied with the idea that were just a cosmic Big Bang accident in an infinite universe with no significance. I continued doing research with the same intensity as before and now I've dropped the label and no longer believe that there is no God. Just everything relating to sacred geometry suggested to me some kind of inherent mathematical guide, the result of a directed intelligence. Then I realized NASA is lying to us and I dropped most of the western beliefs about science that I was taught. Looking back, as an American, I was taught the scientific method, but if they tell you what you can and can't investigate, then that isn't science, that's Science (from authority). Anyway, my point is that if you consider yourself an atheist because you're basing your beliefs on the findings of modern western thought, then please keep researching. You're not done.

       How many jobs have you gone looking for where they just gave you money, then gave you absolute free reign to do what you want with your time?  Not many legit ones I’d guess.  Neither of the things you mentioned is anyone telling you what you can or can’t investigate, it just looks like you can’t get handouts for it or get accolades for it.  You’re still free to investigate all you want.

       And then what? People in the scientific community will not just parade your study around. If it is on a topic that goes against something they're working on, then they won't just ignore it, but will try to destroy your reputation as not credible or not a real scientist. Then you've got all these debates from lay people on whether the person's research is significant, mostly because one half takes them at face value and the other half is influenced by the personal attacks to see the original researcher as a "pseudoscientist."

       Thank you for this. The only “conspiracy” I got from his ama was that he was a lazy shit and didn’t work and was broke. So he blamed it on everyone but himself. I’m not sure where the conspiracy was, but was definitely misrepresentative of people who are open to the ideas of conspiracy theories.

       Yeah, from what I read the guy wasn't a former 'conspiracy theorist' anyways, he was a guy with paranoid delusions - when he talked about how he has left behind his previous 'beliefs', he was saying things like "no longer believe people/govt are out to get me".

       I'm not here to comment about that dude, only to mention something regarding the latter section of your title. I'm not going to say it's right to demonize conspiracy theorists or attack them when the individual may very well have good intentions behind their beliefs and just want to protect/get to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to point out that conspiracy theories have the potential to become a subversive weapon of war. If you look back to the cold war/the matters Yuri Bezmenov spoke of.. you see how cunning the enemy can be. Ruining an enemy country from the inside out via information warfare is all a part of their comprehensive plan.

       Throughout there years if you add up all conspiracy theories that paint the united states in a bad light - saying we support terrorism,

        kill our own people
       </a>
       , etc which causes us to distrust our own country... the more people that believe it - the more our patriotic morale is lowered.

       <em>
        TPTB

       , I'd need some clarification to go further but I think even our leaders have the ability to be fooled into wars, make mistakes, etc.

       If you strip away the muck and look to what the USA stands for at its core - it's something to be proud of. It's a shame we've been infiltrated and bullshitted for so long though. Seeing as we defend against those that would enslave and conquer us, I'm pretty glad we exist despite our many flaws.

        The reconstructed autonym *Slověninъ is usually considered a derivation from slovo ("word"), originally denoting "people who speak (the same language)," i. e. people who understand each other, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely němьcь, meaning "silent, mute people" (from Slavic *němъ "mute, mumbling"). The word slovo ("word") and the related slava ("glory, fame") and slukh ("hearing") originate from the Proto-Indo-European root *ḱlew- ("be spoken of, glory"), cognate with Ancient Greek κλέος (kléos "fame"), whence comes the name Pericles, Latin clueo ("be called"), and English loud.

       In other news, did you know that the Gaelic language is actually a form of early homosexual cant, like a medieval polari? We know this because it is a compound of two words: gae, meaning gay of course, and lic or lich, which means tongue or language.

       I guess asking for a pediatrician who is anti-vaxx is trashy for a lot of people.

       The most crazy comment on the Reddit post is:

      <blockquote>

       Don't worry. Sperm rates are plummeting already, before the unvaccinated children get to boink. And yes, this sub is open to the idea that adjuvants may not be the best thing to be giving people. This sub is also open to the idea that while stopping the spread of disease is desirable, the means in which some of these drugs are pushed, is not for the good of the populace,but rather the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.

       Good episodes:

       War On Drugs, Recycling, Second-hand Smoke, Environment Hysteria, PETA...

       I remember it being about how most recycling takes much more energy then the benefit you get.

       It exception being can/metal recycling because its still harder to mine more metal.

      <p>
       Eventually mindless consumptive comfort becomes consent for all of the machinations of power brokers you never consider while you climb your own sliding ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making capacity of thought and subscription to belief boil down to by-product of social status is a boring, well worn cliche.

       I think it was more he became successful and, for him, he was using conspiracy theories as an excuse for his lack of success. His position actually applies regardless of if the conspiracy theories are true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who is using some conspiracy theory as an excuse as to why they aren't making as much money as they want, why they haven't achieved personal or profession goals, etc. is probably better off without them. Or at least better off shifting their focus to help them achieve their goals.

       If conspiracy theories or any other mental exercise is your excuse for why you aren’t getting up and out and improving yourself, then it’s probably a good idea to give them up and focus on going to the gym and studying.

       Blaming things outside of yourself is not a productive strategy. It's always better to blame yourself when you don't achieve your goals.

       By blaming external forces you surrender all agency.

       Interesting irony in the linked thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       People make fun of conspiracy theorists because they make a lot of  assumptions about things they can't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in the thread themselves make a lot of assumptions about something they know nearly nothing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       With stuff like wikileaks and the very obvious spying on citizens going on, I find it very frightening that people still think that the government would ever do something malicious to them. Gulf of Tunkin? Syphilis tests on Blacks without their consent? No, never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a testament to the success of the brainwashing machinery, Edward Bernays would've been so proud. But what do I know, I'm just a retarded conspiracy theorist.

       I posted below, but he didn't mention a single conspiracy theory that he use to believe...probably cause he's a shill and didn't do his homework.

       I posted that Mueller is a conspiracy theorist and he responded "sometimes you find a witch." I replied that him shitting on conspiracy theorist as a whole when real conspiracies exist is wrong then. Not a peep. Can't even see the comment on my coworkers phone.

       That's a bit scary. I had to scroll about 1/2 way down the comments to see a single person questioning his blind acceptance that all conspiracies are fake and die to poor people not having jobs and stability.

      <p>
       One user linked our sidebar of "confirmed conspiracies" and of course the guy was too busy to not respond to that post and question....go figure.

       The further you have to go down shows you how many shills and bots they employ to wash out legit comments.  More and more as time goes on.  They realized a long time ago they could slide legit comments to the bottom, and even on some of those "touchy" subjects like the holocaust and such, they slide more and more to the bottom 500 which don't even show up and most people wouldn't bother looking at.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all part of the plan, all by design.

       One helpful thing is still pointing it out here will result in people seeing how one sided things have become and more and more will become aware of the manipulation.

       In 1984 (ive only seen the movie) the TV literally watches/listens in on the protagonist. To the point where if he wants to do anything he has to blast his TV's volume and hide in a corner where it can't see him.
