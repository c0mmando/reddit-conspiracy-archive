<p>&quot;Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how ‘sensitive they are to criticism.’&quot;</p>

<p>If he had no improper contact, he wouldn&#39;t lie, pretty simple. He did have improper contact, got caught, plead guilty for his family and country so his charges were reduced and hidden so others weren&#39;t tipped off to what the investigation has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn was cleared of any wrongdoing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-reviewed-flynns-calls-with-russian-ambassador-but-found-nothing-illicit/2017/01/23/aa83879a-e1ae-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html?utm_term=.b186f6f5f8a7">early</a> in the investigation:</p>

<p>&quot;The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn — national security adviser to then-President-elect Trump — but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government, U.S. officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/michael-flynn-plea-agreement-documents">charge</a> is not for &quot;improper contact&quot; its&#39; for lying about the contact to the FBI. And the FBI knew this because they had the calls. So, if there was improper contact, they would have known it.</p>

<p>&quot;On Friday, the special counsel charged former national security adviser Michael Flynn with one count of making false statements to the FBI in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) regarding his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty in D.C. federal district court at a 10:30 a.m. hearing. &quot;</p>

<p>Muh firing Jeff Sessions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The president can fire Sessions whenever he damn well pleases. That&#39;s his right under the Constitution. Just like he can fire <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/Politics/alan-dershowitz-trump-constitutional-authority/2017/06/19/id/796825/">Comey</a> if he wants:</p>

<p>&quot;President Donald Trump was exercising his constitutional authority when he fired James Comey as the head of the FBI, and should not come under criminal prosecution for his decision, Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz argued Monday.</p>

<p>&quot;I come not to praise President Trump nor to defend his policies, but to defend the constitution,&quot; Dershowitz said during an early morning legal debate with CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on the network&#39;s &quot;New Day&quot; program. </p>

<p>&quot;The president of the United States should not be subject to criminal prosecution for merely exercising his constitutional authority.&quot;</p>

<p>In the absence of any specific statutes in the matter, a president not only has the right to fire an FBI director, Dershowitz continued, but has the power &quot;to tell the director of the FBI who to investigate and who not to investigate.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, Flynn was &quot;cleared&quot; of the crimes, I am suggesting maybe the contacts were improper and the FBI is hiding that so the Trump campaign does not know everything they are investigating. Why would he lie about entirely proper contacts? Seems fishy.</p>

<p>I just showed you, there is no law prohibiting firing the FBI director &quot;for illegal reasons.&quot; The president can instruct the FBI director not to prosecute someone, or fire the FBI director, even if it benefits the president, and it&#39;s not a crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would he lie about entirely proper contacts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because he was a high-level official doing his job and didn&#39;t want to let the FBI know he had (legally) discussed the matter of sanctions, because the FBI was leaking like a sieve and it would get out to the media and affect foreign relations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obstructing justice is always a crime. We know there is no law making it illegal to fire someone for illegal reasons because the firing is already illegal. If you obstruct justice on purpose in any way, you committed a crime. Bill Clinton obstructed justice by lying, Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.</p>

<p>The FBI knew he called the diplomat, he should know the FBI monitors foreign diplomats. Lying does nothing unless there were further meetings that haven&#39;t come to light that he wanted to hide. If the whole intelligence community were after him you&#39;d think he would be worse off than not and jail and still allowed to walk around free. For an example, look at Manafort, dozens of indictments, GPS monitor, house raided, all possessions seized, conviction = death in prison, this is what going after someone looks like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is in charge of the FBI and DOJ. That means he has prosecutorial discretion over what they investigate, and who he appoints to those offices. That means he can&#39;t obstruct justice by instructing them not to investigate something.

<p>Remember, Comey is a witness to the investigation as the head of FBI and after the dinners/loyalty meetings with Trump. Again, I am not arguing whether or not Trump CAN fire him, its whether this specific firing was illegal, which is likely. </p>

<p>Oh shit so his tweets land him in prison for 10 years. Even if he just conspired with others to smear Comey its 10 years! Makes a lot of Fox news look guilty as hell.

<p>&quot;The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn — national security adviser to then-President-elect Trump — but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government, U.S. officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/michael-flynn-plea-agreement-documents">charge</a> is not for &quot;improper contact&quot; its&#39; for lying about the contact to the FBI. And the FBI knew this because they had the calls. So, if there was improper contact, they would have known it.</p>

<p>&quot;On Friday, the special counsel charged former national security adviser Michael Flynn with one count of making false statements to the FBI in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2) regarding his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty in D.C. federal district court at a 10:30 a.m. hearing. &quot;</p>

<p>Muh firing Jeff Sessions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The president can fire Sessions whenever he damn well pleases. That&#39;s his right under the Constitution. Just like he can fire <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/Politics/alan-dershowitz-trump-constitutional-authority/2017/06/19/id/796825/">Comey</a> if he wants:</p>

<p>&quot;President Donald Trump was exercising his constitutional authority when he fired James Comey as the head of the FBI, and should not come under criminal prosecution for his decision, Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz argued Monday.</p>

<p>&quot;I come not to praise President Trump nor to defend his policies, but to defend the constitution,&quot; Dershowitz said during an early morning legal debate with CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on the network&#39;s &quot;New Day&quot; program. </p>

<p>&quot;The president of the United States should not be subject to criminal prosecution for merely exercising his constitutional authority.&quot;</p>

<p>In the absence of any specific statutes in the matter, a president not only has the right to fire an FBI director, Dershowitz continued, but has the power &quot;to tell the director of the FBI who to investigate and who not to investigate.&quot;&quot;</p>
