       The conspiracy against our first amendment rights is about to get a lot worse for the American public.  If you are ok with banning Jones and others because "Youtube is a private business, and its their right", get ready for a flood of businesses to start discriminating against people on both sides of the political line based on morals, beliefs, ect.

       Its the same as the bakery not wanting to bake a cake for a gay wedding, it's picking and choosing what/how people express their first amendment rights and it wrong for our society as a whole. I mean imagine if the MSM decided that you could no longer come on their platform and say anything negative about Trump?  Would you/America be ok with that?  They are a private company after all?

       I don't think it's the same. It's more like a casino demanding patrons wear shoes before allowing entry. If you want to use the service you must abide by the rules.

       its' NOT a 1A issue unless the government is specifically instructing which YT accounts be sanctioned and/or is enacting legal sanction/penalties for expressing an idea.

      <p>
       There are
       <strong>
        definitely
       </strong>
       similarities between YT and the bakery, but what the bakery did was
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       a 1A issue.  What the bakery did was a
       <strong>
        discrimination
       </strong>
       issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its become very, very clear YT has not been applying their ToS equally.  As a private company, YT gets to do quite alot, and ToS'es are written to very much favor the provider of a service, but ToS has to be applied equally.  This is going to blow up for YT,

       The cake analogy is a bit of a stretch. The cake issue would be akin to a newspaper saying "We won't sell a newspaper to you because you're gay", versus the Alex Jones issue being like them saying "We won't publish your editorials since we don't want them associated with our brand."

       Bakery metaphor just does not work. Here is better. It may not work neither. It's just better.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       In a town there is a cafe named "Ideology X Coffee Shop". On the shop's door there is a text saying
       <em>
        "This is the best place in town to share ideas about ideology X and have a cup of coffee at the same time. Please behave and respect others. Welcome!"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       One day a new customer walks in. Obviously this customer strongly supports ideology
       <strong>
        Y
       </strong>
       . The customer is not alone - there are couple of other Y-supporters who too come to this cafe everyday. But this new customer just can not behave. This person shouts and yells, throws  accusations, attacks others. Perhaps the text on the door went unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cafe owner is ideologically neutral but sees how the business declines: market share was backed up by X-customers who are now moving out, only because of one jerk who cannot or is not willing to read the text at the entrance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The owner points out the text but eventually kicks out the troublemaker because nothing else seems to make the desired effect. Next day the heckler comes back and now the police is called.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You cannot kick me out just because I support ideology Y! It's against Amendment 1234! I need my effen soy vanilla latte!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "We are not kicking you out because of your ideology. You see, there are many Y-customers having some coffee", says the officer. "We kick you out because you cannot behave. We protect owner's rights and I am obliged to secure the public safety of well-behaving citizens. It has nothing to do with Amendment 1234, but Rule 5678. Drink your coffee somewhere else."
      </p>
      <p>
       Next week a brand new cafe is opened - it's run by Customer Y, the heckler. Cafe's name is "Ideology Y Coffee Shop". On the door there is a text saying
       <em>
        "This is the best place in town to share ideas about ideology Y and have a cup of coffee at the same time. Please behave and respect others. Welcome!"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very, very small cafe. There are only two tables, but all Y-supporters who live in the town can fit in. They think it is the best place in the world. Soon it becomes the only cafe they visit and they tend to assume there is a strong general correlation between coffee drinking tradition and ideology Y. Their own experience acts as comprehensive proof...
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day the police officer walks by these both cafes and is ready to protect both owners, all customers, laws and amendments. He's happy they are all coffee drinkers after all. And thank God those tea drinking ideology Z supporters were kicked back to Great Britain during the War of 1812.

       It's more like getting banned from a video game for what you say in chat.  Even if you paid for the game, if you piss enough people off you are going to get booted.  Freedom of speech only protects you from being arrested.

       . But for now, the focus on him is distracting from all of the people who have actually been perma-banned. People who, as you would say, are average joes. And it's not like you just get your channel banned, it's everything. gmail, google+, everything.

       The whole "it's technically legal for them to censor you" argument is also a distraction from the core issue.
       <em>
        Should

       YouTube do this? Is it okay for a corporation to masquerade as neutral, siphoning up traffic and support from the majority of the country, only to turn around and use their position for political censorship? It doesn't matter if it's legal or not.

       I don’t think it needs to be illegal or against thier rules for YouTube to deplatform people in order for it to be wrong. We need diverse voices in the public square or else the internet will become one big echo chamber. After a few years of only those with the “right” ideas having a platform, people will no longer understand opposing arguments. Those who push the boundary of acceptable speech will become outcasts and no one will listen to them, even when they are right. They will be seen as dangerous and laws prohibiting thier speech may be passed. Our society will become very intellectually unhealthy. Those who control the flow of information will control society, as it was in the days before the internet (only by degree has this changed). You can see how this moves things closer to totalitarianism. That is why we oppose people being deplatformed, and it is very much in line with the spirit of the first amendment of the US constitution.

       I’m sure he could. No idea if the cost of doing so changes the cost/benefit calculation, but I would assume it does. For most people that use YouTube, building their own platform would be a losing proposition.

       Not really, youtube isn't a public utility or his only means of publicity. He was around before you tube on public access tv, he could always go back. People can either stop using youtube because they don't like the way the operate, find an alternative, or throw themselves a pity party. I ended up on reddit because digg changed , it was no longer community centered. Youtube won't be any different.

       No, it's not arguable.  Even if YouTube's advertisements are lies, it would be a civil false advertising claim, not a first amendment issue.

       But it's not reality! It's another platform dependent on peoples creative content as ad revenue platform. Just don't use it. If content creators start feeling control they can go  and upload to Vimeo or something. In this case, the Power lies with content creators
 Youtube has no power over them. They command viewers and content creation.

       Technically you are correct. However, I think you are missing an important aspect:
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewers MAKE A CHOICE to click on a video.
Viewers can CHOOSE to “like” and even share a video. By design, the “cream will rise to the top”.
Viewers can ALSO CHOOSE to stop watching a video, “dislike” and leave a very negative comment in the comment section. They can even FLAG and REPORT any video they deem offensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       By encouraging YouTube to now be preemptively discriminatory, you are also advocating for the further and continual removal of YOUR OWN POWER as an individual.

       The problem is that people want censorship, but also want to say they believe in Free Speech. They've out-sourced something that would be illegal for the state to do to corporate gatekeepers. It weakens the power of the state and makes censorship an unregulated function of corporations.

       This right here. I absolutely believe Alex Jones has a right to free speech. I don't like him because he sells his conspiracy talk to shill his snake oil vitamin crap. But he absolutely has a right to say and publish whatever he wants. But companies that do not wish to publish his content do not have to do so.  Advertisers are not obligated to continue funding him. If you've ends up eventually deleting him, he will find a new home. Even if he has to start his own streaming service and charge a fee or something, here can still get his voice out there. This is not a first amendment issue, the govt has nothing to do with it. This is consumer driven.

       It is also conspiracy. To rise to the top in a cronyist system is a disgrace.

       If you think Alex Jones is motivated by anything other than money, you are retarded. He makes up insane lies at the drop of the hat every day, no matter what the news is about, he makes shit up and pumps out content to keep revenue flowing. Everyone bending over backwards and crying about losing this is pathetic. If you want to be a member of the resistance, go out and do something that helps working class people, don't sit around and watch a fat texan make money off of your ignorance.

       Every media personality is "playing a character" to a degree. They can't be like how they are on camera 24/7. From what I've seen/heard about Jones, he is pretty much "Alex Jones" 24/7. He's kind of a rediculous person to begin with. Hell, you can find videos of him from 20 years ago and he's pretty much the same guy just much thinner and younger looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, isn't this from his divorce? Dude was trying to get custody of his kids at the time, it sounds like he's willing to damage his career if it means he gets to see his kids more. That seems admirable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think he's full of shit but he can be entertaining at times. It's scary how much people hate this guy. People wish so much ill will on him it's frightening.

       When asked in court wether he believed in the news he was spreading, he said it was "performance art". That's what he thinks about the accuracy of his show.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a crook selling untested, copper-riddled supplements, often using actors as doctors: the whole conspiracy thing is just a way to keep viewers glued to the screen until the next commercial.

       Their character does not imply any creation of content (or, to put it in a simpler manner, lies). That ansswer was given by AJ when he was asked in court about the accuracy of his show. He basically admitted it's all play and pretend

       Then he is playing a character. Ones doing that are usually called as "actors".

       So, you're only ok with him being censored because he breached youtube's terms of agreement.  That's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people are upset because Youtube seems to be enforcing their terms subjectively for political reasons.  But, that's a different argument.

       But he’s not being censored. YouTube aren’t stopping him saying what he wants or even recording it, they just won’t provide him with a platform.

       And his channel at the time of writing is still there.

       Okay, so we're supposed to believe that Alex Jones is not politically motivated but in fact just financially motivated. What about the Russian trolls that Mueller just indicted? Are we supposed to believe the opposite? That they were politically motivated and not simply financially motivated by clickbait ad revenue?

       Because people are acting like the new indictment validates the claim that Russians influenced our election. A huge number of people believe that. I just found your comment interesting in the current context, because I am inclined to field the same way about people who think Russian trolls and their masters are motivated by anything but money.

       A lot of it was motivated by money, but then we are entering the discussion about how a lot of politics is purely motivated by money, but I see your point.

       For example,
       <a href="http://archive.is/YtGpT">
        4 percent of the Internet Research Agency tweets (compared to 8 percent for the election) were posted to undermine the US fossil fuel industry.

       Many environmental blogs are written with the best of intentions, but many of them are click-bait ad revenue generators. There are certain topics which have a tendency to lead people towards blogs. We can't reasonably claim to know the intentions of this Internet Research Agency because it is entirely possible that their business model centers around identifying those topics which have a lot of activity on blogs and alternative media sources, and social media is the easiest way to lead people towards their various blogs. However, every supposed propaganda post that I see claimed to be Russian propaganda is just repeating something that other people already believed and were already writing about and making blogs about. True or false, people will operate semi-legitimate blogs which are intended to be genuinely agreeable to people who follow those issues on social media, even if the people curating the blog have no genuine interest in the topic. That doesn't make the information propaganda because they didn't necessarily care about changing minds. They weren't putting out some high quality product with carefully constructed lies, they were merely exploiting the natural internet activity of regular people to grab a fraction of that ad revenue. At least that's how it looks to me. If this was a propaganda influence campaign, they obviously didn't think it through very well.

       Giant companies have guidelines and people like Alex Jones aren't allowed to break those guidelines with impunity. Either way I'm pretty positive this is nothing more than a publicity stunt from Jones to get people like you riled up. I'm willing to bet you $100- (loser donates the $100- to the charity of the winner's choosing) that YouTube doesn't delete his channel. We on?

       But it's okay, because the more the left shuts down the opposition voices, the apparent it is that the left is a fascist communist movement.

       I think YOURE the one unfamiliar with our 1st, bronson. Free speech applies to our GOVERNMENT not being allowed to arrest you for voicing your opinion. It DOES NOT apply to a private company enforcing it’s own rules as it sees fit. Ever seen a sign at a store that says “we reserve the right to refuse service”....??? Cause that’s how that works with private companies.

       Well, I’m no lawyer so I genuinely don’t know. If they DID arrest you for that I’d assume that if you have even close to a competent lawyer, or unless you’re dealing with a commie judge, that case would get laughed out of the courtroom before someone could even make the laughing noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said I’m no lawyer, but if you got prosecuted for calling a cop a pig fucker......shit man at that point you and I BOTH have problems waaaay deeper than your individual case

       .....I’m really not sure how you’re getting that?The first amendment protects you against the government shutting down your speech, not fucking YouTube. Care to explain to me how when I think a private company enforces it’s rules I believe that means no free speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here perhaps this can help: if you walk up to your boss and say “fuck you, you have a tiny dick and I hope that one day you fall in a fire then get tossed out and eaten by wildebeasts in the Australian outback”....we can both assume your boss would fire you yes? Now would you claim your boss is stifling your free speech or would you realize that a private company is under no obligation to employ jackasses that mouth off to their boss?

       If you read my previous comments on this very topic you would see that I very clearly implied I couldn’t give even half a fuck about what a private bakery does. If they want to refuse to make a cake for a gay couple, they are welcome too. So try again sir. Now give me your next attempt at how a private business isn’t allowed to refuse service to anyone that violates their terms/beliefs.

       Banning AJ has nothing to do with the first amendment or trying to keep alternative media out of mainstream channels. It has to with a more than year long battle between youtube and their advertisements.

       I think this is totally the play as well. His videos aren't monotized anymore on Youtube (cuz most aren't anymore) and wether he liked it or not that channel brought in a lot of income. Now he's moving his platform to place where he can make money on the videos. Even if his channel was getting shutdown by Youtube he would be dumb not to seize on the opportunity considering the publicity he's going to get if he puts up a big stink.

       I always thought Alex Jones was controlled opposition. There was an instance where he started talking about Israel and then stopped and changed basically. Almost as if some 3-letter entity reached out to him and started using him for their agenda.

       Is he being decommissioned now? Instead of saying that his contract was up and reveal the treason, it's basically because of YouTube? Watch out on InfoWars going offline as well.

       Stop talking about the first amendment, and start talking about free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you limit yourself to the US constitution, and not the more general term "free speech", you allow these simplistic dismissals like you see as the top rated comment on this post, and like you mentioned already in your post. Don't feed them an easy argument like that.

       Maybe someone changed their mind after his fan outrage. If someone switched the plan it does not prove that it was bullshit. We have seen the same happen to others (tweet acc banned etc.) just to get reinstated afterwards after users/fans start attacking the company that is censoring the user.

       Discrimination is something you heard of? Not? When i don't let you in my shop and refuse you my service because you're homo, hetero or bisexual, white, black or hispanic, then this is called discrimination. 
When i sent you out of the door because you're talking bullshit, lies, scare and offend my other customers, then it is my right as a private business runner to refuse you my service. Got it. Isn't so hard to understand.

       When a hairdresser would refuse to offer them service just because of the bakers religious beliefs and he would be so stupid to openly admit it, then yes it would be an discrimination. Would also be an discrimination if he wouldn't admit it, but nobody could really prove this.

       A long time ago a law was created in which it was unlawful to yell fire in a theater. Now was this a infringement on your 1st amendment rights or was it an attempt to keep people from being trampled trying to escape a prank by an idiot. What Alex Jones is, is a prankster yelling fire in a crowded theater. And what is happening is the responsible people that are in the theater telling him to sit down and shut up. He's plain and simply a NUTBAG!

       When did YouTube start warning channels that they would be deleted?  Interesting how every other channel gets shut down without warning, but not this time.  Alex Jones would never lie to sell quack medicine, right??

       Conspiracy. Alex Jones is getting his channel deleted on purpose. Publicity regarding it considering it is a big ass channel and he has a following. Then releases a revamped Info Wars or some new site and boom you got traffic. Just the way I'm looking at it. I also think if companies start doing that they will only censor the far left and far right stuff. It's still bad but I don't think Twitter is just gonna straight outright ban anyone with a conservative hint in their tweets.
