    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. It wouldn’t be surprising anyways honestly, Youtube is a private company and can ban or “censor” whoever they choose to, especially if they’ve reprimanded the person multiple times before. </p>

<p>That’s the risk you take when using a platform like Youtube or Twitch etc.. They can do whatever they want- it’s their company unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All people defending the rights of a big company as YouTube in way of: &quot;it&#39;s MY house, MY rules&quot;, try to see it this way:</p>

<p>You defending YouTube is like saying; You have all rights to Your personal houserules if You host a party in Your house and on Your property.</p>

<p>If You invite all people from one small city into Your house for a party, pretend to be a perfect host, give them free drinks and food for the evening and let them be on their own afterwards as normal. Then you Your &quot;full rights and rules&quot; in Your own house, all people are actually guests here in this case.</p>

<p>Now You are very rich and you loved the party and the responses You got and You decide to host another party. Well oke, the same rules and rights apply once again.</p>

<p>But now You go big and host a party every other weekend. Most people will be enthousiast becouse of the free drinks, food, easy company. An easy escape from reality is within reach for everybody.</p>

<p>Well ask Yourself, who would be the people &quot;crying wolf&quot; in the background? Could it be the owners of the 2 local bars?</p>

<p>Oke, they complain and You see no problem becouse &quot;money rules all&quot; and You have a lot. So, instead of letting Yourself get less attention You buy out the bars and the owners come work for You as extra &quot;hosts&quot; during the 2 weekends when one of the bars is now closed.</p>

<p>Great, problem solved, nobody seems unhappy and You have still got all rights on your side... But maybe not all people are happy and they have no voice left becouse all other people are shouting louder... Could the persons who used to work in the bars be out of a job now becouse one bar is closed more often?</p>

<p>No problem, if they like they are welcome in Your house and do some little tasks while staying there. Actually, You were thinking of breaking down one bar completely to make room for some new gasts at the parties. In fact, You start to give parties every weekend, the whole weekend long.</p>

<p>Well, the whole town is happy, free food and drinks for all and when someone is complaining they just need to join You. And if they don&#39;t, well, there is the door of Your house, it is a free world after all.</p>

<p>But it is getting expensive now, somehow there seem to be a lot of people from outside the city and while they don&#39;t play according to Your houserules, they keep within the limits of the law. Oke, no problem, You switch from beer from the local brewery to a cheap brand and start to buy food and other supplies from other suppliers a town over for much cheaper.</p>

<p>Yes, problem solved, oh shit... Now the brewery and local shops are getting way less income and they all start to go bankrupt slowly. Oke, You decide to buy them out, but according to Your rules You only comensate those people living in Your city. Slowly but surely many people start to complain more and more, but the majorety of residents still don&#39;t see or have any problem with You and Your parties. And hey, it is Your house, they are able to leave, You have Your rights.</p>

<p>More and more of the residents become dependent of You and the ones that don&#39;t want that for whatever reason are moving to the next town becouse they can find a job there again without You involved somehow. Sure they get less payed or need to work much harder, but at least they still have their freedom. Right..?</p>

<p>Your party evolves further and futher, slowly Your old small city becomes a capital and there are now so many people you are forced to buy all your supplies over the internet directly from foreighn suppliers. Slowly but surely You are now changing the whole country and even the whole world with Your &quot;privet&quot; party...</p>

<p>And one day you are wondering arround &quot;your&quot; party and start to wonder who all the people are who surround you and seem completely strangers to you and you decide You need to make a raddical decission becouse many guest became a threat to Your houserules and &quot;stuff&quot; so You decide to adjust Your houserules to get rid of some, in Your opinion, unwanted guests.</p>

<p>This is the point we are at right now, sure You have the right to change Your rules at Your party, but is is still just Your party if so many people became depended of You in one way or the other? Shoud it by now not be the Law of the country that needs to followed instead of only Your personal houserules?</p>

<p>Can you imagine now why some people might be somewhat upset over the desicions You made, even when You made them always completly within all existant rights and laws..?</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line YouTube went from being a privet party to being an public event. And while many people still see the party a single, local event and defend the rights of the host and their houserules, many people also forget or don&#39;t recognise the impact YouTube made on all their lives. This until it is sudenly gone, just as is happening right now and while the houserule changes may not seem to have any impact on you directly at this moment, you can see they actually impact Humanity and it&#39;s future as a whole if you are able and willing to look deeper.</p>

<p>Wether You like it or not, in one way or the other, We are all linked in this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t mean to be mean but your rant honestly didn’t make much sense or it was non sequitor lol. Either way- Youtube isn’t a public forum. It is a private company/platform that allows people the freedom to post whatever they want (IF IT DOESNT BREAK THE RULES)</p>

<p>Just because a lot of people use it doesn’t mean it’s public. There’s millions (maybe close to billions now) of people on twitter and facebook. That doesn’t mean there aren’t rules you have to follow. If you break certain rules your account will be deleted.</p>

<p>A “public” forum with certain company policies that you have to abide by isn’t a mutually exclusive idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somehow you seem to forget YT invited these people over, gave them an opertunety to display themselves while acting to represent a platform of free speech as a good host is suppost to due.</p>

<p>YT lured many people into creating and posting personal content over wich YT gains a lot of money while handing over a fea to the actual creators of all content. </p>

<p>While YT was making people slowly dependend on an income out of YT and it was pushing aside all other platforms on the &quot;open market&quot; in the process, it also slowly became almost like an employer for every free creator on the whole world. And now suddenly YT changes the rules or apply them more &quot;fluid&quot; to throw some of the creators out for whatever reason...</p>

<p>Now if these rules were applied all along with a clear bias or non-bias from the start there would be no problem. Most creators would have decided long ago to seek or create an other platform and both the internet and platforms would have evolved naturally.  But clearly YT is now suddenly showing a certain bias, i mean the real dark videos like the &quot;elsa snuff&quot; was up for years while many, many people complained...</p>

<p>YES, YT has the law on its side and can change its rules. But has it the (human) rights to execute and display such obvious bias as the do now while influencing Humanity Worldwide?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol Youtube inviting them over is no different than filling out an application to Mcdonald’s and them inviting you  for an interview or a job opportunity. So that part of your argument means nothing.</p>

<p>as for the other bit- It has nothing to do with “human” rights. Morals aren’t laws. Something that is morally wrong can be legal- just like something that is morally correct can be illegal. (sex with a horse is legal in some state, but feeding a homeless man is illegal in another)</p>

<p>Youtube isn’t breaking the law or doing anything legally wrong by closing channels that violate their ToS. That’s literally the agreement you sign when you decide to partner with Youtube. If someone is that ignorant of terms of service they shouldn’t be streaming for a huge platform/company like YT. It has nothing to do with “human rights” though lol human rights are good but they don’t hold up in court.</p>

<p>Actual laws are what hold up in court. Not feelings or perspective. And from a law point of view- Youtube hasn’t done a single thing wrong or illegal. That isn’t defending Youtube- that’s just pointing out the obvious that they did nothing wrong. Alex had multiple warnings and he failed to give a shit.</p>

<p>You can’t blame that on CNN or Obama or Hilary’s emails lol. Only on Alex Jones. He’s responsible for his own actions, just like everybody else.</p>

<p>I appreciate your comment and get what you’re saying- but from a law perspective- they are 100% clean here. A lot of people may be butthurt now but that doesn’t mean it’s illegal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While i also understand the dry facts, i also am worried for the future of a part of Humanity when i see so many people are actually so willing and eager to comply to any form of obvious social control as i see happening right now.</p>

<p>We are past the state of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, have entert &quot;1984&quot; and we are well on our way to a &quot;brave New World&quot;. I gues i can only say &quot;well played&quot; to some...</p>

<p>Somehere along the line many &quot;laws&quot; have given companies like YT human like rights. Now YT is miss-using or abusing these rights and claim to be only a company now... YT can&#39;t be both and it must be held accounteble for what ever side it choses to represent in the open and behind the scenes. YT needs to chose not the public or the users!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they’re just claiming he can’t upload anymore so they can talk shit about CNN even though it has everything to do with Youtube reprimanding them before and not CNN lol they don’t have a say so inwho gets banned on Youtube. That would be like blaming Coca Cola if Pepsi laid off their workers.</p>

<p>But he isn’t banned you can still see his old videos. If youtube BANS you- they take away all your shit. So either he’s bluffing or he got a third strike which means you can’t upload anymore. And from what I remember they recently got another strike so that would make the most sense.</p>

<p>Either way it’s a Youtube problem not CNN. They have no say so in who gets banned or who gets promoted lol. There’s a lot of people that have gotten strikes or frozen before- so to see it happened to Alex Jones isn’t too surprising to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol CNN doesn’t make youtube rules or decide who gets banned or gets strikes. It’s Youtube that does that. I revert to my former statement- That would be like Pepsi laying off 10,000 workers and then everyone being pissed at Coca Cola. It’s literally the same exact thing. Blaming CNN for this just completely throws your argument out of the water and you lose all credibility- no offense.</p>

<p>Alex Jones makes thousands of dollars off of youtube- they can cancel or delete his shit at any time if it violates their ToS (he’s gotten like two or three strikes already so he clearly has a problem following them)</p>

<p>Even some states are at will states meaning they can fire you for no reason. If you’re making 8 bucks an hour and they can fire you for no reason- you seriously think Youtube who pays Alex Jones thousands of thousands of dollars isn’t going to hold him to the same standard? </p>

<p>If a bakery can decline gay people service based on their religious beliefs- then youtube can decide whoever they want to ban or disallow them to use their service. IT IS YOUTUBES WEBSITE NOT ALEX JONES.</p>

<p>Alex can still go and post videos on his own website if he chooses to. But you can’t act like Alex Jones owns Youtube and gets to make the rules. That’s not how the real world works. You can’t walk into your employer and say “I know everybody else has to show up for work and everyone else has to take the proficiency test, or the basic tests we take every year to work here, but I don’t need to do it!”</p>

<p>That just isn’t how the real world works. Maybe on reddit or with a family business, sure. But the real world isn’t like that. I’ll revert to my former statement in saying that blaming CNN for this is like blaming the easter bunny or santa. CNN doesn’t have anything to do with it, and they don’t make Youtube rules.</p>

<p>Youtube is the only one that can decide to terminate an account or a persons channel- BECAUSE ITS THEIR PLATFORM. Youtube is doing video makers a favor- it isn’t the other way around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My statement is still corrent. CNN&#39;s actions are a cause of the loss of advertisers cancelling. Not the only cause. But it wouldn&#39;t have happened without CNN specifically calling and putting them on the spot. </p>

<p>As to the cake shop I mentioned. You might want to check how well their rights to refuse went for them as a private company. </p>

<p>In the end I guess some people want to defend censorship and groupthink. </p>

<p>But just because all of the media is a private company doesn&#39;t mean we should want to be lied to all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again I don’t mean to be rude but when you correlate following company policies  with “defending censorship” you automatically lose all credibility. You can abide by a companies policies and still be anti censorship. </p>

<p>Sure, CNN calling and letting advertisers know that they were being used in videos with some really sketchy material isn’t their job probably- but it isn’t illegal and doesn’t break any rules. However, alex jones clearly broke the rules multiple times because Youtube gave him multiple chances. It isn’t like they one day woke up and decided to “censor” him. Alex needs to take accountability for his own actions- and by blaming CNN- you’re enabling him to blame everyone but himself. </p>

<p>Does following the law and not committing a crime mean that you’re defending rights being taken away? Lol. Come on man. I know what you’re trying to imply but you’re just not correct, at all. </p>

<p>No, they will ban content at the ISP level like in China. See what&#39;s going on there, and if you want to do research, you&#39;ll see that American tech giants have been meeting with the Chinese &quot;Great Wall of China&quot; censorship teams to figure out how to do the same here.</p>

<p>Good luck in the future!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol CNN doesn’t make youtube rules or decide who gets banned or gets strikes. It’s Youtube that does that. I revert to my former statement- That would be like Pepsi laying off 10,000 workers and then everyone being pissed at Coca Cola. It’s literally the same exact thing. Blaming CNN for this just completely throws your argument out of the water and you lose all credibility- no offense.</p>

<p>Alex Jones makes thousands of dollars off of youtube- they can cancel or delete his shit at any time if it violates their ToS (he’s gotten like two or three strikes already so he clearly has a problem following them)</p>

<p>Even some states are at will states meaning they can fire you for no reason. If you’re making 8 bucks an hour and they can fire you for no reason- you seriously think Youtube who pays Alex Jones thousands of thousands of dollars isn’t going to hold him to the same standard? </p>

<p>If a bakery can decline gay people service based on their religious beliefs- then youtube can decide whoever they want to ban or disallow them to use their service. IT IS YOUTUBES WEBSITE NOT ALEX JONES.</p>

<p>Alex can still go and post videos on his own website if he chooses to. But you can’t act like Alex Jones owns Youtube and gets to make the rules. That’s not how the real world works. You can’t walk into your employer and say “I know everybody else has to show up for work and everyone else has to take the proficiency test, or the basic tests we take every year to work here, but I don’t need to do it!”</p>

<p>That just isn’t how the real world works. Maybe on reddit or with a family business, sure. But the real world isn’t like that. I’ll revert to my former statement in saying that blaming CNN for this is like blaming the easter bunny or santa. CNN doesn’t have anything to do with it, and they don’t make Youtube rules.</p>

<p>Youtube is the only one that can decide to terminate an account or a persons channel- BECAUSE ITS THEIR PLATFORM. Youtube is doing video makers a favor- it isn’t the other way around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My statement is still corrent. CNN&#39;s actions are a cause of the loss of advertisers cancelling. Not the only cause. But it wouldn&#39;t have happened without CNN specifically calling and putting them on the spot. </p>

<p>As to the cake shop I mentioned. You might want to check how well their rights to refuse went for them as a private company. </p>

<p>In the end I guess some people want to defend censorship and groupthink. </p>

<p>But just because all of the media is a private company doesn&#39;t mean we should want to be lied to all the time. </p>
