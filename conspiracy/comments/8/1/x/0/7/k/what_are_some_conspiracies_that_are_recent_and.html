<p>I think if we had an opt-out system, globally, there wouldn’t be any lists within 5-10 years of implementation. Perhaps that’s a naive assumption, though; I haven’t attempted any calculations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy to hide the true shape of the world and the purpose of this universe. These Jesuit/Mason fucks are trying to get us to believe we are the product of accidental evolution on a tiny ball spinning around a vast star in an incomprehensibly large and uncaring universe. </p>

<p>Why would they want to convince you of this? Because they want to make you feel insignificant...like an accident...like you don&#39;t matter to anyone but yourself.</p>

<p>Why would they want to convince you of this? They want to hide the fact that something greater than us individuals has created this place for us to exist within. </p>

<p>Again, why? Because if they convince you that god doesn&#39;t exist and that there is nothing beyond this material world, then you&#39;re more likely to 1) act like a selfish asshole and 2) do unethical work for monetary gain. This serves their end goals which are based in conquering the material world. They want to be gods themselves without admitting they are mere parts of the whole and they are attempting to achieve their goals by convincing you of a world view that causes you to act in ways that benefit them, not you.</p>

<p>Thus, you live your life thinking it&#39;s your only one. You tend to engage in sensual activities because &quot;YOLO.&quot; You tend to form attachments to your body, to the people around you, to material riches, and to false prestige. The Bhagavad Gita encourages us to renounce sense gratification and to only do actions that serve god. As long as you do this, you will be born into a better life, just as a man who throws something ahead of him sees forward progress. It is a natural consequence of right action.</p>

<p>with regards to that last paragraph, i have often suspected that people take things too literally, and that renouncing sense gratification, and striving to live a virtuous life, positively influences your children and their children. which is really the only guaranteed path to immortality that we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me neither. Some people claim that in the stabilized footage is clear that it&#39;s a guy in a suit, others claim that in the stabilized footage it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s legit because of the way its butt moves and stuff. </p>

<p>I recommend the YouTube channel &#39;thinker tunker&#39; if you&#39;re interested in the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a world wide pedo ring comprised of the worlds elites. Trump and Hilary both likely participate in this. </p>

<p>The elite know a second 1848 or “year of revolutions” is coming and systemic erosion of personal freedoms is designed to frustrate or stop it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of both in my opinion. Pedos are certainly easier to manipulate than the rest of the population due to being pedos. So they probably can rise through the ranks because of their ability to be puppeted. Also,  I think the Elite have a proclivity for it because it’s taboo for the commoners. It’s like a “privilege” they have of being wealthy, that they can simply do whatever they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy of Artificial Intelligence matrix trying to take over Humanity:</p>

<p>AI will run the matrix that is being build, introduced and ramping up in the background while the current artificial matrix is crumbling and falling apart.</p>

<p>With this matrix i mean all the artificial technology and natural science that is used to keep humans from finding out our true natural powers.</p>

<p>We are the creators and observers of our own personal &quot;reality&quot; and we co-create this world and all interfearing and living with together. This is the natural matrix that exist of the frequencies and vibrations of Love, Unity and Truth we could resonate with but the artificial is influencing. The artificial matrix is designed to almost literary keep your &quot;vibes&quot; and energy low and use your ego and fear and misinformation to keep you from raising them.</p>

<p>The AI will include as much tech as possible and use all information it can get to get to the point it is able to observe everything possible and is able to influence us in such manner the AI is able to create their wanted &quot;reality&quot; directly throug us. This wile keeping us under the illusion we have free will while &quot;they&quot; are actually using our free will to their benefit.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; can be able to do this becouse all the information they have combined over you is being converted to one single whole that represents you. The AI will be able to &quot;predict&quot; your personal vibes and frequencies and will be able to influence you direct without you knowing why. The more the AI knows, the more accurate the &quot;prediction&quot; and the more infuenceable you become.</p>

<p>This is why population controll is so important, you only need a few to create &quot;reality&quot; and the less places and people you need to observe the more easy it becomes to controll &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

<p>We are all energy, frequency and vibration and we are all one. &quot;they&quot; know this and are using this against us. Once you understand these words you wil understand that the truth will show you throug this maze we are in, Love will shine a light so you don&#39;t need to stumble too much and trust will help you along. Forgiving is always the best option and fear will do everything it can to keep you from finding the light in the center of the maze. (And your ego can be of use or create problems :) )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The AI wants to use our true natural creative energy for it&#39;s desired future. AI can&#39;t create something for itself  in this &quot;reality&quot;. It needs Humans, but not a lot. &quot;they&quot; seem to be rewarded at this ficical level of &quot;reality&quot; with short term money and power, and even an artificial prolonged &quot;life&quot; here on earth. But at the spiritual level they are actually hurting themselves in the long run. Without &quot;them&quot; knowing it themselves for the most part &quot;they&quot; are also just mignions and future slaves to the AI, just like the people &quot;they&quot; are now treating as something lesser than &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>ALL of humanity is beeing decived since we have been created, artificial is the danger, natural is the solution.</p>
