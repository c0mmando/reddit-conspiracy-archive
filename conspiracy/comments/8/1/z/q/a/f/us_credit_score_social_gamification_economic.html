<p>Why in the fuck should anyone be obligated to play/chase the ever increasing &quot;credit rating&quot; score when investment banking went upside down &amp; the fraudulent credit rating companies had no problem rating the shit &#39;investments&#39; as AAA bullshit for a fee of course.</p>

<p>Not only that but even &#39;low&#39; interest rate credit cards have added so much interest &amp; penalties it had basically become a 100% setup to fuck people up if they ever have a minor problem in their lives.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had to &quot;chase&quot; anything.  It&#39;s earned when you prove you are a responsible adult who can manage their money.  </p>

<p>then don&#39;t use credit, nobody is forcing people to use credit.  If you don&#39;t have money to buy something, here&#39;s a novel concept, maybe don&#39;t buy it today.  I have no problem with people being &quot;labeled&quot; with a low credit score if there is proof they don&#39;t manage their money well.  It&#39;s a life skill not everyone has even though I wish they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are several elements that are purposely designed to work in favor of the banks: </p>

<p>1)  The formula for calculating the score is proprietary. This means that a 3rd party is using a secret formula for evaluation of your credit worthiness. It all happens in a black box that the public can&#39;t see. </p>

<p>2) The score is designed to fall fast and recover slowly. One late payment or incorrect report by a lender forces you into a higher level interest class. Keeping you on the sh!t list helps the banks extract a penalty for your &quot;unworthiness&quot;.  A score can drop instantly and it takes months to recover from the misstep. </p>

<p>3) Shopping for the best credit offer is penalized.  Inquiries by a separate banking institution lowers the score by a few points each time. This means that looking for credit at two different banks is less damaging to your credit than looking at 15 different banks. This limits your choice of credit options, thus helping banks limit competition between themselves. </p>

<p>4) No recourse. Plan and simple you are &quot;guilty&quot; based solely on the testimony of a reporting bank or credit card company. There is little if any way to correct or challenge the score drop via the credit score company. The only way to change a black mark on your report is to deal with the reporting bank, hospital, or credit card company. This is effectively doing business at the point of a gun after you&#39;ve already been shot once. </p>
