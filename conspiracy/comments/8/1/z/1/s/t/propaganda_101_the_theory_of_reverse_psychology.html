<p>Also this:</p>

<p>Illustrating the reverse psychology [possibly] used to elect President Trump:</p>

<p>The institutional propaganda&#39;s criticism of Trump is (and has always been) absolutely and utterly invalid, and it is done on purpose. It is something I noticed from the very start of the electoral campaign. Him &quot;imitating&quot; a handicapped man, pussy grabbing, &quot;offensive&quot; words ... they even went as far as claiming he was antisemitic ... I mean, come on! None of his actual flaws were ever cited (starting with his morbid statism and Zionism).</p>

<p>This could (and did) have one major effect: increase his popularity, especially in a time when people are craving substance.</p>

<p>About this last example (&quot;Trump the antisemite&quot;), realize that in guise of this fake talking point, the American public was bombarded with this poster:</p>

<p><a href="https://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FHttpHandlers%2FShowImage.ashx%3Fid%3D345966&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FUS-Elections%2FJewish-World-Anti-immigrant-and-white-supremacist-maybe-But-is-the-alt-right-anti-Semitic-466675&amp;amp;docid=0b3TH_0a5iQYnM&amp;amp;tbnid=ii3dXzqk5W6JuM%3A&amp;amp;vet=1&amp;amp;w=758&amp;amp;h=530&amp;amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim">https://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FHttpHandlers%2FShowImage.ashx%3Fid%3D345966&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FUS-Elections%2FJewish-World-Anti-immigrant-and-white-supremacist-maybe-But-is-the-alt-right-anti-Semitic-466675&amp;amp;docid=0b3TH_0a5iQYnM&amp;amp;tbnid=ii3dXzqk5W6JuM%3A&amp;amp;vet=1&amp;amp;w=758&amp;amp;h=530&amp;amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim</a></p>

<p>This happened on the same holiday week-end as Comey saying, in substance, &quot;Clinton is guilty but she&#39;s above the law&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - Clinton is a war criminal and suspected child trafficker. But she was never supposed to become president. She was the scarecrow - for every super-hero needs a super-villain.</p>

<p>Do you see the reverse psychology and subliminal manipulation this particular example involves?</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ll grant to the people doing this. They are master story-tellers. But that&#39;s pretty much the only way they are capable of being creative. Lying and manipulating honest people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was an idea I&#39;d had back in 2016, but one I ended up forgetting. On a thread I started yesterday about YouTube freezing InfoWars channel u/murphy212 gave me a startling reminder. </p>

<p>Consider how President Trump has slowly moved away from his campaign platform. He said he would repeal the ACA, but that turned into repeal and replace. Consider his sliding stance on gun control and foreign engagement. Consider the progress of the border wall and his recent positive comments towards Chinese President Xi nixing term limits, effectively making him emperor of his communist, globalist state. </p>

<p>I have warily supported Trump for a year and a half, but now, as I separate his actions from his rhetoric, I have become increasingly suspicious of his role as President. </p>

<p>We live in the Age of Deception. William Cooper warned us of this duplicitous coming epoch. I hope u/murphy212 and I are wrong about this. But if not, consider this a wake up call. Stay vigilant and skeptical brothers and sisters. If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Just an idea though. Theoretically, they used widespread distrust of progressive corporate media to manipulate us into thinking Trump was anti-establishment by criticizing him relentlessly while never focusing on his legitimate flaws. Instead, they attacked the way he talked and the sensationalist claims he made and people said “I’m also sick of political correctness and career politicians. The media hates this guy and he’s saying everything I think so he must be a threat to the establishment I hate.” And then they headed to the polls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the only thing the media cared about was ratings. Trump was huge for ratings which is why he got such insane coverage.

<p>As far as flaws go, I&#39;d say he&#39;s impulsive, egotistic and not exactly honest. Things like his bigger button tweet and &quot;Nobody knows/is/does X better than me&quot; come to mind.

    <div class="md"><p>The flaws are apart of it. What I&#39;m mainly saying is that if you have a system of information distribution that is no longer trusted, the best way to get people to do what you want is to make them think you don&#39;t want a certain person to be elected. Then have that person run on a platform that the people who distrust the system agree with, and then hound everything about that person to make the target audience believe that person will shake up the establishment they distrust and thus garner support for that candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but, from my perspective (I&#39;m liberal, so I&#39;m biased), is that the flaws they reported on was legitimate. A lot of the stuff they reported on could be independently verified.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they didn&#39;t took some things out of context, but for me personally, I always felt like he was a terrible person/candidate and shouldn&#39;t be let close to a position of power within the government.</p>

<p>As for who trusts the media and such, I think for the most part, people in general trusts what the MSM says, even if they take what they say with some grains of salt due to biases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info. I didn&#39;t realize it was that low, but it seems it was always lower than what I thought. </p>

<p>You gave me a link to the 2016 polling data, but <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/212852/confidence-newspapers-low-rising.aspx">there is a more up to date polling data from 2017.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Despite an ongoing controversy over &quot;fake news,&quot; more Americans this year (27%) say they have a &quot;great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot&quot; of confidence in newspapers than did so last year (20%). Although confidence in newspapers is up from last year&#39;s record low, it remains lower than it typically was in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p>From a long-range perspective, confidence in newspapers hasn&#39;t been high at any point over the past 30 years; the highest was 39% in 1990. The 27% who express confidence this year is the highest recorded since 2011.</p>

<p>Democrats primarily are driving the overall increase in confidence in newspapers this year from last year&#39;s all-time low. In 2016, 28% of Democrats had &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot&quot; of confidence in printed media, but that percentage rose to 46% this year. Sixteen percent of Republicans last year had confidence but, in contrast to Democrats, that has edged down to 13% this year.</p>

<p>These party differences may represent a backlash against President Donald Trump&#39;s proclamation that the media are &quot;the enemy of the people.&quot; Newspapers -- traditionally viewed as the centerpiece of media -- may be holding a renewed attraction for Democrats in light of the president&#39;s comments. Also, with more partisan internet blogs and websites purporting to be news sites, Democrats may be showing a greater affinity for the traditional printed word.</p>

<p>Americans are no more confident in television news than in newspapers. As the line between news and opinion is often blurred on cable networks, 24% of U.S. adults say they possess confidence in television news. Still, this is up from the record low of 18% in 2014 and is the highest since 2011.</p>

<p>This year&#39;s level of confidence in television news is almost half as high as it was the first time Gallup asked this question, in 1993 (46%). During the more than two decades that have followed, television news has been transformed from three broadcast networks and a handful of cable outlets to a proliferation of dozens of all-news and information channels across all of television broadcasting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, what were his legitimate flaws during the campaign? I&#39;m not sure if I understand what you consider as legitimate flaws that we would publicly know about during the election, since that&#39;s what your reverse psychology point is about.</p>
