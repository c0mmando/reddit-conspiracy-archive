        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>24 minutes were cut from &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; </p>

<p>5 days later Stanley Kubrick died from a heart attack, 666 days until January 1st, 2001 - A 2001 Space Odyssey.</p>

<p>From my research, I&#39;m lead to believe that in the Mansion party, Tom Cruise goes into a room where there was some kind of human sacrificial practices taking place.  </p>

<p>My gut instinct tells me this has something to do with Adrenochrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess it was a combination of things. I bet there were more masks Kubrick had made that identified more people. They kept the gold Bob Hope mask and of course all the others, but there was probably way more.</p>

<p>They probably had way more (much worse) stuff on the kids, too. And as OP says, sacrifices of adults/children. They go there a bit with the under the rainbow rental shop, but there was probably much more they had to take out after clipping Stanley.</p>

<p>Normal human sacrifices wouldn&#39;t be a big deal though, imo. We see that stuff in other movies all the time. There had to be some sort of raw connection he made that <em>had</em> to be delete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can tell its real because it looks so fake 😁</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Kubrick was behind the moon landings if they were staged, at most NASA consulted with him about what camera angles to use. The guy had a very interesting life but one thing I noticed is throughout his whole career even as a photographer, he definitely exuded a certain attitude that said &quot;I am the last guy in the room you want to fuck with&quot; so in no reality do I see a government funded organization like nasa running to this guy (a brilliant auteur director who has a real problem with authority) to see if he wants to be involved in the most elaborate hoax in recorded history</p>

<p>Evidence of the movie getting losing 24 minutes?  That&#39;s not hard to find.</p>

<p>To raise doubt to your second statement, think about how much time was spent on chrome in &#39;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#39; - a lot less than 24 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it makes sense in the narrative of the film for Tom Cruise&#39;s character to have seem something like human sacrifice at the party. He doesn&#39;t know what happened to the woman that spoke up for him and it&#39;s only when he sees the article in the paper about her overdose that he begins to suspect they were capable of murder, let alone ritualistic sacrifice.</p>

<p>This is a very intriguing subject about an equally intriguing movie. I wish we could see what the cut 24min was but as others have pointed out, that&#39;s really not a whole lot to omit from a movie that already has a hefty run-time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are my assumptions as to why they were deleted. Overall, it had to do with the Hardfords prostituting their daughter to the elites.<br/>
At the end of the film, it appears the girl goes with two mean in suits, these same two men were at the dinner party at the beginning of the movies. It cuts away before it shows anything.<br/>
Another was probably that Leelee was only 16 at the time and if memory serves correctly that she had a nude scene that was cut.<br/>
My guess would be that we see the party with all the masks, it&#39;s weird, naked people walking around, the secrecy, the chanting, then he sees a room where kids are being traded to adults. The &quot;Room&quot; scene that was cut.  </p>

<p>There is a scene where Nicole Kidman and her daughter are riding horse back, probably discussing selling her to the elites, and another where they are in a boat, most likely at the ending of the movie because of his sweater. My guess would be that they are now apart of this society and what they had to sacrifice was their family.</p>
