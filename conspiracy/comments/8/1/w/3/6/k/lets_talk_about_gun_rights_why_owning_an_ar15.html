       I do not live in a heavily populated area so i have a better chance of not being in a heavily populated area if it happens.  If i am in one get the fuck away from it &amp; back to my home ASAP.  My car wont work so i’ll have to start walking or find a bike till i get to a horse i can steal.  Stay on back roads.  But if you want to live &amp; you have loved ones with you.  Obtain a gun ASAP or get killed while your loved ones are raped &amp; murdered.

       Let me correct myself its not just that the electricity staying on is preventing this... its that an EMP kills everything electrical unless you have the electrical devices in a faraday cage.  So you cant even go get replacement parts to fix your car unless they are being stored in large quantities in a faraday cage somewhere &amp; the replacement part at your local auto parts will all be useless unless your auto parts store has a faraday cage.  Rebuilding the entire electrical grid &amp; all the satellites controlling our electronics in space would take a VERY LONG TIME.

       Darwin.  Survival of the fittest.  In my best interest if i want to live to remove myself from a heavily populated area ASAP.  Whatever it takes to escape the chaos as quickly as possible.  If i were the horse owner i would shoot me if i caught someone doing it.

       All i know is that it would truly suck &amp; i am most likely one of the first to die.  So i cant blame those with survival skills wanting to be prepared... we should ask our lawmakers/scientists to do as much as possible to prepare for something like this.  Its truly best for everyone.

       I know this is an older post, but I came across it and it's interesting. I completely agree with OP -- with the caveat that I don't have the specific scenario of EMP in mind. It's more the idea of "if the shit
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       hit the fan and people are now desperate for food and water". My family has guns, and this to me is a big reason why we always will. So to answer your question, well, if you live anywhere near at least some wildlife, as we do, guns become one way to get food. So there's that. Make a fire and you've got meat. Otherwise, are you going to spear the animals, hit them with rocks? Obviously you're also going to need water so I myself would like to get a purification system in the near future just in case. Secondly, there's the people-are-desperate part. Let's say for arguments sake you suddenly had no clean water for your kids. Wouldn't you do anything to get it for them? This is not an argument for violence, it's for self-defense. Now you have guns in order to protect your family from those who might have heard that your house has water or supplies. Yes it's all very doomsday prepper, but my point is that you really can't make the argument that guns wouldn't help in a dystopian scenario.

       If only governments are that organised. The bottom line is selling guns and ammunition is a really good way to make a lot of money. Nobody at the top of a supply chain like that is going to want to give it up. The funny thing is, if you do the maths. At this current time, you are far more likely to be shot than involved in an EMP....or any kind of attack from a non U.S based enemy.

       An EMP is able to be large enough to kill the electrical grid but not kill humans.  Less developed areas of the world less reliant on electricity will not be as impacted.  But developed countries totally reliant on modern comforts will be a shit show if it takes to long for the grid to be rebuilt.  People will start fighting for resources.  There’s a saying that God made man &amp; Samuel Colt made them all equal.  It will be a kill or be killed situation.

       When compatible events have occurred in history such as Hiroshima, Dresden, Nagasaki, Christmas Island. Can you show me where humans instead of decimating each other, arming themselves and hoarding supplies, realised that the only way to survive would be to come together and work as a team. You will see exceptions, but I am talking about the general surviving population.

       So what your telling me is that people will literally just start flat out murdering each other if we lost power? I mean I have little faith in humanity, and like maybe New York and Chicago big strips would be looted but I don’t think people would flat out start murdering each other. I think you have a very low perception of the human race. Right now in Puerto Rico most of those people are without electricity and they are working together as a community to help feed each other and get water to each other and find shelter from destroyed homes during the hurricane because fema and trump were useless to them. I mean like you’re really stretching here..... would you shoot someone you didn’t know walking around looking for supplies out in the world or rape them given this circumstance? I wouldn’t, and I know most people I know wouldn’t. So maybe you’re  the one whose fucked up?

       How long would it take to rebuild the entire electrical grid when every electronic device on earth that is not in a faraday cage is dead?  How would a population that doesnt know how to hunt or grow food react when the food supply starts running out?  It will be just like New Orleans after Katrina but worse.

       The entire population isn’t fucking stupid. Books exist with the knowledge that people need to do things like grow food and humans are intelligent, plus there are lots of people with the knowledge on how to grow food and hunt, were a resourceful being. It won’t be like that because that was a city swallowed by water with mainly impoverished  lives destroyed while the rest of the world went on around it, in this case homes will stand, and city’s will stand, the banks will fall and the powerful will fall and it might even be a good thing it would be a chance for the people to come together and rally and learn how to depend on each other and not on electronics which can be done and has been done many many many times in history and is still being done in many third world countries today. You’re argument however isn’t about humans survival based on eating and survival skills, you’re argument is about how apparently humans are brutal and if all of us don’t have ARs we will die in the event we lose electricity which is fucking Ridiculous. You also didn’t answer my original question.

       I remember when Hurricane Sandy hit NYC. I live in Manhattan and lost power for a week. I heard later that in parts of other boroughs they went without power for several weeks. So a big city without any electricity, sounds like the apocalypse right? Apparently not. In fact the opposite, things were very calm. Calmer than usual. The city was quiet: no looting, no shooting, no mass chaos. Instead people were helping each other out, just trying to get by without the basic necessities of modern day living that we've grown accustomed to. That's about it. It was probably the quietest the city's ever been.
      </p>

       You're definitely right, the original poster's letting his hard on for guns get in the way of his critical thinking skills. Human beings as a whole are for the most part good, evil is an outlier. Let's not fall for the fearmongering, that's what causes people to turn on each other in the first place.

       I was in Queens during Sandy working in NYC for 6 weeks.  An EMP is much worse than a hurricane.  The only reason ppl were acting that way was because they knew the power would come back on.  Everything north of Columbus Circle had power.  It was only the southern half of manhattan that didnt have power.  With an EMP unless they get the power on in a month or two society will collapse if you dont get enough food into the city.  How will we get it there if none of the semi-trucks work in a city of 10 million in the area?  I think it is your critical thinking skills that are lacking. :-) -

       A solar emp would do a lot more then just cut the electricity out of a city.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people probably wouldn't just start murdering each other. But when you're out of power for an indefinite time with no working form of electronics...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are going to freak out a little bit more than you might expect. Look for some sort of authority that has control over the situation. I can imagine people and groups of people, whomever it may be,  trying to fill that spot. Especially when this is going on all over, and the only information you'll be getting much of the time could be by word of mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hypothetical situation. Play with it in your head a little bit before calling someone fucked up?
I wouldn't say he's stretching that much.

       I would. I’m not saying I am the expert or authority on the matter but I will say that humans aren’t inherently bad, and it would take a long time before anything got to flat out murdering each other with ARs. I also think that TPTB would have their best people on the grid because all of their money and power is on the grid so it wouldn’t be out as long as many here seem to think it would be. I’m sure that there are plans in every city for such events as long term power outages/utility outages. Sure would having a gun maybe make you feel safer sure, do I think every single person should own an Automatic weapon absolutely not. This post is a hypothetical situation meant to scare people into thinking maybe they need one, and it is bullshit.

       Lol but by your theory no one will have money because banks will be down and stores will be down if the grid goes down everything goes down and money is useless so that argument is moot. I will assume the government will have stepped in at this point and start distributing food especially in the dangerous and high populated areas and if that fails  people will do the logical thing which is bartering from the stores that would most likely be looted at this point. Growing up in Chicago and having been homeless at a young age in the cold on the streets I watched my mom barter for things all the time, not killing but trading, you know like people used to do before Monopoly money.

       Maybe i didnt answer because you are rude as shit &amp; the mods have advised that i ignore people like you.  When you stop acting like a manchild to every user in this thread you disagree with then maybe you will get more responses.  Dont be surprised if people dont respond to you when you are being a dick.

       I’m being rude because I disagree with you? And I’m challenging your logic with my own logic? I don’t think I was being rude. Also I am female, so I would be more of a woman child but I guess that doesn’t really matter  does it.

       I just was curious if you would take someone’s life over food because I wouldn’t and I don’t think most would and I think your post is meant to instill fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I hurt your feelings I apologize that wasn’t my intention, my intention was to point out that you shouldn’t assume the worst in people and you shouldn’t try to scare people into thinking they need automatic weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had a logical argument for guns I wouldn’t have commented at all. If you had used this same argument but said maybe consider getting a hunting rifle in the case of disaster so you can hunt for food I would maybe been like huh that’s a little far fetched and moved on, however you said we need ARS because people will start killing each other if anything like this happens.

       I never said a solar flare couldn’t happen.... and that is not what the argument is about. It’s about why on earth would more guns be a good idea and why is plausible to think that humans would just go to killing each other when past events have shown that isn’t the case. This isn’t the purge this is real life. I didn’t insult anyone’s intelligence and if you took it that way, then you should reevaluate.

       Now that you have admitted an EMP is possible go reevaluate all of your statements in this thread &amp; then tell me how a city like NYC will react if after 2-3 months the power isnt coming back on &amp; the government doesnt have the ability to supply than many people in that many cities with food.  If people start “working together in peace &amp; harmony” as you say... where will you get all the food for that many people &amp; how will you keep them from fighting over it?

       America has plenty of food an abundance of food if you will, rations will definitely take place. People will migrate out of the city as well. There are plenty of non perishables and plenty of people who will have hoarded items and who will be willing to trade for certain higher regarded luxury items for food staples, like bathroom items. I also never said it was going to be a fairy tale of peace and harmony, but it isn’t going to be the purge with gangsters and rednecks running around with automatic weapons murdering and raping everyone, as you assumed. I also said it is possible not likely, but anything is possible. Most people won’t fight, most people will do their best to help each other out or stay out of each others way. I hate to bring puerto Rico up again but they have been without power for months and are still helping each other not murdering each other most the deaths there have been because people can’t get medical attention, or are in such a rural area that other locals can’t reach them with food. Also soy-lent could become a temporary solution instituted by the government in the case of a widespread emergency like this as it is easy and affordable.  I have been providing logical answers just because you disagree with them doesn’t make them illogical. I also don’t care if you reply to me. Lastly why won’t you answer my question? A simple no would suffice, however by you refusing to answer I am slightly concerned that you are allowed to own a firearm.

       First, you disregarded every other point I made. Second you watch to much fucking news if you believe a word about what they said about Puerto Rico. Third look it up. FEMA and Trump did not do the job they were supposed to, they sent barely enough supplies the water they sent was gone long long ago people are still without power, and many are living off very little food and water that is not clean. I work for a large insurance company and I have friends that are their apart of our charity catastrophe team, and the horror stories they tell me it’s fucking hell there, but one thing they do tell me is the people take care of the other fucking people. Just because the media said we sent some supplies and only 16 people died and trump went there and handed out some water and T-shirt’s doesn’t mean that they are remotely okay or that we had a huge hand in helping them that’s just some what do the trumpers call it fake news?

       Okay, you’re a troll, you’ve wasted enough of my time and I think I’ve made my point. There is obviously no intelligent conversation to be had here without you thinking I am being rude, illogical, unhinged, a man baby(woman baby), loon, mean, insulting your intelligence (which I didn’t do unless my mental prowess was somehow so amazing it did that all on its own), so now I guess it’s time for you to go ahead and put a big arrow and say I’m a flame baiter, or something, and claim another false thing, because you can’t see my side and obviously can’t handle it when someone disagrees with you.

       You seem very anti-gun which, in this scenario, would be ill-advised. Machine guns are not going to suddenly materialize because these were outlawed during the '60s when they WERE available to the general public; bolt action and semi-auto would be visible.

       The police will pull back and protect certain people and property - they will not be available on every corner.

       On an island, I believe, people will help each other because there is no way to leave! In a big city, your best bet is to shelter in place until you die or get the hell out.

       Being anti-gun would be ill advised in this purely hypothetical situation or are you just talking in everyday life? I also never said I was anti gun, that is an assumption that was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re curious I am neither for or against guns, I don’t personally own a gun, however I have taken gun safety classes and shot a gun. I think maybe some more laws surrounding automatic weapons might be helpful, maybe stricter background checks because I personally have had to disarm two men on the verge of suicide who probably shouldn’t have had guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am against is fear mongering and baiting people to get specific responses like the OP does, just look at his other post where he uses words like libtards, shitlibs so he is here to strengthen the divide between liberal and conservative people, and that’s fucked up and not needed in today’s climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people have left the island and headed for Florida due to the conditions and seeking medical attention, boats exist. Everyone seems to think big city dwellers are just savages, most big city people aren’t. We’re nice people who often times will help out a neighbor in need ( note I have lived in Chicago a big city most of my life and have been homeless in Chicago before)

       If you buy an AR, you can hunt food, or kill people. If you buy a hunting rifle you can hunt food, but are much less effective against people. AR seems more cost effective to me.

       My team leader in the Army (and an actual friend) used to like to have "philosophical" conversations while we had a cigarette.  He couldn't understand why I didn't just kill people and rape women since I didn't grow up in a religious environment.  He didn't really say it like that, but that was the crux of the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       He knew I was an okay guy, but a couple of times he asked me why I just didn't do whatever I wanted all of the time if I don't believe in an afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>
       He seemed to think that if I wasn't religious, there were NO RULES for me.  I had decent parents.  I wasn't taught to rape and pillage.  That's really not my thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still like to believe that
       <em>
        not killing people
       </em>
       is the default setting for humans.  Most people just want to live, do their thing, maybe cooperate, and get along.

       Most people do, there are always a few bad eggs and luckily more good than bad, that’s why the one percent are the one percent. You’ve gotta have some pretty fucked up morals to be apart of that group. Millennials are also a whole lot different than the generation before us and while some view it as a weakness we are inherently as a majority pretty nonviolent and we like to work together to accomplish things (note all the silly liberal marches and go fund me’s) and we make up most of the healthy, agile population

       Much better off in a rural area for this reason if you can make it to one.  But in a city where you cant call the cops to report looting &amp; even if you could call them their cars dont work to get to you.  Then those that already have little resources do whatever they have to do to get them... i dont know.  I could be wrong but when you start really thinking about the logistics i think it will get tribal real quick.

       THANK YOU FOR THIS!

       My college recently had a power outage. I live in dorms. For the 12 hours it was out (at night), it was madness. Some people roamed the building scaring people, playing games, fucking around, some people hunkered down and read by candelight. Eventually, people would need resources to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ordeal taught me that the society we live in skates on very thin ice, that ice being the electrical grid. Our world is surprisingly delicate, and I would want to be armed if it all went to shit.

       Looks at the question posed: What if there an EMP or the electrical system goes down? Now the next question should be "How can we help rebuild society and band together?" But nope, it's "Can you murder enough people to stay safe?"

       Speak softly and carry a big stick. I'm down to get our and do what I can in OPs EMP scenario but I'm damn sure going to be armed because he's right about the danger level. Unarmed, I'm not going anywhere near a city. Remember it's not murder when it's self defense.

       Yea no. You can't control what other people do, and in times of crisis, people tend to act in violent and irrational ways. All it takes is a quick look through history. I'm not saying that it's impossible to work together and rebuild, but not all people are of that same mindset. To say the desire to protect oneself is the cause of mass shootings is just ignorant.

       Utter chaos. No more money unless you physically have it. No telephones. No computers. No idea where your family and friends are, with now no way to get ahold of them. Cars won't start.

       The assumption there would be that they'd have technology which would be immune somehow. Just because we'd be wiped out by such a thing doesn't mean those with the best tech would, and they'd be able to use their superior technology to dominate. Either way, it'd be silly to think that the government doesn't have a plan for what to do if EMPs wiped out electronics. That is a serious vulnerability. The only question should be whether they'd also plan an authoritarian crack down as part of their plan for how to handle that kind of devastation.

       military vehicles and electronics are,supposedly,hardened against an EMP.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the stuff that isnt, well, if the ptb were to set off an emp blast, Im pretty sure they would warn their people to protect their gear by other means, like storing their gear underground or in a hardened facility.

       Seriously. They have contigency planning for shit like this. And satellites,while convienant, arent the only form of communication.

       A viable option...if that is your voluntary choice and what you deem best given the circumstances.  If one has ownership of their own life, then such a decision is theirs alone to make.  No one else's opinions, rules, or laws really carries any weight at all in that situation.  It is purely a choice to exercise...or not...an individual right.

       The only State in the Union that has a protected electrical grid is Texas. They're also farther south compared to most states, so winter wouldn't be quite so bad. Texas also has the best situation in terms of oil storage/refineries and even renewable energy.

       tldr; if you're really worried about EMP, get your ass to Texas.

       I think you need to spend some time living somewhere that every second person doesn’t own a gun or 2 or 10... I just can’t comprehend the need, how you feel it’s a necessity? 
I think where I live anyway, people would come together to rebuild, and work to get it back up and running faster.

       On a practical note though, don't buy a piece of shit like a S&amp;W M&amp;P. Actually invest in a quality firearm that you can depend on and learn to shoot the rifle rather than playing with tacti-cool accessories. And learn to reload ammunition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buying the latest craze in cheap firearms to stick it in the closet forgotten, but "just in case", will only provide someone else with a weapon when they take it away from you.

       Yes, in an EMP, everybody would be eating the same shit sandwich. In that scenario, precious metals would become the default currency, with lead and brass being the most precious of all.

       The violence &amp; sex is pushed on us by liberalism.  So i’m already not doing that.  Leftists will continue to control hollywood &amp; glamorize these things &amp; contimue claiming dome sort of moral superiority over those they disagree with even though most of yhe country already rejects.  Problem is they are brainwashimg people with this shit through film &amp; college campuses.

       I was in Queens during Sandy working in NYC for 6 weeks.  An EMP is much worse than a hurricane.  The only reason ppl were acting that way was because they knew the power would come back on.  Everything north of Columbus Circle had power.  It was only the southern half of manhattan that didnt have power.  With an EMP unless they get the power on in a month or two society will collapse if you dont get enough food into the city.  How will we get it there if none of the semi-trucks work in a city of 10 million in the area?  I think it is your critical thinking skills that are lacking. :-) -

       Now that you have admitted an EMP is possible go reevaluate all of your statements in this thread &amp; then tell me how a city like NYC will react if after 2-3 months the power isnt coming back on &amp; the government doesnt have the ability to supply than many people in that many cities with food.  If people start “working together in peace &amp; harmony” as you say... where will you get all the food for that many people &amp; how will you keep them from fighting over it?  I’m not responding to you again till you provide logical answers to these questions.
