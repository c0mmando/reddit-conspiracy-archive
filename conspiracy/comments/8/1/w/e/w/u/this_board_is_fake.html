    <div class="md"><p>I agree that people find it absurd to think all of our well educated scientists would miss something so grand. However, let&#39;s remember that most scientists are studying their topic in depth, so their scope is very narrow. They&#39;re not going to speak about things in another field unless they have a personal interest in the topic. So then we can ask why most of the physicists and astrophysicists haven&#39;t figured it out. It should tell you that they aren&#39;t doing true seeking of knowledge. They&#39;re appealing to gatekeepers that decide if they get published or tarnished. At this point, the scientific method has become authoritative Science, which castigates free unbiased inquiry, and demands rote memorization. There are a few open minded physicists, engineers, and pilots who didn&#39;t let public pressure dissuade them from questioning the things they were taught previously. For anyone curious, seek them out online. It never hurts to look.</p>

<p>If I was in the TPTB, I would run a disinfo operation a lot like FE. It would, just by association, keep away a lot of interest in the &quot;biggies&quot; like 9/11 and UFO&#39;s, from a certain &quot;trend setting&quot; group of techie or university educated potential conspiracy theorists, who would see FE as the standard-bearer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is this really about 9/11? Are we scaring your handlers enough that they need to replace &quot;9/11 conspiracy&quot; with &quot;Flat Earth conspiracy&quot;?</p>

<p>Am I getting too close? Or are you just all fun and games?</p>

<p>Your arguments are incredibly weak - as if you could, but are too lazy to engage. I assume the whole charade is to make an amusing parallel between Flat Earth and 9/11 - as if all these should apply to both equally. They don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most scientists are studying their topic in depth, so their scope is very narrow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost no scientists are able to skip general subjects that include astronomy and geology. They also know much about the 500 year process of science evolution that spanned Galileo to Einstein since it is held as the &quot;textbook&quot; process of reducing verbal theories to numerical models during the Renaissance and Enlightenment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>astronomers ...  aren&#39;t doing true seeking of knowledge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anybody can do true seeking, or fail to do it. Knowledge is an open book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[they are] appealing to gatekeepers that decide</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no gatekeepers trying to keep anyone away from the Flat Earth concept. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>scientific method has become authoritative Science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a tautology - it&#39;s just saying something in different words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>demands rote memorization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every trade of any kind requires some rote memorization. It is a general requirement not not unique to astronomers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Flat Earthers] didn&#39;t let public pressure dissuade them from questioning the things they were taught</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So some few people were not pressured to dismiss out of hand the astronomy they learned in school. It&#39;s called freedom to think what you want!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9/11 is small scale and the flat earth conspiracy is the grandest of them all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is what you are trying to achieve, nefariously. But it&#39;s patently false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hide [Flat Earth] by taking over the school system and media and indoctrinating kids for decades</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since no ordinary western person has doubted standard astronomy in this way for about 300 years - a couple decades of indoctrination would not be enough. However, interesting fact that 9/11 is now a couple decades pf indoctrination. Too bad it isn&#39;t working.</p>

<p>It was on the front page immediately - astonishing - with no comments!</p>

<p>Two of us that sort of showed doubt about the thing got downvoted into collapsed.</p>

<p>Right now it is on front page at position 12 or so. It is essentially a nothingburger. And I don&#39;t mean that a well-crafted conspiracy can be made about ancient giants. It could. But this isn&#39;t that at all. There&#39;s no intelligent discussion about context and literally no outside references besides the 1890 newspaper article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all fake.</p>

<p>Temporary home.</p>

<p>Matrix.</p>

<p>What-the-fuck-everrrrrr.</p>

<p>Call it whatever you want but this is just a test to see what our true colors are when shit hits the fan (individual experiences will vary, obviously).</p>

<p>BTW I guess I have to outright state this: I&#39;m a tax paying citizen of the US. I&#39;m also a veteran. I&#39;m just here because I&#39;m tired of my government using tax money to wage war, both domestically and abroad. I took an oath to defend my country and constitution and I will always uphold that oath.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned for my family, my neighbors and my community. It&#39;s a diverse group. It&#39;s a working class and poor group of neighbors. The schools teach Communist values. Unhealthy, overweight young people in alarming numbers. Single mothers everywhere. No. Wait. GRANDMOTHER&#39;S raising their grand babies because mom and dad are opioid addicts. People nodding out in cars ON THE ROAD at 4:30 pm on a weekday. Homeless people approaching the neighborhood door&#39;s trying to get money for gas or whatever. It&#39;s fucking bad. I&#39;m here because one day I started to wonder wtf is going on with the opioid use in the US and why are troops guarding poppy fields overseas?</p>

<p>And now I know more than I want to know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you can do better than that. You&#39;ve got your scale backwards my friend. 9/11 is small scale and the flat earth conspiracy is the grandest of them all. What better way to hide it than by taking over the school system and media and indoctrinating kids for decades with your false representation of reality? </p>
