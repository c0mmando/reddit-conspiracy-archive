       Disclaimer: With everyone going off on globalism, this may be an unpopular, or inflammatory question to some. But remember - it's just a question. Nothing else. If you get emotional answering it, or make assumptions about me for asking it, that's on you. Not me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the problem with feeling like you're a citizen of the world? Now time out. I'm talking about the following: 1. A world where everyone on the planet has a decent living standard. 2. Where your race, or religion isn't a means for fighting. 3. Where people welcome people of other cultures. 4. Where we accept others despite their differences. 5. Where we can travel freely with visas to their countries, and they can travel freely to ours. 6. Where we explore, make friends, and welcome strangers into our lives. This to me is feeling like you're a citizen of the world. Where you don't judge those you don't understand, you learn from them, and we help each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear people spit on globalism, and you are essentially making sure none of what I listed ever happens. You may think you're spitting on world banks, and governments stealing from people, but it's us on the bottom that gets hurt. ALWAYS. Why do people shy away from becoming a peace loving world? Why do people put the health of the economy in front of the health of the people? Why is paying for something always the biggest factor? We are paying for all our poor decisions with our inability to reach our potential. Why are so many people either willingly, or out of ignorance, against this?

       I'm not opposed to what you said and think that is the ideal scenario. But seeing how corrupt even major powerful countries like the US is I'm not sure its a good idea for so much centralized power and dont know if were ready as a society

       I am not sure about a centralized power, but what are people doing to move us towards peace? I think we are not realizing our potential, and it's because we are not mobilizing towards the power of peace. We are still fostering a society of violence.

       We will never have peace dude, we have an ever increasing population and thus need more room to grow food to supply the population. Some countries will run out of room and will need to invade another to get that room.

       If I want to fight for peace on this earth, I have to fight against all of you who don't believe it's ever going to happen. That fucking sucks. You know you want it, so why would you resist it? Just support it, act in favor of it, don't defeat yourself because of some dumb reason that can be overcome when we work together.

       That's not true. That's how it is today, that doesn't mean that's how it always will be. We are the ones who have the power to change it by standing taller and accepting that we don't accept this anymore. 'How many people feel helpless about our politicians in Washington let alone the geopolitical scenario in the world. We are not helpless, we have a sense of mission, many of us have a sense of duty, many of us wish they could contribute or do something to make a change, and now is the time to start small. Just believe it is possible first and foremost. That's all it takes to start an avalanche.

       I never said we were helpless. I just told you the truth and where to start. It's not going to happen within our expected lifetimes though. That's just realism. The people in power have been playing chess like this for 2000 years. It's not just going to happen over night.

       The only part of what you said that was worth challenging for me was the So it will be. That's the part. That's the 4 words I want to challenge. Also your timelines. Maybe if you're really old that's true, but the only reason it takes time is a matter of organization, logistics and working together. Look what some people have achieved in their own lives. There were people saying it would never happen to them too. It doesn't even make sense to decide how long it will take or whether it will happen. It makes sense to decide if you want it to happen or not. And once you've made that decision, support it with your actions in whatever little way you can. If you want it to happen in your life or don't want it to happen in your life, your actions will take you straight there.

       Well explaining evolution, emergence and complexity theory like someone is 5 while being tipsy is kind of a tall order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand how crystals form? Lets start there.
      </p>
      <p>
       A solution of say, salt water is just a mix with no real order. The solution will behave like a liquid. If you let salt water dry, through dehydration and
       <em>
        self organization
       </em>
       , salt crystals will form in a regular way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, salt crystals have a predictable structure. They may be somewhat unique at a large scale, but their underlying structure coalesces into being in the same way every time. Its complexity emerging from seeming chaos,
       <em>
        because of the way the atoms arrange themselves because of their own fundamental properties like their orbitals and bond angles
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic underlying nature of sodium and chlorine(the constituent elements of NaCl table salt) gives rise to the structure of the crystals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well wtf does that have to do with evolution? Its the same process but with more variables than two atoms and their underlying atomic structures. Yet, complexity forms from seeming randomness: stars from coalescing hydrogen, planets from coalescing dust in a stars accretion disc, and so on right down to life itself forming and then evolving into different species, each either being well adapted and surviving and continuing to evolve, or going extinct as most of the species that have ever existed have gone extinct.

       Care to explain? That's a pretty bold statement. There are 2 parts to it: 1. That statement assumes that what makes people unique can be destroyed. 
2. It also assumes that if we have peace on earth, people won't be unique anymore.

       Well think about it - Why are you against globalism? because it destroys what makes countries or people unique.
      </p>
      <p>
       first assumption: what makes a country or person unique can be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       second assumtion, globalism and uniqueness can't exist together, because one causes the destruction of the other.

       You're making the classic mistake of assuming all cultures and all people are equal, that they are just like you except with brown skin or have a different word for god, etc. That is demonstrably untrue and sadly most people only find that out when their country begins to negatively change from within after mass migration (Sweden, Germany, etc).

       There is evidence the Chinese visited the americas and only communicated with the natives, leaving them in peace. It was not the natives to be blamed for their polices. It was the English to be blamed for theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people are equal in that they experience life as a human equally. Negative change is a relative term.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been to sweden and Germany. Malmö’s best street food is falafel. Best in Europe they say. Arabic kids are just as important as Swedish kids and just as smart. What you’re talking about is the impact of people feeling unloved and unwanted and lashing out. It has nothing to do with their inherent value as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I met a girl who came from war torn Bosnia. She was maybe 10. She looked at me in the eyes and drew her finger across her throat and pointed to me. I was so freaked out but it wasn’t her culture. It was what she’d seen and witnessed. People, with love are all able to respect each other. It’s intolerance that causes strife.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every crime because someone is poor occurs not because of their culture, but because they have nothing to speak of and the streets call their name to be a hustler or an opportunist. There are so many ways to categorize negativity but the least ambitious or thoughtful way is to say it’s because of culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many other more poignant reasons than the language someone speaks or the country they come from. If the English values the natives as much as they values themselves, there would never have been a genocide. But as long as they saw them as other, and lesser, the genocide was inevitable.

       I think we could discuss the details of what an effective level of diversity might be to a society vs. ineffective, but I think for the sake of this discussion we can agree diversity means "not homogenous", let's say, which from a biological perspective I do believe is a truism.

       Happy cake-day. You know it's hard to tell the difference? I'm almost certain there are a ton of people who hate both of them just because they don't know the difference either.

       Globalism is this whole centralized world government and mark of the beast scenario right? I'm not talking anything like that. I'm just talking about getting on with getting along again.

       Because none of your 6 points are in place yet, and won't be as long as our current rulers are in power.  The ones with all the money hoard all the wealth, exploit every nation they can, wage war on anyone they want, and use terrorism and tribalism to divide us into manageable blocs.

       It means that we are the ones to make it happen. No one will do it for us. It's time for us to realize the only way it will ever occur is if we begin to think like it's actually something we can muster, amongst ourselves our friends our neighbors and each other. It's up to us to make it happen. We all have anger and purpose and mission.

       Do you even remember why they hate us in the first place? Do you remember a time when they didn't hate us? All this talk about extremism has only increased in recent years. The extremists are a movement, meaning they gain support by supporting their arguments with truthful examples. They are not a truth, or a way that needs to be. Their hatred for us doesn't begin and end with them being from whatever country they are from. Their hatred comes from their lashing out to find someone to blame for the terrors in their own lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the ones that hate us? They are the ones that feel the most. Maybe they are the ones that have also lost the most, or the ones who have the instinct to protect. THey don't hate us from their bones, because they were born to be our enemy because of who they are. THey hate us because they have been taught to hate us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are more than them. they can be flipped. we are more than the people who would hurt others. All of the people in those countries are human just like us, they want to wake up to peace just like us. Another day in war, another day in fear, another day in pain and agony, and yes they want to fight, they want to fight for it to stop. But they don't want to hurt us just because of who they are, that's an idea that is planted in our heads by people who have no value for the individual lives of each and every human on this earth. These are the people who we all want to fall down.

       Maybe...  They just hate us because our soldiers and mercenaries keep killing their children...?  I'm sure that if we just told them that the white people want to stop killing them for awhile, that they'd trust us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if they don't, I guess we could just kill them until they move to another country and forget what happened...?

       I work as a product designer. My job is to identify big gaps and figure out how to solve them. What makes me different from most people, is that to me a gap is something to build a bridge over. We have to make sure we are not intimidated by not having the answer right away. Every great event, and undertaking has begun with someone convincing someone else that what they want is actually possible. The rest is just a mad game of filling in the blanks that make it so.

       I ask for anyone who believes to begin moving forward in their own lives. To believe first and foremost is the most important thing. They get that down, and there are countless small teams working towards something we can all benefit from. If we believe it is coming, and can be done, and it's up to us - that's how we change the world.

       It sounds like you want what i want as a "buys local or from selected countries" protectionist, isolationist though.

       In order for people to see other people as human beings, they need to be able to actually empathize with them and not view them as mere statistics or slaves in foreign countries whose deaths and misery mean nothing.

       More traveling the world, more accepting other religions and more embracing of other cultures and traditions does not lead to less small tribes. It creates dispersed tribes that are no distinguished by locale and physical attributes. I get it, you firmly believe it's not going to happen. I'm sorry that has happened to you, and I will embrace every day that I believe it is possible with a fervent passion, that if it can be done, if I can have a mission, if I can have a desire, then peace on earth and accepting of one another is it.

       Read some political theory. 
More people=less freedom. Essentially the trade-off is the collective interest of humans will be represented but your voice will be drowned out by the billions of others. This makes it extremely easy to set up tyrannical government or monarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that it would be nice to start thinking of each other as humans from planet Earth instead of citizens from different countries but the truth is that there are a lot of uneducated people on this planet and ignorant people and you can't just give them the ability to vote.

       I'm glad you agree. There are a ton of uneducated people on this planet, this is true. I'm not sure about the rest of what you said as being anything more than just a 'tradition'. It's not written and stone, and we can change it with our actions, and how we stand together. We all have a sense of agency and a mission that we want to accomplish. Even the uneducated have experience. It shouldn't be such a scenario that only the educated may vote, because even the ditch digger has a voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time to move towards a planet where we exercise our potential. When we begin to stick together, our voice grows. There are logistical flaws, but it's no reason to avoid seeking the best for ourselves and each other. We must raise our standard of what we believe is ok, and judging form you posting here, you already have. The time is coming to act.

       Sounds great. Lead by example. Make your personal life successful and compassionate then work out towards community etc. If we all do this and focus first on order in our own chaos we could achieve world peace.  If we can show people by deed instead of lecture or pontificate.

       This is what drives me bonkers about the kneeling athletes.  They have millions of dollars but do narcisstic "protests" instead of investing 90% of that insane wealth into the poor communities they grew up in.  Start charter schools, rec centers, community gardens, health clinics, music and art lessons, teach classic literature and tutor kids on how to think and write and debate.  Then come and tell the rest of the US what we need to do... Likely we will already be doing it.

       And let them protest. Remember, they are just people that have made it big, and they still feel all the pains that poor people feel, they still have all the quirks and inadequacies and even they with all their money can feel helpless. Rodney Dangerfield said on an interview with Johnny Carson that you've got the same head no matter how much money you get.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like some of the ideas you have they are powerful starting points. Imagine if they knew they could do this, if they had the infrastructure, the knowhow, the impetus? They have the money, but truth be told, a lot of people with money don't know what to spend it on.

       I'm not saying that only the educated should have the ability to vote but rather only the educated and well qualified individuals like Rich businessman and esteemed lawyers should have positions in office. Joe the plumber shouldn't be president of the United States even if his interests are more aligned with the general public.

       Yes. Until the concept of money is no longer needed, greed will drive human behaviour. Even after money doesn't become a thing humans will still find ways to divide into groups and fight. (Ex. Robots vs. Humans)

       Because it's reality young man. I'm not sure how old you are but if you pick up a history book you'll see that man has waged war for hundreds and thousands of years and won't be stopping anytime soon. It is a part of nature whether you want to admit it or not, otherwise there would have already been a cultural balance with Biology.

       Yes, I agree. We need humans to focus on self-improvement and education to eradicate ignorance and weakness. Unfortunately its not reality for everyone. Many people lack something that drives passion in their lives or they get tangled up in other life problems, like having kids too early or having an abusive upbringing/mental issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's up to young leaders like us to drive innovation and that's why you see business leaders coming up with ideas like UBI. We are trying to prepare ourselves for an automated world and it's going to be very difficult to adapt. Money will have to be gone before that can occur. But nobody knows a better system. Capitalism is working for now, we just need to protect our environment more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your idea is the eventual "sense of purpose" but we aren't there yet. Your talking about what it's going to feel fulfil us spiritually when we no longer have to work due to automation. At that point though we have to worry about robots trying to attack us and/or our environment already being destroyed.
The onl only other way this would happen would be if humans had to unite against things like:
- asteroid Collision 
-changing environment/terraform mars
- pandemic
-alien invasion

       I like your smarts but you start with a yes and then immediately say “but no”. As a thought experiment what if you simply removed the “but no” from your thought patterns. How would you change as a person? Not saying you must but I’m saying it’s that which makes the difference between swimming against the flow towards a rock of stability, or letting the water carry us where it may, swampiness and all. In short, swimming there or floating there.

       I just read your edit. I do agree with you and I'm glad for your cogent reply. It doesn't make sense that it all hinges on resources however, because that seems entirely artificial. We have dirt and we have seeds, therefore we have food. I think it really hinges around human understanding of our inherent capabilities.

       Completely relates to resources our whole world economy is based off of supply and demand. People aren't just happy with having food there's a lot more to goes into human happiness than just that. Extreme poverty is declining and should be eliminated by 2030. I know it sounds harsh and I'm cynical but I really just don't think that human wisdom is distributed evenly across all of us there are some of us who are naturally smarter and some of us who aren't in the people who are naturally smarter are born to lead the ones who arent

       Well, I don't disagree with you, but hear this: It's not intelligence that results in leadership. It's a reason. It's passion. It's a desire. That's why stupid people are leaders, because passion is independent of brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think one world government is even a necessity. I don't know why people (present company excluded) get so antsy, thinking that having peace on earth means a new world government. Just like
       <a href="/u/kickedinthedick">
        /u/kickedinthedick
       </a>
       said, there's a difference between globalism and globalisation that most people don't differentiate. There are people in this thread talking about how I'm speaking the words of satan if I want peace on earth, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the problem with inherently distrusting government - it means that you'll never be motivated to change things from within, and instead of understanding how to build a perfect governing system, the tendency is to reject it at all, and to see well meaning things with malintents, and see common shortcomings as intentional malicious acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no need to break up the current system of countries and borders, but there is a need to make peace among countries. I think if you follow what I'm saying you see that I'm not calling for a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, I am calling for people to realize that becoming one human people is not as bad as it sounds from all the pundits, and it is within our grasps, regardless of location and resources. But it will take dedication and soldiering for peace.

       "More people=less freedom. Essentially the trade-off is the collective interest of humans will be represented but your voice will be drowned out by the billions of others."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that ignores all the positive effects of forming a collective. For example, you pay taxes to have roads. Some of which you may not drive on. But now you have the freedom to travel, which wouldn't be there otherwise, because if everyone's out for themselves then nobody will build a road network out of the kindness of their hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might pay into health insurance you're not currently using, but then you're grateful when you actually need it. Even Ayn Rand collected Social Security benefits, despite the hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just imagine how much of your life would be impossible without any sort of collective. Modern civilization was built on it. Anything done with public money, any project accomplished by the government (including the internet), any infrastructure like roads, clean water...

       Right, the only way to beat them is to work together and envision the world that is acceptable. It's to raise our standard, and to bring like minds together. THere are so many of us that think this, but we sit at home and wish. If we just realized that we're not this little minority, we are the majority - we can completely turn the world upsidedown. We are not the pawns of the men with money, as much as it would seem so, innit.

        Why are people against a more global community?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some people are against it because they’re racists and seclusionists.  I feel those people are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others are not so much against a global community, but against one ran by TPTB that exist today.  These PTB are negative and manipulative.  You don’t want to give those types even more control of the entire planet than they already have.  This particular viewpoint I don’t disagree with.  I’m personally all for a global community.  I think it will elevate the human species.  However, it has to be
       <em>
        the right kind
       </em>
       of global community.  Not just any will do because there is so much deceit on this planet that there are powerful types that will proclaim that a global community is “the best thing that can happen to the world!” and get many behind the idea, and all the while they are sowing the seeds of an eventual system where literally
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       will be enslaved under their manipulative, totalitarian rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s certainly not the kind of global community one should ever want.  It would essentially be a global community where everyone’s a slave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the majority of people that speak out against a global community are essentially speaking out against this type of “global community” that can lead to the enslavement of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are also the ignorant racist types that I mentioned initially, but that’s another type altogether.

       I agree, making sure it is the
       <em>
        right kind
       </em>
       is of utmost value. And that's why it
       <strong>
        has
       </strong>
       to come from us. We can't wait for people to do it for us, it's time for us to being. You may be right about people speaking out against a certain kind of community. We have to be careful of our words though because that sort of outcry is leading to a certain kind of identityism and isolationism that intentionally or inadvertently takes us further and further away from that peaceful world done the right way. Like Einstein said - I don't know with what weapons ww3 will be fought with, but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones. It's time to break that cycle and stop thinking war is an acceptable behavior. It' s literally taking from someone with force. It's literally getting what you want by making other people stop breathing. That is so terrible, and we need to begin to foster peace at the earliest stages in life, and begin convincing people who have given up on life that we can do more to change, we need to take the sense of mission and desire for something better and stand behind it together so that we can get anything done at all.

       If it’s not, then advocating for a global community might be even more dangerous for the human species than

       Absolutely and 100% agreed.  However, that means that we as a people have to step up to the plate, grow some serious responsibility, and all come together as one united people.

       In other words, there are many potential pitfalls on the way to actually accomplishing the global community goal.  Agreed.  There are

       Well, I’ll tell you that I certainly work on breaking that cycle within my

      <p>
       I fully agree with this…but the vast and overwhelming majority of us human beings on this planet - even the well-meaning ones, to say nothing of the assholes - are weak and ignorant hypocrites.  Like, for example, what you said above here…It’s nice.  More than nice, as a matter of fact.

       However, with no disrespect meant toward you by saying this, I would bet a

       of money that you don’t even represent in your own life the very things you said here.

       And that’s no slight against you.  It’s EXTREMELY difficult to

       be a being of peace and

       Cheating helps you get ahead and cheating is something bad people do. We've identified a target. We are free to cheat, but what does that mean and how can we bring out the honest and compassion in each other so that cheating seems to be detrimental rather than attractive to those who would do it... just thinking out loud.

       dude   i'm just a realist.  when you get to the point of acceptance you can work more effectively.   i'm still an activist but picking my battles and staying focused is much better for my health.   :D

       Realism doesn't line up with reality. Realism is a way of making predictions that are unlikely to fail. I'm sorry but you just called me a bad guy for wanting world peace. Do you think I'm the one that has my wires crossed or have you adopted something and internalized something that may not be in line with actual reality, and more of a defeatist mindset? I want you to know it doesn't make sense what you just told me, and it certainly false.

       Make sure you see before you walk away that I never said anything about one world government so if you've made that assumption that is on you. Everything I said has nothing to do with a nwo or one world government, but people like you fight against regular peace because of fear instead of desire for peace. Jesus tells us - fear not believe only. He that has ears to listen will hear.

       Oh. You're deep conspiracy. Ok. Then you can be done. Remember what Jesus told us about how when two or more are gathered in his name they can tell a mountain to cast itself into the sea and it will obey. He was describing to us the power we have been given. If you do not believe this, then experiencing it will not be in your life this time around.

       Hey listen - humans are arguably the only beings on this earth that can enact agency. To where we can manipulate the world around us to achieve whatever it is we desire in it. We still obey and follow the laws of physics, but we can also birth an idea in the mist of our minds and slowly and with certainty bring it into existence in this world.

       I don't even know how that's related. You say that like you've seen some youtube videos on how bad it's going to be. But did you ever even think about it? I didn't say anything about having a centralized world government. What I said was people fighting against having a more connected world are only getting in the way of reaching our potential as a race of beings on this earth. We will get there, but we need to think straight first. You're here in this sub, that means you are a free thinker. Realize what is good about globalizing, and realize how that's different from the NWO.

       I mean that you and me experience being human just like someone in Syria or Mexico city does. We are all connected at this experiential level in way that is irrespective of economy or class. We all have a humanness to us that doesn't even consider what religion we are. So yes, we are literally connected on the internet now, like you're a stranger sharing their thoughts from behind your screen, but your pain and joy and sorrow and happiness are shared by a mother behind a hijab who lost everything, or a canadian miner that struck oil, or a child blowing out candles during their 10th birthday - this year, last year, 100 years ago, and 100 years from now. We're part of this awesome experience, and we need to stick together if we want to evolve as a population. That means making a ruckus that we're sick and tired of how things are, and that we want to do something about it. we want to awaken that sense of mission, and that sense of drive to change and make things better - and then actually do it.

       It's not proven that small groups evolve
       <em>
        faster
       </em>
       . It's proven that small groups evolve to suit their environments. The speed at which the birds on the island evolved had nothing to do with population size, but rather the environments and the attributes that increased fitness. A larger population would have also evolved if every sparrow was placed in a new environment. It can happen in the span of a few generations, it all has to do with fitness. But that's not an argument for people. It's a completely different scenario. We don't evolve as desert people, or plains people, or forest people, or city people biologically to a major extent, so it doesn't really make sense for having peace on earth, I just wanted you to know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some truth to humans being small tribe apes, it's always easier to manage things in small groups, obviously, but we don't lose that by accepting other cultures and learning and loving them. We gain by understanding people other than ourselves, and in fact, intermingling of cultures spurs ideas and change faster than isolation. Think of the silk road, and how the mesh of ideas from around the world lead to the renaissance, and how we advanced our knowledge by receiving algebra from the persians, and powder from the chinese, and how italians transformed their food from noodles from the orient, and etc, etc, etc. Exchange is better for people and genetic populations, than isolation. that is definitely a fact. You gotta realize being accepting of others doesn't mean you give up who you are. Being welcoming and opening yourself up to understanding others makes you a more wise individual.

       Actually you are completely misinterpreting how the birds in the Galapagos evolved and making a patently false statement that it had nothing to do with population size.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you study complexity theory and understand how emergent complexity forms, you will see the error in your statement. It is the smallness of the population that allows it to adapt quickly, not birds being put in different environments. The populations were small and isolated on the Galapagos, where as the mainland had "more environments" to evolve in actually, yet they didnt. They changed slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big committe of birds got their work done slower because there were more of them to dilute the evolutionary process.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in point of fact, sometimes, it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       mean that we give up who we are to be accepting of others and not every "difference or diversity" is actually good or beneficial.

       It is the isolation only. The size is irrelevant. If there were 10,000 birds on an island and it could support them, after a generation, the same mos fit birds would have been selected for, than if there were 20 birds on that island. Selection pressures are sexual fitness, ability to get food, percentage values of population, genetic migration, random mutation, and some other things. Size is not the driving factor, in fact the larger the population, the MORE genetic variation is possible.

       You literally contradicted yourself in your own post...
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was just isolation, why didnt birds on the mainland who have the same diet and live in the same type of ecological conditions evolve as quickly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because that "some other things" as you so scientifically put it is the key element of evolution itself: self organized criticality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That self organized criticality happens slower with more organisms because traits get diluted in the larger population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Population size was absolutely the enabling factor for faster evolution. The populations are isolated
       <em>
        from each other
       </em>
       as well, yet one evolved faster to specialize than the other did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure why you incoherently repeat words at the end there, but you should probably go back to school and learn what self organized criticality is and how it relates to evolution. You seemed to have missed those lectures.

       no, it's that you're simply a contrarian and when your knowledge of evolution is clearly wrong, it becomes irritating and boring to repeat myself. I honestly know what I am talking about when it comes to bottlenecks in genetic pools, and whether there are 2 individuals or 500 individuals, they do not contribute to the speed at which evolution occurs, but they contribute to the diversity of the gene pool. I don't know how to say it so that you don't still think you are correct, so it has become an exercise in futility, and thereby, not interesting, challenging, rewarding or fun. Why should I discuss for the sake of replying to you?

       Ok it would be my pleasure to explain to you the concept of evolution from an analytical perspective. For starters - let's begin here:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Evolution always happens at the rate of one generation at a time. It cannot happen faster than that. So if that is clear, clarify what is unclear.

       Listen you're confusing pervasiveness as a trait with evolution. In any populatin a trait can become present from 0% to 100%. You are assuming that at 100%, it is evolution, but at say... 2%, it's not. This is where you must realize that even if 2% of a population contain a trait that increases their fitness, they are evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one generation passes on a trait that increases fitness, it is evolution. If after 10 generations, it reaches 50% of the population, it is evolution. If it stays at that population frequency for 1000 years because of equilibrium, it is still evolution. If selection pressures push that trait down to 2% of the population after one generation,  it is also evolution. If after one generation, it becomes 100% of the population, it is also evolution. Evolution isn't an end result. Evolution is a process. It is a process that happens over each successive generation, with the passing on traits suited or ill-suited to fit an environment. Evolution is not the end result of this. I am taking the time to help you.

       Evolution is also non-directional. It doesn't get more advanced or less advanced. It simply gets more suited to its environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since one contributor to evolution is random mutation in genes, one could say that an increased gene pool makes it more likely that particular genetic mutations will arise randomly in any given population. The more diverse the gene pool is, the more likely it is that a particular gene mutation will find its way through the entire population.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have isolation of a population of any size, you limit the gene pool. Another contributing factor to evolution is genetic diversity and migration. If you cut off migration, it means that all of the external forces acting on a particular population are applying evolutionary pressure the same on the entire population.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a population that has fluid migration, very large gene pools, and extremely diverse environments, the species will evolve to become a generalist population. If you cut off a small group from the rest of the population, limit genetic migration, and decrease the population size, you run the risk of the entire generation dying off from the lack of ability to adapt, due to lack of genetically variable traits that can be
       <em>
        selected for
       </em>
       , or proven more fit for a particular environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you isolate a population, you create a genetic bottleneck effect. This means traits can spread as a percentage of a population more thoroughly than they can in more diverse groups. I think this is what you are referring to as evolution happening faster, and "diluting" evolution. What you are talking about is the dampening of the frequency of a particular trait.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fields of flowers for instance, there is a population frequency of purple variants, vs yellow variants. Environmental pressures like bees, can make it so that purple flowers are preferred to the yellow flowers, but other insects make it so that yellow flowers also exist, at a lower percentage of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you create a new environment, and eliminate all the bees, then you will find that the entire population may turn yellow unless another creature fills the niche of pollinating purple flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the rate of trait distribution changes with each generation due to the environmental pressures, whether there are 10 or 10,000 flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you took only yellow flowers to an island with bees and no insects, and the bees didn't like to pollinate those flowers, the entire population of flowers could die out, unless there is a random purple color mutation or variant that occurs. Then all the bees will pollinate that flower, and purple flowers will subsequently spread throughout the island as the most fit offspring of that purple flower. The rate of evolution is always occurring at the same exact pace though, and the population size is not really a major determining factor. It is the diversity, and migration and selection pressures and various other elements that have an impact on any given population.

       First paragraph: Except that it absolutely does get more advanced(complex). Life originated as very simple organisms, and evolved into more and more complex forms over time. Dont conflate feedback loops, which are an integral part of evolution, for non-directionality. Evolution doesnt really go in reverse, otherwise youd see mitochondria and chloroplasts devolving back into separate bacterial cells from which they originated, or birds reverting to dinosaurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second paragraph: More organisms means more mutations, but it logically also means that some specific mutation is
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       likely to find its way through the entire population, because that population is larger! It therefore decreases the likelyhood of any given mutated trait being able to change the species at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third paragraph: "When you have isolation of a population of any size, you limit the gene pool." Isolating a population of any size? If its the entirety of the species, then thats obviously not true. And according to you, a population of organisms being smaller or larger has the same rate of mutations, but evolutionary pressures cause traits to spread "more thoroughly" in a smaller one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except that evolution is more than random mutations spreading through a population. Thinking thats how evolution works is like thinking a tornado can hit a junkyard and make a Ferrari appear. Its a self organized emergent process. The echolocation of a bat requires the simultaneous evolution of specialized ears, the ability to make the sounds to echolocate and a neurological system capable of processing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, random mutations are not enough. Complexity self organizes in life just like it does in nonliving systems(coalescence of matter into stars and planets etc). And thats where the feedback mechanisms in evolutionary systems generate increasing complexity(more advanced forms from simpler).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose you could say: dampening the feedback mechanisms and ability for complexity to increase, and id agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about the bees and flowers is a nice example of evolutionary pressure and selective forces, but the coevolution and coordination between species isnt really what we were talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       That and not all species migrate, and introducing species into an ecosystem can and does often cause catastrophic failure of that ecosystem and destroys indigenous species... kind of makes a good case against globalization really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all species migrate, nor do they coexist with other species. Cane toads, fire ants, killer bees, parasites that proliferate and destroy entire species... history is full of cases where invasive introduced species destroyed delicately balanced ecosystems.

       Let's take this one step a time. Complex and advanced are not the same thing. E-coli is perfectly suited to its environment, as is rice. Rice has more active genes than a human being, a nematode has more active genes than an earthworm. Complexity and advancement are artificial constructs. If you think you are more advanced than a fish, just try switching environments for a lifetime. You will lose. Evolution does not have a direction. It is measured in fitness levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly.. i am fine with teaching you about how evolution works, but will you stop challenging me with your own little theories? They are very incomplete and demonstrably so. If you want to book a block of my time, I can have this converstion and explain to you where your theory goes against all forms of analysis, and is quite an incomplete model of evolution as it is accepted today, but if you want mentoring come to me in a private message. I can sit here and write a chapter of a text book explaining to you, for the sake of Karma, or just pm me and I'll share with you everything I know so that you can get on the same page with the rest of demonstrable science regarding the processes of evolution.

       As for your semantics with directionality, would you disagree that "evolution tends to produce more complex forms. For example, simple single celled organisms eventually gave rise to multicellular organisms and this increasing complexity led to dinosaurs, birds, mammals and the technological species homo sapiens"? Surely you dont find that well accepted observation controversial do you?

       oh mylanta. complexity is not an artificial construct. Complexity being strictly correlated to "advanced" is. I thought context would provide you clues. You know - someone is having a decent day, and then someone like you comes along to make sure it is as literally annoying as possible. What is your game son?

       Firstly, you are using the wrong context for the word complexity, which is why i linked you to the specific definition of the type of complexity i am referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i suppose you need a definition for "advanced" too? Advanced doesnt equal better. I mean advancement in an
       <em>
        iterative process
       </em>
       which evolution is. It advances rather than regresses.

       Do you think I enjoy writing walls of text? I could just link you to an entire fucking book on the topic and be done with you, or I could try and condense some main points that you seem to be missing in a broken down presentation of some of the fundamentals. I request, with the amount of respect that is due, for you to please refrain from interacting with me further, lest it be construed as a form of intentional harassment on your part. Restrain yourself from interacting with me further please. This is your notice to leave me alone.

      <p>
       Evolution in complex traits
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolutionary pressures: Sexual selection, gene pool diversity, random variation, DNA mutations, calculating fitness levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to evolutionary theory, a bat could reasonably evolve echolocation as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodents squeek. Bats are rodents. Some rodents are born in the dark. Some of those rodents found that they could hear their squeeks reflected off of objects in the dark. This rodent that 'see' items in the dark is more fit than other rodents. They die, they don't mate as much, because the rodent that hears its echo doesn't die as easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       This rodent mates, and has 20 offspring. 10 of the offspring do not share the same ability to hear, and they die, their genes: deleted. The 10 remaining can also hear reflected squeeks off of objects, and each to a varying degree. They all survive. The best ones of the bunch are most fit. All of the 10 surviving squeek navigators have 20 offspring each.
      </p>
      <p>
       the most fit of the squeek navigators have 20  offspring, and 10 of them can squeek navigate better than the other 190 offspring. These 10 have varying degrees of fitness over the other 190, and they are most fit. They all have 20 offspring. The most fit of those 10 are now super squeek navigators, and the remaining offspring are bumbling around in the dark still.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon, each one of the offspring of the super squeek navigators are so much more fit to their dark environment than the others that they nimbly walk around in the darkness and have found they can eat more and mate more. Pretty soon, the only rodents left aoround them are super squeek navigators because the others get weak and die off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now every single offspring that they have vary from one another. Faces look different, ears are bigger, some are smaller, some are fat, some are thin. This is natural variation, and not considered a major mutation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ear size can continue to grow as long as it increases fitness, and pretty soon, the resolution of their squeeking can detect insects, because they squeek the best and their ears are the largest. Pretty soon, they are the fittest, and they take over the gene pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       There hasn't been a major mutation yet, this is just random fitness in their local environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So one day, they also have a common loose skin mutation. This rodent begins soaring on its loose skin flaps from tree to tree. These aren't wings, this just a random genetic mutation. They happen all the time. Sometimes they're born with 2 heads. It doesn't help, they can't focus. They die. Sometimes they are born with 3 feet. Doesn't help, animals catch them easier. they die. Sometimes they are born with white skin. Doesn't help, they are easy for predators to find. They die. Sometimes they are born hairy, sometimes bald. Doesn't matter to predators, but the females like hairy rodents over bald. It helps. Hairy rodents become popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes step-wise, and it's not trying to be an echolocating genius, the complexity arises from increased fitness, not because it wants to be more complex. I mean this is enough. If you want to keep challenging me, you don't want to learn. I can't give you more, stranger. Not now, not for nothing.

       Holy shit that is one huge wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, bats are not even remotely related to rodents and their evolutionary history is quite separate from rodents...
      </p>
      <p>

        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, evolution doesnt work at all like you describe. The ability to squeak and echolocate are very different. I suggest you actually look at where bats actually came from evolutionarily...

       First of all - good catch on the rodent thing. Fucking shit. They're not rodents. They are small mammals. My entire example still stands however. The 'hair' example was exactly a completely made up feature to describe how sexual selection can select a particular feature if the opposite gender prefers it. It could be anything. Look at guppies. Hirsutism was just a fairly common glitch in gene replication that I picked it for arbitrary reasons. Other than that, everything I said is pretty feasible. The problem with you is that fuck sake you are tenacious as sh*T.

       No, you are completely ignoring how the
       <em>

       of evolution works(hint: its self organized criticality in an emergent system).

       And your hypothesis for bat evolution is contradicted by the evolutionary history of bats, which apparently you havent googled up yet.

       I think it's mostly because it seems to depend on the government forcing the issue instead of the actual citizens frame of mind. People in general tend to self-segregate into communities where they feel comfortable,  and there's nothing wrong with that. Given that humans are capable of knowing only about 150 persons maximum it's a little unrealistic to expect that we'll really care deeply about more people than that. Not that you wish people ill but there's only so much one can do to improve anyone's situation globally. Also given that laws affect places differently due to religious beliefs, personal beliefs and values, making sweeping legal changes tend to cause chaos.

       You speak from wisdom and I appreciate that. But you speak to the amount of people as if the entire world needed to be your friend. What you miss is that it's not an argument of quantity, but a question of quality. That you will not pre judge someone for where they are from, just like we will not be judged as an enemy or an outsider first. I'm tired now, but we can change, and we have to change. I think there are very very few people satisfied with the status quo, would you agree? There's no reason we should live like our ancestors did and just accept that it's the way things are. We have more capability and knowledge than we've ever had before. It's time to evolve.

       I think you missed my point. It goes against human nature to see the entire population of the world as your friend. Trying to make the globe's inhabitants "evolve" and see outsiders as insiders, ememies as friends, etc., is risky. The utopian ideal where everyone is friendly, everyone accepts everyone, people share resources and get along is a great concept and I get why it's desired. It's just unrealistic and forgets to take into account psychopaths, pedophiles, narcissists, murderers, rapists, etc. NO ONE likes those aspects of humanity. But they exist. There are good reasons for being suspicious of those we don't know, the same way we're hard-wired to be afraid of snakes.

       yes but we still take calculated risks. like driving cars knowing there are crazy drivers out there. the mindset that settles for less because of edge cases is sort of doomed to never improve itself. We have to take risks and go what we're after first.

       I would recommend researching groups that influenced the modern day "alternative" conspiracy culture, like the John Birch Society, which Alex Jones was a member of. They were against globalism, the CFR, World Bank, etc. A stance I can agree with. But I don't agree with their motivations. They have far right views, bordering on fascist. They're extremely nationalistic, which makes them oppose globalism and outside influence. Sort of a mish mash of libertarians and neo-fascists. They hate communism, globalism, and even the federal government because of that strong sense of rugged individualism, and that brand of conservatism heavily influenced modern day conspiracy culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is that because these groups were so anti-communist, many were seeded or started by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to follow the money trail back to the CIA, I'd recommend searching "John Birch Society", "Roy Cohn", "Western Goals Foundation", "World Anti Communist League", and most importantly "John K. Singlaub."

       Because the reason for the push towards globalism is so rich can outsource costs, labour and pollution to the poor while hoarding the profit. It's essentially a propaganda tool to ease world transition into being ruled by corporations.

       I'm all for cultural exchange and free travel, those are good for cultural and thought diversity. But the word diversity itself has been twisted. Diversity is not a world where all people are blended into a soup, all consuming the same foods, same entertainment, same culture, a monoculture, but somehow that is the globalist definition of diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent nations and thousands of tribes/cultures all with their own way of doing things and free flow of information between those is true diversity. In such an enviroment ideas and innovations flourish by the natural law of edge effects:
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effects">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effects
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example of how this is true, two of humanitys cultural Golden Ages( and imo probably the high points reached so far in culture) happened in places where the norm was independent city states all with their own cultures interacting and trading, those two being ancient Greece and renaissance Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand Rome flourished while it expanded and clashed with other nations. Once Pax Romana came and those nations had been subdued and swallowed up in the Roman monoculture the empire declined and collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The globalist vision is akin to the roman one. The outcome if they suceed will be the same.

       You answered your own question in your second paragraph. We don't have any of those enumerated conditions. What we do have is Empire attempting to masquerade as a benevolent force. Empire has co-opted the "globalization" terminology, but the outcome of Empire isn't more equal distribution of resources - it is the concentration of available resources in the hands of a few, while the many feel the lack thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalism could exist as a net positive or negative for the humans living within the condition, but so long as one group of those humans continue to extract and hoard resources from the rest, the balance will always end up in the red for the majority. The nature of power is to become more concentrated with the accumulation of resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       No sane human consciously shies away from peace. Negativity, anger, destructiveness come from a place of pain - humans expressing those emotions are broken somehow. No one consciously puts the health of the economy in front of the health of the people. When a coal miner goes in to the mine and ends up with black lung, he didn't do it so that 'Murica could thrive - he did it to support his family. When Monsanto poisons the water supply, it does it so that its shareholders can acquire more resources, not so that it adds to the GDP. The economy is made up of those millions of individual decisions that humans make to acquire resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really does all boil down to the dismal science. I would love to hear how you think we might get from here to there, though. I've spent plenty of time wishing the Enterprise would show up and beam me up to a saner existence, but it hasn't happened yet. So, while we're waiting, perhaps you have some ideas about how to get from the reality we live in to the utopia you're envisioning?

       While I would like to accept and welcome other peoples cultures, there are some that I cannot. Tolerance is not acceptance, nor do you have an obligation to tolerate everything. I do not accept or tolerate the culture of Saudi Arabia, I do not accept their treatment of women, gays, and people of other religions. That does not mean I do not tolerate or accept Arabs, a culture is not a race. Some cultures are just not compatible, but others are which is why you have EU.

       The problem with this utopian ideal is that you are skipping over the many, many steps that would be required to implement it with the results you desire.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate, think of your local community. Is there equal distribution of wealth? No poverty? No crime? No drug addiction? No bigotry? Do the education, justice and healths systems all run efficiently?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, at the level of government is there a complete absence of corruption?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these problems become worse as you move upward in terms of centralized authority. The level of oversight becomes easier to circumvent the more you remove those in control from the people the serve and, as it stands, you need to be more politically cutthroat and unethical to survive at those higher levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       At each subsequent level the politicians running the system are further out of touch with the needs and control of those who elected them, yet, you are suggesting that we move things up yet another level to a Global system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not the concept itself that is bad, simply the fact that until we can fix our systems on a community level, then a metropolitan level, then state and finally national, we won't be ready for the challenge of a global system. Even in such a perfect situation (with efficient non-corrupt lower-level systems) it would still be a huge challenge moving up to that final level. As it is now it would be a disaster for the poor of the world, by which I mean about 80% of the population. You and I would probably fit into the lower level of the moderately wealthy and might do well enough as long as we turned a blind eye to the suffering of the majority and refrained from any dissident opinions but, even then, over time we would begin to see that block of comfortable 20 percenters shrink to 19% then 18%...

       Well, not to take credit from you, but I'm sensitive to attitude. Kind of like if you believe you can, or if you believe you can't, you're right. The attitude describes to me the future, not only the past. The past is more or less always true, but the future hasn't been written. Some people, like yourself signal intentionally or not, that they believe that the future has been determined already by the past. I see the future as a completely blank slate, so I look for challenges to tackle. So I'm a very tactical realist, but in my view of the future, I look to those who understand exactly what the troubles are
       <strong>
        in combination
       </strong>
       with the ability to know that we have the power to change it all.

       Globalism is the systematic exploitation of poverty solely for further enrichment of the wealthy. In the US, globalist policies like NAFTA and open borders have decimated the standard of living for the middle and lower classes.

       in my experience the most powerful human connections are found in communities. Smaller groups working together for a smaller goal. Everyone has a voice everyone makes contributions. (I worked as a camp counselor and adventure course leader).
      </p>
      <p>
       My fear is one, the people who actively push for the one world government are corrupt as fuck and want nothing for our own well being. Look at the geroegia Guide Stones. That’s a lot of dead people if those are the goals...
And two, we will begin to lose all sense of community as it grows to a global capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, your argument that we are “paying for all our poor decisions with our inability to reach our potential” is true but no due to our own fault.. The people who want the one world governments are the reason why we CANT do this now!
      </p>
      <p>
       I want world peace too and people to see each other as brothers and sisters. But this won’t happen and I’m sure as hell not going to give up control to the NWO under this guise. It’s dangerous
      </p>
      <p>
       And when the “aliens” attack and they start instituting this one world government for protections, it’s going to suck man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, within our life time there is going to be a fake alien attack that will institute this one world shit.

       Good question, I've thought about this as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion: while there will hopefully be a time when a "one world community" will exist harmoniously, without corruption, now just isn't that time. Look around, look at the world's top leaders in industry and politics. Their lives revolve around money, and power, and control. The extreme elite are only concerned with building and maintaining their own empires. These are the people in the bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, etc. leading the globalization movement. You'd have to be a fool to think that they would give it all up.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are assholes, and many would not hesitate to take advantage of a one world system, just as they take advantage of every other system in society. Combine that with the sheer enormity of such a project as creating and maintaining the harmony of 7+ billion souls, and it's not looking good.  To me, it's clear that we aren't ready, and as depressing as it is, we might not ever be. To aim for a one world utopia would be to aim for perfection, and perfection is the opposite of good. We can't aim for perfection because it will never happen.

       I'm rather confident that the people of this world are in support of this idea. Pretty sure, it is those that we've given the power of decision making. A determining of "pecking order" within the world ecosystem is what most likely is holding us back. Most every country in the world has pride for where it has come from and a want/ need to be included in decision making on a larger scale. Also, a local/ national policy change that is encouraging on a global scale may not be very popular with those that stand to lose anything they feel entitled to locally along the way. 
Being a little more involved in our own realities and worrying more for who we each choose to be can begin to give every one else the space to be who they choose/ need to be and begin to limit the friction we seem to all be feeling for each other and our personal opinions:)

       Cheating helps you get ahead and cheating is something bad people do. We've identified a target. We are free to cheat, but what does that mean and how can we bring out the honest and compassion in each other so that cheating seems to be detrimental rather than attractive to those who would do it... just thinking out loud.

       Yes. Until the concept of money is no longer needed, greed will drive human behaviour. Even after money doesn't become a thing humans will still find ways to divide into groups and fight. (Ex. Robots vs. Humans)

       Yes, I agree. We need humans to focus on self-improvement and education to eradicate ignorance and weakness. Unfortunately its not reality for everyone. Many people lack something that drives passion in their lives or they get tangled up in other life problems, like having kids too early or having an abusive upbringing/mental issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's up to young leaders like us to drive innovation and that's why you see business leaders coming up with ideas like UBI. We are trying to prepare ourselves for an automated world and it's going to be very difficult to adapt. Money will have to be gone before that can occur. But nobody knows a better system. Capitalism is working for now, we just need to protect our environment more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your idea is the eventual "sense of purpose" but we aren't there yet. Your talking about what it's going to feel fulfil us spiritually when we no longer have to work due to automation. At that point though we have to worry about robots trying to attack us and/or our environment already being destroyed.
The onl only other way this would happen would be if humans had to unite against things like:
- asteroid Collision 
-changing environment/terraform mars
- pandemic
-alien invasion

       Well explaining evolution, emergence and complexity theory like someone is 5 while being tipsy is kind of a tall order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand how crystals form? Lets start there.
      </p>
      <p>
       A solution of say, salt water is just a mix with no real order. The solution will behave like a liquid. If you let salt water dry, through dehydration and
       <em>
        self organization
       </em>
       , salt crystals will form in a regular way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, salt crystals have a predictable structure. They may be somewhat unique at a large scale, but their underlying structure coalesces into being in the same way every time. Its complexity emerging from seeming chaos,
       <em>
        because of the way the atoms arrange themselves because of their own fundamental properties like their orbitals and bond angles
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic underlying nature of sodium and chlorine(the constituent elements of NaCl table salt) gives rise to the structure of the crystals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well wtf does that have to do with evolution? Its the same process but with more variables than two atoms and their underlying atomic structures. Yet, complexity forms from seeming randomness: stars from coalescing hydrogen, planets from coalescing dust in a stars accretion disc, and so on right down to life itself forming and then evolving into different species, each either being well adapted and surviving and continuing to evolve, or going extinct as most of the species that have ever existed have gone extinct.

       Listen you're confusing pervasiveness as a trait with evolution. In any populatin a trait can become present from 0% to 100%. You are assuming that at 100%, it is evolution, but at say... 2%, it's not. This is where you must realize that even if 2% of a population contain a trait that increases their fitness, they are evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one generation passes on a trait that increases fitness, it is evolution. If after 10 generations, it reaches 50% of the population, it is evolution. If it stays at that population frequency for 1000 years because of equilibrium, it is still evolution. If selection pressures push that trait down to 2% of the population after one generation,  it is also evolution. If after one generation, it becomes 100% of the population, it is also evolution. Evolution isn't an end result. Evolution is a process. It is a process that happens over each successive generation, with the passing on traits suited or ill-suited to fit an environment. Evolution is not the end result of this. I am taking the time to help you.
