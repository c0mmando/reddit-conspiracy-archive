       Today we find it was a left wing nut with gun control obsession and there is not a single post about it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The envelopes to Jr. and few others were sent at the same time, all of which were harmless, only two days before Florida shooting. Is it crazy to think that the two events are related and we are looking at a much bigger conspiracy here?

       This thread seems to be more anti trump then neutral or pro trump. Its fine on other conspiracies, but any conspiracy involving trump, him and his family either are evil scumbags or theyre trying to garner sympathy.

       Trumps apparently have no good sides, and can not possibly be even neutral.

       I don’t see that at all. Quite the opposite. Pro-Trump posts don’t have suspiciously high upvotes like anti-Trump posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any post about the FISA memos or that involve Clinton, Podesta, etc. are always brigaded by the same group of users who get 50+ upvotes while anyone with a dissenting comment get -50 downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       These same people attack anyone who appears pro-Trump by calling them Trumptards and accusing them of bowing down to their Emperor or Daddy Trump. They are completely obsessed with Trump while they accuse others of being obsessed with Trump.

       Worshippers of a statist and authoritarian come to a
       <em>

       I disagree with that. I do not consider trump authoritarian and i dont know why you would. I also do not have unquestioning support for him or anyone.
Do not patronise me as a way of explaining because you are not explaining anything other then how you seem to believe you are omnipotent.
So instead of going full on reddit, please actually explain your point of view, otherwise youre just trolling pretending to know what youre talking about.

       But ultimately the pied piper thing supports my point. It was an orchestrated media strategy to present Trump like he was an anti-establishment outsider. That was the MSM narrative.

       He was well connected-yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all those people who were stoked to take a picture with him 4 years ago constantly shit all over him now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an orchestrated media strategy to smear him as much as possible...he kept giving them shit to talk about and they kept talking about it. If only the dems had a candidate that didn’t lose support every time she opened her mouth.
      </p>

       They knew the best way to support Hillary was to have people focus on Trump.

       I have nothing to disagree with here. I think you're on point as I also find the Clintons revolting.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think you're understating the role the media's narrative had on influencing Trump supporters. The MSM are the ones who pushed the narrative that there was this crazy dangerous baffoon who would "drain the swamp". This is the narrative the MSM loved to push since they thought people would be turned off by craziness and danger. But yet this crazy image resonated with his supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I think the MSM was promoting him. Albeit could have been unknowing promotion, but I find it hard to believe with how much air time he got on the major networks.

       Yeah, I don't see that mentioned in the linked article at all. Also, I'm still not sure how this is supposedly connected to the Florida shooting. It wasn't even an assassination attempt, it was a letter filled with cornstarch.

       It was inferred from Jr's tweet that said "opposing views", obviously meaning left-ish person... I don't know if it was about gun control though, cause it was sent 2 days before the shooting event...

       If the point was to garner sympathy then a "left wing nut with gun control obsession" would be exactly the patsy/plant they'd use.
