       Reading many of the comments in this topic about a new law passed in South Africa is disturbing:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8127pa/this_man_who_called_for_the_white_genocide_in/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8127pa/this_man_who_called_for_the_white_genocide_in/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are the comments blatantly false and fabrications (e.g. people claiming the law isnt being reported, genocidal, etc). They also seem to be pushing a racist agenda that suggests whites are inherently better than blacks and they will be useless without them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read lately about some white supremacist tactics which sow discontent and divisions among communities this way. I believe they are using this news item to recruit people from here. Check out this AMA from a former klansman who mentions a technique similar to this:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/80y3va/im_an_ex_white_supremacist_and_klansman_ama/duz4xab/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/80y3va/im_an_ex_white_supremacist_and_klansman_ama/duz4xab/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway just asking the folks here to be wary of white supremacists since they are recruiting. I know many people here can be susceptible to their IDpol propaganda since they know how to tap into people's outrage and make emotional pleas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add the racist comments -

       They also exploit some of the ambiguity/dog-whistleability of discussions about Israel, the Holocaust, so-called (((globalists))), "Cultural Marxism", etc to get their foot in the door to this and other communities.

       This won't be a popular opinion but a lot of conspiracy theories (jews run the world, etc) are started by white Christians and most white supremicist groups hate Jews, hence neo nazi radical christians.

       Please explain the difference between pointing out that white people are in positions in power or that Jews are in positions of power. The only difference I see is that the former is allowed and the latter not.

       Who said that one is allowed and the other isn't? Confused by this statement. But certainly there are a lot of Jews and Zionists who have power, that is just a statement of fact. Racism only comes in if ascribe (especially negative) characteristics to a person due to their ethnicity. E.g. arguing that "the Jews" are evil and are coming to get you is racist.

       I made no moral judgement. I simply said that I'm
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       to point out that white people are disproportionately in positions of power but I'm not permitted to say the same about Jews without being labeled a racist (as you so quickly demonstrated).

       There are several Israeli shills who will call any criticism or mention of Israel "anti-semitic". But I've never seen them argue against the fact there are many Jews with influence and power, or shout that down as racist. Maybe you're just sensitive since you somehow took my comment as an accusation of you being racist, when I made no such comment lol.

       I've already mentioned this. I have no problem with pointing out facts. I have no doubt there are people from every racial and ethnic group that participate in conspiracies, especially the wealthy elite. Using their race is a distraction and IDpol tactic that racists and progressive alike use to shutdown conversations and discredit legitimate conspiracies.

       Who cares what white supremacists believe? They’re in the minority. Fringe groups. Their message certainly isn’t going to sway me to their side and I doubt it will sway many other sane people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a lot more deliberate confusion by the MSM between white supremacists and nationalists. People who are anti-globalism and pro-USA are not white supremacists. Nationalists are against illegal immigration and importing refugees. No open borders. That does not mean they are racists but the media tries to portray them as such.

        Who cares what white supremacists believe? They’re in the minority. Fringe groups. Their message certainly isn’t going to sway me to their side and I doubt it will sway many other sane people.

      <p>
       This is a bit naive. Maybe you won't be swayed, but it's not crazy to think that the normalization of some of these white supremacist ideas doesn't impact others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perception of popularity is a strong tool that's been exploited throughout history. Our ideas shape our reality. Push an idea aggressively and fool the useful idiot into thinking a fringe idea is normal.

      <p>
       Just open up pol and take a look at that massive psyop. Racist right wing nationalist propaganda that is normalized using memes and humor. WHY SO SERIOUS?! IZ JUS BAIT. Swallow the bullshit and keep it moving it's all normal.

       Again, racists and nationalists are not the same thing. You don’t have to be white to be a nationalists. They aren’t the same thing and I’d argue that nationalists out number racists. There are Black and Hispanic nationalists.

       Fair point that I didn't think needed to be reiterated. I didn't even address that in my reply because the scope of what I'm saying is much larger than questioning whether being a white nationalist makes someone racist.

       When the white farmers were kicked off their land, the land was given to African farmers.  The African farmers didn't know how to run the land and the country had a food shortage.  If you look online there is quite a bit of information on it.

       This is something collectivists never seem to understand. Ascribing issues with one group of black people to black
       <em>
        individuals
       </em>
       IS racism. You are reducing the individual to their race  - a collective - and saying that entails some negative characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn to treat people as individual humans, and not a collective, abstract group with a certain set of characteristics. Then you won't be considered a racist. It is simple.

       You have to address collective issues of racial groups because different racial groups generally have different issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       White people have shown to be far more likely to commit mass shootings and seem to be more suceptable to mental health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people commit murder on an average of 4:1 to their other racial counterparts in the US and alot of that is due to gang violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we solve these issues? Let's start with whites.  Raise the minimum age to buy guns (Being done) and put.more resources into mental health and prevention tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we solve black issues? Increase funding for social programs, bring in good quality educators, and promote a safe community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well Maslows Heirarchy of Needs states that you need safety before you can achieve any other tier on the path to self-fulfillment.  To do that we first need a higher police presence in the community.  But cops are all racists and the conversation stops there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think a better quality educator is going to endanger themselves in a classroom with potential 16 year old gang members I'd probably laugh in your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody can address the issues of racial minorities because it just becomes an issue about race.  Thanks media, thanks BLM.  Good job on setting us back 50 years of multicultural progress

       I don't disagree that there are certain issues which disproportionately affect certain communities. I actually agree with some of what you have to say and don't find it completely unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my issue on this topic is very specific. If (taking your example) someone says because someone is white, they must be mentally ill or a killer=&gt; This is racism. If you say because someone is black, they must be unable or incompetent  (because look at what these other black people did!) =&gt; This is racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I would say I agree that different issues affect different communities, and that means they need to be addressed differently. Saying this is not racist because you don't need to make the argument that their genetics/race are what caused this. Rather you can study and put it into historical context, racism, systemic causes (some of which you mentioned), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think using
       <em>
        race
       </em>
       to ascribe characteristics to individual people is racist and an entirely different situation. Since in this case the argument is being made that their genetics/race inherently make them less competent and less deserving of basic humanity. This view is justified by imposing collectivist views on them. That is, they are being reduced to a member of their race, rather than an individual person/human who has the capacity to overcome issues their community is plagued by.

       Fair enough.  The problem is that even though there are very obvious trends that effect certain populations, people are so quickly to accuse each other of racism that we never get to address the issue at the root of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now in SA, white farmers are being targeted and murdered.  If you do a little bit of research into the issue and ignore the racebaiting clickbait opinion articles you'll see that these same farmers.  This isn't regular shot to the head murder either, people are being skinned alive and tortured before being killed.  There are plenty of pictures (that I've seen) and a few videos on live leak (that I refuse to watch) of the aftermath of the killings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that white people (who are the obvious majority on reddit considering it is an English speaking website.) are pissed.  Could you imagine what would happen if people started targeting and torturing black business owners in America?  Then the president states "We are going to take all black business owners assets."
      </p>
      <p>
       The emotional reaction from the black community would be just as intense.  A large problem is that people who don't follow the news very closely and those that do appear to have a hyper-reactionary response but their emotional response does have merit.

       I think white supremacists are here in force. We should be supporting a nation trying to build itself up and kick people who have exploited them off their land, but what gets upvoted is sensationalized misinformation with clickbait titles like "black people want to kill white people!"

       Its not racist to point out what happened in Zimbabwe when they kicked out the whites.  White people wanting to preserve their race and countries is not racism nor is it white supremacism.  The uptick in people defending whites here is not unique to this subforum.  Americans are being force fed the idea that if they don't accept people from third world countries by the millions they are racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Europeans are being force fed the idea that if they don't accept  muslims by the millions they are racist.  There will naturally be resistance to these agendas, and I'm not sure why that surprises you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bombing the shit out of Afghanistan and Iraq was pretty racist.  If those countries were full of white Christians the American people wouldn't have allowed that, believe me.  But the idea that razing the middle east to the ground being racist, is not talked about.  In fact, the very people in government and media who convinced the American people to kill millions of brown people in the middle east for no reason whatsoever, are the same people who tell us we are racist for wanting to live in a white country.  Why do you suppose that is?  Could it be because reigning fire and fury down on the middle east fits their agenda, and filling white countries with nonwhites also fits their agenda?
      </p>

       I was against the wars.  I have always fought and tried to raise awareness against the deep state bombing of innocent people of all races and religions.  I have always voted in the voting booth and with my wallet against these wars of aggression.  Acknowledging that every country in the world that I would want to live in also happens to be a white country, does not make me a violent person, it does not make me a dangerous person, and it does not make me a bad person.  I hope every human on earth can enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  I'm also awake enough to realize that liberty, freedom, and legal justice tend to be found in places where there are white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if my acknowledging that observation offends you.

       When the majority of one profession is taken up by a certain group then it is fair to assume they have a higher knowledge of that profession - it may have been racism that originally got them in that position but now it is just the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       To break this stupid chain it needs to be realized that the farmers who have been doing this for longer have more knowledge than those who have not. We can either play the race card equally split everything forcefully or we can bring in long term policy to slowly equalize the system and educate and train up those who want to find work in the farming system.

       I wonder why nobody keeps complaining about the killings of the natives of Africa when the white settlers and colonists went into those lands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well of Course, for some here that wasn't a genocide (well it wasn't at all, except soemthing like punitive expeditions the against the Nama and Herero), it's just something like taking god giving rights or just take what the superior race was to be entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it at least just dispossess or stealing back stolen land at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this as racists, but then you also had to see it as racist that a minority of white farmers owns the majority of the lands. then you should ask yourself, what's more racist.
Perhaps you should think also a bit about the history of those regions, how the White treated the Black there, was there something like equality or fairness?
      </p>
      <p>
       One Thing at least, yes there are certain numbers of racists, especially White supremacists people parading around in this sub.
Some of them obviously showing their mindset and others doing it more subtle.
