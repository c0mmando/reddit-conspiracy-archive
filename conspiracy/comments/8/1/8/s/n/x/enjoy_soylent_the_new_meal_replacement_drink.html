        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been seeing the ad for this Soylent meal replacement drink more and more lately. Maybe it’s because of my age or love of obscure wild movies but I can’t be the only one who remembers the movie “Soylent Green” where Charlton Heston screaming in horror discovers the new food that the government has been feeding people with is made from the people they scoop up in giant bulldozers during food riots. “Soylent Green is people...it’s people!!!” I figured that there was a separate meaning of the word soylent, why else would they possibly name a drink unless there was another definition so to speak. To my surprise there isn’t and never was the word soylent in the dictionary or used anywhere else except in this old Charlton Heston movie. Literally the only time that word had ever been used up until this drink came out was in the title of a movie about people unwittingly eating other humans. At this point I was a little blown away. Why would a company possibly want to name their product after such a thing? Maybe they hoped no one watched this movie or are trying to be funny? I’m at a loss. I’m interested about what other people take from this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What, that&#39;s still around? I remember years ago it was being marketed as a meal replacement for hyperfocused tech workers who couldn&#39;t find the time or effort for regular meals. The &quot;edgy&quot; darkly humorous name, was, of course, part of the branding, because meal replacement shakes already exist, but have associations with the elderly and infirm, while Soylent wanted to be trendy and associated with young overachieving tecchies. </p>

<p>I remember it going fabulously wrong... explosive diarrhea? mysterious green slime?</p>

<p>This stuff couldn&#39;t have come back from that PR disaster, surely? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should rewatch it.  Logan talks to the main AI when he goes undercover as a runner, and BoxBot is the AI robot who says its his job to freeze and serve humans as food (a job assumed to be given from the main AI).  You could argue he only serves the runners as food to the city but based on the size of the city and the number of runners that make it that far, you can be pretty sure they are cooking everyone over 30 (as you see there is not much outside the city so where else does the food come from?)</p>

I&#39;ll drink some every now and then when I&#39;m in a hurry. Taste kinda like pancake batter. They now have Soylent chow which is a keto friendly version. My buddy has lost close to 100 pounds on just the keto friendly version while working out a few times a week. This shit is pretty legit as far as meal replacements, I just dislike the taste or else I would be 100% in for convenience sake.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a toxic substance if it&#39;s in the form of nano particles and inhaled in huge quantities. As far as I know there is no research suggesting eating foods with typical amounts of titanium dioxide is harmful.</p>
