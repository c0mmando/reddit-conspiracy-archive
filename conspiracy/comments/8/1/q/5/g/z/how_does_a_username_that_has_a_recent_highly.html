       . His comment currently has 660+ upvotes. Yet if you try and go to his userpage, it says user not found. He or she has obviously not deleted themselves. Or been banned or shadowbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is some fucky shit. So please explain or handwave away. As it stands, to me, at this point, this is not normal for reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       e: changed is to has, added been. Sorry I can't live with poor grammar on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       e2: This appears to have been a user who has been shadowbanned by the admins for whatever reason. I am going to leave this post as is instead of deleting it, hopefully to foster a discussion on how shadowbanning is detrimental to the stated aims of reddit. Why don't reddit admins ban all people outright stating the reason for the ban which can seen by the community as a whole, rather than this shadowbanning shit which is at this point, only serving to muddy the waters about who is and isn't a "legitimate" poster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, it seems that the shadowban process is a perfect (or at least very good) way to make stealth and untraceable accounts that can manipulate posts.
      </p>

       This is how it works when a user is shadowbanned. Either the user made the comment and was then shadowbanned or suspended (shadowbans don't retroactively remove all comments or posts by a users), or the user was already shadowbanned/suspended, and a mod manually approved the comment.

       No. It leads to the same "page not found" page as if the account were deleted or never existed. Mods can see comments the user makes on their sub, but that's it.

       No, I think it's much more likely that the user has been shadowbanned or suspended sometime in the interim. I gave the other only to fully list the possibilities of what could have happened.

        most recent comment
       </a>
       was made 19 hours ago (as of this writing), and the other user noticed the userpage was missing 11 hours.  I think it's most likely that his account was banned or suspended sometime during that 8 hours. It's very possible the admins banned him because they suspected he was involved in vote manipulation, but it could be for a host of reasons.

       Thanks. I edited my original post to reflect this info. I'm hoping it can spark a broader discussion about shadowbanning. If you or the other mods remove it for whatever reasons, I won't raise a stink, but hopefully you all will let stay.

       I've noticed that the accounts making comments that push or accommodate the nwo agenda are often upvoted to 33, 33.3k, 66, 666, etc. They also many times have a username that pays homage to Satan.

       I can't because it would be against forum rules most likely (calling out shills). It's really easy to see if you look for it. I think a lot of these accounts are ai controlled.

       I don’t think pointing out suspicious activity in other subs is rule breaking, just attacking users in this sub.  You could ask a mod to make sure.  I was just hoping you’d share some specific examples.

       I dont give a fuck if someone has ever or never deleted their post history. Deleting (or not deleting) does not make someone better or any worse than people who routinely delete or keep every post they make.

      <p>
       I have never seen a reason not to delete posts after 5-6 days, after the thread quiets down, drops down to 20-300- on the list, no one reads it again, it is gone. The only people who would look at it are snoops looking over a users history for one reason or another.

       A shitty comment should not be upvoted simply because someone likes the poster.
