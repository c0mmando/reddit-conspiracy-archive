       I am not here to educate people on the ins and outs of face typing, but i am curious if anyone here knows about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a highly controversial subject, often dismissed as "phrenology" and therefore mere pseudoscience. However, no one disagrees that genetics give rise to an organisms physical traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new version of face reading, typing etc has been called various things, among them Edenism, although i did not know that there was an ancient pseudoscience and a modern genetics based face typing community until a few years back. I found that i had been face reading all my life. As a Starchild, that would be somewhat natural, since we are the "mind reader/empath" type.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know terms like Starchild, Melon, Thal and Cromag, you know of what i speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason i bring this up is that it is extremely useful in detecting those likely to be, how shall i put this: dishonest, murderous, liars, sociopathic, simply by looking at their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: heres a thread about the US Senate that people should find interesting around here.

       The old aphorism "the eyes are the window to the soul" is true(barring disfigurement by disease or injury
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else acquainted with this newer version of the ancient, rather quiet field?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, what type are you? I am a starchild plus neanderthal back/neanderthal front, although that is somewhat oversimplified.
      </p>

       Beware the antisocial cromags, certain types of melons and most especially cromag melon hybrids(Paris Hilton face).

       I was not familiar w those terms, cool.  Ekman and Freisen's Unmasking the Face is THE book you want to hit up.   FBI helped pay for 50 years of research.  I'd recommend reading w a dash of Piaget (and LeCoq) since he demonstrates how these so-called universal expressions are very likely conditioned viscerally at such young age we mistake our programming as "natural". The project to domesticate humans began in ancient times so yeah , I'd bundle it up w all those other reptilian superstitions like phrenology.    It simply has not been demonstrated that a "smile" has universal meaning.   People who believe that believe in cartoons, that's how cartoons convey emotions to the viewer - we are conditioned to believe in cartoons.   All micro expressions are the behavioral byproduct of neurological processes, thoughts. And many thoughts are not conscious, so the idea is our face becomes a lie detector.  That's why politicians started getting botox during the 1950s so they could lie to us with a straight face.

       Do you mean facial

       betray the true intentions of a person? Because thats not controversial. Its like a polygraph(which are quite interesting to take lol).

       as i said before, you are associating facial features with the character of a person. YOU JUST CHANGED A WORD!

       but my problem is not that... my problem with it is that you are making this sistematicaly, conciously reinforcing your bias against perceived physical caracteristics of people and trying to spread you PREJUDICE to others.

       Im sorry if empirical evidence bothers you. Are you against IQ testing as well? Do you not realize that IQ is partially genetically determined? Do those simple facts trigger you?

       OP maybe you are unconsciously/intuitively perceiving something beyond the mere face, and you are just rationalizing this with face typing? Also how do you know you’re a starchild?
