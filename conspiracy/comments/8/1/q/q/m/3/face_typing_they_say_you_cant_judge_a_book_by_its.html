        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not here to educate people on the ins and outs of face typing, but i am curious if anyone here knows about it.</p>

<p>It is a highly controversial subject, often dismissed as &quot;phrenology&quot; and therefore mere pseudoscience. However, no one disagrees that genetics give rise to an organisms physical traits. </p>

<p>The new version of face reading, typing etc has been called various things, among them Edenism, although i did not know that there was an ancient pseudoscience and a modern genetics based face typing community until a few years back. I found that i had been face reading all my life. As a Starchild, that would be somewhat natural, since we are the &quot;mind reader/empath&quot; type.</p>

<p>If you know terms like Starchild, Melon, Thal and Cromag, you know of what i speak. </p>

<p>The reason i bring this up is that it is extremely useful in detecting those likely to be, how shall i put this: dishonest, murderous, liars, sociopathic, simply by looking at their face. </p>

<p>Edit: heres a thread about the US Senate that people should find interesting around here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.xen.altrugenics.com/xf/index.php?threads/op-ed-a-phrenological-investigation-into-the-united-states-senate-in-two-parts.715/">https://www.xen.altrugenics.com/xf/index.php?threads/op-ed-a-phrenological-investigation-into-the-united-states-senate-in-two-parts.715/</a></p>

<p>The old aphorism &quot;the eyes are the window to the soul&quot; is true(barring disfigurement by disease or injury <em>of course</em>).</p>

<p>Anyone else acquainted with this newer version of the ancient, rather quiet field?</p>

<p>If so, what type are you? I am a starchild plus neanderthal back/neanderthal front, although that is somewhat oversimplified.</p>

<p>Beware the antisocial cromags, certain types of melons and most especially cromag melon hybrids(Paris Hilton face).</p>

<p>as i said before, you are associating facial features with the character of a person. YOU JUST CHANGED A WORD!<br/>
