       The reason r/politics is so vastly overran by liberal ideology is because almost all conservative users are issued a 7-10 minute cool down almost immediately after their first comment. The excuse that more liberals frequent this site may be true but not to the extent that it would completely silence an entire community that was large enough to win a presidential election. Top comments are left without engagement because users are unable to acknowledge more than one without wasting their entire day. This allows liberal comments to go completely unchecked, posting multiple times per thread without worry of censorship or descent. The downvote button has been completely misused to silence a political party on one of the largest sites on the internet.

       You can't just say that you have to actually give us exactly how what the comment says is going wrong. That would be the equivalent of me saying "you are wrong the comment you replied to explains why you are wrong"... I'm guessing you won't explain why probably because you can't.

        "The situation was already resolved by the time we heard about Trump's involvement,” one team source claimed to ESPN. “That's not to take away from the fact that he got involved, but the players already had their passports back and their flights booked to go home Tuesday night when Gen. Kelly called the players.”The players were released on bail within 24 hours, but UCLA officials reportedly appeased Chinese officials by agreeing to keep the players in China an extra 72 hours after the rest of the team returned home to “avoid the perception that they got off easy,” an unnamed team source told ESPN.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incident happened on a Tuesday, and the players returned to the U.S. on the following Tuesday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump was in China that weekend and raised the subject with Chinese President Xi Jinping, reportedly at a Sunday night dinner.
       </p>
       <p>
        A source told ESPN that the players' return flights were already secured by the time White House chief of staff John Kelly called to tell the players that the White House was getting involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump took credit for intervening and negotiating the players’ release, but a new report from ESPN finds that the charges had been dropped and the players’ passports returned two days before the White House told them it was involved.

       Yes. Welcome to Reddit, the gate way to echo chambers and closed minded closet subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics was subdued to silence any overall political dissenting voices gathering momentum. The Liberal leaning facade it has was deliberately ordained to create division and partian tones.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you step back, you will see the Sub is a narrative control hub.It's not even particularly "liberal" perverted but mainstream  puke verbatim narrative control. It's the holding tank of newspeak zombies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were days when r/politics was place to discuss ideas beyond political parties. People were waking up to Bush era tyranny, and political dissent was amplified in internet forums.

       The two largest conservative subreddits r/conservative and r/the_donald bans anyone with liberals opinions. Yet you are concerned with r/politics “censorship”, which allows conservative opinion, just because they put a cool down on posts....are we being serious right now?

       Do you not see a difference? Each of those subs plus many more, and like 100 liberal subs have rules that don't allow dissenting opinions. r/ politics is meant to be a middle ground for all, though I don't believe they are doing cool downs for conservative. I think it has more to do with your karma, and your account age. Though I was banned from many liberal subs during the election bc they said I made comments in t_d, and I've never been banned from a 'conservative' sub for commenting in liberal subs

       I didn't think I implied that was the goal of the subreddit. Just that it's the main/default political sub, and 'politics' usually indicates more than one side. I think it was cute what you tried to misinterpret in my comment, and what you just blatantly ignored. IIRC I was defending r/ politics. Misinterpreting/misrepresenting people and ideas is kind of your thing huh?

       I’ve seen subs that don’t have downvote buttons. Also I’m not blaming mods, but this should be something reported as an issue. This isn’t a tiny sub it has 4mil subs and is on r/all every second of the day.

       That is because they hide downvotes with CSS. Doing so makes no difference for the vast majority of users, it doesn't work on mobile which is I believe over half of all reddit users and for anyone with RES it's just one click to disable subreddit styling and get the downvote button back. It's just too easy to circumvent to have any real effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       We actually had a study months ago with researchers from MIT where we hid downvotes for a period of time and the data concluded doing so had virtually no effect on user civility, so it is something we looked at and got some actual data for.
