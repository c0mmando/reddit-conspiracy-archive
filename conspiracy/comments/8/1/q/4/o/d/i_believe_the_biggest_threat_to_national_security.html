        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because some have so much and some have so little, people do not have an equal say in their government. This is not democracy. They say the elections give everyone equal say because they are chosing people. Well, after these people are chosen, money dictates what they do more than what the people they represent want. The farther the gap in rich and poor, the more unstable and authoritarian the country becomes. We have a billionaire president and a multi millionaire majority congress, with a thousandaire electorate. Make no mistake that this is what ruined kindoms during serfdom. Who fights the wars? Who builds the houses? Who gets paid more for planning when the labor has the knowledge after a little practice? Who fixes these higher paid people&#39;s mistakes bc they have hands on experience?</p>

<p>I think terrorism can be wealthy people using money as a weapon of mass destruction. </p>

A majority of the US population will be dead in a few months because they do not know how to even grow their own food &amp; hunt.  People in the US will not rise up because the conditions are to good.  Ever think about what it would be like if a big enough solar flare wipes out the power grid?

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Even the poor here live better than the majority of the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree, though your statement has some truth to it. </p>

<p>A panhandler in the U.S. can make more than a merchant in say India. </p>

<p>The thing is, what does it <em>cost</em> for that panhandler to get the basic necessities of life? Several orders of magnitude what it costs that merchant. </p>

<p>If income is high and cost of living is high, then the net is a worse quality of life than places where the income is low and the cost of living is very low with supporting infrastructure. </p>

<p>That last part is the real big deal there, and it is something <em>everyone</em> ignores when it comes to wealth and quality of life. </p>

<p>A man with a billion dollars on an island in the middle of nowhere with no communication will have a lower quality of life than a homeless person living in the city. </p>

<p>Because of the infrastructure. </p>

<p>A homeless man with $10 is usually less than a 5 minute walk from food and hydration. </p>

<p>That billionaire on the island better spend most of his next few days setting up trapping and sourcing a water supply. </p>

<p>That said, $10 in the hands of that Indian merchant just bought a lavish dinner for him and his 5 best friends. </p>

<p>Quality of life is massively affected by available infrastructure and the buying power of an equivalent hour&#39;s income. </p>

<p>For example, my mother when making minimum wage back in the 60s had <em>more</em> buying power per hour than I do making twice minimum wage today. </p>

<p>The task I do requires more knowledge and experience than my mother&#39;s min wage job yet I have a measurably lower quality of life than she had. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve lived homeless for 6 months, and I can tell you this that there were days when I knew for a fact that a mud hut and a handful of grubs were twice the luxury I could muster. </p>

<p>It was miserable, an identity destroying ordeal that I wish upon no one. It took a lot of hard work to climb out of it and I have wasted a good chunk of my life making sure it never happened again. </p>

<p>So while your statement is in a sense true, it lacks the nuance to truly grasp the situation of world wealth inequality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A majority of the US population will be dead in a few months because they do not know how to even grow their own food &amp; hunt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed, and a lot of people who think they have survival skills because they&#39;ve read a book and watched all the Mad Max movies are going to get a very lethal surprise when the grid does drop. </p>

<p>Being cityfolk is going to be a survival detriment soon. Thankfully I had a healthy country childhood. </p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t own a firearm. I fully support the ownership of firearms, including assault rifles, by legal and licensed citizens. </p>

<p>In fact, I would go as far as to say that any equipment available to the police force, Coast Guard, or any other military branch operating on U.S. soil should also be legally available to properly licensed citizens. </p>

<p>Yes I include tank-like vehicles in this list. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s why they try so hard to push the blue vs red propaganda so strong with trivial issues. The longer and harder poor republicans fight poor democrats the longer those at the top can stay in power. If we could figure out a way to unite and fight the inequality we could see real socioeconomic change. But as long as we&#39;re fighting eachother so hard it will never happen. Whether it&#39;s through civil disobedience or revolution there needs to be a stop to this income inequality. It&#39;s worse than it was during &quot;The Guilded Age&quot; but they&#39;re keeping us so well distracted it&#39;s only going to get worse while they&#39;re protected at the top. We need to unite and fight for change with eachother and realize their hate propaganda is only meant to keep us divided against eachother and not against them. Their militiarizing the rights hate and anger against those whom they perceive causes their economic strife through lack of education and militarize for xenophobia and the left is being told to hate those on the right. It isn&#39;t working and we need to fight back and punish those at the top who&#39;ve pillaged us for far too long. </p>

A recent signpost was Thomas Piketty&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">Capital</a>, which does a very thorough job reviewing and summarizing the data (unfortunately it&#39;s written in a way that is torture to read).  </p>

<p>The only identity politic that truly matters is rich v. poor and money is <em>the</em> number 1 control mechanism driving every problem in the world today.

    <div class="md"><p>You make a very good point, but the way I&#39;ve been looking at it recently is that the money is a mechanism for control no matter if you have alot or a little. </p>

<p>Money itself is inherently worthless.  We have 1s and 0s that are meant to represent paper money that represents a unit of gold but there is really no gold and the gold is artificially kept stable  and only worth what it&#39;s worth because it was assigned a value by the ruling class. </p>

<p>Imo the problem is not some have more money than others, but rather that people focusing on attaining dollars is a mass distraction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the not only does money decide what politicians do once they are elected, money also decides who the candidates are to start with.  Just like this last presidential election, it&#39;s the choice between a shit sandwich and a giant douche.  I firmly believe that anyone who is able to be elected in this country is unfit for the job, by virtue of being &#39;electable&#39; in the first place.  It takes crazy amounts of money to run a campaign these days, even for lower offices like the house of representatives, and except for the rare cases where a candidate is entirely self-funded (and even those who could fund their own campaign don&#39;t, since lobbyists and special interest groups will throw money at them) they make promises to the lobbyists  and donors to represent <em>their</em> interests, and not the interests of their constituency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so true it&#39;s not even funny.</p>

<p>For example, I know someone who is currently campaign chairman of a really great candidate running for congress (house, not senate). The candidate is essentially someone from the middle class.</p>

<p>What is truly criminal is the parasitic &quot;consultant class&quot; that you apparently <em>must</em> have working in one&#39;s campaign. In this federal campaign you have to comply with the FEC rules, in order for a candidate to comply <em>the FEC will send over a consultant, essentially for free, to help a campaign meet all the FEC compliance guidelines</em>. Sounds about right doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>However, <em>in order to be taken seriously as a candidate</em> the campaign is going to have to bring on a &quot;Compliance Consultant&quot; and <em>pay this consultant $5,000 dollars a month</em> to essentially do nothing, because the FEC will send in someone from the FEC to help a campaign comply. </p>

<p>When the campaign chairman wanted to nix the paid consultant, and thus save the campaign around $45,000 between now and the election, <em>they were overruled because if they did not have the $5,000 a month Compliance Consultant they would not be taken seriously and would not be supported by the Democratic Party and be the nominee</em>.</p>

<p>The system is essentially rigged to prevent a non-millionaire from running for Congress right from the start.</p>
