       I’ve seen this discussion here before but I want to ask everyone one question;
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you here to push your political beliefs on people or are you here to discuss true conspiracies that plague humanity (past and present)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought I’d see Trump-Russia talk on here. Or 2nd amendment arguments referencing left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top of the rules of this sub says this;
“This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I would very much like this irrelevant shit talking to cease and this sub stop being a place of political nonsensical jibber. In my opinion this is exactly how the rich and powerful want our interactions/conversations; chaotic and uninformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your thoughts.

       SS: I would just like an open discussion about why people feel the need to polarize their beliefs and why we’ve become so emotional about everything. Why is it so bad to change your opinion on something or even consider someone else’s viewpoint?  Why do we have to align ourselves with a political movement and jam that down each others throats all the time?

       Most people prioritize being accepted, or being “cool” over finding the truth. So they end up with politically polarized opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also taught “never change! Never let anyone tell you who you are or what to think!” All they while what they think and defend so ardently as their own opinion was simply indoctrinated into them as children. Parents continue the cycle.

       I have no idea but I want to hear about things that challenge who we are and why we’re here. And hell, what we as individuals stand for. In an open discussion. I want to hear about aliens, CERN, pedophile rings spanning the whole world, banking conspiracies, governments overthrowing other governments, etc. That’s the stuff that I come here for. It’s being drowned out

       All of these things are political. Attempting to have a conversation about any of them is likely to draw attention from partisan idiots pushing agendas too. How would you suggest we discuss "governments overthrowing governments" without politics playing a role in the discussion? If I tell you about how the US government lied about the Syrian government using gas attacks on their own people, if I point out that Islamic terrorists with ties to the US government were actually responsible for chemical attacks, what do you do when useful idiots come in to defend Obama for illegally bombing Syria without congressional approval? What do you do when useful idiots come in to defend Trump who also illegally bombed Syria based on them using the same kind of lie AGAIN? How could we possibly talk about the US government attempting to overthrow Syria by supporting Islamic terrorists in the country while also somehow keeping things "non-political"?

       I guess it’s not political how we view it. All these politicians are on the same side and, as one user just put it, “report to the same people”. It’s more blind US imperialism than an administrations foreign policy. Syria has been going on since 2014! How can that be a Trump-Obama difference when the situation is still being handled the same way?

       It doesn't matter if there's a real difference. Useful idiots and paid shills will pretend there is, and there's no way you can reasonably and fairly keep this type of person out of a conversation just on the grounds that they're expressing a stupid political opinion.

       Not really. If you honestly engaged with them, read them, and realized what they implied, it's almost impossible to vote for a mainstream candidate. It's also impossible to support either Party without massive internal reform.

       OP wasn't claiming to be woke. He was just saying that there's a lot of other political opinion here, and I agree. r/conspiracy has tons of people from all walks. I've engaged with anarchists, communists, libertarians, conservatives, socialists, liberals...all of em hang around here, especially if you browse by /new, which everyone should do.

       Exactly, I’m from the UK and Brexit wasn’t because people are racist/xenophobic, it was a vote against the establishment. I’m not sure Trump is actually antiestablishment or he was placed to appear that way. Trust in the media and politicians is at an all time low, it could be that TPTB recognised this and put Trump up for election or it could be that he is genuinely his own man. I’m doubtful at this point in time but I can see why people voted for him at the time. There are a few genuine people in politics but I’m reminded of a quote about gladiators. To paraphrase, “we cheer on our side but the gladiators on either team have more in common with each other than with their supporters”. Politics is the same. Check how even far-right parties in the UK like the BNP are led by people who went to the same universities like Oxford and Cambridge. Most parties are led by people who are fully aware they are part of the elite. I’ve seen it described as a card game where they’ll do anything to beat each other but if anybody threatens the card game itself then they’ll join forces to make sure they keep what they have

       The greatest conspiracies against us are political.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the biggest conspiracy is the Republican and Russian collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that the biggest was the economic collapse of 2007/08.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that it was the Iraq invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that it was 9/11 and the report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that it was the very conservative Clinton Presidency all while selling Clinton as African American centric liberal, who just happened to sign off on the conservative Heritage Foundation dream legislation list.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the obvious control of not only all news, but all information.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the globalization and commodification of human labor to the lowest possible pay level, in all nations, and in particular the effort that reduced the pay of all current so called advanced nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell us what you  you consider to be a non-political conspiracy that is actually affecting us?

       It was mortgages they couldn’t pay back. Too much housing was built because of a fake demand perceived by the residential building industry, perpetuated by the banks approving mortgages to anyone with a pulse.

       Understandable. I personally think politics are nothing more than actors apart of a show. There’s no election. They only make decisions that the elite, shadow government, whatever you want to call it approve behind closed doors. Trump is the most polarizing figure they could’ve carted out there so they did and their plan to divide us into complete civil war is working. Charlottesville last summer was one of the scariest things I’ve ever seen. I’m honestly surprised more political attacks like that don’t happen more.

       Haha, do you believe Clinton has never broken any law or never been involved with illegal activity, corruption or bribes of any kind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying the Clintons are not corrupt or that they haven’t been convicted of anything yet? There’s quite a big difference. Why are you on a conspiracy sub if you’re happy to be a cheerleader for  career politicians? Is it just so you can tell people that Trump is paid off by Russia? Your “team”, your “party”, whatever you call it doesn’t care about you or anyone you love.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does a politician with a salary that’s public knowledge end up with a foundation worth hundreds of millions? What price do you pay for that money? How many favours do you owe? You can squabble over which puppet said what, but the power resides with the ultra wealthy dynastic families and institutions. It’s less rational to think they wouldn’t try to buy off politicians to ensure they keep their wealth it’s actually pragmatic and totally understandable but you’ll no doubt say something about Trump again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself was Clinton a great candidate you trusted and though had great ideas or was she the lesser of two evils to you? If it was the latter then do you think it’s the best that humanity has to offer? Should we ever vote for evil because we think the other side is more evil? Or should we have a system where if there are two candidates we don’t like we have the chance to vote for someone who isn’t evil? On the other hand, if you really think Clinton was a great candidate then I hope you find some discernment otherwise you’ll end up buying a bridge

       Indeed.

      <p>
       Even if Extra-terrestrials (E.T.) were to exist in probability and visit earth in potential, their trip is a 'political one'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a political one by coming here and making it such to humans, and a political one to them in their destiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a game:
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me a conspiracy that DOES NOT involve politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this hard?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is hard because the word 'conspiracy' implied a crime. Crime is within the realm of politics and law. Therefore, all conspiracies that are actual conspiracy theories involve some aspect of the political landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your inclusive use of the term 'conspiracy theory', you might be suggesting, 'alternative history' or 'alternative physics', or 'experiential sciences'; 'alchemy', 'magic', and 'theology/ world religions'.

       I don't know exactly what this place looked like years ago but it went full on the_donald during the election. Just non stop posts about Hillary, The DNC, and pizzagate. It's leveled off a bit since then. Now we are allowed to say bad things about Trump when some big news happens. And then the complaining started. Never saw these complaints when the entire front page was about democrats being evil corrupt pedophiles.

       The issue is that there is truth. I'll keep an open mind but when people are dismissing all evidence that goes against their theory, they need to be challenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it can't stand up to simple questioning, I don't care if it's political, it's probably bogus. People here are willing to ignore simple questions, reasoning and upvote downvote things they like rather than reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more likely that many things have become political. Gun control isn't politics in many countries on Earth, nor is climate change or much of healthcare. But the USA has a special way of making everything politics so you can't touch real issues without putting on child friendly gloves.

       I don't think you can examine conspiracies without examining politics.  Consider the Republican Committee to Reelect the President (Nixon) and the Watergate break-in.  Consider where the Watergate Plumbers used to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many conspiracies are that political.  Many are just inspired or motivated by plllitics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't help but come at it or develop your own sense of political morality.  You might get meta and read Lakoff, Moral Politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, when partisan people whose thinking on politics is basic, level 1, qrrive, you might get drawn into arguments with people about politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also question how much of what has happened here is due to paid or nation state operations.  It's not really a believable possibility that 0% of the posts here came from Russian operatives trying to destroy the U.S. by sewing dissent among U.S. citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally see a lot of evidence that the Bear and Dragon are actively winning a PsyWar right now.  They seem to me to be setting up a partisan upheaval among the conspiracy theorist population.  I assume they need to clear out ud political researchers and truth seekers if they want to take over the sheep more easily.  It appears to me that a lot of Bear and Dragon activities are intending to get conspiracy theorists variously killed, jailed, or at least disarmed.  Oh, and also, "silenced."

       I think that’s a great way to look at it. It’s useful when someone can “gain” from it.

       I don’t know much about Russian bots infiltrating US social media but that’s quite the theory! I think if they wanted to create distain between citizens they would most definitely go after the mistrust of conspiracy theory-believing types

       Yeah I mean I believe all of them are disinfo/controlled opposition/bots to muddy the waters and make the whole conspiracy community look just as messy and divided as the public. I believe all politics is is a sham, the dems and Repubs all report to the same people. They only act like enemies so that you never know what really is going on. They fill your head full of party politics and want you to believe that there side is right when in reality it’s just to brain wash you so u never find out who the REAL bad guys are.

       Trump. He is the most politically polarizing figure to ever run for office. He was a topic in every single household, workplace, magazine, radio, television, etc. He had support and hate from so many different places and people on all sides. He is also loved. But why I think THIS SUB was attracted to Trump and why we talk about him all the time is because 1. There was something about Trump that we all felt he was some kind of outsider to shake up the system and that's what we always wanted on this sub and 2. He has a history of mentioning conspiracy theories.

       Look around, there are a lot of writings on the concept that
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=everything+is+political">
        "everything is political"
       </a>
       . There's no way to not be political. If you make an active effort to be "not-political" that is itself a political choice. If you like a certain company's product, that's a political opinion. If you have any kind of personal philosophy about a topic, that is a political opinion. If you want to express yourself at all anywhere about anything, that is a political opinion. If you support someone else's idea, that's political. If you argue against someone else's idea, that's political. If you remain silent, even that is a political choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, this is r/conspiracy. In this community, we discuss secret plans by groups to do unlawful or harmful things. If a person gets together with other people to do harm, that is a political action. These organizations are often tied to major corporations, political parties, or governments. All of these are inherently political, would you really try to tell us that we can't discuss corporate corruption or government cover-ups here? Politics could broadly be thought of as applied philosophy with regards to how we should collectively handle interpersonal interactions and disputes. If philosophy of interpersonal dispute is involved, that's political.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like your problem is with PARTISANSHIP, which is a completely different thing than merely being political. People interested in conspiracies inherently discuss political ideas just by virtue of what conspiracies are.

       I feel like it happened around the time of the U.S. presidential elections. In a very short amount of time, you had a lot of people using this subreddit (
       <em>
        and tons of others
       </em>
       ) to vent their political beliefs because let's face it... that was a very polarizing election and emotions were running strong everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you had people coming and saying "Hillary blah emails blah blah", "Trump is a dickbag", "Trump is our savior", "Bernie or BUST!", "Why isn't Rand Paul running???" and all manner of other shit. I feel like that sentiment and post trend has just continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully people are starting to wake up to it and push for actual conspiracy posts. Hopefully, we get a lot of this political bullshit out of here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And last thought, I'm not opposed to things that are political if there is an actual conspiracy but posting something that was just released in the Washington Post 3 hours ago isn't usually a conspiracy. It's just people bitching. I wish people would just save it for
