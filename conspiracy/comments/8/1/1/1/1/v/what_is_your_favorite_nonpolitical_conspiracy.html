<p>I&#39;ll start. </p>

<p>The conspiracy that intrigues me the most has got to be aliens by far. From the Roswell crash of 1947, to the sightings seen today, aliens are an incredibly fun topic to discuss. I&#39;m still on the fence on whether or not they&#39;ve visited Earth before, as I have seen evidence for both sides. Most recently, I&#39;ve listened to Bill Cooper&#39;s claim that aliens/ufos are just a government hoax. As seen down below</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_g0NIBevWk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_g0NIBevWk</a></p>

<p>Please share your favorite theory here, with any links if you&#39;ve got them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds super cool. I will definitely read that article soon. It reminds me of when I had a math teacher who  gave us a detailed explication of the similarities between a “dragon” and a spacecraft - large, “fire-breathing”, often metallic, flying... and the fact that they were detailed in so many cultures around the world.. its interesting to think of the possibilities. And the pyramids and stuff like that. He read us this webpage (man I wish I knew what it was) that talked about why the building of the pyramids, Sphinx, etc would be completely impossible for humans without any machinery or electronics. </p>

<p>&quot;In this experiment, Allende claimed the destroyer escort USS Eldridge (DE-173) was rendered invisible, teleported to New York, teleported to another dimension where it encountered aliens, and teleported through time, resulting in the death of several sailors, some of whom were fused with the ship&#39;s hull.&quot;</p>

<p>Another fact is that in 1955 an auto parts salesman and amateur astronomer named Morris K. Jessup published a book called The Case for the UFO. In his book, Jessup speculated--among other things--that anti-gravity and electromagnetism would be better than rocket fuel for propelling space vehicles.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already read all about this but the <em>der Reise</em> map of Nazi Zombies was a real place. It was still under construction when the war ended and no one is entirely sure what it was going to be used for. The accepted theory is that it was going to be an underground munitions factory of some sort, but there&#39;s also the theories that it was related to the Bell or some other weird occult experiments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food fuckery.  My favorite recent one is sugar having been paying scientists to blame heart disease on fat.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat">In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to a newly published article in JAMA Internal Medicine.  The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to &quot;refute&quot; concerns about sugar&#39;s possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>People actually don&#39;t get that this lie literally has killed millions as we erroneously treated heart disease by attacking fat in blood and avoiding fat in diets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, guess what replaced fat in these low fat options...</p>

<p>Also like spy fuckery like Putin&#39;s assassinations or the American embassy folks in Cuba that got sick from sonic waves:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/us-embassy-attack-cuba-brain-abnormalities-victims">Doctors treating the victims of mysterious, invisible attacks on the US embassy in Cuba have discovered brain abnormalities as they search for clues to explain the damage to their hearing, vision, balance and memory.  The most specific finding to date about physical damage from the attacks shows that whatever it was that harmed the Americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains. It is one of several factors fuelling growing scepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I like conspiracies that have a lot more semblance of truth than some of the ones popular.  </p>

<p>I also like the uncovering of the massive pedophile presence in our society but hate that it is being co-opted by right wingers to attack the left.</p>

<p>Pedophilia is prevalent in society, institutionalized if you think about the automatic coverups that happen ver it but the worst of it is our famil and friends and people in everyday life.  A much larger amount and much more scary than some elite cult in comet ping pong.  Pedophilia is much more common by family than by some satanic stranger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we were just being COMPLETELY hypothetical at flat earth and only looked at the spiritual reasons for it, it is fun to think about. This is all hypothetical and I am simply entertaining a thought:</p>

<p>The claims I want to make:</p>

<p>1) It is possible the earth is flat.
2) Space may be real but only manifested interdimensionally.
3) Space and space travel is rooted in occultism.</p>

<p>I will only be discussing spiritual and philosophical arguments. </p>

<p>The biggest evidence that space is not what we think it is is the bible itself. You are familiar with the tower of Babel. The original derivation of the name Babel(also the Hebrew name for Babylon) is uncertain, but it may come from bab-ilum, meaning &quot;gate of God.&quot; According to the Bible, the city received the name &quot;Babel&quot; from the Hebrew word balal, meaning to jumble or to confuse. Clearly, God stopped people from entering this &quot;gate of God.&quot; Is this what is happening today? Nothing is new under the sun.</p>

<p>Today there is a belief that technology or some type of ascension or new age oneness will deliver us into God&#39;s territory, essentially by making us Gods.</p>

<p>Did you know Satan is called the prince of air, too?</p>

<p> <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm</a></p>

<p>He is able to control and deceive us through the air and &quot;space&quot;...the physical world we see.</p>

<p>Further, astral mean stars. Many can access the &quot;astral&quot; realm where the stars are located. Further, one can access these realms (dimensions) through drugs or other mind altering experiences. (Still working on this). It is interesting to note that planet in the bible actually translates as &quot;wandering star.&quot;</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.bibleandscience.com/bible/books/genesis/genesis1_wanderingstars.htm">https://www.bibleandscience.com/bible/books/genesis/genesis1_wanderingstars.htm</a></p>

<p>The idea of going to space and visiting other worlds has created a false God in a sense - other realities people can worship and escape to while denying the real creator.</p>

<p>Further, if the Earth is flat and there is a firmament, then there would be no such thing as outerspace (at least nothing we can access through a space ship). The entire concept of popular occult movies like Interstellar and a Space Odyssey 2001 is space travel interdimensionally.</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>

<p>I suppose I am of the opinion that the logistics of landing on the moon are actually less complicated than the logistics of covering up a false moon landing would be, but I would love to have my mind changed! :) If you&#39;ve got the time, would you mind sharing what evidence in favor of NASA having faked the moon landing you find to be most compelling?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m referring to is the fact that the belief in those accounts is based on the assumption that Earth&#39;s rotational speed randomly varies without predictability, an assumption which itself is based on those very accounts. Phantom Time Hypothesis posits that those accounts were faked and that the Earth&#39;s rotation does <em>not</em> randomly speed up and slow down. So the situation basically goes like this:</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorist: &quot;Those records don&#39;t adhere to the laws of physics! They&#39;re fake!&quot;</p>

<p>TPTB: &quot;No they&#39;re not!&quot;</p>

<p>Everybody else: &quot;Well, that clears that up!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same argument. The refutation of the accusation that the records are fake is literally just the assertion that they are not, and the defense of that assertion comes in the form of yet more records that are just as likely to be fake. The defense hinges entirely on the dismissal out of hand of the possibility of conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole Cuba thing is extremely concerning. This should be a huge conspiracy but it rarely is mentioned in MSM.</p>

<p>Diplomats for US and Canada have complained of head trauma caused by sonic blasts. Everything from slight headaches to full on memory loss.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. personnel first reported hearing strange sounds in their homes on Dec. 30, 2016.</p>

<p>At least 24 U.S. Embassy personnel reported hearing the sounds. The Canadian government has also identified workers in their embassy in Havana who were affected. Individuals reported symptoms including sharp ear pain or hearing loss, nausea, vertigo, and trouble focusing or walking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-mysterious-cuba-sonic-attacks-are-still-puzzling-investigators">https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-mysterious-cuba-sonic-attacks-are-still-puzzling-investigators</a></p>

<p>It was mentioned that these type of weapons do not exist.. The Cuban government has been fully cooperative in the investigation and yet nothing has been found.</p>

<p>So a weapon that shouldn&#39;t exist is being used on American and Canadian diplomats and the state department has stated that Cuba isn&#39;t the one causing it. I&#39;m sure America has its eyes on Cuba&#39;s shores. So what&#39;s going on? Is a country testing out a new sonic weapon on North American diplomats?</p>

<p>I am very interested in seeing where this story goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens regardless if your brain can accept it or not, are very real.  There were sightings of ufo like objects on oct 13th (google and youll find YouTube videos and the year it happened)  all across the world....it was us...the US.  More or less doing a demonstration of the tech theyve built off of reverse engineering alien tech over the years.  Still not capable of direct space travel but good for air and certain atmospheric travel.  </p>

<p>Years ago there was a security meeting to discuss the option of taking our nukes and putting them on satellites orbiting earth rather than leave them on the surface and at risk of being taken &quot;if&quot; the US was ever invaded.  The counter discussion was the risk posed of identified and confirmed alien visitors orbiting our planet now observing us, taking this technology themselves to study and possibly use on us themselves or each other.  I heard part of this meeting myself.  (The concern is aliens have yet to develop nuclear technology hence their interest in us as a species and planet.  Their propulsion is based off magnetism.)</p>

<p>There are living aliens on earth but not among us.  They are...in the best way to describe it..in stasis.  They are not conscious nor are they dead. They wee recovered...  We cannot communicate with them and since they were exposed to cosmic radiation, were so radiated they are kept in stasis deep underground with a hydrogen particle infused chamber with massive amounts of hydrogen pumped into this chamber to aid in containing this radiation from escaping.  If one of these creatures would make it to the surface the radiation alone would be destructive to nearby ecosystems and humans.   </p>

<p>Also, the gold that provided the impetus for Imelda Marcos is an interesting thing to look up as well.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good one too...did ya know that when Rome REALLY fell for good (supposedly) somewhere in the mid-400s, they were invaded by basically Germans who stormed in to a somewhat unguarded city and....stole all the gold.</p>

<p>THEN, fast forward to WWII...ya know what happened?  Germany marched down to the Vatican (supposedly) and stole their gold.  I think that&#39;s a pretty strange repetition in history.  </p>

Then just thinking about how fast it actually takes to make things completely deteriorate. I don’t have any good reads to offers you, but try listening to the Joe Rogan experience. He often has historians on that don’t believe the official timeline. Also his podcast is just great all together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, that is the predominant opinion in the scientific community today, but OP requested our favorite non-political theories.</p>

<p>If you disregard the extremely hard to swallow living race aspect and stick solely to the exploding planet hypothesis, Tom Van Flandern has been arguing for decades that exploding planets have shaped our solar system and lays out a pretty fleshed out paper located behind a paywall (PM me if interested) here:  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/challenge-of-the-exploded-planet-hypothesis/3EE7D6DA4F83A9B9F25500F46081AC50">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/challenge-of-the-exploded-planet-hypothesis/3EE7D6DA4F83A9B9F25500F46081AC50</a></p>

<p>His arguments regarding the mass issue is a combination of most of the mass vaporizing due to pressure, followed by only the remnants with the most stable orbits remaining over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MHD technology is an interesting one, supposedly it&#39;s secretly used on torpedoes and air/underwater vehicles, they release a gas at the head and ignite it into a plasma around the torpedoe/ship which is then controlled via magnetic field, it would allow for frictionless movement into air/liquid, but not crazy accelerations or things like that though :)</p>

<p>Another one is bioelectronics, a theory that says germs have electronic (rh4) and protonic (pH) requirements for a demographic explosion (aka infection) to occur, and one can modulate these parameters to fight off or prevent an infection, and with specific water drinking habits, ensure that living tissues are as inhospitable to germs as they can be, making things easier for your immune system. I&#39;ve personally had surprisingly positive results with it. It would have been buried down in the 60s by Pasteur and friends in France where they have a strong grip on the medical academy to preserve the mainstream model which was (and still is) more lucrative. If it&#39;s true, in a way aquarium specialists know more about infection prevention than doctors, they go to great lengths to control protons and electrons in the water to preserve their little friends :)</p>

<p>There is also Nassim Haramein, a charlatan who might or might not have put his finger on the door to the next paradigm in physics, what is for certain though is that his theory somehow yields the best prediction of the proton radius as far as measurements are concerned. The accuracy of that prediction is uncanny and so is its elegant and geometrical origin, and while he loses me with the new age interpretation and repetitive standup routine, i think the result is still remarkable enough to merit scientific scrutiny, but that ain&#39;t happening :)</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Rick Spiegel? Dude has footage on youtube of 911 where you can clearly see a helicopter go above the tower, drops an explosive that flashes and fly away as the tower starts dropping. Ok &quot;clearly&quot; is a strong word, but if that&#39;s not what the recording is showing, then wtf else is it showing? It&#39;s not just that either, it&#39;s a whole ballet of helicopters dropping smoke canisters and preparing the field before hand. This is never discussed anywhere, despite being one of the clearest evidence of fuckery there is :)</p>

<p>Did you know that the original democracy was essentially a lottery? Over two thousand years ago, fucking Athenians with their logos were smart enough to realize that the only thing that was not corruptible was randomness, it worked well for about a century, a some point they had a new mayor every day haha... then wealthy landowners (who remained wealthy while the poor were in power, interestingly) arranged a losing war with Sparta and quickly replaced the lottery with a voting system they could more easily subvert, they kept the name democracy though, clever. Could it be why Hollywood celebrates Sparta :)</p>

<p>Then there is the hiv, i have no idea but at the very least the argument against it does not strike me as intellectually dishonest, you can find it here <a href="http://thecaseagainsthiv.net/">http://thecaseagainsthiv.net/</a> and judge or not for yourself. </p>

<p>lol. Nassim Haramein&#39;s physics lead to unification, yet somehow he&#39;s still a charlatan. How about the mainstream community has shit all over him for decades, so he took his own route completely outside of how you&#39;re supposed to do it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to be a charlatan and unify physics, I hope you understand how silly that sounds. Either you&#39;re doing physics or you&#39;re not. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about &quot;actors&quot;, I&#39;m talking about nefarious people with ill intentions. I also said that bad actors post self-posts like this, not that you yourself were necessarily posting this one due to a nefarious intent. I didn&#39;t even bother investigating to see if you were the type who defends corrupt politicians like that, I just get annoyed when people say &quot;don&#39;t talk about x&quot;. If you try to control what I say, you&#39;re only going to encourage me to say those things more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorites was a convincing thing I read a long time ago.</p>

<p>The hypothesis is a mentally challenging one. It proposed that time is going backwards, but we are falsely perceiving it as going forward.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t direct you to a specific literature or video.</p>

<p>On a similar tangent, there&#39;s somewhat convincing arguments that humans are on a drastic decline culturally. As you go back in time structures get larger and more ornate, language gets more verbose, moral and tradition gets more strict, fashion gets more elaborate, philosophy and high art are at higher levels. The main point here is that it appears as if cultures start at some high peak of decadence, then slowly decay out of existence. </p>

It reminds me of when I had a math teacher who  gave us a detailed explication of the similarities between a “dragon” and a spacecraft - large, “fire-breathing”, often metallic, flying... and the fact that they were detailed in so many cultures around the world.. its interesting to think of the possibilities. And the pyramids and stuff like that.

The refutation of the accusation that the records are fake is literally just the assertion that they are not, and the defense of that assertion comes in the form of yet more records that are just as likely to be fake.

<p>Also, the gold that provided the impetus for Imelda Marcos is an interesting thing to look up as well.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good one too...did ya know that when Rome REALLY fell for good (supposedly) somewhere in the mid-400s, they were invaded by basically Germans who stormed in to a somewhat unguarded city and....stole all the gold.</p>

<p>THEN, fast forward to WWII...ya know what happened?  Germany marched down to the Vatican (supposedly) and stole their gold.  I think that&#39;s a pretty strange repetition in history.  </p>
