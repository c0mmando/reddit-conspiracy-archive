       I find the fentanyl issue alarming due to the knowledge that the amount of fentanyl being produced is enough to kill 100's of millions of people, and the amount required for a supposed buzz is extremely small compared to heroin, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal crazy theory: At first, someone is trying to push it in specifics drugs to either kill off hard users, or completely sell them fake shit that's tiny amounts of fentanyl that just gets them high.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scarier theory I have is that someone is trying to stockpile enough to try a "blitz", basically push it in a food/drink product, etc etc, beyond drugs, VERY QUICKLY, to try to kill as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit just doesn't add up either way, the only thing I could see is maybe it has an easier production cost and process and dealers want to sell tiny amounts of fentanyl mixed with baking soda or whatever so they don't have to get heroine, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your opinion about this fentanyl issue?

       Good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why push a thoroughly toxic drug guaranteed to kill the user? It's the opposite strategy that a parasite would use, based on never kill the host from which you derive your sustenance.

      <p>
       I too am mystified by it.

       I can only forward some unconfirmed hearsay that it is exported by China to the west for cheap; and that the Chinese care nothing for the death toll as long as there are profits to be made.

       Because it makes all drugs taboo. You sprinkle a little Fentanyl on that and it will kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure. There are drugs the WONT kill you. But unless you research these drugs you wouldnt know any better (LSD, pot...).
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about Fent being added to coke. Polar opposites. Think about Fent being added to weed. of all things...

       They just want to scare the black market they can't control.

       This shit is bought cheap as fuck from China and such. Then they throw it in everything.

       Lump sum is beneficial. TPTB make money because they are still gonna sell them. Those "in charge" look good for passing laws. Cops can still bust people for having them. The users go to private prisons.

       Afghan heroin is a huge problem in China (Russia and Iran as well), purposefully done by US military and US intel. China is paying back the US in kind. The opioid crisis is affecting politics here so much, and that aids China, like the torrent of Afghani heroin into China aids US strategic goals.

       He's right.
The sad reality (as someone else mentioned) is that overdoses actually drive up demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason being, once word gets out about the overdoses, every other addict thinks they can handle what the now-deceased could not.
Unfortunately, this isn't the case when you're dealing with things like hotspots (improperly mixed fentanyl).

       They cut the heroine a lot with other non psychoactive additives and then add fentanyl so it becomes stronger And more appealing to users. The users don’t know there is barely any heroine in there. And just a grain can potentially kill someone, but they don’t add grains of it. My guess is they dissolve a batch of heroine, cut, and a tiny bit of fentanyl; mix it all up; dry it out; then sell it. Each bag has a fraction of a grain in it. Just enough to get people super fucked up and coming back for more.

       It makes sense because fentanyl is much much cheaper to produce than heroin.

       How does that not make sense? Fent is cheaper and stronger than heroin. So, Mr. Dope Dealer adds some fent to his supply of heroin, thus making his original supply of more expensive heroin go further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people will not want straight fent, so it makes sense to just cut your dope with it and not even tell the junkies...that way they just think you're the guy with really good shit, and they tell all their junkie friends, and they all come running to the guy with the primo skagg.

       Well as a commenter posted before, Dope is not cut with just fentanyl but spiked with fentanyl after being cut to spike up the potency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly had not thought about that and just assumed people were cutting their shit with just straight fentanyl.

       It makes sense since fent is cheap and can turn cheap black tar heroin into something that is stronger and more addicting.

       Fentanyl is a godsend for cancer patients and the terminally ill, its many times more potent than heroin in its pain relieving capacity so obviously the market for abuse is commensurate. Dealers often use a little fentanyl to start an overdose scare ie this dealer has some pure heroin when it's actually laced with fent

       Are you joking? People put it in heroin to make it stronger. If you put it in heroin then you can cut the heroin even more and make even more money. No is really like I want to but fentanyl, but if you just add it to some cut and call it heroin people want to buy it. Most people using it don’t know they are using it and most people that use it don’t die. The problem is when it gets mixed in either in too high a concentration or unevenly so that some bags are too high of a dose. Dealers are very careful to not do this because they do not want to kill off customers. They want them coming back with more money. Unfortunately most of the people doing this are not PhDs so mistakes happen, that’s why you hear about it on the news. The vast majority is used without death or even notice.

       I read somewhere that naloxone ties into MK-Ultra somehow. Like it helps dull people's minds. I can't provide any hard evidence, it's just something I remember in passing. Naloxone is the drug they're giving out for free to everyone right now, you're supposed to give it to people OD'ing from Fentanyl to help buy them time until they get to the hospital.

       We use naloxone in the ER to strip the opiates off people's receptors to save their life.  Don't spread stuff like this because if someone listens to you than you could risk their life.  It literally has no effect if you don't have opiates in your system.

       They aren't trying to kill the user. Fentanyl does 2 things to heroin. It makes it cheaper and makes it stronger for the dealers. While all dealers will tell you they don't want people dying from their product, they will all tell you that business booms when people OD from it. They will also say that because most of the Fent made is from some illegal operation in Mexico or China or India, the strength of it isn't always known. The same amount one week could be stronger or weaker the next week so it is a crapshoot on how much they put in there.

       It is incredibly easy to synthesize with the right equipment and chemistry background. Most of the precursors can be bought domestically aside from one or two that are sold in China but can be imported.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the whole "mixing fent with other drugs to kill the customers" is a myth. Fent is usually only mixed with opiates and sometimes benzos in order to potentiate or mimic the effects of the drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you aren't realizing is that there is a huge population of people that want opiates but hate the stigma/taste/etc. of heroin.
And now that oxy has skyrocketed in price, fent provides an alternative to those who want to stay away from heroin.

       Fent may not be mixed in to kill intentionally, but kill it does nonetheless. Fent in pressed pills happens and it kills people. Heroin that kills people is heroin that addicts want because they know it is strong. Most of the opiophiles i know are lamenting this turn of events, where trying to stay well is a life or death coinflip. Most people dont want fent, they are trying to dodge fent in their DOC.

       Well, concerning the market, a large majority of my customers were either pretty affluent and respectable. You did get some characters that gave off the stereotypical "junkie" appearance, but for the most part the people that he'd always meet up with dressed nicely and had rich parents or good jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seattle is notorious for locking up doctors over prescribing even reasonable amounts of painkillers, so most of the pharmaceuticals are either counterfeit or imported. 
Regardless of their origin, they are incredibly expensive, and some people refuse to do heroin so the fentanyl option allowed them to still get high but within their "moral" parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, it is often cut with natural sweeteners so it doesn't taste terrible when smoked, and is so potent that it doesn't require intravenous use.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that does not mean that it isn't dangerous.
One particular risk I ran into often were "hot-spots". Basically, when you mix the two precursors to make fent, it is so strong that if you are even in the same room without PPE, you can pass out or die

That means if you don't cut your product down considerably AND consistently, then you end up with areas that are stronger than the rest. Which is incredibly scary because you could be fine for the first half of your bag, but that last hit was 100x stronger than the rest and you fallout over an amount you normally could handle.

       Laziness is what I attribute it to.
From what I was told, the mixing process should take at least 12-16 hours to ensure 100% consistency.
But I doubt that was happening because eventually people started dropping like flies just from smoking it.

       Producers could indicate what the product is all they want, some distributers will always lie in order to make bank on a product. Far as the war on drugs goes, the Trump admin could easily encourage testing kits that would save lives today, but it's far more useful as scare material. Our Attorney General truly believes marijuana is the first step to dying of fentanyl OD. It's disgusting and harmful...they benefit from this epidemic.

       Because heroin came back in a big way after we invaded Afghanistan. Fentanyl is cheaply bought in bulk from vendors in China and dealers then use it to cut the heroin resulting in fiends overdosing, which is then a sign to all the other fiends that this guy has the best shit.

       Well it’s used everyday in hospitals, at least here in the U.K.  I had an operation recently and was chatting with the anaesthesiologist and asked what they were going to give me - she said it was fentanyl and propofol (the one that Michael Jackson OD’d on)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hospitals here also use diamorphine (heroin). I imagine it’s the same throughout the world.

       Here's why: The Depopulation Agenda has been modified to accommodate larger percentages of death. Along with derivatives of opium, Fentanyl will kill of a portion of the baby-boomer (and other) generations, the policy will de-stress the pension fund and healthcare systems' budgets. The other side of the crushing vice is the fact that healthcare
       <em>
        can only continually raise prices

       and nobody asks why. Nobody, no representative or agency, is investigating because, frankly, they're trying to kill you.

       A deputy a county over from mine had to be administered Narcan after exposure to an "unknown substance" that turned out, of course, to be Fentanyl. I am wondering why plastic gloves when handling anything that's an unknown wouldn't be standard protocol, but at least from now on it will be.

       It's produced in China. It's imported to the US and usually mixed with an inert cut. You can get turn $10K into $500K easy if you cut it right. The Chinese are then getting their money out by real estate in Vancouver and BitCoin.

       Note the Chinese tend to do the lab sales, while anyone buying from them does the street deals.

       Someone wants Americans dead.  Drug dealers usually don't want their clients to die.  There is more money in keeping them alive and addicted.  This is a form of warfare from another country or some independent group(s).

       Occasionally organized crime does do a purge, it's called bum kicking.  That order comes from up top though, way up top. Having a zillion junkie zombies shambling around is equally bad for business. It makes joe average want to do something about it, that's dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you're right, there's a foreign presence in this. To the best of my knowledge it's the Chinese, working in collaberation with our own homegrown organized crime.

       Lol the reason fent is popular is because you can order it from China dirt cheap. It mimics heroin and is cheap that's the why. It's not a conspiracy

       I dunno. I knew someone who got a custom synthesis of a fent analoug done in China and shipped over. It was cheap. Real cheap. That shit was strong too. It would break through my methodone dose. Heroin never could do that

       Because it's more profitable than heroin.  Heroin relies on cultivation and poppy harvests are reliant on cooperative weather.  Synthetic opioids can be cheaply manufactured on an industrial scale.

       A pound of cocaine is a lot easier/profitable to smuggle than a pound of coca leaves.
