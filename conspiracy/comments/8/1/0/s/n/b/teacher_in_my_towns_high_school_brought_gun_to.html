        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In case you haven&#39;t heard the news, a school teacher in my hometown Dalton, GA brought a gun to school. Apparently he had asked the students to leave the classroom and locked the door behind them. Principal tried to open the door but had no luck. Principal heard a gunshot which pierced the front window of the school. Students were evacuated and no one was injured.</p>

<p>I&#39;m don&#39;t understand why the gunshot would&#39;ve shot out the window. If this was a failed suicide attempt, why would the gun have been shot in the first place? </p>

<p>I refuse to log on to my Facebook for the next week or so because all of my friends are from dalton and had this teacher throughout high school and I can&#39;t avoid reading about it on social media.</p>

<p>Here is a small clip I recorded of the broken window of the school:
<a href="https://youtu.be/F4VAoXnlWy4">https://youtu.be/F4VAoXnlWy4</a></p>

<p>Anyone think this is fishy? Just when people are discussing the whole concealed carry for teachers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be posting more links and info here as I find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting rid of public education would solve a lot of this.  It&#39;s very difficult to provide a safe environment when you are more or less required to keep anyone there whose parents want to lock them up for 6-8 hours a day.  When I was in high school we would routinely have kids that were sent away for assaults, drug sales, property crimes, etc. back in school in a few months.  Also moved from one school to another over armed assaults, instead of removed from the school system for the safety of the non-criminal students.  Public schools are just minimum security prisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned a lot while I was there. I know how to survive in the woods. But there is not much to do. An I cannot understand small town mentality. I will never date a woman my friends have dated, yet out there people marry each others exes all the time an still remain friends. The klan mentality blew my fucking mind. Never knew I was &quot;ninja&quot; until I was called it everyday by some hick or fat pig. The north is alright. You can curse freely, people generally do not care what you do as long as it does not affect them. An in the cities there is no small town gossip. I can only imagine the stories that were floating around Dalton. </p>
