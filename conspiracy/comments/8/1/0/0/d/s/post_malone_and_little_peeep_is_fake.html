       Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995) does not come up on a search on geni.com nor intelius.com. His dad, Richard Jordan Post, does come up on intelius but Austin is not listed as related. Why not? Amy, Elizabeth, Sydney, Byron, Jordan &amp; Mary are there. On instantcheckmate there is a Richard J. Post ,45, relatives Amy, Carol, Elizabeth, Louis, Mary, Richard, RJ &amp; Sydney but no Austin. Austin R. Post is on instantcheckmate with relatives Enna, Jodie &amp; 2 Richard Posts. Idolwiki.com says Yes, the rapper has Jewish roots. Although they are somewhat crap websites, a google search brings up prenote . net and airmax-zero . net also say that post malone is jewish. "Malone is simply a 21-year-old white boy rapping shallow lyrics about fucking bitches and counting stacks over polished beats, and he still earns a No.1 spot atop Billboard's Top Rap album chart.The only problem with this all is: He's probably a fraud. In roughly a year, Malone — real name Austin Post — went from making Minecraft tutorial videos and covering acoustic pop songs with his friends to rocking braids and gold teeth while rapping with a distinct ghetto "twang," an accent he plays with in some interviews. Many of the videos from his past life have since been deleted, only adding to the suspicion that Malone is an industry plant. Malone's success story is remarkable — so remarkable that it tiptoes into being unbelievable. Only months after moving into Los Angeles, Malone met FKi, a production team consisting of Trocon "1st Down" Roberts, Jr. and Steven "Sauce Lord Rich" Bolden, through mutual friends. While it's possible that the Dallas teenager had connections in L.A. that landed him opportunities with a production team credited for producing bangers by 2 Chainz, Tyga, Wiz Khalifa and Travis Scott, it certainly makes all his credit for producing a smash hit first single a little less impressive." -DBKnews.com.

       Above was posted Oct. 11 2014 with the caption It was great seeing you kiddo. Good luck chasing your dreams out on the left coast.

       Then in Feb 2015 the transition is already fully underway with the release of "White Iverson".

       This is the only other picture of him before the rap transition on his dad's twitter. Jewish teenager JIDF mode. Posted 20 Sept. 2014. The rest of the pictures of his son are just retweets of his promotional rap posters. He seems like another iteration of the white negro project they have Justin Bieber on.

       Austin Post is promoted by Az Cohen, son of Lyor Cohen. Lyor's mother is Ziva Sirkis Naumann a patrilineal descendant of Rabbi Joel Yaffe Sirkis [The Ba"Ch] ‪(1561 - 1640).

       Rich Post posted one or two Merry Christmas photos but just a tree no family a what looks like co-worker picture. So which is it Austin &amp; Richard Post?
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings us to Gustav Elijah Åhr or ..Lil Peep From Wiki : His parents were both Harvard graduates who divorced when he was a teenager.[6] Åhr's mother, Liza Womack[7] is a first grade teacher and his father is a college professor. He has Swedish, German and Irish descent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a real hard time believing that Harvard graduate parents would let this kid do the drugs that he sang about &amp; get such awful tatoos. Cannot find the name of his father yet. His Grandmother, Liza Womack's mother, is Jenny Kastner. Jennifer Pirie married Peter Kastner. From When Scotland was Jewish : [Finally, Tyrie graveyard had several Semitic surnames: Pirie, Lyon, Lee, Lovie, Lowe (indicative of lion/Loewe for the tribe of Judah), Shirran, Lunan (Sp. de Luna) and Chivas.] Kastner is Ashkenazi jewish last name for cabinetmakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peter Kastner's IMDB page: Peter Kastner graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) with a degree in Modern European History. He studied also at UCLA for a Masters degree in that field but put those studies aside to pursue acting work. He was a lifelong learner, most recently teaching himself Yiddish in the original Hebrew script. First wife Wendy Miller. Second wife Jenny, to whom he was married 34 years. Has a stepdaughter, Liza, and two grandsons, Oskar and Gus. One of many actors who read for the lead role in The Graduate (1967) but lost out to Dustin Hoffman. His parents were involved in a printing and publishing business. He was the second of four children, including older sister Susan Kastner, and younger siblings John Kastner and Kathy Kastner. All were involved in the entertainment business in some way - Susan was a journalist at the Toronto Star, New York Post, and Agence France-Presse; John was an actor who turned prolific director and producer; Kathy was a Toronto-based host of a current-affairs show. After choosing to leave acting, Peter became a high-school English teacher. He had a breakdown in 1991 and was hospitalized for a while. Following that, he taught himself all aspects of videography and became a video teacher and mentor to many students. He created his own video art which was funny, wry, quirky and political and, at times, deeply personal, particularly on the subject of his own experience as a survivor of incest. He wrote many songs and recorded two CDs. One of his songs, "Testosterone", was set to animation by the brilliant Jonathan Amitay. It can be seen on YouTube. He played at Club Passim, in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the former Club 47 of Joan Baez fame), and at the Free Times Cafe and other venues in Toronto. A proud survivor of incest. He spoke out about it in his art and would have brought it further into the light, particularly the devastating effects of mother/son incest.

       Lil Peep is probably a Jewish actor. This means his death may have been faked as foreshadowed by his lyrics. On the other hand wikipedia suspiciously states "Foul play was not suspected,[42] with his death believed to be from an overdose." From his twitter: "I don't need Zionists amongst my fans. Israel is not "defending" anything they are murdering innocent children every day." &amp; "Fuck Israel."
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps certain people were angry at Peep and wanted him gone for those comments. After Lil Peep died, Post got a similar "Crybaby" face tatoo above the eyebrow: Stay Away.

       Nice post i haven't finshed reading it yet but i wanted tk throw it out there that the rapper 6ix9ine could be in the same category. There's a picture of 69 before he got famous and he looked like just a normal kid now he's some big gamg banger who runs new york? It's worth looking into him too.

       he was fucked by birdman most likely. people don’t question why these rappers are all young looking fuckheads with colored hair. no one talks about how the rap industry is gay as hell. not all of them but lots of videos and shit exist that are pretty telling. used to be a channel on youtube that specialized in it but now it’s gone. i can try and dig them up and make a post about it but you’d be surprised to find out just how homo it is.

       Austin post is from my hometown, and he went to my high school. He is younger than me but attended at the same time as my brother. When I found out there was a white boy rapper from colleyville I almost pissed my pants with glee, until I was horrified. The metroplex is one of the worldwide ground zeroes for nefarious secret society bullshit and oppression. There are many corporate HQs there for a reason. Colleyville/grapevine/southlake is where gang leaders house their baby mommas, from the Mexican mafia, to the dallas cowboys, to Zionist secret societies. Austin is from colleyville. Lol. If you pick a person from colleyville there is a good chance they are somehow connected to some nefarious shit, even me, I’m skeptical of my own family. Of course post Malone is blowing up for a reason, and of course his daddy is well connected

       From the Metroplex as well. There is definitely a Mafia and cartel presence in the Southlake and Westlake area. Not sure if you remember, but there was an

        assassination

       My condolences. Yes I remember the story, wasn’t living there at the time but I still saw the news. It scared the fuck out of me as I’ve been to southlake town square so many times. Apparently the assasain managed to sneak up and sneak away without a trace, obviously a pro.

       Colleyville/Southlake are full of rich white people who got away with it. Might as well be called impunityville and privilegelake. Rules don’t apply to these people, but they sure do on the lane. The metroplex is disgustingly economically segregated, on purpose, by the type of people who live in colleyville and their by families in the past. My dear friend lived in colleyville right next to that rich dude from Fort Worth who got away with killing his wife, wife’s lover, and 11 year old step kid. I’ll have to find his name, he was on an episode on power privilege and justice. The guy is like a demon to meet in real life, horrible energy, and his house caught fire twice probably as a what’s up from Satan. All kookiness aside, there’s plenty of run of the mill fraud, power trippin’, and oppression going on in Colleyville. The cops even harass the rich white people there, because they have a fraternal order of dasdardliness. And the colleyville women, gross. A ham sandwich has more substance. At least their evil husbands have careers.

       In the words of Chamillionaire “if you ain’t ever been to jail but said you did time, you fake, you phony, you falsifying.” I laughed my ass off when I thought about all the young kids out there thinking Austin is hard and a real rapper with any kind of life experience.
       <em>
        He is from colleyville
       </em>
       . Very few from colleyville are hard. We’re a bunch of rich pampered sheltered white kids. Yes, he could have life experience, I sure had my fair share by the time I was 18. But that was from dallas, not colleyville. If his parents were good to him, which it seems like they were, then he’s probably had a cushy life. Many of the young men at my high school were involved in the fraternal orders of their fathers. That’s austin. He’s phony

       That’s the only thing with this that I was hoping someone would comment on.
I’d say having that sort of upbringing sort of increased the odds the kids gonna do drugs and act differently. At least in my experience.

       I could care less about Post, I could believe all that honestly.

       I’m admittedly biased with Peep, because I liked the music and he seemed like a cool dude. Like he’s fit right on my circle of friends when I was that age. 
So I’d like to hope he was more than some fucking plant, but who knows.

       Your first point in the lil peep paragraph doesn’t really make sense, a parent only has so much control over their children outside of their view they can’t really do much and in this interview you see gustav’s mother address somethings like why he had gotten tattoos and why she let him do his own thing and be himself
       <a href="https://youtu.be/agZqh6aGfJI">
        https://youtu.be/agZqh6aGfJI
       </a>
       and on the drugs topic you can tell from his music he was a very troubled man, he struggled with addiction and in the end it took his life, addiction and drugs isn’t really something a parent would be able to prevent from happening, Gustav was an outcast and picked on through school that’s why he had gotten tattoos because he knew he wasn’t like other kids he was a unique person he wanted to be himself (also was a heavy drug user and a teeenager not a good combo for making wise decisions)

       Ya I always thought it was weird that peeps grandfather was a professor at Harvard and his father another college professor considering the grunge image he put forth. And that something happens were the dad and him never spoke again.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the painful stuff wrote about in his lyrics and his struggle with depression and not wanting to be sober, I wonder if he was abused like many other artists. I don't think he was a fake plant, I think his family may have had some connections to certain people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also thought it weird that blink 182s marks dad as in the DOD and Toms connections to all those goverment people. They probably set some of their kids up to be in the entertainment industry as a way of influence and control.

       Also I suggest you look into Nadia Lee Cohen and her engagement with the whole new trash trap hop scene and the mini movie music videos she makes for high profile trappers like this one which has some very interesting and inflammatory symbolism:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool beat, dope lyrics, edgy AF n everything but this is pretty tame/tip of the iceberg compared to the desensitizing stuff out there atm under the banner of "trap" which all appears aimed at demoralizing the American psyche and highlighting only the basest and most depraved aspects of said American culture like her own "work" a mini movie with very little point other than to celebrate trailer trash depravity in the most magnified, disgusting and contrived manner possible:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kImSsppLVAM">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know she's just like mad edgy n satirical n shit and being "spurred on by her love of narrative in cinema and cinematic photography she collected 1960s and 70s props and furniture" and likes to "accentuate the glamorous decadence of the 50s and 60s in America."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure. Oh well dumteedoo nothing to see here, moving along.
