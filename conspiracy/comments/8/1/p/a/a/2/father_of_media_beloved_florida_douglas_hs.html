       Jeff Kasky is the father of Cameron Kasky, one of the students at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School calling for gun control after the shooting that occurred there. Jeff Kasky is notable to Pizzagate because he was vice-president of One World Adoption Services in Florida. User @MolochHunter had a great post here (
       <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2420160">
        https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2420160
       </a>
       ) which gives a great explanation of the situation as discovered by Digital Empire. One of the locations for OWAS in Georgia was shut down after it was found they were coercing children away from their mothers in the Congo.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Jeff Kasky's personal youtube channel the videos are almost all about his sons Cameron and Julian, particularly when they were babies, toddlers, and small children. In a video that is open to everyone and not age restricted called "Julian Kasky right after birth", Jeff Kasky shows footage of the birth of his son which includes tons of nudity of his own newborn son. The section on actual childbirth is actually relatively short so it would be hard for Youtube to classify it as existing for educational purposes. Even if we assume his posting of the video was merely bad judgement and not intended to be sexual, it doesn't explain some of the other videos. One video is called "Julians1st birthday and lap dance" (that is verbatim) where an unknown woman makes another small (presumably female) toddler perform a lap dance on Julian and then makes them kiss. Below is the link to the youtube. Watch any of it with warning.

      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, I believe there is strong evidence of predatory adoptions and human trafficking being rampant in Florida and Jeff Kasky is merely one example and egregous case. I believe that this Youtube is not merely inappropriate but evidence of Jeff Kasky's own perversity and criminal mind. While the mainstream media will decry this as extremism, only one year ago a Huffpost writer spoke out about Kasky for referring to adopters as "consumers" and being dishonest about disclosing his financial motivations and treating adoption as a business and not a charity with the best interest of children at heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest we all flag the account and hold Youtube accountable for allowing such content while disallowing viewpoints they oppose. The world deserves the truth.

       edited to add: apparently the circumcision video is on there as well. What. the. fuck.

       Not clicking any of the links, and about to go to bed, but... this is how they control the narrative, imo. People ask: "How could crisis actors be controlled and not come out later on?". Well, TPTB use pedophiles.  They don't need Clancy type of "assassinations" to keep them quiet. They just use black mail, then character assassination. If that doesn't work, off to the looney bin...  Media follows suit, because they are controlled...

       Since when are naked babies inherently sexual. What the fuck is wrong with you? Nudity is our natural state, to immediately jump to sexual thoughts when you see a 1 year old naked says way more about you than anyone involved in these videos. Take a fucking break from the internet.

       I tend to agree with the fact that I wouldnt put my children online until they were old enough to make that choice for themselves, but I'm technologically savvy and privacy oriented, but I can acknowledge that the new norm seems to be plastering your kid on social media and I dont think that inherently makes someone a bad parent.

       Plastering your kid NUDE is one step further, making it questionable.  It’s beyond the foolishness of making them eye candy for pedos and predators just bec they are so proud of their kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids don’t completely mature until age 22-24 so, ‘until they are old enough’ to choose for themselves is a silly notion.  No one posts nudity without issues of self worth and most times history of sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad parenting may be deliberate or unintentional, does not change the result —harm to the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember trolls when pizzagate came out. What gave them away was their total  lack of any sense of what  is appropriate behavior for and toward young children. They have become so tainted they don’t know when they are giving themselves away.  I hear Maddie Mcan’s patents have made similar questionable statements.

       Yes the whole world is crazy and your the sane one. Youre totally right. All the people posting cute pictures of their kids blowing bubbles in the tub or peeing on a tree in the woods are secretly feeding the needs of pedophiles worldwide and not just innocently sharing fun moments of their proudest achievment to their friends and family. What has tainted your view of people and the world so much that you cant even fathom innocent intentions in the sharing of some big moments in a child's life by their parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like ive said previously, I myself wouldnt post my kid online, Id leave that up to them when theyre older, but I still can acknowledge that in todays world its becoming more normal to plaater your kid on social media, and I just dont see how them posting these things could make anybody jump to the conclusions you are.  You must live in a pretty scary world if this is how you view your reality.

       You must be in quite a bit of denial. It

       that bad.  Innocent pictures are found in pedo libraries.  Sure, uninformed parents exist, acknowledged.

       No one said the material was sexual. The material is obscene and given what we know about the internet and its users, exploitative to the child. These are to say the very least. YOU are making it about sexuality, pervert.

       I'm not being selective in any way, there is literally nothing obscene here. This is equivalent to the picture of my 2 year old nephew passed out naked with a beer can placed in his hand that I just got on snapchat. If you see this shit as obscene or sexual YOU are the issue here.

       You came to a conspiracy sub to read the information I provided to only respond with a "NOT UH YOU'RE THE SICK ONE" Oooookay. You can move along to another thread now. We can all see that you think it is okay to host infant circumcision on the internet. Nothing wrong in that to you. Got it. Loud and clear, you fucking pig.
