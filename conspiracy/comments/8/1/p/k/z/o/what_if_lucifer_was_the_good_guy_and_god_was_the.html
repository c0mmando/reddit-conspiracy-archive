       What if Lucifer quarreled with God because he did not want to submit his DNA for Jehovah's galactical blockchain cryptocurrency?

      <p>
       What if Jesus the son of God actually meant that we must betray our rightful ancestors Adam and Lucifer and be enslaved by submitting out DNA to Jehovah's galactical blockchain cryptocurrency?

       Am I stupid for believing this? I tend to think people are loving and communal but have lost the way. The idea of these “evil” people sacrificing themselves for the greater of humanity aligns with my beliefs of past lives and multiple dimensions/“human” forms. I see things changing, yes a lot of it bad, but think about this. If all this shit collapses people will find out why and who and band together to survive and flourish.

       i heard an extremely interesting explanation for the mechanics of time and in a way it relates to this thread. the illusion of time is a result of consciousness stepping down from one dimension to the next. starting at the 9th dimension each distortion of the unified one allows for a greater manifestation of a physical illusion in space/time. very hard for me to wrap my head around what the ethereal realms would be like but hey this density isn't meant for having all the answers.

       That’s kind of how I see it. Like 4th dimension would be something akin to flawless human bodies or light bodies that don’t require food to live. Differences in time. Basically none of the “negatives” or being earthly. This would allow more attention and growth of the self and community. Next dimension something similar until we dissolve into source. I think a majority of people can’t even begin to imagine such (due to being distracted,medicated,indoctrinated). I think there’s potential for wonderful things on earth. The thought of the Georgia guidestone can be interpreted into something positive based on this reasoning. Sure a lot of people would have to be eliminated, but it would be those people’s time. I also believe there’s a species of human that is soulless that would be eliminated to fulfill this cause, but that’s just me. Sorry for the ramble I’m not 100% here right now, but I love this type of discussion

       According to the Bible Adam. But honestly no one knows anything like that for sure. But I base my opinion of the idea on the people pitching it, the UN/NWO types and the masons are secretive because they have to be and can’t be trusted. So they show the idea is wrong and folly.

       I agree. And they pitch the inversion of everything. So I’m not a hugely religious person, but if Lucifer was good and told the idea that man would be Gods if they ate the apple of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, when we did what he/she wanted......we didn’t become gods right? So Lucifer has to be the liar he/she is pitched as. Just basic Sunday school drop out analysis here 😛

       Not only did they not become Gods, but by eating the fruit they brought about death and destruction, as God had warned.  Jesus is the only reason we can be restored from this consequence; He took the penalty for that stupidity and offers forgiveness for faith in Him.

       Each thing that I learn about how the whole system is designed to teach me that there is no God it makes me KNOW that there is a God. There would t be this many evil bastards trying to convince people that there isn’t one if there actually wasn’t one. And the other proof in my mind about Jesus is that in a lot of the UFO abduction stories and bad things that happen to people the only thing they say made it end was calling out his name. Makes ya think.

       God is the same, He does not change. He made man in His own image, to love and enjoy each other, and lost him to a jealous, lying fallen creature —the ‘prince’ of this world. The evil you see in the world is a consequence of departing from goodness and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Old Testament God was teaching ppl who He was, what was good and evil, what the cost of sin is. Man’s evil was so bad, He had to start over. Jesus is the Messiah who will set things right. He has paid for sin and through faith any and all may be forgiven —even from all time. His agenda is not complete as He will return to set up His kingdom soon.

       I could help you understand this if you really want to know? Although I would like you to figure it out on your own. Read the myths of Zeus, and Prometheus, and enki and enlil. After that you may understand. Elohim is plural.

       So, I was actually confusing two texts i read a few years ago. I had to go back and reread a bit. The Gnostic Gospel is what you are looking for, not the Dead Sea Scrolls. Here is a link to the Gnostic Gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nag Hammadi Library
PDFSkeptik.net › khazarzar › books › nhl
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a website out there with a lot of similar info I will try and find for you. Again it's been several years since I've seen it.
