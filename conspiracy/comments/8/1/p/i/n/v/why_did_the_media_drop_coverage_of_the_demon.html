    <div class="md"><p>There are many things more likely then  someone beaming a voice into his head.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that his lawyer is lying to set up a defense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely he is schizophrenic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely he had temporary psychosis.</p>

<p>You could carry on for a while, the point is, unless something else seems to point towards a CIA/FBI style plot, I think it&#39;s safe to say that the skull tech thing is just too far a reach in this instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how do you determine which witnesses are actors and which are real?  Presumably you just decide &quot;this person is saying Cruz was the shooter therefor he is an actor&quot; and if somebody says anything other than that you say &quot;well this guy is legit!&quot;  So my question is, why didn&#39;t whoever planned this event use 100% crisis actors?  Why would they leave people around the school who weren&#39;t part of the plan?  That makes no sense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they&#39;re on the MSM pushing the official story they&#39;re actors.  If they&#39;re witnesses the MSM is ignoring or trying to hide then they&#39;re probably real.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the official narrative is obviously a politically driven crock of shit.  There are way too many inconsistencies, and the MSM is doing everything in their power to ignore them instead of addressing them.  </p>

<p>The man accused of fatally shooting a woman and wounding six other people at a Tennessee church last month told police he heard voices and had visions, including an image of that particular church, a detective testified in court Monday.</p>

<p>Sampson didn&#39;t recall shooting inside the church and wasn&#39;t shooting at anyone in particular.</p>

<p>Hours before he opened fire at the Florida State University library, lawyer Myron May left a desperate voicemail for an acquaintance with this plea: &quot;I do not want to die in vain.&quot;</p>

<p>The message was part of a flurry of emails, texts and phone calls in which the former prosecutor laid bare his torment: He believed government &quot;stalkers&quot; were harassing him and using a &quot;direct energy weapon&quot; to hurt him. He said that he had sent packages to 10 people that would &quot;expose&quot; what he thought was happening to him. </p>

<p>Kalamazoo shooter saw &#39;devil&#39; on Uber app and blames visions for killing spree. An Uber driver charged with fatally shooting six people in western Michigan told police that the ride-sharing company’s app takes over “your whole body” and forced him to go on a killing spree that also left two wounded. Dalton described the devil figure as a horned cow head … and then it would give you an assignment and it would literally take over your whole body.”</p>

<p>This is a very strange trend. The media will report on single incidents about a shooter complaining of being targeted by &quot;directed energy weapons&quot; and things like that, but the media won&#39;t connect the dots. They don&#39;t seem to want to discuss the fact that there is a trend here. There must be an explanation for all of this. Whatever that real explanation is, whether or not they can figure it out, the media should at least be discussing it....but they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>I would even settle for some news articles that say something like &quot;All of these mass shooters appear to have the same psychiatric illness.&quot; Why won&#39;t they discuss it?  Maybe there is something in the water? Could it be a reaction to psychiatric medications that the media doesn&#39;t want to discuss? Maybe some people are getting some kind of interference from wifi or close proximity to cell towers? That&#39;s a far-out possibility, but I&#39;m willing to consider anything at this point. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the &quot;audio spotlight?&quot; It is an ultrasound device that can direct ultrasound, focused in a beam, that can be heard only when the beam is directed at you. To everyone else, it is silent. This is already being used in grocery stores for advertising: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg</a></p>

<p>What about &quot;Voice-to-Skull?&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals.

<p>I’m inclined to believe this is being transmitted through cell phones somehow, but I am not nearly versed on the mechanics part to state a case saying so, so hopefully others will chime in here. </p>

<p>Maybe you can make a post highlighting these, I’m sure we could get a great discussion going on the subject. Or maybe you already have and I have just missed it. If you have, please point me to it because I would love to read more. </p>

<p>&quot;Santiago’s brother Bryan told reporters in Spanish that his brother is not Muslim and had been “born and raised Christian.”&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel took the opportunity to discuss his thoughts on gun policy, calling for tighter measures to ensure people with mental health issues do not have access to firearms. &quot;</p>

<p>This is so messed up. I don&#39;t think someone converts to Islam after watching some internet propaganda and turns in to a mass shooter. </p>

<p>What&#39;s your take on his apt. being rigged with explosives that it took significant man-hours to disarm the room?

    <div class="md"><p>Am a T.I in Iran, they used tech on me and another person I talked to irl, he thinks it was &#39;demonic possession&#39;, they controlled us to do weird things and erased our memory of doing it like Sirhan Sirhan not remembering he pulled a trigger, in my case they hinted at it in advance what they were gonna do been watched/harassed since at least 13 and my friend was looking into too much occult stuff online, a lot of my harassment is based off of my internet/phone activity and not just that, all the data they can gather like they didn&#39;t like my strong desire to help others (talked about it too much) that I&#39;m talented in something and had a upper middle class family with lot of connections so they made life very hard for me to limit my contribution to society. </p>

<p>Sorry to go on a woo rant on this highly controversial topic but I just don&#39;t give a damn about bots/shills calling me crazy anymore cuz I&#39;ve researched this enough to gain more awareness about the situation, there&#39;re enough doctors, professors, ex NSA or CIA agents whistleblowing about this and the crazy claims just come from a place of ignorance to make truth seem irrelevant like they&#39;ve always done. I stood with a sign about supporting targeted individuals in freaking Tehran, majority of people people fucking love and encourage activism, understand PTB use covert technologies to oppress us and I know the notion that conspiracy theorists are in the minority is an illusion they like to project to control us with fear. </p>

<p>In Tehran although there is a Farsi term for conspiracy theories most aren&#39;t familiar with it, when someone asks what does it mean you just explain one sentence &#39;it&#39;s like people who believe 9/11 was a false flag and governments aren&#39;t really for the people&#39; and they&#39;re totally on board 100% and just know there&#39;s so much shit that&#39;s hidden from us because our fucking ancestors have been going through this shit time and time again, it&#39;s like encoded in our DNA by now to &#39;not trust our leaders&#39;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced personalized targeted tactics and all the conditioning they subject people to since birth, money being probably the biggest one, are a means to an end, a time management procedure to fulfill a ritual of <em>something</em>. Time is an illusion they use to condition us, time is based on an object&#39;s relation to it&#39;s environment, heaven/hell can be right here whenever we want, it seems our controllers are striving towards a specific situation on Earth, I wonder what it could be, transhumanist agenda is my guess.    </p>

<p>You&#39;re not trying to be an ass, you&#39;re trying very hard to make it seem like you&#39;re not being an ass. You&#39;re trying to make everything I&#39;ve said about targeting irrelevant cuz in that technologically induced experience I used a drug which might&#39;ve not even had anything to do with the experience cuz it was such a low dose and they wanted me to use a drug so I&#39;d think it&#39;s related to a drug so I&#39;d post about it so bots can come and say I&#39;m a crazy drug addict or whatever, there are so many other experiences that seem crazier than this you could be calling me out on but it&#39;s just the drug post people like you keep attacking me for cuz supposedly anyone who&#39;s ever taken a drug is addicted to it thus must have mental issues /s </p>

<p>Although it&#39;s true that I don&#39;t really know you (like maybe I shouldn&#39;t be judging you so easily...hint hint) but from knowing my own life too well I&#39;d say there&#39;s a pretty high chance you&#39;d actually want to live my life lol I&#39;m an empowered individual trying to live the life I truly desire with amazing friends, family and I&#39;m not addicted to any substance. I&#39;m really lucky to have things like marijuana easily available to me so I can heal when I need it.  </p>

<p>Not even sure what you&#39;re trying to judge me on cuz the way we see the world are vastly different. I&#39;ll just keep on doing my thing, you seem kinda sad I hope there&#39;re no major issues in your life atm that&#39;s making you act out like this on reddit, I don&#39;t understand the whole point of your comment to judge reddit users based on your feelings. I was talking about advanced remote neural monitoring technologies and your comment based on your feelings just comes off as ignorant...and a little sad. </p>

<p>Even if you were to prove you&#39;re a psychiatrist and not basing your judgments on your feelings, I&#39;ve had enough experience with medical doctors to know that business is infiltrated as fuck which is a big reason why I had to start learning basic things about medicine and healing myself cuz you never know when you&#39;re gonna get injured or if people are gonna be around to treat you like a baby all your life. I was prescribed things that were killing me, no I don&#39;t trust the illusory accepted norm which is just that, an illusion and majority of people can basically tell when someone is talking out of their ass. </p>

<p>So I got a little (VERY little and haven&#39;t even started yet) adventurous in my early 20s with drugs, oh how will I ever redeem my self in your view...it&#39;s very important to me that every reddit user agrees with me /facepalm    </p>

<p>Drugs could easily explain some of your experiences. </p>

<p>Or if you truly are a targeted individual and they&#39;re increasing the effects of drugs, why not stop the drugs?</p>

<p>That would take away their attack vector. So why not stop the drugs and regain some of your freedom?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They increased the effects one time after I did something they didn&#39;t like and they induce horrible experiences to like &#39;punish&#39; me when I do good things or condition me with new age alien bullshit, one other time they induced an alien communication from smoking weed lol. Pretty sure I&#39;ve just posted about these 2 experiences related to drugs cuz they don&#39;t do it often and they usually just induce lot of pain now after they&#39;ve already tried to ruin my life with organized harassment against my family for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing more special about me than anyone else I was just young and had lot of potential to do good things for the world (like any sane, compassionate person would) upper middle class family with <em>lot</em> of connections so deemed a threat to their whole agenda of shitting on the world, targeting <em>probably</em> goes deeper than that with esoteric stuff but basically I believe it&#39;s to alter the path of people&#39;s lives and the decisions they make in life. </p>

<p>I had lot of potential and wanted to do so many important stuff, still do, but please understand how much they&#39;ve tried to ruin my life and tried to get me into bad habits with numerous perps introduced in my life which I&#39;ve cut connections with and I&#39;m trying to be a healthier person every day but it&#39;s hard after all the limitations they&#39;ve created in my life, which I&#39;m trying to get through (burned an office, killed dogs, raped, caused 2 divorces in family w/ fights both by electronic manipulation and by perps manipulating in horrible ways, stole about everything we had and still are) but also understand ultimately it&#39;s a huge fucking problem globally, a collective issue and so much bigger than my little experiences and we all need to come together to solve this, it&#39;s the one cause we <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> try to solve individually or else we&#39;ve fallen right into their trap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost, I&#39;m sorry about the hardships you have endured and I hope things get better for you and your family.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why they would target you, I come from a similar background and have been very vocal about my discontent for government corruption. </p>

<p>Maybe you could build a faraday cage to block all signals or use a spectrum ananylzier to capture proof of manipulation, it could help others.</p>

<p>Maybe the perpetrators in your life gave you drugs stronger than they said. It would serve their best interests.</p>

<p>Stay away from pills etc, even marijuana can be sprayed/laced with synthetic cannabinoids that would make you more vulnerable.</p>

<p>And sadly a young girl such as yourself needs to keep an eye on her drinks.</p>

Lol like you&#39;re really worried about what plants I inhale or liquids I drink, your character shows through your writing way too much. I hope you can be a generally better person for your own sake and humanity&#39;s in the future if you&#39;re a real person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was not my intention, what did I say that was condescending?</p>

<p>Yes we have different world views (not so different) I was suggesting things that I felt could help your situation.</p>

<p>Faraday cage could block them from targeting you... Why not? Create a safe space for you to play guitar/read/whatever you want.</p>

<p>As far as your grow, good! Consume only what you know is safe! Indoor or outdoor? Hydro/soil? Strain? India vs sativa?</p>

<p>We may have different views doesn&#39;t mean we have to be enemies. Wouldn&#39;t you help me if you thought you could?</p>

<p>Pills are dangerous, no telling what&#39;s in them.</p>
