       Existence is the meaning. How you do it will not only determine your life, but the lives of all others in ways you will never know. The rest doesn’t matter in terms of what anyone says, because if it is not your truth, it is not your life. Choose wisely and honorably, unless you would be less.

       We are the part of God that desires a material experience. The more you desire, the more you will continue rebirth into physical bodies. The less you desire, the closer to God you will be born, until you return to him forever and are no longer born into a material world. This is a reflection of the Vedic scriptures.

       Not sure why you think I’m
       <em>
        not

       “chill”.  I’m not rattling away at you or upset or anything.

      <p>
       I honestly hardly even remember what I stated in that original post - but it was ultimately just another way of saying what ended up actually being posted.  What’s there now is ultimately a better way of saying what I was initially attempting to state all along.  Whatever the initial post stated captured the general essence of what
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       post that’s stayed up is stating as well.  It just didn’t do it as well as this one did, and that’s why I re-stated my comment in the post that’s up there right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, it’s not like I made the original post, sat on it for like 30 minutes or an hour, and then later after taking a break, came back and re-edited it.  I posted the original post, quickly read it, and literally right then and there said “Ah.  Let me state it this other way instead.  I think the point will be better made in the following manner…” and that’s it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I don’t actually remember saying anything about evolution in particular - or at least not in the way that you seemed to have interpreted it in your response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responding to your response you made above all the same, however:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I disagree. I think Darwin had it right, but not in how you may think (or the propaganda he was paid to push). Species do not evolve, minds/souls evolve
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I’ll say the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Darwin actually had it almost
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       wrong.  Mind and souls can perhaps be said to evolve in the sense of accruing more knowledge, wisdom, understanding, information - yes.  However, it seems the physical vehicle/organism that houses the mind and the soul
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       evolve as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       That evolution can take place, as Darwin stated, via “random” natural selection (I put “random” in quotes because I feel there may be nothing truly “random” in the context of Cosmic Intelligence, but that’s a whole other can of worms altogether that I feel is far too complicated to address here).  This is at least part of the equation.  Physical organisms do indeed respond, adjust, adapt, and change in physical ways to the physical environment around them.  This, again, does in fact happen.  However, this is by far not the only mechanism involved in the evolution of species.  For example, not only have species of aphids been shown to change and adapt as per how they’re actually bred by harvester ants that collect and manipulate them en mass for their own purposes, but human themselves have entirely circumvented the idea and theory of “evolution by random, natural selection” on countless occasions by way of the breeding programs that been have employed on an untold number of species:  Cats, dogs, horses, bovines of all types, sheep, etc, etc, etc - literally every single domesticated animal is by its very definition a testament to the extremely limited scope of Darwin’s theory of evolution.  It shows that Darwin ultimately couldn’t have been more wrong when it comes to how in fact at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       (perhaps many) species change over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes/often species do change as a result of the external environment with no stimuli outside of the “natural” elements involved.  However, it also seems that no less frequently is it the case that a species evolves and changes (often drastically) as a result of being purposefully and genetically manipulated by another.  This changes the makeup of the species in ways that would have never otherwise taken place without such intelligent genetic manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of very significant but almost entirely suppressed evidence strongly indicating that human beings themselves are the result not of any sort of long, drawn out “Darwinian evolution through random, natural, selection”, but are instead the end product of a program of genetic manipulation at the hands of a far more intelligent and advanced species itself.  In humanity’s case, it is
       <em>
        the humans themselves
       </em>
       that are the pets that have been genetically manipulated by another more advanced species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, Darwin had it almost entirely wrong.

       That is but one religions outlook though, so you can't say it is absolute truth, because we just don't know. As a counter argument, what about the Sumerian scripts from 2600 bc that outline vitues? Or even the Epic of Gilgamesh (2250 bc ish)... They all predate and all talk about the same things... "Modern" (using that term loosely) religions have essentially taken bits of older religions.

       Once I got out of bed and made my morning coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reaching for the sugar jar on the top shelf I noticed this little ant crawling across the clay Buddha my partner has in her kitchen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally I’d squish that ant with my thumb, but that morning I had a thought. This little ant is just running around free doing what an ant does. Seemed a bit wrong to squish an ant on Buddha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the sugar is way up on the top shelf. It has to get over that greasy wall above the stove, through a kitchen cabinet and into a sealed airtight container.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming home at the end of the day there was a steady stream of ants running across the clay figure, up the wall, through the cabinet door and into the sugar jar which I thought was sealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lesson here is to always check your tyre pressure before driving to buy more sugar at the shops.

       Not sure why you think I’m
       <em>
        not

       “chill”.  I’m not rattling away at you or upset or anything.

      <p>
       I honestly hardly even remember what I stated in that original post - but it was ultimately just another way of saying what ended up actually being posted.  What’s there now is ultimately a better way of saying what I was initially attempting to state all along.  Whatever the initial post stated captured the general essence of what
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       post that’s stayed up is stating as well.  It just didn’t do it as well as this one did, and that’s why I re-stated my comment in the post that’s up there right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, it’s not like I made the original post, sat on it for like 30 minutes or an hour, and then later after taking a break, came back and re-edited it.  I posted the original post, quickly read it, and literally right then and there said “Ah.  Let me state it this other way instead.  I think the point will be better made in the following manner…” and that’s it.
      </p>

       That being said, I don’t actually remember saying anything about evolution in particular - or at least not in the way that you seemed to have interpreted it in your response.
