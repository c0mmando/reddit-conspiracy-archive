       I've never believed in a 'terror attack' conspiracy before. I think Sandy Hook happened, Boston Bombing happened, 9/11 I'm not sure... But it's weird how many natural speakers are involved in this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police sherif, faculty, students, parents. I don't really watch the news - only YouTube clips, but there are an insane number of videos out there interviewing all of these people. They're all extroverted public speakers, well spoken and not too nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hardly know anyone who could experience a traumatic event, and instantly be thrown into the ring of CNN and FOX without an issue. Yet this community is filled with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand... Maybe they don't publish the interviews that aren't smooth and don't provide a good story.

       Well then it sounds like the “truth movement” is finally building up momentum. Please continue to look around &amp; question stuff. “They” are pretty shifty though so never accept the answer from like Snopes or Quora. It’s usually the opposite :-)

       A 1000 isn't much. The high school I went to also had a 1000 kids, under the same circumstance we would have been a bunch of babbling idiots (entire grad class knew each other). However in our country we aren't as obsessed with the media, maybe kids in the US are more comfortable with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the whole situation seems weird due to the amount of production value behind the videos. Look at the CNN Town Hall video, it's odd. I picture millions of people mindlessly plugged into this Orwellian looking news coverage.

       You didn't watch it all but feel compelled to comment on it attacking the kids because you have a feeling based on a partial viewing of the material.

       Funny thing about that "Town Hall"....
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was it organized so quickly? Especially before full details emerged about the shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does no one really look too distressed? Especially the parents??
      </p>
      <p>
       What in the name of fuck was the Sheriff doing there and why did he proceed to grandstand about the NRA, especially when evidence has emerged that the department was not only negligent on this case, but derelict of duty??

       Kids in the U.S. do tend to be really comfortable on camera right now, moreso than previous generations.  It's probably due to the fact that it's the "selfie" generation and every kid has a camera in their pocket.

       That's actually part of this. Youre going to tell me it's a coincidence that out of 1,000 students, the media has "organically" focused on 4 or 5 kids who are staunchly anti-gun? Where are the pro-gun students?? Where are the students who report second shooters or an uptick in security (even Secret Service) leading up to the shooting?

       Seems to me like a combination.  A couple, David Hogg specifically, seemed to put himself forward.  A couple the media found because they were in close proximity to the shooter during the incident.  A couple seem to have been kinda picked by the students involved with this, at least the ones who were speakers at the rally in Tallahassee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second shooter hasn't been confirmed by anyone yet.  Often after tragedies, you'll hear unusual stories from shocked victims.  I vividly remember the MSM reporting one such story about a man who survived the WTC tower collapse by surfing down on top of a piece of debris.  I'm not saying that the second shooter testimonies are wrong, just that as of now, they are unconfirmed.  As more proof around that is discovered, eventually documentaries will be made, and those things will circulate, just like 9/11 or Waco conspiracy documentaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are absolutely pro-gun students who went to Parkland.  While I'd agree that the media are not purposely seeking them out in order to give them equal time, and they should, they didn't completely ignore them either.  I've seen interviews on MSNBC with a couple, and several more who agree with increased background checks, but stop short of favoring Assault Weapons bans.  I don't watch CNN, so I can't comment on their coverage, other than to highlight the pro-gun student who was supposed to give a question at the Marco Rubio Town Hall, and the whole shitshow with his father fabricating emails in order to help push the anti-CNN agenda.

       guess you've never seen someone shoot at targets for sport.  No killing.  Its a competition in eye/hand coordination.  (i.e. dart throwing is another example, as is archery).  see ya!

       When I was in college, one of my house mates came back from the jungles of south america with a blow gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       We set up a dart board outside and shot darts at it.

       So how does using a blow dart gun correlate to the original point of sport, darts, and hand/eye coordination in the universally understood sense of throwing darts at a dartboard?

       Are you under the impression that a blow gun doesnt require hand eye coordination?

       Just like darts or slingshots or pretty much any other weapon,it takes practice to become profficient at killing with it.

       I'm all for shooting for sport. Note: I'm not the guy who you were originally talking to. I just thought I'd chime in when you said "hunting" as if it wasn't killing.
       <br/>
       All things aside, the gun is literally a tool that was built for the sole purpose of killing. That can't be denied. But guns are already a thing. They exist, and have come for hundreds of years. I believe every mentally- healthy adult should have the right to own a gun, and I also believe they should have the right to use that gun as an absolute last resort to stop violence against their person, or against a tyrannical government.
       <br/>
       I'm a liberal. In the literal sense, that is, that I believe everyone is entitled to the freedom to do what they want without the restrictions of control by another party. But at the same time I believe there should be some serious education courses that go hand in hand with the purchase of any gun. I only believe in hunting if one actually hunts for food, rather than for sport. I also think target shooting and clay shooting is totally cool. It's a complex issue, and so I don't think it has a simple answer. I don't think guns are inherently the problem, but I won't deny that their existence and accessibility play a role in the larger problem, as does mental health treatment and education.

       Guns are hardly as much a necessity for day to day for the vast, vast majority.

       Because the response to this tragedy has been co-opted and professionalized, capitalized upon to control the narrative and forward the anti-2a agenda. I posted

       Not only is there a concerted effort to shape the narrative, but there are also resources being put toward ensuring that the manipulation remains covert.

       I think non-partisan movements on a local level can help. It's working to end cannabis prohibition state-by-state. The only question is how we can weaponize local democracy against encroachments by the Federal government when the states see themselves as subservient. Maybe serious talks of secession might be on the menu for all of us before long.

       I agree with this. That Emma Gonzales girl who I keep seeing speaking all over the place has something off about her too.

       I personally think a lot of these things continue to happen in an effort to make it harder for everyone to get a gun which will make it easier for who's really pulling the strings to control the population. I wonder how long it will be before the next "tragedy" happens now?

       I teach high schoolers, and you'd be surprised how capable they can be when they're motivated by something. Just because it would be tough for you doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people have more interpersonal experience and comfort.

       I too have wondered where the pro-2a kids are and why they aren'tgiven any camera time, though it's entirely possible they are staying silent due to peer pressure or fear of public scrutiny for voicing an unpopular opinion.

       Here in Seattle people will vilify you if you don't tow the line. I saw flyers posted in public about a guy who was claimed to be part of a Neo-Nazi group. The flyer had multi photos of him, in color detail, along with his full name, address, phone and email. Pretty fucking terrifying. I don't think anyone deserves that treatment no matter what they believe. Wouldn't surprise me if he is getting death threats too.

       I seem to remember a bunch of posts and comments here saying that the fact that one of them struggled to say what he intended to say during an interview was evidence that the whole thing was scripted and thus a hoax/false flag.

       You guys underestimate high schoolers. ALOT. Ever thought that maybe there school got shot the fuck up and they’re very upset and passionate about it? Because I would sure as hell jump on a stage and speak if it happened in my school. There are PLENTY of kids at my school that are great with public speaking, and perform and talk in front of the school in assemblies and shows. It is no surprise that these kids are articulate. Stop trying to downplay this tragedy and put dirt on the students.

       Check out Maddy Wilford. Something stinks about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       SWAT apparently applied a chest seal to her, which Coral Springs FD Lieutenant Ojeda believes alleviated the symptoms of a punctured lung.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three days later, she's photographed with Trump, and doesn't even seem to have an IV, or chest tube. Four days after that she's released from the hospital. Less than a week later, she's walking around doing interviews. And next week she can go back to school.
      </p>

       After having a lung punctured by a bullet.

       I think the students who are choosing to speak (and who are chosen by the news outlets) are natural public speakers and intelligent people. Why would someone who is shy and not very talkative would be chosen to talk for CNN? Why is it so hard to believe these teenagers can be articulate?

       I remember CNN doing a segment from the HS students' bus on their way to the town hall meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many students obviously did not want CNN on the bus with them doing live segments while on the way to the event. You could see and hear their exasperation.   I saw it live, but wasnt able to bring up clips of it just now. They may have gotten rid of it as it made CNN look like agressive trolls preying on young kids.

       This is more so what I'm thinking. I'm sure the attack happened and the kids are real - but CNN simply makes it look fake / staged / off. The production value, the weird interviews, the obsession with it all.

       When I watch it I feel disgusted. Looks like some dystopian future. Like a movie or book. Not real life...
