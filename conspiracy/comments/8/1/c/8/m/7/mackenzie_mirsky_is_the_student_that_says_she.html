       I have heard people refuting that Nikolas Cruz was ever seen with a gun. I want to post these as reference with all of the associated links. This is not to define how many shooters were present, but to establish the information that is available, and scrutinize its validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       From an article out of the Chicago Tribune:
       <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-82-minutes-florida-shooting-20180215-story.html">
        http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-82-minutes-florida-shooting-20180215-story.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       At about 2:21 p.m., the shooting began. Bullets streamed from the hallway, through doorways, into classrooms on the first floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a psychology class, a bullet came in through the window in the classroom door and skimmed past Meghan Hill's ear, trailing an intense ringing sound. It struck her friend in the knee. Three others also were hit. The gunman moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
       "No one was crying," said Mackenzie Hill, Meghan's twin sister, relaying her sister's memories. The wounded were moaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       After firing into four classrooms on the first floor, police say the gunman went upstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mackenzie, who'd just left the psychology class to use an upstairs bathroom, saw a man with a gun at the other end of the second-floor hallway. Mackenzie said she recognized him.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I immediately knew it was him," she said. She remembered the boy from her middle school and from the Dollar Store in town. She recalled his terrifying Instagram posts about wanting to kill people. "I always had a bad feeling about him," she said.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Here is another article with a video interview of Mackenzie Mirsky:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/parkland-school-shooting/i-never-got-to-say-goodbye-to-her-parkland-school-shooting-survivor-says-of-friend">
        https://www.local10.com/news/parkland-school-shooting/i-never-got-to-say-goodbye-to-her-parkland-school-shooting-survivor-says-of-friend
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the suspect did put on body armor, a helmet, and/or facemask, it would have had to be after this girl saw him. Of course, video footage from the school would be supremely helpful, but this is a piece of the puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, I saw in another thread that the Broward County Sheriff stated that the suspect "never was in possession of a gas mask [...] we did recover a balaclava, for which those of you that do not know is just a face mask with eye slits".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://globalnews.ca/video/4031260/broward-county-sheriff-say-suspect-didnt-have-gas-mask-smoke-grenade">
        https://globalnews.ca/video/4031260/broward-county-sheriff-say-suspect-didnt-have-gas-mask-smoke-grenade
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I, for one, do not trust the Sheriff whatsoever. Compare this to the teacher's statements of seeing the shooter in "full metal garb, helmet, facemask, bullet proof armor, shooting this rifle that I've never seen before".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/teacher-grazed-by-parkland-shooters-bullet-shooter-was-in-full-metal-garb-helmet-face-mask-bulletproof-armor-shooting-a-rifle-i-never-seen-before/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to offer my exact opinions. This is for reference. I do believe this deserves a full investigation, particularly the negligence of the police department by standing down and failing to set up a perimeter.

       It won't surprise me if this gets downvoted heavily. Some people don't want to hear about the shooting and others are shills. Just keep in mind that this is all sourced material with little commentary.

       Have you ever seen the movie My Uncle Vinny? Specifically the witness questioning part.  Where the woman claimed her magic grits cook in 1 minute and saw the defendant clearly, but rather she could not truly see him clearly at all. The woman wasn’t lying or being malicious, but rather our memory lies to us.  Eye Witnesses are proven to be inaccurate as our memory lies to us.  In this example it was what the shooter was wearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well I️ would like to point out the quote says something along the lines of “I️ knew It was him(Cruz)”.   And she gives background info on how he had posts of guns and other wierd shit.  It makes sense honestly,  if you had an opinion that this kid is crazy as fuck, violent, and posts guns on his Instagram, when you see a shooter you are probably going to think it’s that wierd kid.  Not that she saw beneath his mask and could positively id him, but rather if there was going to be a shooter she knew that this kid would be the one.

       You proved your point by saying it was the woman who cooked magic grits, when it wasn't the woman, it was the man. The woman was legally blind. That and calling it My Uncle Vinnie, and not My Cousin Vinnie, although that could be that blasted Mandela at it again.

       if you wanted to find some one to pin a false flag on, there would be no person more believable than kruz given his history.

         kruz had 2 minutes between exiting the uber and firing shots.

       yeah, I remember a school security or teacher reported that Kruz had arrived on campus and was walking purposefully in the direction of the school with a  backpack on. there was no mention of body armor being on. this means time would have been even more crunched.

       that was my thought too. it fits the teacher's description of the shooter too. the teacher described what sounded like a very professional shooter who she even said seemed taller and vigger than Kruz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Kruz squeamish behavior after the shooting, its hard to believe he had the composure to do it himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       the $800,000 inheritance he was seeking before the shooting is suspicious, but I want to see what drugs he was on, who his pychiatrists and social workers were.

       did McKenna happen to notice whether Cruz was suited up in full tactical gear?

       Eyewitness testimony is not that reliable, especially while undergoing a traumatic life threatening experience

       multiple eyewitness testimonies that corroborate each other is reliable enough to challenge whatever narrative the police have. we know for a fact they werent even there to witness as they were ordered to secure a perimeter rather than go for the shooter.

       i think the witness who saw the gas mask was wrong. They must have mistaken the balaclava for a gas mask. there were no smoke bombs or other reasons why the shooter would have a gas mask other than 1. to look scary 2. maybe shooter was expecting police to shoot gas at some point
