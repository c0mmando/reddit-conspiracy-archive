        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For a long time I was reluctant to jump on the Seth Rich was murdered band wagon. </p>

<p>Big things that kept me at arms length were Kimdotcom (a clear attention whore who was just muddying the water by promising things he kept failing to deliver on), his family (it was hard to believe his family would just stop seeking justice for him), and the fact that there were other reported robberies around that time.</p>

<p>One other thing that was keeping me skeptical was Julian Assange. He basically said as openly as possible Rich was the leaker, but there was so many weird rumors around Assange at the time it was hard to trust him. </p>

<p>Now though looking back with hind site Donna Brazile’s bizarre statements about being afraid for her life after Seth Rich was killed (something that seemingly should have barely been on her radar), the fact that Julian Assange is still being hotly pursued by the government (lends him more credibility in my eyes), and just the fact that the story really does feel off even after all this time.</p>

<p>I expected it would fade out like many fad conspiracies do, but it really has stuck in my mind and grown more suspicious with age.</p>

<p>I can honestly say at his point I think he was the DNC leaker and that he was murdered for it. </p>

<p>You were distracted from it by propaganda about WikiLeaks and Dotcom that you read in the left-establishment press. Now that you&#39;ve recognized the lie, stop trusting the liars and don&#39;t disparage the people that never did. Here&#39;s what they didn&#39;t want you to read:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a long post on Monday about the inception of Russiagate. The story is quite clear if you follow the dates:</p>

<p>12 June 2016: <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-12/assange-on-peston-on-sunday-more-clinton-leaks-to-come/">http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-12/assange-on-peston-on-sunday-more-clinton-leaks-to-come/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, said on Sunday that the journalist organisation is planning to release upcoming leaks in relation to US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Speaking to Peston on Sunday, Mr Assange said Wikileads has further information relating to claims circulating since 2015 that Clinton had in the past used her family&#39;s private email server for official communications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to committee officials and security experts who responded to the breach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 200+ page document that appears to be a Democratic anti-Trump playbook compiled by the Democratic National Committee has leaked online following this week’s report that the DNC was breached by Russian hackers. In it, Trump is pilloried as a “bad businessman” and “misogynist in chief.”</p>

<p>The document—which according to embedded metadata was created by a Democratic strategist named Warren Flood—was created on December 19th, 2015, and forwarded to us by an individual calling himself “Guccifer 2.0,” a reference to the notorious, now-imprisoned Romanian hacker who hacked various American political figures in 2013.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Days after the Democratic National Committee claimed its computer network had been breached by Russian hackers, a blog post published by someone calling themselves &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; has claimed responsibility, shared additional allegedly stolen documents, and promised to release even more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>22 July 2016: <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/">https://www.wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting on Friday 22 July 2016 at 10:30am EDT, WikiLeaks released over 2 publications 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from the top of the US Democratic National Committee -- part one of our new Hillary Leaks series. The leaks come from the accounts of seven key figures in the DNC: Communications Director Luis Miranda (10520 emails), National Finance Director Jordon Kaplan (3799 emails), Finance Chief of Staff Scott Comer (3095 emails), Finanace Director of Data &amp; Strategic Initiatives Daniel Parrish (1742 emails), Finance Director Allen Zachary (1611 emails), Senior Advisor Andrew Wright (938 emails) and Northern California Finance Director Robert (Erik) Stowe (751 emails). The emails cover the period from January last year until 25 May this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So who is Guccifer 2.0? Adam Carter has been trying to answer that question for a very long time:</p>

<p><a href="http://g-2.space/">http://g-2.space/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve seen deliberately placed &quot;Russian Fingerprints&quot;, efforts to forge perceived association to WikiLeaks, DNC breach claims discredited, How Guccifer 2.0 Used &quot;Trump Opposition Research&quot; like an identity card the day after it was cited by CrowdStrike executives in a Washington Post article, noted how he could only ever seem to hack the DNC, lacked syntactical traits of a Russian speaking English and has been shown as most likely operating within US timezones based on email timestamps, archive timestamps, Twitter activity and WordPress activity.</p>

<p>Is the &quot;Steele Dossier&quot; rearing its ugly head for the first time. Here&#39;s the next significant mention of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Washington (CNN)The FBI last year used a dossier of allegations of Russian ties to Donald Trump&#39;s campaign as part of the justification to win approval to secretly monitor a Trump associate, according to US officials briefed on the investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many attempts to pass that off as legitimate later, it resulted in:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a strange comment. You provide some great info taken straight from their gofundme, but then at the same time attack op for his observation that they appeared to care less after the lawyers involvement. I think you&#39;ve missed the point. The point being that yes, of course the family is concerned, but since the appointed lawyer stepped in significant outward conversation was stifled in a very hush-hush way. It seems like this immediate appearance of the family caring less is a product of muddied waters, but when you actually look into it you see that they do very much care about a real investigation being done. </p>

<p>If it was DNC hit they get that same benefit. If Seth can’t talk they can still try to control the narrative. For example, the Russia story could be an elaborate lie that They can now use Seth’s murder to prop up and Seth can’t come forward to debunk it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I definitely don&#39;t think the Russians killed him. I think someone tried to rob him and he fought back. Because he was bruised in the face. Maybe he even beat the guy up and then as he was running away, the guy shot him out of spite.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely weird that the robber didn&#39;t take anything but maybe the guy was terrified of getting caught so he ran right after he shot. We will probably never know. I just think a botched robbery in the middle of the night is infinitely more plausible than a hit job. Especially when there is absolutely no evidence he had those files or leaked them.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, Julian was helping the Trump campaign. With all the online shit that Russia was up to, it just makes much more sense that the DNC was hacked in my eyes. We already know Russia hacked Podesta for a fact. So I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s more plausible that Seth did this. Especially when he was recruited to go work for the Hillary campaign right before he died. </p>

<p>If DNC was hacked anx not leaked why not let FBI invetsigate and examine the evidence? Instead they got some questionable 3rd party to do it and refuse to let the FBI look at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you recall the news breaking about the US Intelligence Community mishandling it&#39;s arsenal of &#39;Advanced Cyber Weapons,&#39; a little over a year ago?</p>

<p>The United States&#39; Arsenal of cyber weapons was compromised because of the gross negligence/incompetence of our intelligence community. Those cyber weapons were widely accessible to any moderately proficient computer hacker and allowed for anyone to hack into a secure network and not leave a trace. </p>

<p>My qualm with the whole &quot;Russia hacked the DNC emails&quot; narrative is the fact that we would not know that the emails were hacked by Russia UNLESS they WANTED us to know that we hacked by Russia. I think everyone has reason to doubt that Russia would hack the DNC servers and make the mistake of utilizing &#39;inferior&#39; cyber weapons that leave a trail leading back to the Kremlin especially with more advanced,covert cyber weapons at their disposal. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know which hacked emails Papadopulous spilled the beans about. People insist it was the Podesta ones because people still cling to the theory that the DNC wasn&#39;t hacked.

Now let&#39;s skip ahead a few decades. If a young man, with strong connections to a powerful political party in let&#39;s say Russia, was murdered days before a major email leak that embarrassed said political party or exploited its unforgivable misdeeds, what do you think we would call it?

<p>100%</p>

<p>I bet if you made a fake news article about someone working for the Kremlin or Putin&#39;s party during Russian elections, and it says that he was killed in an accidental hit and run a week before leaked info from the party was released that embarrassed Putin, the dingbats in Worldnews would break reddit&#39;s server with the upvoting and rabid commentry about how obvious it is Putin had him killed.</p>

<p>A million percent, in that scenario, it would go down like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside of my thoughts on how the MSM treats Seth Rich, we already have multiple accounts of how Western media works against master criminal and James Bond villian Vlad &quot;Da Bad&quot; Putin. Now the stories might not all be fake news but are they all true? For instance, if one searches online for Putin assassinations there are thousands of results that appear. Some are complex poisoning plots, others are straight homicides and there are mysterious heart attacks. Many play like a John le Carre spy thriller.  And perhaps Putin or the upper echelon of Russia&#39;s state are involved in all of these dozens or hundreds of deaths. I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if he was involved.  But to then assume that the upper echelon of the US could in no way shape or form be involved in similar behavior is laughable. For goodness sake, the CIA was involved in bringing in cocaine from Central America to California. And then the US government had the nerve to blame US citizens for taking drugs they were involved in distributing and selling to them. This is just one example of many. Now, if tens of thousands of people being hooked on crack which caused irreparable damage to themselves and their families is no big deal to undertake, why is one person&#39;s mysterious murder for political purposes so unbelievable?</p>

<p>That&#39;s it basically.</p>

<p>To outright dismiss it while circle jerking about how half the world&#39;s leaders are happy to assassinate everyone is just ignorance.</p>

<p>Not even the drug smuggling and general shadiness, but look at stuff like MK Ultra. That shit is insane, kidnapping the public and drugging them up against their will.</p>

<p>To think the US government agencies wouldn&#39;t assassinate someone is way more crazy than thinking they would.</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s been very clear about the Dems and the MSM lately. They&#39;re incredibly unaware and out of touch with how they&#39;re being perceived by the public. They overplay their hand and they think nobody notices. They believe quite strongly they can just say the magic words &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and if they don&#39;t have their media lapdogs talk about it anymore then it goes away.</p>

<p>Why are they trying to make this go away. Why don&#39;t they want their servers examined by the FBI if they&#39;ve been screaming from the mountaintops that it&#39;s a monumental breach of national security? They think you&#39;re stupid. Are you stupid?</p>

But do you believe it a stretch that if they did want to make an example of a leaker, with or without proof, for something as benign as releasing campaign info, that they wouldn&#39;t be more forceful against a leaker that caused the scam of the DNC to be exposed? A billion dollar scam that screwed over a progressive candidate mind you. This is theoretical of course, but we are talking about a conspiracy so bear with me. But IF the DNC emails were internally leaked and not extermally hacked, the aggressive stance, shown in the aforementioned email, towards whistleblowers or a leaker seems relevant to point out.</p>

<p>It still doesn&#39;t explain why Republicans, even those appointed by Trump, say it was Russia. They would have every reason to pin the story on Seth Rich if there was a way to do so.</p>

<p>We will see what Mueller will lay out about it and if he provides proof. However, typically people that buy into this theory aren&#39;t interested in the truth.</p>

<p>Something being a larger factor is not the same as it being the <em>only</em> factor. And again I have already stated very clearly that it was a gradual change but a sudden one.</p>

<p>I like that you want to say I can’t say what you find suspicious (which I never claimed to) but you want to pretend like you can read my mind.</p>

<p>Like I pointed out elsewhere, none of them have anything to do with Wikileaks or the DNCLeaks, but &quot;hurr durr muh ongoing investigation.&quot; Mueller must run a <strong><em>really</em></strong> tight ship to avoid leaking <strong><em>any</em></strong> proof of Wikileaks-Russia collusion.

<p>You have it backwards:  Russians are suing buzzfeed because they are accused of hacking.  They will probably win the case because buzzfeed can&#39;t get any evidence that there was a hack at all.  </p>

<p>Can you explain why the DNC would want to hide evidence of a hack?  The simplest explanation is that there is no evidence.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happens when a mugging goes bad. People generally don&#39;t pull guns in a mugging with the intention on murder, but rather just to scare. When the gun goes off suddenly you aren&#39;t at the scene of a mugging, you&#39;re at the scene of a murder. Your plan has gone sideways, and you panic, so you run without rummaging through the soon to be corpse&#39;s pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, too. If thugs killed him for his wallet (which, as you point out, they didn&#39;t even take), the media would have been quick to show the world the CCTV footage. Washington DC has cameras everywhere. I think there were no less than three pointed directly at the spot where he was murdered. Yet . . . no footage.</p>

<p>If it was ALSO a random robbery of a nobody, why would Julian Assange (thousands of miles away) even know who Seth Rich was and take pains to mention him being murdered in an interview. How would be possible know who he was (if he was really some irrelevant nonentity). Likewise with Donna Brazille, who dedicated her book to him and said that she feared them doing to her what they did to him.</p>

<p>When you listen to her interviews, you get the sinking feeling that Seth wasn&#39;t acting on his own. What she makes it sounds like is that SHE was the one who ordered him to leak the data as a &quot;cutout&quot; and then she felt guilty when he was murdered. Seriously. Go listen to her talk about it. Her sense of guilt is plain for all to see.</p>

<p>And one of the biggest underreported stories of last year was that the man Seth Rich was lured out to meet at the bar (where he was drugged) was none other than Pakistani spy Imran Awan, who made the news for tapping the servers of dozens of U.S. Congressmen and sending the data back to Pakistani secret intelligence. Awan was on Debbie Wasserman-Schultz&#39; payroll. And it&#39;s largely believed that she was the one who put the hit out on Rich (using MS-13 members to do it.)</p>

<p><strong>This is getting stupidly ridiculous – all of the recent high profile crime is concentrated on the exact same 2-3 blocks of Flagler, Adams, and First.</strong> Nowhere else in the neighborhood. Why doesn’t MPD have a permanent police presence in an area <strong>they know there is an ongoing problem?</strong> A car on each block at all times, and/or officers walking the blocks, and/or SOMETHING visible. They do this all over the city – along 7th at R in Shaw is the most obvious example just down the block.</p>

<p><strong>They know there is a problem. They know where there is a problem. Yet they seem to have a strategy of thoughts and prayers. Yeah, good luck with that.</strong></p>

<p>This is so tragic. If what you are saying is true — that the victim was a DNC employee and former congressional staffer — it sounds like he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. <strong>It’s especially awful considering how much violent crime has been going on in this 2-3 block radius</strong>. As a neighbor who has been concerned will all of the crime in the area, I can’t help but feel that this could have been prevented by better policing and more emphasis on public safety (including by DC water in the nearby construction area). <strong>There has been a small group of guys with a silver handgun terrorizing this neighborhood for weeks with minimal response from public officials</strong>. I don’t know if this is possible, but if I were one of his family members, I would explore suing the district for negligence.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone in B’dale is in the wrong place at the wrong time right now… The neighborhood has been terrorized by a group of criminals for the last month, all incidents – same pattern.</strong> Unfortunately, the last one left no witness. What will be the tipping point for officials?</p>

<p>The neighborhood construction impedes the cops ability to canvass the streets, offers hiding places for criminals and eliminates sight lines for neighbors. As someone that lives near the crime scene and in front of DC waters construction, I know first hand the atmosphere this creates. Any neighbor I’ve talked to feels the same. Crimes near the construction zones have been going on since they first started. Attempted rapes, break-ins and muggings have happened right in front of the construction barriers on a consistent basis, it’s just more concentrated in the last month. There is no lighting for safety and the security is nothing more than a physical presence without response. It’s a tragic state of affairs.</p>

<p>I’m sure the last thing his family wants to do is read a comments section of a blog post on his death, so I hope SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM can relay this to the family: <strong>Violence in this neighborhood (literally all within a couple of blocks of his death) has been boiling over in the past few weeks. There have been 2 guys with a “silver hand gun” involved in at least 6 armed robberies in the past few weeks. There have been neighborhood meetings about this and several neighbors begging DC water to do something about the unsafe, unlit construction zone nearby that has created a perfect opportunity for violent crime.</strong> The police said they would send out a patrol on a segway and apparently that only lasted a couple of days.

The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Rich’s laptop sits with the FBI in a co-shared space with the D.C. police department.

<p>He also claims that he would not ever reveal his sources. So what does he do to manipulate public opinion? Misdirect by implying someone is a source without actually saying it, so he doesn&#39;t actually violate one of his most important principles. Don&#39;t let him play you so easily.</p>

<p>First, what does this suggest? That they family was in on it? Are you suggesting that the DNC paid them off and they were like &quot;That&#39;s fine that you killed our son&quot;? Maybe they just believed the cop&#39;s version of the events. It&#39;s unlikely, after a short period of time, that you will ever find someone who randomly killed another person. (Randomly as in they don&#39;t know each other). It&#39;s better for your mental health to move on, so there is no point in continued pursuit of this.</p>

<p>Because it shows that he had incentive to paint her in a negative light. If we know someone doesn&#39;t like another person, when they make claims (implicit or explicit) against that person, we should be smart enough to demand proof, and not buy into something so vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate Hillary and I didn’t go out and create an elaborate plan to hurt her election cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple of things.</p>

<p>First, this is ridiculous logic. How does the fact that you didn&#39;t do so with the same feelings toward Clinton preclude him from doing so?</p>

<p>Second, he simply casually and implicitly added fuel to the fire of the &quot;the DNC killed Rich&quot; conspiracy theory in a single tweet. There is nothing elaborate about this plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either you have evidence he actually lied to harm her, or you don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, I&#39;m not saying he is lying. I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t know who the source is. What I am doing is pointing out that you should be skeptical about the situation: we have a person obviously biased against Clinton, vaguely implying that she might be behind a murder while, seemingly at the same time, violating his most important rule: don&#39;t reveal your sources. However, if the source does come out, he has an out and say &quot;I never said it was Seth Rich.&quot; It&#39;s a pretty convenient position for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>But also, either you have evidence that the DNC actually killed Seth or you don&#39;t.  If this vague tweet by Assange is the best you&#39;ve got, then you should admit you really don&#39;t have anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proving someone doesn’t like one of the most disliked people in history doesn’t say anything about what the DNC did or didn’t do.</p>

<li> Donna Brazile’s comments of his murder making her fear for her life</li>

<p>A robbery gone wrong is clearly an over simplified explanation that doesn’t account for all of those things.

<p>Unless, of course, everything you listed was just speculation and actually had nothing to do with his murder. It&#39;s amazing that the simple, obvious explanation for his death, which is supported by actual evidence, is rejected while blind speculation based on coincidences, vague implicit accusations, reading into people&#39;s statements and opinions about behavior is taken as &quot;good&quot; evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that you can&#39;t torture the facts to make it fit any narrative you want. Without actually seeing something with our own eyes, we can imagine all kinds of explanations for something. But I think you are mistaking evidence for speculation.</p>

<p>Example. An old tree in my yard falls over one night. I look at it and see that at least much of it was dead and there was rot in the trunk. Evidence suggests that it was just old, possibly dead, and it fell over as is the natural process of trees.</p>

<p>Or. . . .maybe it was aliens who came down and put rot into the tree and pushed it over. I can support this because one time someone in my neighborhood said they saw a UFO and another person swears they heard a weird noise that night and I heard once that aliens have the ability to make something rot.</p>

<p>The evidence fits both of these claims, and both are possible, but one is the natural conclusion from objectively viewing the evidence, the other blind speculation based on some other things that are seemingly unrelated.</p>

<p>Granted, I don&#39;t think your speculation is nearly as ridiculous as the alien speculation, but it is the same idea. You are looking at unrelated coincidences, reading into people&#39;s comments and vague, unsubstantiated accusations (that you, yourself, said you should be skeptical of. . .but are now used as evidence for your claim. . .which is kind of contradictory) and then turning the murder scene into some elaborate scheme to make it look like it was just a botched robbery. It&#39;s amazing that you even admit that it looks like a botched robbery, but with no other good evidence, you <em>still</em> think that it is more likely that someone had him killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is torturing facts. There is absolutely nothing that links the DNC or anyone else to the murder. Nothing. Not one shred of evidence.</p>

<p>The only &quot;evidence&quot; you have that he was even the leaker is a vague tweet by Assange. But even if he was the leaker, there is still nothing that ties anyone to his death.</p>

<p>You have a comment from Donna Brazile that says she was afraid for her life, but we don&#39;t know why. Was it because she was afraid of the powers-to-be? Or was she afraid of conspiracy nutters? Remember, she was originally a prime candidate for the one ordering the hit. But this still doesn&#39;t link anyone to his death.</p>

<p>You claim that &quot;timing&quot; is evidence, but this could just be coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does everyone recall the news breaking about the US Intelligence Community mishandling our arsenal of &#39;Advanced Cyber Weapons,&#39; a little over a year ago?</p>

<p>The United States&#39; cache of the worlds most advanced cyber weapons was compromised because of the gross negligence/incompetence of our intelligence community. Those cyber weapons were widely accessible to any moderately proficient computer hacker and allowed for anyone to hack into virtually any secure network and not leave a trace.</p>

<p>This is the basis for my qualm with the whole &quot;Russia hacked the DNC emails&quot; narrative. We would not know that the emails were hacked by Russia UNLESS they WANTED us to know it. I think everyone has reason to doubt that Russia would hack the DNC servers and make the mistake of utilizing &#39;inferior&#39; cyber weapons that leave a trail leading all the way back to the Kremlin especially with more advanced,covert cyber weapons at their disposal.</p>

<p>I think it is intuitive to follow the line of thought that it is absolutely possible that the technical firm that was brought in to investigate the DNC email hack would rub &#39;Russian fingerprints&#39; all over the servers and then blame Russia.</p>

<p>This also sowed the seeds for the &quot;Trump colluded with Russia&quot; narrative in the unlikely event that Trump would win the presidency.</p>

<p>Two birds with one stone, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Seth Rich, directly employed by the DNC, didn&#39;t immediately become a rallying cry for gun control is a bit like the dog that didn&#39;t bark.</p>

<p>This Bernie-supportin&#39;, Stein-voter emphatically does <strong>NOT</strong> approve of anymore gun laws, nor do I want Seth Rich to be used that way.  But that the <strong>Democrats</strong> didn&#39;t turn Seth into a martyr... For a demographic so strongly against guns, Dem leadership missed an easy lay-up/field goal/free throw.  Especially with that All-American outfit Seth wore on a July 4th.  I could see a strategy of avoiding gun control as an issue before the election, but certainly not after.  Especially after Brazille brought it up in her book.  Seth&#39;s parents seem to be the type who&#39;d be ok with Seth being used that way if it was the kind of thing Seth would want.</p>

<p>Just doesn&#39;t make sense.  If a GOP staffer got beat up and car-jacked by illegal immigrants, that would be an R talking point for the next 2 or 3 decades.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton">Like Willie Horton.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, Julian was helping the Trump campaign. With all the online shit that Russia was up to, it just makes much more sense that the DNC was hacked in my eyes. We already know Russia hacked Podesta for a fact. So I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s more plausible that Seth did this. Especially when he was recruited to go work for the Hillary campaign right before he died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>32k in over a year? How much have the parkland victims got? Imagine if the DNC got behind the Seth rich murder and pushed an investigation or even made the issuse a gun control issue since you know it was another gun that killed him. Bet they could&#39;ve really help the family generate a lot more money. 32k in a year is laughable and shows that family has no support from the DNC. Disgusting cover up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a strange comment. You provide some great info taken straight from their gofundme, but then at the same time attack op for his observation that they appeared to care less after the lawyers involvement. I think you&#39;ve missed the point. The point being that yes, of course the family is concerned, but since the appointed lawyer stepped in significant outward conversation was stifled in a very hush-hush way. It seems like this immediate appearance of the family caring less is a product of muddied waters, but when you actually look into it you see that they do very much care about a real investigation being done. </p>

<p>Some people think that he saw something terrible in the DNC and was responsible for leaking the DNC email trove to WikiLeaks, thereby costing Hillary Clinton the election by revealing her true motives, true goals, and the twisted and seditious network of sycophants that surround her.</p>

<p>But I could be misremembering. Podesta said a lot of bizarre things.</p>

<p>Now it isn&#39;t. Even if it wasn&#39;t as I said it is all older than that even. So yes old information has suddenly changed your mind.</p>
