    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that Africans are quite literally the least intelligent group of people on earth. That doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t smart Africans. But when we&#39;re talking about an entire country&#39;s prospects, it&#39;s necessary to look at the people who make up that country as a whole. A country is only as good as its average, not its outliers. </p>

<p>Reality is not always palatable. You can lie to yourself and look at the world through ideologue glasses all you want. I would advise against it, but you do you. ✌️ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao. First of all, we wuz kangz shit will be laughed at. Second of all, I already said there are smart Africans but again, the future prospects of a country aren&#39;t based on outliers, they&#39;re based on averages. And Africans have the lowest average IQ on earth. That is not based on ignorance, it is simply a fact. Many facts are unpalatable but that does not affect their veracity. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not aware of it, but your opinions are coming from a place of ideology. An ideology that will be seen from the POV of the future as a temporary fad like lysenkosim.</p>

<p>But there are numerous going on in africa now: Genocide Watch has an <a href="https://www.click2map.com/v2/H3llo/Genocide_Prevention">interactive map for more</a></p>

<p>Regarding Israel, they are deporting (or jailing) African refugees as is and have apartheid issues of their own. </p>

Unless you plan on destroying their Muslim identity, which I don&#39;t consider right, their existing allegiances won&#39;t match up very very well with Europe/US.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for not being clear.  I&#39;m still trying to understand this myself.  Take for example your family.  Most people would be willing to die defending their family.  You will sacrifice for it and feel good about it.  Muslims obviously have these feelings too.  But does it end there?  Aren&#39;t we willing to sacrifice for other things we value?  I believe groups are best organized around shared values.  It makes taxation more just if it goes to defending your values.  Islam is very important to Muslims.  I&#39;m not willing to die for Islam.  Many of them are.  I respect them for that like I respect my founding fathers for dying for free speech and the other values they enshrined.  Islam enshrined different values.  They have defended them through the ages with war like we have our values (Excluding the fucking CIA and other useless recent wars that benefit the values of who knows who (Big Oil, Israel?).</p>

<p>I would like them to keep their culture and I also believe communities based on strong agreement on values work better because humans will sacrifice to defend values.</p>

<p>I feel the best way to do this is for them to seek refuge in neighboring countries and we send aid to those areas.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m still grappling with these ideas.  Multiculturalism is obviously the opposite of this.  I&#39;m just wondering if that means culture is not important.  Hmm, I kind of like western culture and I&#39;m willing to be taxed for it, make sacrifices for it. I also like other cultures.  How do we maintain them?  I thinking maintaining nation states around values is the best way to do this.</p>

<p>If you like Islam, you have a place where you can sacrifice to the government and support it.</p>

<p>If you like wesetern culture, you have a place where you can sacrifice to the government and support it.</p>

<p>Otherwise the government does stuff you don&#39;t value.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the highest ideal western culture has achieved is the right to free speech and the importance of debate/discussion of ideas.  It goes back to ancient Greece and is best expressed by John Stuart Mill in &quot;On Liberty&quot;.  I value this over everything.  Islam has prohibitions in this area with the aim to place Allah above all else.  I&#39;m not anti-Islam, but I know these two views can&#39;t coexist.  So I believe they should be free to try this idea and form a nation around it.  At the nation-state level is where we give these ideals teeth.  Perhaps westerners are too liberal and this will be our undoing. </p>

<p>As to slavery, it still exists in most non-western countries.  Slave markets are active in Libya right now.  It is western culture that has done more to end it than any other culture.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just speeching to the ideals of western culture.  Obviously, there are many examples where we have not lived up to it and failed and are failing.  Debate/free speech is allows us to expose this and correct it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War#In_other_Middle_Eastern_countries">According to Wikipedia</a>, Turkey &amp; Lebanon have taken in over 4 million refugees from Syria. Jordan has 628,000 registered and over 1.5 million total. Iraq, a country that actually has almost no capacity to support refugees on the fact that it&#39;s suffering from 15 years of active destabilization and internal conflict, has about 250,000 registered.</p>

<p>And also, you have to bear in mind that this isn&#39;t an issue where you have unlimited time to make a decision if the lives of the refugees are important. Yes, sure, no one&#39;s gonna disagree that countries like Egypt or Saudi Arabia aren&#39;t doing what they should be to support these people.</p>

<p>It would be wonderful if other countries chipped in to help, and as statistics have demonstrated, some have (though many haven&#39;t.) But understand that the majority of people you&#39;re talking to are also residents of these same western countries. There&#39;s really nothing that average people in the US can do to directly influence Egypt to take in its fair share of refugees. However, if they want to help, they <em>can</em> petition for their own leaders to do something.</p>

<p>This is just the reality of the situation. You&#39;re not seeing any activism for Chinese acceptance of refugees because few on the internet can influence whether that happens, it&#39;s a moot discussion. Making it about &quot;white countries&quot; vs &quot;western countries&quot; as you&#39;re doing is the real issue.</p>

As far as the south Darfur Christians, I&#39;m not sure, so might call us an Christian nation, but they might have trouble assimilating to our western standards and culture. 
The problem with takin in a mass of immigrants is keeping them apart. It sounds harsh but, if they are living next to people who share same values/culture/language, there is no reason for them assimilate.

<p>I&#39;d really like to think how people think the forefathers of the black people got ahold of the land that is now South Africa. Do they think that there was a ballot of some kind, where everybody in that region voted on who they think deserves the land, or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;white genocide&quot; is a confused term...  I first learned the term in the 90s, and it meant something very different...</p>

<p>Like, &quot;white slavery&quot; doesn&#39;t mean slavery of white people</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are the Slavic people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;White genocide&quot; only recently started meaning &quot;genocide of white people.&quot;</p>

<p>When I learned the term, it was a method of genocide.  Genocide by sexual displacement.  For instance, the caste systems in India that deemed certain people were unable to take wives, while their daughters could certainly be taken as a wife by &quot;higher&quot; castes, that would be a policy of white genocide.</p>

<p>Another thing that I find interesting is the context for why I learned of this term...  At the time, in my circles, it was considered a settled matter that there was no genocide of the native Americans, and we were trying to figure out whether or not it could have been considered a white genocide...</p>

<p>Now, our culture has turned racial-centric and people believe white genocide means genocide of white people...  They probably also believe that white slavery refers to the slavery of white people.  White slavery refers to sex slavery.</p>

<p>Finally, you could go down a certain rabbit hole regarding the Amalekites and their modern-day descendants. Of the 613 mitzvot (commandments) followed by Orthodox Jews, three refer to the Amalek: to remember what the Amalekites did to the Israelites, not to forget what the Amalekites did to Israelites, and to destroy the Amalekites utterly. The rabbis derived these from Deuteronomy 25:17–18, Exodus 17:14 and 1 Samuel 15:3. Rashi explains the third commandment:</p>

<p>From man unto woman, from infant unto suckling, from ox unto sheep, so that the name of Amalek not be mentioned even with reference to an animal by saying &quot;This animal belonged to Amalek&quot;.</p>

<p>The man himself doesn&#39;t even seem to state it as &quot;white&quot; in an <em>ethnic</em> sense, but as a contention of <strong>privilege</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>the US, France and UK vetoed a UN resolution against apartheid in the 70s.</p>

<p>the land redistribution concerns those that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>obtained land illegally</p></li>
<li><p>doesn&#39;t concern houses</p></li>
<li><p>those who are are using land for farming can keep using it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You really can&#39;t claim that it&#39;s logical that the whites (8% of the population) own ( 72% of the land). This is a direct result of colonialism and aprtheid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is not only a fraud, but a race-baiting moron overly focused on the demographics at play rather than any material examination of either the land redistribution itself or of the reasons 8% of the population own 72% of the land in the first place. They&#39;re probably white, so they hear a couple black people say horrific shit and it justifies their knee-jerk need to defend colonialist bullshit.</p>

<p>So much racist shit, so much <em>obviously</em> misleading shit in all these threads. I keep seeing people quote like, minor opposition party officials talk about killing whitey like it has anything to do with anything. It&#39;s like they&#39;ve never heard of cherry-picking, but they&#39;d object to someone grabbing quotes from neo-nazis like they&#39;re proof that whites in America want to commit genocide. </p>

<p>What really gets me, though, is that if 8% of a <em>certain ethnicity</em> owned 72% of <em>their</em> country, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be up in arms about it. Especially if those people owned the news or had significant influence in the government. I (((wonder))) who I could be talking about? p.s. I don&#39;t agree with all this Jew-hating shit, but god damn is it the perfect example of cognitive dissonance when someone pushes shit like OP while also constantly railing against Jews. </p>

<p>P.p.s. lol look at OP&#39;s post history he&#39;s got a thread where he acts like 24/29 terrorist attacks being perpetrated by white supremacists is insignificant because &quot;it&#39;s a majority white country.&quot; Holy retardation, batman</p>

<p>The same thing that happened in Zimbabwe will happen in South Africa.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, just checked and you are correct. If you use the term &#39;land reform&#39; you can find wide coverage of the story. If you use the term &#39;confiscation&#39; you can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Appropriating property without compensation is confiscation though. It&#39;s not sensational or alarmist. Calling it simply &#39;land reform&#39; sounds like a euphemism to me. It seems I wasn&#39;t using the politically appropriate term to describe what&#39;s happening in South Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the angle the Nazis were using against the Jews, so yeah, you did miss it. </p>

<p>&quot;This is what is happening and this is what WILL happen if we don&#39;t stop the jews. The Jew has everything while good Aryan Germans starve. etc. etc.&quot;</p>

<p>So are you advocating for ethnic cleansing and/or genocide here? </p>

<p>Keep in mind if it IS identified as genocide, or even ethnic cleansing, the UN must intervene.......against a nuclear power. So we now have a clusterfuck featuring nukes because some asshole wants to be the &quot;hero to his people&quot;. </p>

<p>This is a fucked situation and the only way to stop it is to send a strong message now, so they
have a tough decision before the the bloodletting truly begins.</p>

<p>Really this is already ethnic cleansing so the time to send this message is very short if not gone.</p>

<p>No Ethnic Cleansing, No Genocide, by anyone, against anyone, ever. It&#39;s not fucking rocket science here. It&#39;s decent human being 101. These are some of the very core ideals of the modern world. The very same world that has survived without World War III for 70 or so years.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve made excuses for this type of asshole too many times already. You want to be on the side of these regressive savages, that&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the people they&#39;re doing this to are the very ones who ENDED Apartheid. Them, their children, and their grandchildren. They took a stand and said &quot;Our fathers were wrong, we can do better.&quot; So some guy around 20 years later can say &quot;No, Now you pay for the sins of your fathers which you ended&quot;</p>

<p>This obviously smacks of race baiting, scapegoating and a desire to gain a more firm grasp on power. We&#39;ve seen this playbook before. Where though? Oh yeah, The Nazis.</p>

<p>It is pretty heavily implied though.</p>

<p>But to the point of conflict.</p>

<p>To the Nazis the Jewish problem actually did happen as well. Having spoken to Germans who were alive during the rise of Hitler, your same argument was used by them to explain how Hitler got into power. </p>

<p>To them this actually did happen as well. That&#39;s the justification then and it&#39;s a justification now for a new disgusting event. This time we&#39;re alive to say &quot;No, not this time madman&quot;</p>

<p>As for the people getting fucked over now, Apartheid ended 20 years ago. Only just now do the ethnic majority seek retribution on a strucural level.</p>

<p>Why&#39;s that you figure?</p>

<p>Condemn it, even one time. I have my doubts that you will, because we both know you support it.</p>

<p>&quot;White farmers in South Africa who refuse to sell their property to the government under a land redistribution scheme were told yesterday that their property would be seized.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1544384/South-Africa-to-step-up-land-seizure.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1544384/South-Africa-to-step-up-land-seizure.html</a></p>

<p>Ethnic Cleansing. Which is NOW legal there due to the ammendment of this....</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_Two_of_the_Constitution_of_South_Africa">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_Two_of_the_Constitution_of_South_Africa</a></p>

<p>“No one may be deprived of property except in terms of law of general application, and no law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property. Property may be expropriated only in terms of law of general application for a public purpose or in the public interest; and subject to compensation.</p>

<p>Tell me more about their constitution, the very constitution they ammended to allow for this ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>You are wrong. Your stance on this is Wrong. This is Ethnic Cleansing, bordering on Genocide plain and simple. </p>

<p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth only gets you more blood and teeth. </p>

<p>Additionally, This situation is lighting up white supremacist websites and their traffic. A rallying cry and major advertising boon to them. So perhaps what would be a normally moderate person will stumble onto those places and could become radicalized. FFS the daily stormer ( A literal neo-nazi website) was one of the search results. Giving them more attention to their cause is a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>This is what your eye for an eye attitude will bring. You want a bloodbath? That&#39;s what you&#39;ll get, more than beyond your wildest dreams. When you&#39;re ready for it to end, guess what.... it only ends when IT decides it&#39;s time to end. </p>

<p>There are no winners in a situation like that, only losers. The only way to come out ahead is to avoid it entirely.</p>

<p>Simply yelling &quot;Genocide! Genocide!&quot; doesn&#39;t make it true. Even genocide watch - the one people love to quote - lists south africa at stage 6. Know what other country is at stage 6? The USA. And I doubt you would argue that the USA is currently enacting a genocide.</p>

<p>So what? White supremacists have used SA as a rally cry for decades. They can&#39;t stand the idea of blacks being successful in any way. That&#39;s what makes them supremacists.</p>

<p>Returning stolen property is not as bad at theft. At all.</p>

<p>Its especially suspect that no one complained about land redistribution when it happened in Japan, South Korea, Ireland and Taiwan. </p>

<p>Yes, ladies and gentleman the lunatics are in charge of the asylum.

That is not to say that it is horrible for the people involved, but so are the genocides happening in Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen, CAR. For example, tens of thousands of Rohingya have been killed, an estimated seven hundred thousand has driven from their homes. But this particular atrocity needs to take precedence, why? </p>

<p>&quot;South Africa&#39;s total population is around 50 million, of which indigenous groups are estimated to comprise approximately 1%.&quot;
<a href="https://www.iwgia.org/en/south-africa/722-indigenous-peoples-in-south-africa">https://www.iwgia.org/en/south-africa/722-indigenous-peoples-in-south-africa</a></p>

<p>South Africa couldn&#39;t hold a large population prior to white farmers arriving.  That increased available food beyond what was growing naturally and the population grew to what it is now.  </p>

<p>Zimbabwe in the north tried taking white farm landing (often killing the farmers) and shortly had famines.</p>

<p>I disagree with that statement. See how that works? I think white people in SA have been abhorrant pieces of shit for decades. They instituted a system of racial segregation similar to Jim Crow laws in the US. Now, the blacks have wrested power back from whitey and they&#39;re pissed. OMFG! WHITE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER! ALERT! ALERT!</p>

<p>You know what? Good. Fuck those racist pieces of shit, they reap what they sow. Why should they get a pass just to avoid repeating history? Doesn&#39;t matter what the outcome is, doesn&#39;t matter what became of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, and it doesn&#39;t matter what you or I think. This is their retribution for decades of abuse at the hands of white people, and they are a sovereign nation that can decide their own policy. (which is why systemic racism existed there in the first place)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone who is acting like this is a completely black and white issue should read up a bit about South Africa. Image a similar scenario in the US. Say Mexico succesfully invaded the US, barred Americans from owning all but a small part of the land and migrated their own citizens to fill out the rest. Imagine if the outcome of this was that Mexicans, while making up 8% of the population owned 72% of the total land area in the US. Would you be as opposed to land redistributions then? </p>

<p>That being said, I am still mostly against the land seizures, and especially combined with the violent rhetoric that has been used. However, I think it would do well if people could take a step back and actually examine the situation.</p>

<p>Black people were restricted from owning land during apartheid but most of the land contested was owned by whites before apartheid (Basically when the land was conquered) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the morality of all this is, it is a form of justice and actually a way to address the past inequalities to now take land away from white people who oppressed black people for a long period of time.<br/>
But I do think if you want to step back and examine the situation, then examine properly and don&#39;t just shout &quot;apartheid!&quot;
Fact is that the people taking the land back actually conquered, killed and enslaved land owners before them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually happened in America though. Red Indians were there first! Basically people came from across the ocean and took all their land. Should Red Indians not be given all their land back?</p>

<p>The same happened in South Africa. Some major wars were fought and land taken from the colonial settlers to farm. Also in the case of someone I know of, the Zulu King gifted a huge stretch of land to white farmers in return for their doctors saving his life.
Either way, American whites should lose their land in a proper comparison.</p>

<p>Also one thing to note, the Zulus etc weren&#39;t the first group in South Africa. They were a conquering kingdom and took over a large section of the country by force before the white people came! Are we going to go that far with land claims? The only group that actually were here before everyone migrated and conquered were the San people and trust me they ain&#39;t benefiting at all from this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is more complex than that because of the creation of bantulands which were lands put aside for various tribal groups. It gets more complicated because the ANC actually forced these autonomous territories to integrate into the rest of South Africa. Often the Bantulands <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisho_massacre">fought against joining the union</a> but in the end conceded defeat. </p>

<p>Also remember that most White South africans are not the descendent of conquerors but just farmers who moved in search of a better life. Similar to the Americas, sure some people are descended from those who fought the natives Americans but most are the descendants of those fleeing poverty and persecution.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an un-nuanced view of the situation. The current &quot;owners&quot; benefit tremendously from the bad actions of their predecessors. They have done nothing to earn that benefit.</p>

<p>Similarly, the current descendants of the dispossessed suffer greatly from the bad acts suffered by their predecessors. They did nothing to deserve that suffering.</p>

<p>Therefore, whatever unearned benefit current &quot;owners&quot; possess should be transferred back to the descendants of the original victims.</p>

<p>TL;DR: If you can inherit the benefit, you should also inherit the liability, and make good on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>journalistic integrity is like the hippocratic oath. MSM platforms have higher moral obligations to present the facts objectively than youtubers. Unfortunately the reality is that youtubers are the only ones trying to be objective.</p>

<p>I think MSM should be forced to pay high fincancial penalties for publishing fake news. the pricess for filing claims and receiving compensation should be made quick and efficient.</p>

<p>there needs to be standards for what is called news. This is an extremely reasonable request. 
when calling themselves officially news, there should be high standards, for everyone else, anything goes</p>

That is not to say that it is horrible for the people involved, but so are the genocides happening in Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen, CAR. For example, tens of thousands of Rohingya have been killed, an estimated seven hundred thousand has driven from their homes. But this particular atrocity needs to take precedence, why? </p>

<p>Finally, you could go down a certain rabbit hole regarding the Amalekites and their modern-day descendants. Of the 613 mitzvot (commandments) followed by Orthodox Jews, three refer to the Amalek: to remember what the Amalekites did to the Israelites, not to forget what the Amalekites did to Israelites, and to destroy the Amalekites utterly. The rabbis derived these from Deuteronomy 25:17–18, Exodus 17:14 and 1 Samuel 15:3. Rashi explains the third commandment:</p>

<p>From man unto woman, from infant unto suckling, from ox unto sheep, so that the name of Amalek not be mentioned even with reference to an animal by saying &quot;This animal belonged to Amalek&quot;.</p>
