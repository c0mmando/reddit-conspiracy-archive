<p>You may remember this story</p>

<p>Former Trump Campaign Official charged with rape and human trafficking charges could face more than 100 years in prison</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/yPsyadI.png">https://imgur.com/yPsyadI.png</a></p>

<p>Has recently had more charges added</p>

<p>These are obviously worrying developments, another recent news item from Kentucky caught my eye -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kentucky State Rep. Dan Johnson dies of self-inflicted gunshot wound in Mt. Washington</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/37062873/rep-dan-johnson-commits-suicide-on-bridge-in-mt-washington">http://www.wdrb.com/story/37062873/rep-dan-johnson-commits-suicide-on-bridge-in-mt-washington</a></p>

<p>This guy had just been exposed by local news for some disturbing behaviour including inducing minors to drink, sexual assault on a minor, multiple lies about his history and involvement in 9/11.</p>

<p>Some info on his background :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting has, in a thoroughly reported account, revealed much more about Johnson, who calls himself “bishop” and “pope” in his role of the presiding minister at the Heart of Fire Church.</p>

<p>Now 21, Maranda Richmond says she attended Johnson’s church and was a friend of his daughter. After a wild, boozy New Year’s Eve party — <strong>heavy drinking parties including juveniles appear to be a regular part of the “worship” at Heart of Fire</strong> — she stayed over with Johnson’s daughter <strong>only to wake up in the wee hours with Johnson kneeling over her. She says he kissed her, fondled her, forced his hands under her pants and penetrated her with his finger.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abuse allegations </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Danielle Elmore, now in her mid-20s, <strong>was underage when she attended some of these parties.</strong> She considered herself a regular at the church and the bar.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s times when it got crazy,” Elmore said. She recalls feeling uncomfortable when a boozy <strong>Johnson would sometimes kiss her and other young women on the lips.</strong></p>

<p>Elmore knew something wasn’t right. But she didn’t know that the liquor and partying would serve as a backdrop to something much more serious: alleged molestation in Pope’s House.</p>

<p>Often, weekends meant parties at the Pope’s House. Sometimes there’d be concerts. Other times just booze and camaraderie. <strong>Some of the antics — the scantily clad women, the dancing on the bar, the body shots, the costumes — have been documented in pictures posted to Johnson’s Facebook page.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two incidents occurred roughly around two large cities, Cincinnati and Louisville, two cities close to each other and with good transport links.</p>

<p>I suspect there is a larger ring operating in this area, possibly within local government channels.</p>

<p>I&#39;m posting this to try and gain some help looking for connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! Totally untrue! I&#39;m balls deep in pedo research right now. Feel free to HMU if you have info or want to share info!</p>

<p>OP: if you think there&#39;s a trafficking ring, I&#39;ll tell you that there are usually &#39;accuser advocate&#39; firms staffed by unscrupulous PIs and attorneys, that exist to help cover up allegations, should a victim or collateral family member somehow go public. They don&#39;t usually really have an easily-found internet presence, but if you can dig deeper (contact the victims) and find out all the people that are around them, that have contacted them (often pro-bono, or under the guise of help), are often involved in damage control for larger groups (if this guy is connected to a larger ring....which is definitely possible, since he&#39;s involved in politics.)</p>

<p>Another avenue to look into is the Church he was involved with. Often times rings have a connection to a church for different reasons....providing moral cover, procuring children, money laundering, etc. If this dude was a member of this church and was involved in a ring, there&#39;s a good chance other members of the church were at least complicit as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to have other people to share info with, if anyone else is on this quest.</p>

<p>The pizzagate form on Voat would also probably be a good place for this information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks I forgot how I originally found it I think I may have read it on voat during the early days of pizzagate before it got so politically charged. And when I tried to find it again I couldn&#39;t and I took a ton of digging to find it but once I did I made sure to save it so I could post the harrowing nature of child trafficking because it paints the picture in real terms that&#39;s sometimes not stated or mentioned when these things come up. It truly shows the depravity of the issue. If you try googling it it&#39;s almost impossible to find so I commend the original person who brought it to my attention. It&#39;s pretty horrific and real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just government. Look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/81dpoz/vote_on_bill_to_outlaw_child_marriage_in_kentucky/">this</a> post from earlier and you&#39;ll see whole american culture is riled with it. Especially look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/81dpoz/vote_on_bill_to_outlaw_child_marriage_in_kentucky/dv2rucq/">this</a> comment. Some subreddits often times make jokes on muslims and how they marry young girls, but parts of america are exactly the same. Americans, of every side, are sick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP: if you think there&#39;s a trafficking ring, I&#39;ll tell you that there are usually &#39;accuser advocate&#39; firms staffed by unscrupulous PIs and attorneys, that exist to help cover up allegations, should a victim or collateral family member somehow go public. They don&#39;t usually really have an easily-found internet presence, but if you can dig deeper (contact the victims) and find out all the people that are around them, that have contacted them (often pro-bono, or under the guise of help), are often involved in damage control for larger groups (if this guy is connected to a larger ring....which is definitely possible, since he&#39;s involved in politics.). If you can find one of these firms fingerprints on this thing, there&#39;s a good chance it connects to something larger.</p>

<p>Another avenue to look into is the Church he was involved with. Often times rings have a connection to a church for different reasons....providing moral cover, procuring children, money laundering, etc. If this dude was a member of this church and was involved in a ring, there&#39;s a good chance other members of the church were at least complicit as well.</p>
