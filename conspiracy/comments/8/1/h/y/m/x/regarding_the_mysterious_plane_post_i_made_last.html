<p>I&#39;m quite surprised by some of the reactions I&#39;ve gotten from it honestly.</p>

<p>I noticed something out of the ordinary happening, I gave a heads up to create awareness..(what we do on this sub)</p>

<p>I was hoping someone would be able to document it on one of the flight radar apps. (such as FlightAware)</p>

<p>I have zero experience with those apps...and it never occurred to me at the time I made the post that it would not show up on one of these applications.</p>

<p>The fact that it didn&#39;t makes me glad I did say something when I look at it in hindsight.</p>

<p>I may never get an explanation for why the plane was flying that pattern. </p>

<p>My questions about this whole thing comes down to this -</p>

<p>When did attempting to crowd source an event to learn more about what might be happening become a bad thing?</p>

<p>When did attempting to keep people on this sub informed of a possible situation evolving become an act of risk regarding mockery?</p>

<p>The fact that I wasn&#39;t able to produce video/pictures of it seems to be the largest point of contention. I can understand that, I&#39;ve been guilty of asking for pictures or video of an event myself...very recently as a matter of fact. </p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t mock the OP...and I did not insinuate that their motive was less than honorable.</p>

<p>I can assure the users on this sub that my intentions were honest and good when I made the post. I had every reason to believe more information would be forthcoming regarding the event because of how unusual it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the comments weren&#39;t mocking you, but supportive. It&#39;s good you posted that even if you didn&#39;t have documentation. Sometimes people don&#39;t have proof. If someone is easily able to provide proof but doesn&#39;t, that is reason to be skeptical of a shitpost. Some people did mock you but that is to be expected on the internet.

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose you&#39;re right in that I&#39;m taking it too personally. But it concerns me that in the future I will decide not to.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact...it&#39;s already happened..had helicopters flying all over the neighborhood today..police cars blocking intersections...turns out an armed and dangerous suspect was on the loose after a shootout with law-enforcement.</p>

<p>I could have easily posted video of it...but didn&#39;t for fear of having my location doxxed...sad state of affairs.</p>

<p>They were really low...believe me. Police copter was easily under 300 feet...news copters maybe 500 tops.</p>

I could be wrong...but honestly if that were the case then radar isn&#39;t worth a shit...because this plane managed to do an oval around the Phoenix Cardinals Stadium without being detected for over 20 minutes.

<p>I don&#39;t usually get those types of comments on my posts. Of course..I very rarely post about unusual planes or objects in the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this helps any, according to a corrido &quot;La Pista Enterrada&quot;, there is an underground landing strip somewhere in Phoenix where narcos do their smuggling. Idk how big a plane has to be to carry 500 kilos of drugs, but that&#39;s the size of load they mention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting...</p>

<p>I think this plane was way to obvious to be something like that tho..I&#39;m serious War...it was flying that pattern for over 20 minutes...anybody and everybody that looked up would have seen it and noticed it was unusual..</p>

<p>I was actually hoping to see something on the news today about it.</p>

<p>This was the only one I could capture via iPhone, but the sky was filled with them. I could see about 7 planes all zigging and zagging making almost perfectly spaced chem trails in for about 10 miles over the city. I thought “hmm, I guess this plane is heading back to the airport” except I noticed a few other planes also changed their course, sometimes multiple changes in flight path in less than a mile. Why would so many planes change course mid flight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with posting on a topic you clearly know fuck-all about is that you open yourself up to mockery. Just a couple of little hints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Read up on aircraft holding patterns (racetrack patterns) and the reasons a pilot may need to enter one.</p></li>
<li><p>Those apps you&#39;re talking about, despite their names are not radar apps. They receive something called ADS-B signals. Now go look that up and educate yourself on ADS-B workings. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This way next time you won&#39;t conjure up such a bullshit story.</p>
