      <p>
       I'm quite surprised by some of the reactions I've gotten from it honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed something out of the ordinary happening, I gave a heads up to create awareness..(what we do on this sub)
      </p>
      <p>
       I was hoping someone would be able to document it on one of the flight radar apps. (such as FlightAware)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have zero experience with those apps...and it never occurred to me at the time I made the post that it would not show up on one of these applications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that it didn't makes me glad I did say something when I look at it in hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may never get an explanation for why the plane was flying that pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       My questions about this whole thing comes down to this -
      </p>
      <p>
       When did attempting to crowd source an event to learn more about what might be happening become a bad thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       When did attempting to keep people on this sub informed of a possible situation evolving become an act of risk regarding mockery?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that I wasn't able to produce video/pictures of it seems to be the largest point of contention. I can understand that, I've been guilty of asking for pictures or video of an event myself...very recently as a matter of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I didn't mock the OP...and I did not insinuate that their motive was less than honorable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can assure the users on this sub that my intentions were honest and good when I made the post. I had every reason to believe more information would be forthcoming regarding the event because of how unusual it was.

       Most of the comments weren't mocking you, but supportive. It's good you posted that even if you didn't have documentation. Sometimes people don't have proof. If someone is easily able to provide proof but doesn't, that is reason to be skeptical of a shitpost. Some people did mock you but that is to be expected on the internet. I wouldn't take it so personally.

       I suppose you're right in that I'm taking it too personally. But it concerns me that in the future I will decide not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a matter of fact...it's already happened..had helicopters flying all over the neighborhood today..police cars blocking intersections...turns out an armed and dangerous suspect was on the loose after a shootout with law-enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could have easily posted video of it...but didn't for fear of having my location doxxed...sad state of affairs.

       Judging from some knowledgeable comments about the mysterious plane it's possible that the helicopters were too low to be seen by radar..
      </p>
      <p>
       They were really low...believe me. Police copter was easily under 300 feet...news copters maybe 500 tops.

       I don't know. It's altitude seemed high enough if you ask me. I could be wrong...but honestly if that were the case then radar isn't worth a shit...because this plane managed to do an oval around the Phoenix Cardinals Stadium without being detected for over 20 minutes. Think about that.

       I read your post last night, but didn't comment on it. I perfectly understand why you posted. You saw something odd/out of the ordinary. Of course, you were concerned! I would have been too!

       I don't usually get those types of comments on my posts. Of course..I very rarely post about unusual planes or objects in the sky.

       The last time I did was the SpaceX launch that caused such a brouhaha in Arizona and California...I gave a heads up Post..and then deleted it as soon as someone explained it was SpaceX.

       If this helps any, according to a corrido "La Pista Enterrada", there is an underground landing strip somewhere in Phoenix where narcos do their smuggling. Idk how big a plane has to be to carry 500 kilos of drugs, but that's the size of load they mention.

       According to the song the air traffic controllers are in their range.

       Interesting...

      <p>
       I think this plane was way to obvious to be something like that tho..I'm serious War...it was flying that pattern for over 20 minutes...anybody and everybody that looked up would have seen it and noticed it was unusual..
      </p>

       I was actually hoping to see something on the news today about it.

       I'd believe drones or even Chinese lanterns, but not glowing seagulls lol. Then we had a comet the next day right after.

       If you do, check out the Bradshaw Ranch. It's a more legit version of the Skinwalker Ranch. Almost impossible to get to. And if you manage to get there, you'll quickly see that the stories about the government forcing the owner to sell it, making it now property of the federal government, are true.

       It does say "high powered mafias have accounts with millions of dollars. We know money can move MOUNTAINS why couldn't they make a tunnel with an underground air strip"
      </p>
      <p>
       Could "move mountains" mean pay off people at the mountain base to play the other side? I think it could.

       It's become a hostile playground these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first glance people automatically assume whatever it is, its a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people have a chip on their shoulders because they have grown accustom to being on the defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And an ulterior motive is always suspected.

       That's what happens when your go to place for sharing information and discussions is turned into a battlefield. An all out war has been happening here for a good long while now, all to see who gets to control the narrative.

       This was the only one I could capture via iPhone, but the sky was filled with them. I could see about 7 planes all zigging and zagging making almost perfectly spaced chem trails in for about 10 miles over the city. I thought “hmm, I guess this plane is heading back to the airport” except I noticed a few other planes also changed their course, sometimes multiple changes in flight path in less than a mile. Why would so many planes change course mid flight?

       Of the 2 to 7 thousand people/bots who are here on any given day, probably half of them are here just to irritate you if you have any legitimate concern or observation. It's tough to weed through the shit to find other thinking people and not to take the asshole commenters personally.

       The problem with posting on a topic you clearly know fuck-all about is that you open yourself up to mockery. Just a couple of little hints:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Read up on aircraft holding patterns (racetrack patterns) and the reasons a pilot may need to enter one.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Those apps you're talking about, despite their names are not radar apps. They receive something called ADS-B signals. Now go look that up and educate yourself on ADS-B workings.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This way next time you won't conjure up such a bullshit story.
