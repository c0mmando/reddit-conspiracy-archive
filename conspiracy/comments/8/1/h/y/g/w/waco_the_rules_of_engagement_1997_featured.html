       My mother had it on VHS, and when she passed away it was one of the few tapes I kept, I thought the powers that be will totally suppress this. Now it's on Netflix, lol.

       Have you heard the theory that Waco was a hoax wherein nobody died or got hurt?

       A guy called Dave J used to have a YouTube channel with videos on this exact topic.

       After watching the recent Waco mini series I started checking out all the conspiracies surrounding the siege and I learned stuff I'd never heard about before. Like the involvement of Delta Force, tanks pushing evidence into the fire and purposely knocking debris on top of the bunker hatch so people couldn't escape, all four dead ATF agents were former Clinton bodyguards, etc.

       He said what he learned. The story of Waco. If you suspect that story is incorrect, fine, but he answered the question. He isn't obligated to respond in detail to anyone who wants to aggressively quiz him on it. Find someone else to school.

       Lol. I'm not saying the story is correct or incorrect. You are full of assumptions aren't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, just saying I learned something and then assuming it is the same as what everyone else learned is laughably stupid. I don't even know what he knows about Waco. The official story? People's opinions from around the area? There are many different possibilities. He never said what he thought though. That's kinda my point.

       That's exactly what you're doing though and why I chimed in. Dude makes an innocent post describing how when he was a kid, all he knew about Waco was a bacronym people made from it, and you want to get confrontational probing for what he knows now. It's stupid and out of place.

       Former FBI Special Agent in Charge Ted Gunderson said several of the ATF agents killed @ the Davidian compound suffered head wounds from an elevated position. Which, he said, must have been a helo-based sniper. And, he said, the dead agents were all former members of POTUS Clinton’s security detail.

       Even the MSM has come around to realize Waco was a massive fuckup/tragedy regardless of the actions of the B/D's. The new mini-series is incredible and the lead's appearance on the Daily Show was far from pro-LE.

       Just watched the Documentary and damn. I had seen and heard bits and pieces of WACO, as I grew up in the 90's. But after seeing it all together in the documentary had me baffled as to how its not more well known.

       Are there more like this that I may have missed? Just seeing the tanks spinning and everyone toying about was really upsetting.

       Early that morning my brother and I sat looking at the news. They showed a video of a tank-like military vehicle smashing into the house and creating a giant fire ball. The brother said "am I seeing what I think I'm seeing"?
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day I have not seen that video again. Was on April 19. I'll never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now I cannot figure out why the US government wanted to destroy those people. Maybe they had a kooky religion. Is a kooky religion reason enough to murder that many people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their "prophet", David Koresh, had invited the BATF to come inspect their inventory of firearms and ammunition which they LEGALLY marketed. Just two weeks prior, the County Sheriff visited the facility and verified inventory and invoices. He found all to be in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twenty years later, I am still confused. I cannot understand why "our" government would make an all-out military assault on a (goofy) church.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Koresh was known to frequent the Golden Corral in Waco on certain days. A Boy Scout troop could have arrested him at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Our" government wanted him and his followers dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       My initial intuition is that the government wanted to make an example out of people leading a lifestyle on subject to mainstream control and prediction, to limit the tendency of this kind of cultural variation to get out of hand, from the perspective of people desiring to control a large populace with relatively simple central mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't really fit, however. I don't think the incentives work quite like that for people considering fringe lifestyles, for one. And I don't think the benefit to the government, in terms of increased control of any sort normative or otherwise, was especially large.
      </p>
      <p>
       I basically don't know what to make of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will sound outlandish and insane, but one guess -- just throwing something out there -- is that it was some variety of occult blood sacrifice given the large number dead, as for all I know it could have aligned with "lay lines" and a certain date to work out well for occultists or Masons. Perhaps some such had power in the government, and/or criminal-type connections to the Clintons (who seem to have had connections with organized crime since their Arkansas days, given that state's use for the black market drug trade).

       Now that's a conspiracy theory! Never thought of that possibility before and admittedly, this is truly an outlandish ideal, but that's what this subreddit is for, isn't it?

       Went to a lecture about ten years ago from an author who interviewed and wrote a book on Timothy McVeigh.  I never hear people talk about the fact that McVeigh was one of the tank drivers during the end of the siege

       Wow!
      </p>
      <p>
       What really sold me was the thermal imaging analysis. The claim that it was just sunlight reflecting off of certain surfaces was almost absurd. This could be referred to as the "smoking gun" that the FBI or some Government entity engaged in gunfire post ATF control, despite the FBI claiming there was "not one shot" fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, based on the testimonies during the hearing, it appeared as though certain individuals on the committee held heavy bias towards a particular group, almost as if to protect them/control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm curious about is who gave the order for the tank operators to basically destroy, errrr breach, the compound itself. Also, have those tank operators ever come forward and shared their stories?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also surprised when I heard that the fire department wasn't allowed to approach and engage the blaze because TPTB didn't want them "taking fire". What a load of shit that was.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there one thing that can be taken away from all of this, IMO, is that it exposes not only our appointed representatives, but also the Feds who handled the situation, as being quite incompetent with regards to their respective duties.

       I watched this documentary years ago wanting to learn more about Waco after I heard of David Koresh through looking at lyrics to 1969 by Boards of Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FLIR imaging was pretty damning in my opinion. I watched an alternate and more recent documentary that also looked more in depth at the FLIR imaging and refuted the government claim that it was sunlight reflection. They basically found that for sunlight to reflect at that interval, the recording helicopter would have to have been traveling at like mach 2 or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hate this situation and part of me always wants to watch a new documentary about it just because I’m hoping there will be some happy ending but the ending is always terrible.

       Haunting, tragic and terrible indictment of the federal government and law enforcement agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the conspiracy vein, do you think it's possible that the govt. (Hillary / Bill, someone else?) was worried he actually
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       or could be a prophet? We know they dabble in the occult. The whole death by fire on 4/19 adds to this for me - blood sacrifice. Then there's rumors of the FBI calling in actual satanists. I just don't see how any LE or Federal people let it escalate to the point it did. Why did they even want Koresh to begin with? You don't roll up with cattle trucks and helicopters (and later tanks and FLIR planes) for a couple illegal guns. He and his group were practically nobody and from what I can tell there was absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing of any kind when the ATF showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I think this has to be blood on the Clinton's hands. Look at some of the key players here. Janet Reno, Web Hubbell, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, etc. These are the same people that have carried (and in some cases STILL carry) water for the Clintons. I know Ted Gunderson had a theory, though never any real proof, that it was an excuse to off some Clinton security detail guys that "knew stuff". I wouldn't put it past them, but it would seem like there would be other ways to achieve that goal without killing a bunch of women and kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were the underage abuse accusations pre or postmortem? It would seem a convenient accusation of justification to make afterwards, obviously, but I gotta tell you: almost everything I've read and seen about Koresh doesn't paint a picture of a guy who abuses / molests kids. Different theology? Yes. Multiple wives? Yes, but it would seem to be explained by their beliefs and done in a consensual and respectful way. That said, the accusations of the girl who survived are alarming, but who is she? Koresh's lawyer doubted the accusations. The Sherrif doubted the accusations. It would seem that painting Koresh as the bad guy sort of revolved around these accusations. We know the Clintons like to project. Was this a projection or was he really a kiddie diddler? My perception of him and his character sort of hinge on the veracity of this claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who authorized the raid? Someone at or near the top had to authorize the raid, the use of those National Guard helicopters, all of the advanced weaponry and the goddamn TANKS. Was anyone ever punished for this stuff? I had to choke a bit when Biden or whoever said in the documentary that these guys were murderers and deserved to be brought to justice by any means necessary. They weren't murders. The ATF were the murderers. They showed up decked in assault gear, locked, loaded and ready to kill. Koresh's people didn't want to hurt anybody, and that's fairly obvious from the documentary. Was NO ONE held accountable for this? I don't see how Reno got away with saying the things she said when they were clearly untrue. Ditto the FBI commander who said they never fired a shot when there had to have existed ballistic evidence in addition to the FLIR proof which is pretty indisputable. Did the survivors sue?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, I have a million other questions and could go on, but I can't help but feeling this was one of the biggest, if not the biggest (outside of 9/11), travesties of federal law enforcement in modern history. They practically murdered 80 people for what? Because the ATF showed up unannounced for an armed raid on a church and were met with resistance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we talk about the language of propaganda a bit. Sorry I know I'm all over the place, but I couldn't help but notice LE's use of certain militarizing buzzwords. The Mt. Carmel Church became the Davidian's "Compound". Koresh's bedroom became his "living quarters". The cafeteria became "the bunker". Even Koresh, who detested the term, became a "cult leader" and his followers a "cult". When used by the media, they became lexicon for talking about the event and no doubt colored people's perceptions of the events. It almost makes me sick. Ditto when the FBI guys were saying that all the gunfire was coming from the Davidians and that they were shooting at each other and in fact it was "probably" one of Koresh's own followers who killed him. Does anyone, even the guy saying it, believe this shit? No accounts from the tapes recovered or the survivors claim this stuff. No evidence supports it. Evidence supports FBI and ATF shooting into a tear-gassed, blazing fire where women and children were trapped. How can this happen in America?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, that's all I got for now. I have to say I cried several times during this doc and it was extremely hard to think about anything else for a couple of days. I can't believe it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR; I sympathize with Koresh and his followers and feel the ATF, FBI and Clinton Admin had ulterior motives and unjustly faced ZERO consequences for one of the biggest LE fuckups in modern history. RIP.

       Feds barricaded a church for two months, eventually burned it down with women and children inside, blamed it all on the church.  Much more to the story but that's the nutshell.
