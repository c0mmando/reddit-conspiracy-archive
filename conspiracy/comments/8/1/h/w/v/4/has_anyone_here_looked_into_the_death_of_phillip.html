He was an ex pilot for the CIA and write many books in the conspiracy of 9/11. The media stated it as an apparent murder-suicide, but the details of it are very sketchy and many people who knew him know he was not this kind of man. Just wondering if anyone here has read of this case and what you guys think of it? </p>

<p>I think he was the one who said the 9/11 pilots would have had needed actual physical training in a jet and they could&#39;ve been trained in a US desert some where.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. If the official story is that Marshall shot them both, why didn’t they try and run? Maybe he shot the first one unexpectedly but the other one would have at least tried to run. There’s no indication they were shot elsewhere and placed on the couch.</p>

<p>I think that whoever came in the side door made Marshall Watch as they shot his kids in front of him before killing him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have only investigated his last 9/11 book, The Big Bamboozle.</p>

<p><a href="http://endofinnocence.com/big-bamboozle-philip-marshall-controlled-opposition-murder-suicide/">In The Big Bamboozle, he not only carefully avoided any hint that a third tower fell on 9/11, but he even denigrated those who talked about how the towers fell.</a></p>

<p>Why would he suppress the single most compelling, self-evident and easily accessible proof that the official story can&#39;t be true?</p>
