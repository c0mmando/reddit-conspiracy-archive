       He and his two kids (who I knew fairly well) and pet dog were found dead in their house my county in 2013. He was an ex pilot for the CIA and write many books in the conspiracy of 9/11. The media stated it as an apparent murder-suicide, but the details of it are very sketchy and many people who knew him know he was not this kind of man. Just wondering if anyone here has read of this case and what you guys think of it?

       Is that the guy who was shot more to the back of head and the weapon might have silenced?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he was the one who said the 9/11 pilots would have had needed actual physical training in a jet and they could've been trained in a US desert some where.

       He was shot from the left side of the head even though he was right handed. Gun was found under him. Neighbors heard no gunshots and it’s in a community. Kids were asleep on opposite ends of the couch but somehow neither heard the gunshot and was alerted.

       By that I meant neither kid heard the other one being shot. If they claim it was murder suicide, one of the kids would have heard the first shot

       Right. If the official story is that Marshall shot them both, why didn’t they try and run? Maybe he shot the first one unexpectedly but the other one would have at least tried to run. There’s no indication they were shot elsewhere and placed on the couch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that whoever came in the side door made Marshall Watch as they shot his kids in front of him before killing him.

       Marshall is a sad story. I own his books (some edited after his death) and even the reviewers believe he was murdered. There are old interviews of him on Coast to Coast still on youtube and I found him to be a level headed guy.

       I have only investigated his last 9/11 book, The Big Bamboozle.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/big-bamboozle-philip-marshall-controlled-opposition-murder-suicide/">
        In The Big Bamboozle, he not only carefully avoided any hint that a third tower fell on 9/11, but he even denigrated those who talked about how the towers fell.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would he suppress the single most compelling, self-evident and easily accessible proof that the official story can't be true?
