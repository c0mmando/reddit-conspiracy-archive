<p>&quot;Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary â€˜attack the messengerâ€™ ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as â€˜kooksâ€™, â€˜right-wingâ€™, â€˜liberalâ€™, â€˜left-wingâ€™, â€˜terroristsâ€™, â€˜conspiracy buffsâ€™, â€˜radicalsâ€™, â€˜militiaâ€™, â€˜racistsâ€™, â€˜religious fanaticsâ€™, â€˜sexual deviatesâ€™, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a comment I replied to where I said that the person I was replying to was being disengenuous by painting problems as 100% conservative borne. I had assumed in a conspiracy sub a lot more people would be inclined to believe that the two party system is fake, and a way of pushing and pulling on issues to make people think that &quot;their&quot; side is fighting for them, meanwhile deep state goals are always moving forward:</p>

Your projection is really telling. I&#39;m not going to put much effort into this response because I have no reason to believe you&#39;re looking for an honest discussion. Don&#39;t worry, you can say whatever false and misleading things to and about me that you want, most likely I won&#39;t bother to respond to you.</p>

<p>[â€“]varemia 2 points 21 hours ago 
He&#39;s saying it isn&#39;t a one sided issue, so projection makes zero sense. We have emails of Democrats taking cues from big pharma from those massive leaks everyone keeps forgetting.</p>

<p>Both left and right politicians are bought and sold by the massive pharma lobby. They&#39;re at the top of every donor list.</p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is how your comment almost seems cookie-cutter, in that it doesn&#39;t address any specifics, and seems to be automatic in nature.</p>
