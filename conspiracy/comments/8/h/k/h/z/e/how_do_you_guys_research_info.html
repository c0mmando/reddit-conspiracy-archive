       Perhaps this isn’t the next question, but it is important - at least to me. How exactly do you guys find info given that there’s so much info/mis info/dis info out there? I mean any particular subject can take you down so many different paths, so how exactly do you narrow it down?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sorry if the question is crap, but I finally have a little time to do research and would like some direction from the pros.

       So you find one thing and then read others yet you find a connection to the original point?

       This is usually what I do with my research for school but it’s a whole different ball game when it comes to conspiracies because there are sooo many different view points on everything.

       A good base in history, logic, and deduction will help you here. Look into the Trivium. Really it's the only way. Read/entertain all, read in between the lines, cross reference, look into the author(s), and then come to your own conclusion(s). That's really all we have.

       So, what you need to do (if you haven't yet), imo, is look into the "Alternative" view of it all. Dive head first. What does non MS historians/researchers propose/present?
      </p>
      <p>
       Choose one topic that truly fascinates and interests you. I have one (truth about ancient civilizations and human origins), now find yours, and focus on it. It will help.

       you've been taught was a lie, but, much of it was (as it was for me and others, as well).

       Aye, it's a break up, really. Look into the 7 stages of grief. From what you said, you are at #3 (we've all been there - mind was particular rough, tbh).

       I love that break up analogy - it’s so fitting. I was in denial for such a long time but I’m so grateful my bf kept badgering me and forcing me to question and uncover my cognitive dissonance. If it weren’t for him, I would’ve never woken up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually disconnected from my studies significantly this semester because I think it’s pure indoctrination and it’s become so apparent for me that I’m just done. I can’t believe I bought into everything so gullibly and never questioned. It’s ridiculous and I wish I could take it all back. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll finish but the degree is worthless to me. And this is coming from an absolute bookworm/nerd. I loved school and learning but I’ve come to realize that these are increasingly mutually exclusive concepts. And I’m so indebted with student loans it makes me all the more angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the vent, but I just feel so lost. I wish I could restart my whole life sometimes because I feel robbed.

       Yeah, agree. You do it when it’s formal, you should here too. Read everything, cross reference, eventually the bullshit filters out. Viewpoints are awesome but not always grounded in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a bit of common sense and wisdom help too. I been around the block a bit, lots of miles under my belt. This is a 6th sense you can only get with time and experience, it cannot be learned from book or Reddit. 6th sense is like a bullshit magnet that you use along with cross referencing.

      <p>
       Do you remember what your first conspiracy rabbit hole was? I’m just curious because I have the tendency of being gullible and sometimes again, like I was taught in school, college, and my current graduate program, I can believe things without credible proof.

       Really, I want conspiracy stuff to mostly be true. Reptilians, flat earth, UFO’s, aliens, shape shifters, that would be so cool!
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast and furious was a legit thing, sorta covered up but, I don’t think of it as a conspiracy theory so much as it was just a stupid operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biggest legit conspiracy I think I’ve seen isn’t super exciting... it’s Marijuana. Marijuana was systematically and knowingly misrepresented to make / keep it illegal. Groups of people motivated with agendas collaborating to put out false information about marijuana so that they could benefit. Government officials knowingly provided junk data to justify war on drugs. Big pharm helped keep it schedule 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s a conspiracy.

       What do you think about Icke? I don’t think I’ve seen people talk about him - but then again, I haven’t been here long. I’m genuinely curious because I was listening to several of his videos and I just don’t know what to make of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re right, it wasn’t that sexy, I was expecting something more exciting haha. But this isn’t strictly limited to just pot right? If  not mistaken this was a similar approach to LSD. It was being used successfully to help with PTSD and other traumatic mental illnesses and then big pharma and the government shut the whole thing down and now people are petrified of it.

       Here's a good few places to start. Establishing the Reality of high level abuse is essential before diving into Pgate itself. Dutroux, Franklin, and much, much more show that this already happens. Pgate, and a deeper understanding (that isn't dictated by the MSM) are possible once you realize this.

       The number of assumptions that must be leaped to assume that EVEN IF/THOUGH abuse happens, Pizzagate must be real continues to stagger me, personally. And none of these links actually 'prove' Pizzagate at all.

       So what do you think about all the weird pizza references to the Wiki emails and knowing that the FBI has publicly stated that pedos use pizza related terminology as a cover? Especially, the email related to the Luzzato (sp) kids being in a hot tub for entertainment? I mean, that’s... strange?

       I mean don't assume the majority of people here are good at reasoning. The core people are pretty good because they are good at reasoning while entertaining all thoughts and ideas. Without both you have nothing. In other Words if you are only using reasoning but are stifling input then you are reasoning within the confines of your comfort level and you won't find truth that way.

       Ok so how exactly do you think outside the box? I mean, I’ve basically never been taught to think critically outside of what I’m told so now I’m starting to learn so many different things but my “box” is still limited because public education did me so wrong.

       My advice, find a article that does not make sense.. mark it down and notate it. Then research other articles that are from other agencies and then look for their sources. After link together puzzle pieces by quotes, videos, and other forms. Eventually you will have something to put together. Something that is recent.. Syria. Start solving that puzzle on how we bombed a country without evidence to ignoring it ever happened. Enjoy!

       Haha that place is awesome. I have no idea how people can be so talented at finding info. For example, ReallyGraceful, Truthstream Media, the Truth Factory, etc.

       They just seem to have this innate ability to uncover info. I know it’s a muscle that needs to be worked on, so I’m doing my best to deprogram myself.

      <p>
       My method:
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at who owns the info
      </p>
      <p>
       How and and when it’s dispersed
      </p>
      <p>
       Who’s writing it
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at other sources that are sharing the same info and see what’s omitted/common.

       It’s impossible to see everything hidden, with Wikileak dumps, Whistleblowers, MSM working cohesively. Honestly I follow my gut, look at the history of these sick fucks, and never rule anything out.

      <p>
       I personally don’t trust FOX, CNN, MSNBC, or any other big corp that’s paid by TPTB  to push a narrative. The fucked up part is that FOX and CNN do have some truth to their reports but their extremely biased. Trust your gut.

       I believe Goebbles said something to the effect of every piece of propaganda as to have a grain of truth for people to believe it.

      <p>
       The only good thing about FOX is Tucker Carlson, that guy is a refreshing change from the rest of TV.  CNN is just god awful, I mean bad... I have no idea how they still can call themselves the most trusted name in news when they’ve been caught in so many scandals.

       I’ve been seeing loads of docs on them, and it’s fascinating how they brainwashed an entire country. It’s absolutely fascinating! The psychology behind it is remarkable, I really have always been intrigued by things like that.

       Carlson is really awesome, I love that he brings on guests that differ even though they are so insane I want to punch my phone. It’s remarkable how crazy people are...

       I believe they’ve mastered what the late Bill Cooper talks about in his book Behold A Pale Horse Chapter 1. Basically using a method of electronic transistors but applying it to a massive population. I’m too stupid to fully comprehend it but you should give it a read and see what you surmise of it, its dense but intriguing.

       I hope you also feel the same about Ben Swann. Guy is a fucking hero, he’s all over the shit that no one else I’ll touch.

       Yes, he’s the only guy to actually report on Pizzagate. He breaks it down for the layman in his “Reality Check” segment, I suggest watching his short summary of Pizzagate then searching out what he’s explaining for yourself and see what conclusions you reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately he was fired from CBS for his “reality check segments”. Fucking bullshit.

       He was fired?? That’s how you know you are on the right track! It’s becoming increasingly difficult for people with different opinions to stay on giant TV corps. Now you really made me want to look the guy up, anyone else?

       Yes he was first suspended then fired shortly after that. All after PG broke out. He now runs his independent website

       Haha tell me about it, but I had so much fun one night in Charlottesville years ago on a night out with some girls I knew. Hahaha it was hilarious. I never got drunk drunk in my life, I can’t see the appeal. I would get tipsy and stop. Plus, as a girl, it’s so easy for people to take advantage when they see you black out drunk. So these broads all got black out drunk and I ended up nursing several of them in the bathroom when they puked. It was hilarious.

       I don’t have any social media, I just opened reddit a couple months ago. I had FB once in the 10th grade (or around then) and I realized how freaking addictive it was and I shut it down after a month. And I never looked back.

       It’s genuinely leading to a decay of our civilization- and that seems dramatic but it’s not. They are literally programming you on what to think and consume so much of your mind you are a slave to it. No thanks, I can pass.

       I stick to reddit myself and peak into twitter to see what everyday people are saying about certain things by searching keywords. Reddit is comprised as well however, tons of brigading and shilling in this sub specifically and most certainly an overall agenda for the rest of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its most certainly contributing to a decline in the quality of life of our country and civilization as a whole, the fucked up part is that this is just the beginning. The internet has grown into prominence over the last 20-25 years and look at where we are. Imaging extrapolating a century from now? What will it all look like?

       Oh my god, I was somehow banned on the travel subreddit for voicing moderately conservative view points - Jesus. If you saw me in person you would think I was the most innocuous person ever. I’m such a nerdy girl so to get banned is ridiculous - I was so livid for a couple days. I couldn’t believe that they would shut me out without me actually saying hateful stuff. And even if I did say hateful/racist things I shouldn’t be banned, I would just get downvotes into oblivion. I was so mad, you can’t imagine -.-
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I don’t even want to think about a year from now because of all the horrific things I’ve been discovering. I somewhat wish I was still ignorant because life was much simpler haha. I’ve been hearing about FB planning on developing a software that types what you think and I can see millions lining up for that because “typing is so 2018” but completely giving up every modicum of privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way - humans have monetized your DNA. Do you know how ridiculous that is?! What exactly do these companies do with your DNA?! I told my MiL not to do the test and explained to her my opinions and she said “damn you’re right, but I’ll do it anyways” -.-

       Reddit is ultra liberal so I can see how that happened, did you get a snarky remark from some asshole moderator when you asked why you were banned? r/TIL is notorious for banning users and shitting on them for being “loony conspiracy theorists”   It’s crazy that r/travel is doing the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes life was easier to deal with when you’re a drone going about your 8/8/8 day. But once you take a peek behind the curtain it’s impossible to go back, don’t stress though it’ll get easier as you get wiser and can just brush bullshit brigading off, or silly hard headed view points because people don’t want their worlds rocked. My suggestion is to simply provide information and let the people you surround yourself with decide what they believe for themselves. You can’t do anything more than that. Information is everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cringe just thinking of what they are doing hoarding the DNA of countless citizens. Unfortunately, most people have the same sentiments as your mother in law.

       Nooooo I never got a reply! I messaged something along the lines of “well I know social media sites are banning conservatives but I never knew that an innocuous user on reddit would experience it.” I wanted to be a total bitch but I just dropped it. The way I see it, they don’t deserve my viewership - assholes -.-

       You’re absolutely right that it’s best to be knowledgeable than ignorant. Didn’t Peter Parker’s uncle say that with power comes great responsibility? Well it’s the same with knowledge. I’ll tell you a funny story, I know this guy who works for the DoD and we were in class last year when the Syrian gas attack happened and I mentioned that I made no sense that Assad would gas his own people when he was winning at the time, and that the US engaged in false flags all the time. He gave me a straight look and said that the US doesn’t conduct false flags. That gave me no hope haha
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve always been obsessed with ethnicities and races, I’m a strange person haha so I always wanted to get it done but then I saw a video by ReallyGraceful in YT about the privacy issues and that woman totally opened my eyes. My bf actually wanted to buy my the kit for Christmas since he knows I love the idea, but I had to decline with so much sadness :(

       Ha I just let it go, he asked me out on a date later and I thought it was hilarious. Hahahahaha I can’t imagine my face after he told me that we don’t commit false flags.

       Essentially, that the DNA companies are owned largely by Alfabet (google’s parent company) and the info probably gets sold to google (don’t quote me but something along these lines. It’s been a while) The CEO of Google Susan or Karen Wojblahblah is the sister of the ex-wife of Google’s cofounder Sergei Bryn, who herself is the CEO of 23andMe. It’s some hot familial mess that means they basically have direct links between 23andMe and google. Sooo basically google has your dna most likely.

       Yeah that would’ve most likely been their response. It’s similar to what happens when shills come in these threads and ask the same question 2,3,4 times after you reply with links and answers. It’s done to get you to call them dickheads and retards which will then get you banned. Fucking sinister shit haha

       Hahah damn seriously? Now that’s a twist

       So the DNA companies sell all the info they get and give it to google? I guess the real question is, what is google planning to do with all this DNA?

       Hahaha yes, they really ride you until you just say something nasty. So I just figured I would be a better person, haha I wanted to try it out for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haha yes, he did ask me out. It was a little weird but then I stopped talking to him, because of that. Then we had another class and he started to text me and I just ignored him because it was painfully awkward that he knew I had a bf and he asked me out Hahaha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well did you hear about the golden state killer? Apparently they found his ass through those sites! My MiL told me that someone in his family took the test and it came back as being similar to the killers DNA and so they clustered a whole heap of people and rifled through his trash to confirm it was him. Then 23andMe and a whole heap of companies put out statements regarding client privacy and basically said “we do our best to protect your privacy but when the police asks, we’ll throw you under the bus and drive over you multiple times”

       Whoa, no I hadn’t heard about that and I’m here in California. I guess it’s that the golden state killer was caught, but these guys can certainly use the DNA for nefarious purposes. Just like the NSA has all of our data but promises not to be bad and use it to snoop or blackmail

       Haha yeah, he could go somewhere else with all that. Haha telling me there are no false flags yet you work for the DoD?! No dude, nooooo.

       Look it up! It’s pretty interesting, I really haven’t had the time to personally since I’ve had finals and I’ve been working extra shifts but I will once I get the chance. The interesting part is that some commenters on this British rag I read were saying that they were happy that the police were using the DNA companies to find killers. Which is cool, obviously, but you have to think about the evil things they could do as well. I’m sure the NSA will be nice enough to send me a backup of my computer if it ever crashed!

       Great question, really. Its very difficult to properly research, because, like you said, there is lots of disinformation. The key is to be able to recognize said disinfo and to sift through it in order to find the valuable, accurate and relevant information. This means looking all over the place, and making the best of your intuition and reasoning skills.

       I recommend watching a documentary like The Greatest Story Never Told or Europa: The Last Battle. It really depends on the topic, then I usually use searches from there and then eventually I start reading original sources, some of which can be very old.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, I sort of all depends on what you are interested in.

       Ahaha I just googled the greatest story and I definitely didn’t expect that. I have a huuuuge interest in WWII and the Nazis and Soviets in particular - I’m not evil I promise! I’m going to Germany and Russia in the coming days so I’ve been binge watching so much Hitler/Nazi docs. This is so up my street you have no idea, THANKS!! Anything else you can recommend that’s WWII related?

       Nooo don’t be a pessimist! Some of the content I’ve seen is pretty thorough. I mean, I’m no expert conspiracy theorist, but some people do actually put in a lot of work into research.

       once upon a time, people liked to have their preexisting beliefs challenged.

       Original sources are best but time consuming and very narrow in focus usually.

       You can also try to absorb a lot of different content and connect the dots the best you can.

       1) Look at what's being said
2) Look at who is saying it
3) Look at when they said it
4) Look at who they said it to

       As for misinformation and disinformation, there's less of it about than you'd think. Why should the intel agencies bother producing it when freedom of speech allows irrelevant ideas to proliferate like wildfire without any assistance whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, that being said, mis- and disinformationists have fewer "themes" than you might imagine. It's fairly easy to compile a list of their favourite topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a general rule of thumb, if your investigations only get more and more complex, rather than simpler and simpler, then you are either on the wrong track, or are at the wrong level (i.e., you are filling in background rather than the foregrounded stuff you originally wanted to research).

       I would say narrow it down to things you can comprehend and verify by yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption, invasions, three leter agencies...  cause going deep in UFO's, flat earth, satanic abuse, etc.. can be daunting and there is so much disinformation out there is useless to be speculating.

       But then you have the western civilization and the crown, conquering, raping and colonizing land creating monopolies during centuries and everyone just agreeing with it, now the final stages are in the middle east but they did it in South America and Eastern Europe before for years!

       I like to find a bunch of different articles from different sources(some MSM, mostly non-msm resources). I also look at social media and see if experts have anything on the topic. I don't believe anything until I've seen evidence from multiple good-looking sources
