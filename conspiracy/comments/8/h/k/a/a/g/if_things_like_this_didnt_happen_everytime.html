    <div class="md"><p>By all means, do so. Certainly not trying to stop or dissuade you, I&#39;m just at the point where nothing will actually change. I mean, Bush could go on live TV and say 9/11 was an inside job - admit to it in full detail, and people would just laugh and think he was &quot;trolling&quot;. This Country has passed the point of no return, imo. </p>

<p>I just want to find an island and Found my own Country, at this point.</p>

<p>Anyways, just though I&#39;d add my two cents about the CIA protection for those tards who say what you&#39;ve said. Hopefully one day they will realize it, whether if they&#39;re being paid or are just ignorant useful idiots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  I&#39;m from Arkansas and have witnessed the whole run from start to finish.  One thing I didn&#39;t realize until the last 2 years was the satanic worship.  We had a rash of satanic activity when they were in office in Arkansas. I never put 2 and 2 together until I read the  emails. I looked back and all that satanic activity suddenly stopped when they moved to DC.  It was a real eyeopener. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sheriff Tommy Robinson busted a toga orgy party of elites in LR.  It made the news everyday for weeks. Was a huge scandal.  It&#39;s been scrubbed. I&#39;ve searched for it, but  I&#39;m no pro. Maybe you can find it.  When WJC was governor, we had lots of animal mutilations around the state. We had pentagrams and remnants campfires, satanic drawings, ect. being found in the woods. At one point they were saying aliens were a possible answer for the animal mutilations. We all thought it was some Goth teen fad.  There were a few articles that I found on the mutilations. Here&#39;s all I could find on the toga orgy. Tommy Robinson was a real maverick. I wish someone would interview him, because I bet he knows alot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_F._Robinson">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_F._Robinson</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do.  Have you read her emails?  The thought never crossed my mind until I read them. I knew she was evil and selfserving, but now I think it&#39;s worse than that.  She talks about sacrificing a chicken to Moloch.  Who would even joke about that? Spirit cooking, etc. &quot;Moloch is the biblical name of a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice. The name of this deity is also sometimes spelled Molech, Milcom, or Malcam. The name Moloch results from a dysphemic vocalisation in the Second Temple period of a theonym based on the root mlk &quot;king&quot;.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s notably awful as politicians go, he&#39;s just way out of his depth compared to the systemic evil he faces.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he ever gave any consideration to not being bought out. I think he will be remembered as the quisling who had a chance to save the republic, but didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>They will never let another Trump happen. We aren&#39;t supposed to have a choice they don&#39;t have rock solid dirt on and is completely controllable. All they have on Trump is consensual sex with a trumped up whore, that he (foolishly) lied about. If he&#39;d <em>raped</em> someone they would love him. Better yet a little of the old pedophilia.</p>

<p>The only plausible hope is they push him so far he acts out. But I think this is very unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did no one commenting in here actually read the source? Literally all this says is that they don&#39;t have a chain of custody for 5 weeks... I think everyone should look up what &quot;chain of custody&quot; actually means, and then ask themselves why there are so many posters in here trying to spin this into a nefarious anything...</p>

<p>All Wikileaks has proven in the last couple years is that everyone would rather believe a huge nefarious plot with no evidence they can actually understand, then admit their own ignorance or read primary sources...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here it is, the favorite argument for non-conspiracy theorists: &quot;Most of the events that occur around politics shouldn&#39;t be labeled as acts of evil, greed or bad intent, but just by stupidity and mediocre politicians.&quot;  </p>

<p>Yeah, right... Accidentally, cause they are dumb, they took my liberties and I can end up in jail pretty easily if I&#39;m not careful, but they are so dumb that they can&#39;t prosecute each other. </p>

Ron Brown and Vince Foster are the two who raise the biggest flags not to mention 2 kids who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

<p>The Clintons are some of the biggest scumbags to walk the face of the earth and there are still those who think they got a raw deal and it was just the RNC just picking on them.</p>

<p>Hillary is the poster child of evil and yet somehow people believe in her.
