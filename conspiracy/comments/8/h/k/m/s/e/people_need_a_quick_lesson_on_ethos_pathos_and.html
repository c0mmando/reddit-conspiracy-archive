        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A lot of people post a lot of shit. You have to determine whether that shit is truthful or it&#39;s shit.</p>

<p>People will often appeal to the masses through emotion. This is called pathos.</p>

<p>You see it when you see a commercial for a charity on TV. They&#39;ll play emotional music and provide images that tug at your heart strings. Or you&#39;ll see people even on here, saying &quot;I love you, I love everyone, I just want there to be peace...&quot;</p>

<p>None of that is sincere. It&#39;s made to persuade you to believe in something they want you to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pathos or the emotional appeal, means to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions</strong></p>

<p>Authors use pathos to invoke sympathy from an audience; to make the audience feel what what the author wants them to feel. A common use of pathos would be to draw pity from an audience. Another use of pathos would be to inspire anger from an audience; perhaps in order to prompt action. Pathos is the Greek word for both “suffering” and “experience.” The words empathy and pathetic  are derived from pathos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You as a conspiracy theorist, must use evidence to understand things. People will try to con you into believing an agenda or propaganda. </p>

<p>ie. Syria gas attacks</p>

<p>They straight up showed kids that weren&#39;t dead as if they were dead to garner sympathy so the bombs can get dropped.</p>

<p>Another often more clever way to trick people is through the use of someone people believe are good or an authority figure. A good example of this is Bill Cosby. Everyone thought he was a good dude. In reality, he&#39;s a convicted rapist. We need to look past someone&#39;s credentials and analyze the evidence or points they present.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ethos or the ethical appeal, means to convince an audience of the author’s credibility or character.</strong></p>

<p>An author would use ethos to show to his audience that he is a credible source and is worth listening to. Ethos is the Greek word for “character.” The word “ethic” is derived from ethos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why we should pay attention to see if someone persuades through logos or through logical argument and evidence. Most people often present fake facts to win an arguments and it is your job to dissect the &#39;facts&#39; and see if they hold up to real analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Logos or the appeal to logic, means to convince an audience by use of logic or reason.</strong></p>

<p>To use logos would be to cite facts and statistics, historical and literal analogies, and citing certain authorities on a subject.Logos is the Greek word for “word,” however the true definition goes beyond that, and can be most closely described as “the word or that by which the inward thought is expressed, Lat. oratio; and,  the inward thought itself, Lat. Ratio. (1) The word “logic” is derived from logos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is truth out there. But unfortunately, there&#39;s a lot of bullshit. You have weed through bullshit to get to that golden nugget of truth.</p>

<p>On my initial read I thought it was pretentious to call emotional appeal &quot;pathos&quot; since we already know emotional appeal, but using the Latin (?) To link all three together makes it much easier to remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man. I hope people can learn from it. I saw this previous article on a Palestinian boy that supposedly died and if you see my comment, the boy is actually alive and was treated in an Israeli hospital. As much people want to hate on Israel, they&#39;re spreading lies about certain events.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say Israel hasn&#39;t done really messed up stuff, but at the same time, that emotional appeal by showing a seemingly dead boy being yelled at, riles people up, when in reality, facts show he&#39;s alive and we don&#39;t know who was the person yelling at him.</p>

<p>This is the shit that needs tocbe taught in schools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isnt this taught in schools in the us? - Most people forget what they were taught in school. I think it&#39;s taught to kids in most european schools and highschools. Learning to understand things is sort of the point of school, or to get kids to learn how to comprehend and analyse the world around them, and knowing how writers are manipulating you in different ways is such a good tool for that analysis, plus it gets the kids new words to express what they have read.  </p>

<p>Teacher: &quot;so Johnny, how would you say that the writer chose to express that point in the story?&quot; Johnny: Ehh, he used a lot of pathos in certain points!?!&quot; teacher: &quot;That&#39;s correct Johnny, the writer chose to highlight certain events in the story as more important than others, by the use of pathos in certain parts, thereby getting the reader more emotionally involved with some characters than others.....&quot; Teacher yabbers on while everyone goes for their phone because facebook needs checking &quot;....and with that use of pathos, the writer also establishes the possibility of the use of ethos with that certain character, because an emotional bond have been forged between the reader and the character.&quot; bell rings and life goes on, and most people can&#39;t remember if they just had a class on the 3 forms of appeal or a class on triangles</p>

<p>So are arguments based on false dichotomies  </p>

<p>Paradigms can&#39;t be false, since a paradigm is more or less equal to a/the truth, and all paradigms have their own internal logic, and to be able to claim a paradigm as false you would have to look at it from inside another paradigm - which in turn could be claimed to be false by another paradigm (in infinite regress).   </p>

<p>If you are assuming the concept of paradigms to be truth, you would have to be looking from inside a paradigm that presupposes truth as attainable - but it&#39;s still only truth within the paradigm.   </p>

<p>If you presupposing paradigms you&#39;re also gonna have to give up the concept of ultimate truth, you can&#39;t both have the cake and eat it too.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>all ethical arguments that come from a corrupt and deceptive system are invalid  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would have to presuppose that a non-corrupt and non-deceptive <em>system</em> can even be had for this to be valid.   </p>

<p>Ethics <em>is</em> a system, if it was an universal truth it wouldn&#39;t have to be taught and systematized. And if humans are corrupt and deceptive, wouldn&#39;t most systems made by humans be seen as corrupt or deceptive? - if &quot;truth&quot;, a non-corrupt and non-deceitful truth <em>is</em> and actually exist, why can only the select few acces it? Or isn&#39;t it just more likely that the ones knowledgeable about &quot;truth&quot; could be either corrupt, deceitful or just wrong, which then would make <em>all</em> ethical arguments pertaining to somekind of universal truth, invalid.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>all emotional arguments that play to the lower emotions (negative) are invalid  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emotions doesn&#39;t really have any say in wether an argument is valid or not, if the conclusion follows the premises, the argument is valid, you can even have a valid argument from false premises, aslong as the conclusion follows the premises. You can call it  a dishonourable or unreliable or perhaps unimportant argument, but it&#39;s still valid because the conclusion follows: If we say that 3 = 5, 2 times 3 will = 10, even though it&#39;s <em>wrong</em> math, its still a valid conclusion because of the premise that 3 was 5. So any argument that has the premise that &quot;my feelings are important&quot; can be perfectly valid, but probably just not important to the point thats being made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See now that&#39;s a great example of how pathos works - just going straight for the emotional response, without any need to actually address or even refute any of the points being discussed.   </p>

<p>A point being made without any backup is just a claim, and not an argument -  so the only point i get from that comment is that i should question if you even know what you are actually talking about. I dont see how claiming unrefutable claims about the ego&#39;s need for self validation makes your point any more valid? Or how your truth somehow isn&#39;t based inside a paradigm.  </p>

<p>If you think that my post is somehow speaking from a place of cognitive dissonance i would appreciate if you used some of those beforementioned valid arguments, to show how cognitive dissonance is <em>actually</em> the case, and not just something <em>you&#39;re claiming</em> is the case.  </p>

<p>Dedicating one post to talking about valid arguments, but then as soon as any criticism comes along there&#39;s no longer any need for valid arguments, and suddenly irrefutable claims about the cognitive state of the criticiser becomes relevent to the discussion - how the hell does that make any sense, because it seems pretty  inconsistent to me?    </p>

<p>How is my cognitive resonance or lack thereof relevant to the validity of your arguments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all of your substanceless contentions lead to nihilism when the logic is extended.</p>

<p>You misunderstand the point because you are off in the weeds trying to find pretentious words that fit logically for what you are trying to say, which is absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>The reason you use so many words to say absolutely nothing is because your entire foundation of knowledge is based on false presuppositions.</p>

<p>There are emotional truths</p>

<p>There are logical truths</p>

<p>There are ethical truths</p>

<p>These truths are objective, but they are dynamic. The path to discovering them is through introspection.</p>

<p>Any attempt to reify these truths using language results in some loss of the original truth. </p>

<p>If something is true, than it will inherently appeal to people&#39;s pathos provided that they are open to it.</p>

<p>In your case, you probably believe you have received some validation for this diarrhea of words thing that you do, but its actually just people saying nice things that are fake so they can feel like they understand or to make you go away.</p>

<p>This problem of yours is rooted in your ego which has the need to validate itself through creating a social identity and comparing it to others. In your case your social identity is tied to you being an &#39;intelligent legal/philosophical type&#39;. You validate this identity by producing diarrhea diatribes and feeling good when you think people dont understand or mistakenly give you fake respect for the dribble you produce.</p>

<p>Are you actually aware of my &quot;entire foundation of knowledge&quot; - how about just sticking to the points we were discussing, otherwise is just you using logos, and actually believing it yourself. The fact that you believe your own bs, doesn&#39;t make it valid.  </p>

<p>Would you please state the exact quote where i said that there wasn&#39;t! - don&#39;t spend your energy refuting something that has never been claimed, and instead go for the things i actually wrote! - Otherwise you&#39;re discussing something i never wrote, which doens&#39;t provide any sort of backing towards any of the arguments you made, again it just make it seem like you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. Apparantly you didn&#39;t get that point from my other post - it won&#39;t make any sense to bring the matter of &quot;ultimate truths&quot; into a discussion about whether arguments are valid or not, which is a discussion about rhetorics, and therefore cannot be warranted or backed by points about ultimate truth, it simply just isn&#39;t valid! Just like making a statement about how racism makes you sad or angry isn&#39;t a valid response in a discussion about racism.  </p>

<p>So now you&#39;re just making things up? Or how did you get your reasoning end up there? - I notice an excessive use of pathos in this paragraph, is there an actual reason for this, or are you just trying to make me look bad because <em>you</em> don&#39;t know what i&#39;m talking about, what&#39;s up with making claims about how people i know are only being fake nice because they respect me, respect me even though they consider what comes out of my mouth diarrhea diatribes - so i guess you don&#39;t even know how respect works, and you&#39;re being kinda mean aswell, since i don&#39;t really see any other point in making untrue statements about my life and personality, or how it pertains to the point originally discussed - which is ironic considering how this was post about identifying rhetorical tricks, but you still use those exact tricks, and not even to make a point, but just to tear any critique down.</p>

<p>this scope meandering accusation shows that you feel uncomfortable outside of your little comfort bubble. Afyerwards you descend into all sorts of &#39;no, you are&#39; immaturity masked by words further showing your lack of emotional maturity.</p>

<p>respect works by telling the truth. Diarrhea diatribes is both a poetic and an accurate description of your comments. Respect does not work by treating baby ego&#39;s with little kid gloves. that would be disrespectful.</p>

<p>re your education is your problem, kind of reiterating here, but thats what you gotta do with these cognitive dissonance cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your education created an ego that is making you blind</p></li>
<li><p>only others who are also blinded by their egos would ever see what you say as truth or compelling in any way</p></li>

<p>Is it emotional immature not to agree with you, or what is the point your making? And when did this discussion turn into a psychological evaluayion of me? this isn&#39;t really up for discussion, sorry if it somehow hurts your ego, that i still don&#39;t think that discussing my perceived psychological state is relevant, you can shame me and call me immature, blind, talk about how fragile my ego is, and on and on, and still it won&#39;t get you any closer to making the point your trying to make, all it does is displaying all your strange assumptions about something that you really don&#39;t know anything about - but atleast you can take a little pleasure in being mean to someone that you yourself characterized as lacking emotional maturity, and having a fragile ego, that makes it all worth it doesn&#39;t it!</p>

<p>Making false claims, digging for emotional responses and pointing out things made from your own assumptions is not really having a discussion, so come back when you  actually willing to do that, i don&#39;t care for anymore of your assumptions about my life or about my state of mind.   </p>

<p>Isnt this taught in schools in the us? - Most people forget what they were taught in school. I think it&#39;s taught to kids in most european schools and highschools. Learning to understand things is sort of the point of school, or to get kids to learn how to comprehend and analyse the world around them, and knowing how writers are manipulating you in different ways is such a good tool for that analysis, plus it gets the kids new words to express what they have read.  </p>

<p>Teacher: &quot;so Johnny, how would you say that the writer chose to express that point in the story?&quot; Johnny: Ehh, he used a lot of pathos in certain points!?!&quot; teacher: &quot;That&#39;s correct Johnny, the writer chose to highlight certain events in the story as more important than others, by the use of pathos in certain parts, thereby getting the reader more emotionally involved with some characters than others.....&quot; Teacher yabbers on while everyone goes for their phone because facebook needs checking &quot;....and with that use of pathos, the writer also establishes the possibility of the use of ethos with that certain character, because an emotional bond have been forged between the reader and the character.&quot; bell rings and life goes on, and most people can&#39;t remember if they just had a class on the 3 forms of appeal or a class on triangles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned it in school... then again I was in the advanced classes from elementary and I know the &quot;average&quot; classes did not cover all the shit I had to. Or maybe I just had good teachers - I don&#39;t know. But seriously, I see way to many comments lamenting that people aren&#39;t taught these things  in school when generally it was covered in depth for me by middle school.</p>
