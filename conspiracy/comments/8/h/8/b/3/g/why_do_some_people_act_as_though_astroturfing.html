/ˈastrəʊtəːfɪŋ/
<em>the deceptive practice of presenting an orchestrated marketing or public relations campaign in the guise of unsolicited comments from members of the public.</em></p>

<p>We may have a long way to go before the average man on the street is aware of how astroturfing shapes and distorts public discourse, but the phenomenon is actually already quite well documented and reported on. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some interesting information on it:</p>

<p>Clearly, talk of shills, astroturfing, opinion spamming, web brigades, sockpuppets, and cyber troops is not simply some fringe nonsense which concerns only the paranoid and obsessive. It&#39;s a very real, well documented form of propaganda that has become increasingly prevalent and very effective. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure most are aware of the power of groups, and how the psychology behind the &quot;argument ad populum&quot; can be a huge factor in the behaviour of public opinion. Well, astroturfing exploits this by hinging on the idea that if you can make people believe your view is the norm, then people will be heavily swayed by it. </p>

<p>Much like terrorism and marketing tactics, we may not like to admit that we are credulous enough to be influenced by a type of manipulation that seems to push such irrational, primordial buttons. Regardless, the reality is that we are, and if we wish not to be influenced by astroturfing then we must become savvy to the kind of tactics, patterns, and psychological idiocyncracies that are its hallmarks. Sure, the tactics may shift over time, but only a few sockpuppets will ever be <em>really</em> good at their work. Most will struggle to hide the fact their heart isn&#39;t really in it, and that there is a cold, practical, financial motive behind their actions. </p>

<p>Spend some time trying to thoughtfully write well researched arguments you don&#39;t really believe in or care about. For most people, it&#39;s much more difficult than you might expect, and it becomes tiring very quickly, especially if the point isn&#39;t going to trigger an interesting emotional reaction out of your opponent, but will more likely result in them responding with a similarly well researched and well thought-out piece of writing. If you&#39;re arguing a topic you actually believe in, this kind of well-reasoned discussion is golden. If not, it&#39;s painfully boring. </p>

<p>This is partly why paid sockpuppets often resort to making short, snide remarks, or simply go for personal attacks and gaslighting. This is a much more instantaneous and entertaining tactic that does not require one to go through the tiring rigmarole of researching and cogently defending a point which one has little interest in. Moreover, if one provokes an emotional reaction it will give one a sense of power, much like a bully gets from harassing a peer. </p>

<p>Another reason that astroturfers tend to behave this way is simply that psychological tactics are far more effective than musty old facts and rationality. Psychological tactics can break people down and push people away, and can make one seem strong and assertive, which many people find attractive. People are almost always more attracted to what they perceive as social intelligence (ie, the ability to influence people), rather than other forms of intelligence, such as rationality, wisdom, or knowledgeability.</p>

<p>So why should a conspiracy forum be interested in astroturfing? Well, because it is a conspiracy. Powerful individuals conspire to forcibly and deceitfully manipulate public discourse by paying people to pretend to be uncorrupted internet users who sincerely support or oppose a viewpoint, a collection of viewpoints, or an ideology. That is a fact. If that isn&#39;t a major conspiracy, then I don&#39;t know what is. Moreover, this conspiracy is actually definitively real, and there is plenty of information about it. Further, this is about powerful people brainwashing the public, with a method that is extremely effective and which exploits some of the biggest weaknesses in our psychology.</p>

<p>Hasn&#39;t the conspiracy community always been fascinated by how TPTB manipulates the public? Hasn&#39;t it always been interested in brainwashing, psychological deception, and propaganda? In my view, astroturfing is the biggest and most important conspiracy subject of today, because it comes directly from TPTB, it&#39;s extremely extensive, it&#39;s one of the most effective and deceptive methods of propaganda ever utilised, there&#39;s lots of evidence surrounding it, and it actually affects us personally on a day-to-day basis. Even on this very subreddit, any regular user will have likely become aware that there are parties who come here to manipulate the discourse. </p>

<p>Just as how over the years people became increasingly wise to such things as more on-the-nose methods of political propaganda, online scams, phishing, or yellow journalism, it is now time for us to become wise to astroturfing. It surely won&#39;t be easy, but I welcome every effort to further the discourse on the matter, and I see no reason for why a conspiracy forum wouldn&#39;t be the perfect place for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont play into his fucking games, Flat Earth is a unique form of astroturfing geared at pushing conspiracy theorists into more fringe and ridiculous views, and even though 95% of us dont believe in it, it advertises itself better than most other real conspiracies in an effort to discredit conspiracy culture as a whole.</p>

<p>Its like a modern version of when the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; was invented as a derogatory term to discredit peopel with alternative views, now they are trying to &quot;package&quot; flat earth in with pedogate and other legitimate things</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying pizzagate is real, but I think there is enough strange information should make you at least curious. I feel like people&#39;s aversion to it seems a bit strange. But I think that&#39;s partly because its an American subject, and while in the UK we&#39;ve already been woken up by the Operation Yewtree investigation and the Marc Dutroux case in neighbouring Belgium, the US hasn&#39;t had that yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of that really compares to everyone becoming fully aware that the state public broadcasting service covered up hundreds of cases of a major celebrity and friend of the royals raping children in care homes and bodies in morgues, as well as the paedophilia of a number of other BBC celebrities. Nor does it compare to child victims revealing the identities of European political figures and businessmen raping, torturing, and murdering children in a case that was covered up by the police for years, and resulted in 350,000 people protesting on the streets.</p>

<p>The Franklin case was the only thing remotely similar and most people think it was a hoax (it&#39;s not important to my point whether it was or not, just that most people believe it was).</p>

<p>Exhibit A: Evidence Pertaining to Comet Pizza and Ping Pong
As demonstrated in Exhibit D, we have connected owner James Alefantis to accused child trafficker Laura Silsby, who was got off the hook by a fake attorney who was later convicted of sex-trafficking, and who was wanted for sex trafficking in four countries. Alefantis had a statue of Antinous as his Instagram profile picture. Antinous was the boy lover of a Roman Emperor, and is considered a symbol of pederasty. On his &quot;jimmycomet&quot; Instagram account, Alefantis posted a baby picture and made a clear pedophile reference. The brother of Jeffrey B. Smith (&quot;werkinonmahnightcheese&quot;), who commented on several of the suspect Instagram photos, referred to a friend as &quot;my favorite pedo&quot;.</p>

<p>Listed first on Comet&#39;s website under &quot;friends of comet&quot; is the band Heavy Breathing, which performs at Comet. Heavy Breathing leader &quot;Majestic Ape&quot; wears a ski mask and sunglasses, and uses a voice modulator, hiding his or her identity. Majestic Ape joked about pedophile Jared Fogle and said &quot;we all have our preferences, hee hee hee&quot;. YouTube, bringing laughter from the audience. In another video, Majestic Ape talks about killing a babyYouTube. Majestic Ape also referenced pedophilia in a caption on a music video. Heavy Breathing&#39;s website features art involving both children and sex.</p>

<p>An employee of Comet posted many images portraying pizza in a sexual way., further fueling our suspicion they are using &quot;pizza&quot; as it is commonly used by pedophiles: a symbol and codeword for sex with minors. Another example. An admitted pedophile on a dark-web pedophile forum acknowledged a trend of pedophiles using pizza parlors as fronts for child sex trafficking. Convicted sex offender Robert L. Robinson, who raped a 13-year-old girl, had a Flikr account with five pages of &quot;favorite&quot; pictures, half of which featured young girls, and the other half of which featured... Comet Pizza and Ping Pong.</p>

<p>Please examine these symbols designated by the FBI as pedophile symbols. Besta Pizza, which is three doors down from Comet, had a logo that is a near-exact match of the boylover symbol. Another nearby business, Terasol, had a girl-lover symbol on their website. No direct connection to Besta or Terasol has yet been uncovered, but the logos seem quite a coincidence. With that in mind, take a look at Comet&#39;s logo. It also resembles a pedophile symbol.</p>

<p>General creepiness seems to surround Comet. Alefantis posted a photo of a child taped to a ping pong table. He also posted a photo of a walk-in cooler, to which he commented &quot;#murder&quot; and to which Jeffrey B. Smith commented &quot;#killroom.&quot; Alefantis also posted a picture of Tony Podesta’s sculpture modeled after a Dahmer victim and one of &quot;spirit-cooking&quot; queen Marina Abramovic. Comet had a painting of a man playing ping pong, to which graffiti had been added to show him ejaculating on the table and wearing a Satanic upside-down cross. Comet had murals of people with heads cut off, and the artist who painted the murals also painted adults decapitating children.</p>

<p>Pizzagate researcher Ryan O&#39;Neal posted a YouTube video in which he claims James Alefantis threatened his life and the lives of his familyYouTube to bully O&#39;Neal into removing a video about Alefantis&#39; &quot;Pegasus Museum&quot; from YouTube. O&#39;Neal showed text messages, which appear to be from Alefantis, bullying him into calling Alefantis. O&#39;Neal claims that when he called, Alefantis immediately began screaming at him and threatening him and his family. O&#39;Neal filed a police report over the alleged threats.</p>

<p>Exhibit B: Evidence Pertaining to John and Tony Podesta
John Podesta is the former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, and was the Chair of Hillary Clinton&#39;s presidental campaign. Tony Podesta runs The Podesta Group, a major lobbying firm. The Podestas are associates of James Alefantis, as detailed in Exhibit C. They are also good friends with known and admitted pedophile, former Republican congressman Dennis Hastert. John Podesta received en email suggesting that Hastert should vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island after the news of Hastert&#39;s pedophilia broke.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s discuss the specific emails that led to our investigation of Comet. John Podesta received an email from Tam Luzzatto saying that children of ages 11, 9, and 7 will be &quot;in the pool for further entertainment&quot; and stating that the children &quot;will definitely be in that pool&quot;.</p>

<p>In another email, Podesta was told that he left behind a black-and-white handkerchief &quot;with a map that seems pizza-related&quot;. A handkerchief with a &quot;pizza-related&quot; map? What the...? Note that in the gay community, handkerchiefs are sometimes used as code for sexual preferences. It is possible that others have adopted this code as well. Black symbolizes bdsm/domination in this code; some have suggested that white could symbolize pedophilia, due to the association of white with innocence and purity. Furthermore, as discussed previously, &quot;cheese pizza&quot; is a common code phrase meaning &quot;child pornography,&quot; so &quot;pizza&quot; could be an adaptation of that.</p>

<p>In another suspiciously cryptic email, a friend complained that Podesta had changed &quot;strategies that have long been in place&quot; and remarked that Podesta sent him &quot;cheese&quot; instead of &quot;pasta,&quot; asking if Podesta thought he would do better &quot;playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta&quot;. Why would Podesta regularly send this person pasta, why would there need to be a strategy long in place for doing so, and who plays dominoes on cheese or pasta?</p>

<p>Tony Podesta sent John Podesta an email titled &quot;Last night was fun.&quot; The email read simply &quot;still in the torture chamber&quot;. One could argue this could have been a metaphor, but consider it in light of the fact that Tony Podesta collects art by Biljana Djurdjevic, which references or depicts extreme physical and sexual abuse of children. He also collects photos of naked teenagers, and he has a taste for art portraying cannibalism and murder, such as his headless Arch of Hysteria statue which seems to reproduce one of Jeffrey Dahmer&#39;s decapitated victims. John Podesta also likes artwork portraying cannibalism, such as this piece is in his office.</p>

<p>Exhibit C: Alefantis&#39; Connections to the Podestas and Clintons
James Alefantis himself was deemed one of the 50 most powerful people of Washington D.CPNG by GQ magazine.
He was the romantic partnerof David Brock. David Brock is the Chief of Media Matters, a major instrument of the Democratic Party. Brock is also the founder of Correct the Record, a Super PAC that supported the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is seen with Tony Podesta here andhere. An email from Alefantis to Tony Podesta, which Tony Podesta forwarded to John Podesta had an attached file which was an image of Hillary’s Logo with a pizza slice in it, above a Comet logo. Alefantis also made desserts for a Clinton campaign event. (Notice another photo with Alefantis and Tony Podesta together, and that Alefantis visited the White House on at least five occasions.) Clinton personally thanked Alefantis for cooking for one of her fundraisers. Comet received payments of over $20k from American Bridge 21st Century PAC, a primary funder of which is billionaire Clinton-backer George Soros. Payments can be seen here, here, and here.</p>

<p>Exhibit D: Additional Evidence Implicating the Clintons Specifically
NOTE: All previously cited evidence implicates the Clintons, as John Podesta has been their right-hand man, and as James Alefantis is closely associated with the Clinton Campaign and major Democratic Party leaders.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton is known to have flown multiple times on the &quot;Lolita Express&quot; of disgraced billionaire pedophile Jeffery Epstein to visit Epstein&#39;s private &quot;pedophile island,&quot; Little St. James. Hillary Clinton also joined him on occasion. Bill Clinton even ditched the Secret Service to make these trips Interestingly, Jeffrey Epstein claimed to be a co-founder of the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton was sent email updates on the prosecution of Laura Silsby, who was caught trafficking children in Haiti. Laura Silsby was got off the hook by Jorge Puello, who was later convicted of sex trafficking, and was wanted on charges of sex trafficking in four countries. Additional source. Izette Folger, a close friend of James Alefantis, gave a statement in support of Silsby. Folger is the daughter of Michael Maccoby, who coaches leaders of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, or NPH, a large organization that runs orphanages all over the world. His son, Max Maccoby, is on the Boards of Directors of an NPH orphanage called Friends of the Orphans, which is one of 760 orphanages operating in Haiti, and happens to be the orphanage from which Silsby was caught trafficking children. Max Maccoby gave an emphatic and lengthy statement of support for Comet during a contentious neighborhood commission meeting. The relevant portion of the audio file starts at 31:40.</p>

<p>Frank Giustra owner of the Radcliffe Foundation is on the board of directors for the Clinton Foundation, and is a major Clinton Foundation donor. The logo of Elpida Home, a refugee center founded by the Radcliffe Foundation, happens to be almost identical to the pedophile boylover symbol.</p>
