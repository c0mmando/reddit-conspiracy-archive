       I don't what people to think I'm taking any credit for this person's outstanding work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was watching and listening to the video and couldn't help make some notes about what was going on.  Please comment, tell me where I'm wrong, or add anything else you think is suspicious about what was happening on that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really didn't find anything too interesting before they arrive at Mandalay Bay (I might be wrong, please point out what I missed!), so we'll start here.
       <strong>
        IMPORTANT NOTE:
       </strong>
       the time markers are for this video only, and would not be accurate for the individual cam videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       @19.57, they say they already have a 4 man team upstairs and he says something about “another team” coming to them.  Soon after that they say they have conformation of at least two shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       @25:30 Can someone explain to me why they went up to the 29th floor first, to clear it, before going up to the 32nd?
      </p>
      <p>
       @27:52 “Get off the fucking radio with that shit.”  What is the officer referring to here?
      </p>
      <p>
       @32:50 someone asks, “How many strike teams do we have at the Mandalay Bay?”  That’s a great question, anyone know how many strike teams were there?
      </p>
      <p>
       @34.55 more confirmation that there is already a strike team on the 32nd floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       @36:10 interesting talk about a white male in fatigues and carrying a black bag going into a motorhome at the Motel 6, people were saying he came from the area of the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, at some point before (I forgot to mark it, sorry!) they were talking about a black SUV speeding away from the scene, I seem to remember that being important.
      </p>
      <p>
       @36:40 a civilian stole a patrol car.  And then @37:35 “I’m being overtaken by citizens trying to take patrol cars!” You forget how absolutely insane that night was…..
      </p>
      <p>
       @39:20 Sgt. Bitsko confirming there is a team already on the 32nd floor, he says he doesn’t want a “blue on blue”, which I’m assuming is Metro firing on Metro.
      </p>
      <p>
       @40:20 confirmation they have casualties at two scenes, Ali Baba &amp; Giles (which is on the east side of the Route 91 concert grounds) and inside the Mandalay Bay
      </p>
      <p>
       @43:00 call for more units at Reno and Tropicana, they might have “a possible”.  Another possible shooter, I’m guessing?
      </p>
      <p>
       @43:15 got a five man team going to floor 2.  I didn’t notice if they said what for, though
      </p>
      <p>
       @43:40 subject on the helipad
      </p>
      <p>
       @44:25 shots fired?
      </p>
      <p>
       @45:00 two officers arrive to investigate that target RV mentioned at 36:10
      </p>
      <p>
       @45:30  AAAAAAND they’re finally on the 32nd floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       @45:50 The team is met by a heavily kitted out SWAT officer who was already on the 32nd floor, and who immediately takes everyone back down to the 31st floor. They are being told that they going to the other stairwell to go up and arrive closer to Paddocks suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       @47:00 more confirmation that Ali Baba &amp; Giles  and inside the Mandalay Bay are the two shooting locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       @49:14 loud noise?  Nobody flinches so it’s probably nothing
      </p>
      <p>
       @49:55 more loud noises, these come immediately after someone says, “Hit it with your fucking baton.”  Hit what, though?
      </p>
      <p>
       @52:30  Bathroom break!  But K9 officer David Newton still washes his hands.  Remember, kids, even in an active shooter situation, personal hygiene is always a top priority!
      </p>
      <p>
       @55:00 back on the 32nd floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m going to pause here to mention that, according to the official Metro Oct 1st report
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.lvmpd.com/en-us/Documents/1_October_FIT_Report_01-18-2018_Footnoted.pdf">
        https://www.lvmpd.com/en-us/Documents/1_October_FIT_Report_01-18-2018_Footnoted.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On page 12: “From approximately 2205 to 2216 hours, Paddock committed a mass shooting that left 58 people dead and over 700 hundred injured.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock only fired for 11 minutes, ending at 22:16.  These guys are only now getting to the 32nd floor
      </p>
      <p>
       On page 13: “Engineer Schuck stated over his radio, “Shannon, call the police. Someone’s firing a rifle 
on the 32nd floor down the hallway.”  So, both Jesus Campos (who had already, supposedly, taken a bullet from Paddock) and Stephen Schuck has identified the 32nd floor as the location of the shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I’m saying is that there was well over an hour from the time Paddock stopped shooting to when the officers with the body cams came onto his floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       ON page 14: “Approximately 2241 hours
A Strike  Team  which  included  K9 Sergeant  Bitsko,  K9  Officer  Newton,  SWAT  Officer Hancock and Detective Walford ascended the stairs from the 30th floor. The Strike Team made entry and cleared the 31st floor. 
Approximately 2256 hours 
The Strike Team reentered the stairwell from the 31st floor and walked up to the 32nd floor”
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, remember, @19.57, they said they already have a 4 man team upstairs and he says something about “another team” coming to them.  That, plus Bitsko and Newton were met by another SWAT officer already on the 32nd floor before they even arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       and again, according to the
       <a href="https://www.lvmpd.com/en-us/Documents/1_October_FIT_Report_01-18-2018_Footnoted.pdf">
        official Metro Oct 1st report
       </a>
       : "Approximately 2257 hours
 K9 Sergeant Bitsko and SWAT Officer Hancock manually breached the door barricaded
with the “L” bracket."
      </p>
      <p>
       I might be wrong about this, but at round the @55:00-56:00 mark you should be seeing the officers dealing with the L bracket, but I’m not seeing anything.  Again, might be wrong, but it sure looks like it was dealt with earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       @57:13 is that the door to Paddock’s suite?  Does it look like 200 rounds have been fired through it?
      </p>
      <p>
       @58:00 radio says they have a possible suspect at Circus Circus and Industrial, that’s at the far north end of the Strip, a few miles from the Mandalay Bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:00.05 possible shots fired at New York New York  @1:01:32, shooter at the front desk at NYNY
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:02:12 reports of a black Audi with “wires hanging out” at the Luxor valet, just next door.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:02:22 false alarm at the NYNY?
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:03:00 there are officers already in the hallway, strike team is trying to contact them so they are not caught in the crossfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:03:32  Yup, that $2.00 L bracket looks like it’s already been dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:07:12 reports of two shots fired inside casino floor at NYNY, several subjects down at NYNY and Zumanity
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:08:00 looks like they’ve placed the explosive charge on the door of Paddock’s suite
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:09:05 talking about the possibility of NYNY being a diversion.  Earlier, someone had said they where there and it looked “pretty calm”.  So, maybe it’s nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:09:28 now reports of active shooter at Tropicana, which is just kitty-corner from NYNY, and all within view of Mandalay Bay
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:09:37 that’s the best view of Paddock’s door I’ve seen, looks like maybe two dozen bullet holes at most
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:09:53 multiple calls about multiple shooters at multiple locations.  Dispatcher suggests they may not be diversions.  Let’s listen to those 911 calls now……oh wait, we can’t because LV Metro hasn’t released any yet!
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:10:16 radio from outside Tropicana, they aren’t hearing any gunshots.  Also, looks like we lost David Newton’s body cam, looks like it fell down the stairwell?
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:11:15 “BREACH, BREACH, BREACH”.  We’re finally a go for getting into the Suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official LV Metro Oct 1st report, he Strike Team conducted an explosive breach into room 32-135 and made entry at approx 23:20.  Remember, Paddock stopped shooting at 22:17, more than an hour earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:13:07 enter stage right, where did these officers come from?
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:13:16 partial view down the hallway, looks pretty nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:13:41 finally in Paddock’s suite itself.  Multiple officers have entered the suite before Sgt Bisko.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:14:00 “BREACH, BREACH, BREACH”  I’m assuming that that’s for the entrance to Paddock’s 2nd suite
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:14:55 reports of two shots fired in the park area of NYNY, and one at Aria, which is City Center, a little further north on the Strip.  And, @1:15:58 they’re sending two teams to Excalibur, which is right between Luxor and NYNY
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:16:27 another breach, this time within the suite, I’m assuming it’s this, according to the LV Metro report: “Approximately 2326 hours
The Strike Team made a second explosive breach from inside of room 32-135 into room 32-134 through the connecting doors. Immediately after the explosive breach an LVMPD SWAT Officer negligently fired a three round burst from his rifle. The rounds fired from the SWAT officer’s rifle struck a chair, an entertainment center/cabinet and a wall.”
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:18:02 officer reporting that they have made contact with people inside the Tropicana, and there were no shots fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:18:15, now everyone is coming out of Paddock’s suite.  I’ve mostly seen Bitsko’s chin and the ceiling from his body camera, I don’t think I saw the floor once.   And @1:18:19 more hallway, looks fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:19:00 they are reporting one suspect down in room 135 @ Mandalay Bay
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick question: are there still guests in the other suites on that floor?  Were they evacuated?  If so, by whom?
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:19:54 STILL getting reports of shots fired at the Tropicana, but someone immediately comes on and says they are at the Tropicana (see @1:18:02) and there are no shots fired.  So, who knows, eh?  Also, no shots fired at Aria.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:20:16 command to start “rechecks” all the way down the hall.  I’m assuming that they are rechecking the rooms to make sure they are empty?  If so, who evacuated people in the first place?  Why didn’t anyone staying on that floor go on the Ellen show?  Just thinking out loud here.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:20:25 security at NYNY are saying no shots fired in the casino
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:22:00 still talking about the black Audi with the wires hanging out of it at Luxor.  They’ve got area locked down.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:22:40 now getting reports of shots fired at Ceasers and the Belliago.  This is interesting because the reports are making a direct path from the Mandalay Bay northwards up the Strip.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:23:38 Bitsko wandered back into the suite after loitering in the hallways for a bit, now getting a better view of the room, and the guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:24:58 reports of a man with a gun at the Paris.  Note, that is directly across the street from the Bellagio!
      </p>
      <p>
       In the suite they are talking about windows not being broken, and I’ve seen people comment on that, but listening to it in context, it sounds like a nothingburger, they are just trying to identify what windows are broken and which aren’t.  But, again, that’s just me.  Come to your own conclusions, and let me know if I’m wrong!
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:25:33 “Let’s get some units to Flamingo and the Boulevard to stop this guy going north anymore.”
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:25:51 talking about Paddock, “This guy’s been 419 for a minute”.  Meaning he’s been dead for a while.  LV Metro code for dead body is 419  But, he committed suicide because he thought SWAT was going to breach is room, and the jig was up, right?  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:27:33 talking about the gas mask they found.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:28:22 reports of 434’s at Paris, that’s illegal shooting (I should have downloaded that Metro code sheet at the start), and they’ve got “people running everywhere.”  But, when pressed, they aren’t hearing shots right that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:30:33 the footage is clearly edited, there is an obvious cut there.  I wonder how many more of those I’ve missed.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:31:28 strike team arrives at Paris
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:31:43 more of a walk around in the suite
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:32:35 strike team at Paris, no gunshots, but every one is leaving
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:33:19 mention of a players card found with the name of Mary Lou Danly, Paddock’s girlfriend
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:34:09 not over the radio, but someone with Bitsko’s earshot said there was a man with a rifle at Bellagio.  Again, that’s right across the street from Paris, where people are running from.
      </p>
      <p>
       @1:35:09 Sgt. Bitsko’s footage ends
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's where I've ended, too.  It's all very, very odd, don't you think?

       Good stuff! At 27:52 I think he’s saying “Get off the raisin with that shit” to the guy narrating entrance too the 29th floor or it sounds like he was asking SGT master for his position or phone number? We can see the officers in the video use their cellphones to coordinate simple positions like that.

       I think its more likely people ran in to those other resorts/ casinos and told people there was a shooting they were obviously traumatized and people at those other places called 911 reporting shootings.

       Yea, at 1:30:33 there’s a pretty decent cut in the footage. Where he’s standing a few feet away from where he was based on the walls. 
Good catch. Why did they cut it?

       This is great. Is there a way to sync this with the video shot at the concert or is this audio/communication all taking place roughly an hour after the incident but prior to the room entry?

       Pasting this from another thread: "The body cams appear to export in 30 minute segments. Between each segment, there was either a gap or an overlap. It was horrendous to deal with. I can't believe these are police grade bodycams. Anyhow, you can tell this is the case because of the 2 beeps from the body cam right before, during, or after each "edit".

       Where he mentioned and the cut I noticed , there is no beeping that happens. 
And it looks like a decent amount of time cut, a minute or more.

       Just playing the devil's advocate on an idea. I'm sure gun fire could be heard all up and down the strip that night. 911 centers were flooded with calls of a shooter somewhere on the strip. I could see it is totally plausible that different people at different locations reporting a shooter were reported by 911 as a shooter at the location that this report was coming from. So if hypothetically I was at the Bellagio, call 911 and said, "Somebody's open fire with an automatic weapon", then the 911 operator may assume that I'm hearing it coming from the Bellagio and not from somewhere down the street. Just a thought.

       I originally thought something similar, there were just random reports of gunfire throughout the night.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really listening to the radio all the way through, I think there's a clear pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       It starts from the Tropicana &amp; NYNY which sit on opposite corners of each other at Trop &amp; LV Blvd, and just a stone's throw from the Mandalay Bay. The next reports are from the Aria, then Caesars Palace, then the Bellagio, then the Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at a map of the resort corridor, that's a straight line up LV Boulevard.

       I think as people ran out of the concert, and back to their hotels the calls started coming in from those hotels. Think about it, the people whose hotels were closer to the shooting, went running in yelling there was a shooting, people see them and call 911 reporting a shooting at xyz hotel. Now as the people staying in those farther hotels start getting back the same thing happens.

       Wouldn’t that mean the person would be running straight up the street or shooting across traffic from a single side? It’s not easy to cross LV Blvd without having to take your time and use the pedestrian bridges.

       The casinos are so far apart from each other, and there is so much noise coming from all directions, it would be very hard to hear gun shots from another casino even one casino over. And if you heard the shots you would think its just Las Vegas noise. There is zero chance that the shots from Mandalay Bad could be heard at all at Aria, Bellagio, and Paris. They are very far away.

       Damn, I hate to say this but I think the pattern makes complete sense. If the shooting starts at Mandalay, you would think that as people are running away, they are saying there is a shooter, then it spreads throughout that area, people start calling 911 saying there is a shooter not knowing exactly where it is, then they run to the next casino, same situation over again.

       What would really help would be to hear the 911 calls from the people in the casinos. Was there gunfire in the background? Do the people  sound in danger and in a panic? Can they describe a gunman, or is it all just hearsay? Do they sound confused and not sure about what's happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Metros refusal to release ANY of the 911 calls from that night speaks volumes.

       First of all, great breakdown, thanks for the effort and attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to minimize or trivialize this shooting, but I always wondered how gov’t agencies cover up super spies in movies (like MI, James Bond, or True Lies) taking down some bad dudes, where there’s a lot of collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it’s not a “false flag”; could it possibly be a situation of a mission gone bad? The diversion assertions in this thread, plus the “Ocean’s 91 level” op made me think of this. It DOES sound like a movie plot, and maybe the LV Police are just as confused as the rest of us.

       I’m more inclined to believe this was some sort of FBI or ATF operation that went VERY south on them, and they shat themselves and came up with the Paddock did it story.  Paddock might have been an arms dealer and his customers went off script and killed a bunch of people, leaving the feds with a HUGE problem.

       I've been inclined to believe some sort of arms deal gone wrong. But only because he had so many guns in the room. Other then that it doesn't make sense to do an arms deal in a busy casino hotel. Especially when there's millions and millions of square miles of anonymous desert all around Las Vegas.

       Agreed, but a hotel provides security for both parties, and even more importantly provides a good cover story for being there in the first place.

       Another thing I'm having a problem with, why was he scouting other outdoor venue events? That would point directly to him planing a mass shooting. If this was an arms deal, what advantage would there be having an outdoor venue event nearby?

       A good point.  The only explanation I can imagine is he wanted there to be lots of people coming and going, so that no one would notice him or his gun dealing partners?

       That would make sense actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still points to a crazy guy shooting up a place. The excess of guns could be some OCD and wanted to pack everything because he didn't know what was gonna happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A silly example, my GF and I go to Vegas a lot and we never know what we're gonna end up doing, so we both way over pack. End up with dress shoes and blazer I never use, or swimwear when we never went to the pool.

       If Paddock just lost his mind and set out to kill as many people as he could, bringing all of his guns makes some sense, but there sure seems to be a lot of things that don’t make sense about it in general.

       Perhaps he just really didn’t like Aldeen? Also, if he scouted all these other venues, that would raise the question as to if he toted around all those guns to every venue.

       Thanks for this!  The following bit seems especially important:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        @1:25:51 talking about Paddock, “This guy’s been 419 for a minute”. Meaning he’s been dead for a while. LV Metro code for dead body is 419 But, he committed suicide because he thought SWAT was going to breach is room, and the jig was up, right? Right?

       Thank you for the breakdown. There were a few things i noticed that you did not mention...however you did excellent work! These are just things I noticed, so take it as youd like.
      </p>
      <p>
       *There were a few instances in the video where it was altered/edited. The one I first noticed was between the 39 min and 40 min mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Was the person on the helipad identified? Or the guy in the RV? Or the person in the black SUV? Could the black SUV contained the man being escorted out of the Tropicana?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Odd that the coroner report listed a different time of death, and the Swat dude saying that Paddock had been dead for a while. Goes against the first official stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Anyone spot Campos in the vids?
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, this isn’t making LVMPD look any better, perhaps doing just the opposite. Fighting the release of evidence that belongs to the public, bullshit spewing outta Lombardos mouth, all the delays...
      </p>
      <p>
       On the plus side though, atleast people are starting to question this shooting and others as a result of this shotty “investigation”. We’ll prolly never know the truth, but people like you and the OP of the video give us some faith.

       The body cams appear to export in 30 minute segments. Between each segment, there was either a gap or an overlap. It was horrendous to deal with. I can't believe these are police grade bodycams. Anyhow, you can tell this is the case because of the 2 beeps from the body cam right before, during, or after each "edit".

       I wonder if they have traced all the ballistics back to his specific weapons in the hotel room.  I'm sure it's an arduous task but it would also show if there were multiple shooters present.  If any of the projectiles don't match up with the guns in the room, then there's gotta be other shooters/guns.

       I'm glad you are using the footage. That was why I posted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the cuts and gaps, I can tell you they are ALL due to the gaps in the source footage. Each perspective was originally 4 clips, 8 clips total) that I put together. When syncing them, it became apparent that between each clip there were always 2 beeps. The beeps are either before the cut, during, or after. I also noticed that these cuts appear to have caused some time issues. In some cases, the cut between the clips was perfect. But in other cases, there was a either a gap or an overlap. Strange, right? You can get the
       <a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/search?vendor=ez&amp;amp;qu=1+october%C2%A0body+camera+video">
        original clips
       </a>
       and do this yourself to check out what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The body cameras that LVMPD uses are Axon Flex cameras. These beep twice every 2 minutes while recording an event. I couldn't find anything on their website though about the gaps/overlap. But I honestly don't believe it's nefarious at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent some time today putting together a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/8cecN19KbWk">
        new version
       </a>
       . Here are the improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Improved syncing throughout. I'm pretty new at video editing and I think I may have bumped things out of a few places before rendering the project. This new edit makes it much, much easier to see them speaking with each other
       </li>
       <li>
        Removed audio enhancements. I thought noise reduction would help, but I think it might have actually hurt some areas where the audio was really quiet. It's much louder now, but you can analyze the quiet parts far better.
       </li>
       <li>
        Removed the scanner audio. Again, I thought this would help, but it distracts greatly from the content of the body cams.
       </li>
       <li>
        Added info about missing footage. There is a lot of missing footage. Most of it is due to the bodycams being turned off. Some is due to the cutover problem I mentioned above. But all if it is something you should be aware of.
       </li>
      </ul>

       I would also like to get a copy of the police scanner audio on it's own, do you have a source where you got that?

       Tenone2017.com is the best place to get it as well as many other archived items from the shooting. I don’t run it, but the guy that does is very committed to backing up as much as possible.

       Ok so the bracket thing has always been the giveaway for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the bracket picture, the paint is bonded to the L bracket and not the door. IF and I really mean IF this was the bracket that was barricading the door. Then paddock had to have painted that door as well, then installed the bracket. You can screw any bracket to any door in any home that is previously painted and Its not going to do that. Especially if its been on for less than a day.

       Remember in Oceans 11 when the bad guys were dressed up like the "good guys"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, remember, @19.57, they said they already have a 4 man team upstairs and he says something about “another team” coming to them. That, plus Bitsko and Newton were met by another SWAT officer already on the 32nd floor before they even arrived.

       "Quick question: are there still guests in the other suites on that floor? Were they evacuated? If so, by whom?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an answer to the first 2 questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. There were guests still on the 32nd floor. Some were evacuated immediately and others were not evacuated until after the breaches happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       13 Month old baby Wake Purdue (parents are DJ Silver &amp; Jenna Purdue who were at the concert) was in room #32-130 while his mothers' Aunt Mary cared for him.
The FIT report states that officers had stopped doing evacuations approximately 2/3 of the way up the 100 hallway. It then states that officers found an infant alone in one of the rooms on the 32nd floor but was quickly reunited with the nanny who was in her own room directly across the hall. (This should mean they were evacuated AFTER the breach of #32-135 &amp; #32-134)
In Sgt Bitsko's body cam audio, officers are heard saying "Hands up! Hands up!", soon after they are heard saying "Block that door open, we gotta walk through, we got a baby coming out." 5 Minutes later while back inside of #32-135, they can be heard saying "Jenna Purdue. Baby. Jenna Purdue.... Baby. Get whatever [inaudible]." Wake &amp; Aunt Mary are now confirmed to be evacuated AFTER the breaches &amp; the negligent misfire took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tia Williams Newman was 3 or 4 rooms away from #32-135 on the East side of the hotel and could see muzzle flash parallel to her when she looked out her window. She heard police radio's in the hallway, then breaching of the door. She opened her door &amp; saw 10-12 officers who told her to get back in her room as they yelled "Get down!" in the breached room. Then the officers knocked and evacuated her out of Mandalay Bay and she was told to run South to safety. The next day, about evening time, her belongings were brought to her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shannon Durrett was in his room on the 32nd floor but was far enough away he wasn't sure what he was hearing. He heard the police breach the door. A while later the police burst into his room and got him down on the floor and searched him. He was then evacuated to the basement and then the Theater with hundreds of other people already in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laurie Burkhardt and some friends had returned to her room from the concert. They weren't in the room 5 minutes when her husband, Dustin, called &amp; told her to stay in her room, someone was shooting from Mandalay Bay direction. Laurie &amp; friends hid in the shower and could feel the machine gun fire through the floor on her feet. Dustin was shot through the thigh while fleeing. They stayed on the phone together for 52 minutes. Dustin refused medical help at first knowing that there were others who were far more injured than he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sonny Morgan was woke up by what he thought was fireworks. He could smell gunpowder. He called the front desk and was told to barricade himself in his room. A while later he heard an explosion (door breach). Soon after, 6 or 7 SWAT came into his room &amp; made sure he wasn't involved. He was then evacuated from Mandalay Bay &amp; told to run as far away as he could to get to safety where he saw "an astronomical number" of police cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meredith Rich was in her room when she heard what she thought was fireworks. She received group text messages about an active shooter and to double lock her door. She locked her door, turned off the lights and hid in the bathtub for 90 minutes. Another text message said the shooter was on her floor. She heard an alarm, a siren, a ruckus in the hallway, an explosion, and then saw smoke. The police came door to door asking to ID the occupants of each room. She followed their instructions &amp; got down on the floor and was patted down for weapons. She was then evacuated to the basement and then the Theater with hundreds of other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evacuated Quickly:
Brad Baker was in his 100 wing, 32nd floor room sleeping when he heard loud noises followed by police rushing into his room. He was told to get out quickly, that "We gotta go right now!". He got dressed quickly &amp; was taken to an elevator to wait for a few others. There was a 4 year old boy in there that made him think of his own young daughter. He left so fast he didn't take his phone or wallet with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Returned to 32nd Floor in Middle of Night:
Zach &amp; Jen Rupert had a room on the 32nd floor but were out on the Strip when the shooting occurred. They took shelter in a few different places for a while. Eventually they returned to Mandalay Bay and took the elevator up to the 32nd floor to get their belongings. They startled the police who also startled them. They were asked what they were doing there. They said they wanted to get their stuff. They were told to get back on the elevator and leave. "No civilians!" They found another hotel to stay for the night. They were eventually allowed to go get their things from their room
