       Before someone brings up the cut on his finger, multiple people who talked to him at the airport and on the airplane ride to Chicago testified during the trial that they did not see any cut or bandage on his finger. This video shows their testimonies.
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFj2Xb4q9g">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFj2Xb4q9g
       </a>
       So that means he didn’t get that cut during the murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not denying his involvement but it doesn’t make sense to me especially considering Ron Goldman was clearly in hand to hand combat with his killer. There’s also the fact the crime scene was a blood bath yet there was barely much blood in the Bronco, and much of the blood that was found was on the passenger side.

       I recommend watching Is O.J. Innocent? The Missing Evidence. The whole documentary is available on YouTube. It does a good job of debunking the Jason theory but still provides evidence that suggests another person was involved.

       Was that the BBC one? Because I saw a BBC doc many years ago, that was quite graphic. It showed Ron Goldman's knuckles. They were worn down to almost the bone. He put up an intense fight. Whoever he was fighting would have been messed up the next day. I wonder what condition Jason Simpson was the next day? Just asking questions here.

       No it’s not that one. Here’s the link to part one of it:
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLjnd5IYERkFi9P9QVw9kdmjbZMI-yboCi&amp;amp;v=_hsinuLUOxM">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLjnd5IYERkFi9P9QVw9kdmjbZMI-yboCi&amp;amp;v=_hsinuLUOxM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And exactly Ron’s knuckles indicated he was in hand to hand combat with his killer and like you said, put up an intense fight. OJ’s body didn’t indicate he was in any kind of violent struggle and the cut on his finger had to have been in Chicago. It just makes no sense. I’m not sure what Jason’s condition was like.

       I thought it was complete BS until I actually looked into it, but I honestly think his son, Jason Simpson committed the murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons
      </p>
      <p>
       - Diagnosed with "Intermittent rage disorder" aka "Jekyll and Hyde Syndrome"
      </p>
      <p>
       -  History of alcohol and drug abuse. DUI charges, Assault with a deadly weapon, multiple suicide attempts
      </p>
      <p>
       -  A self-written note to himself in which he wrote about killing anyone who hurt his loved ones and how he felt like a monster
      </p>
      <p>
       -  6 months prior to killings, Jason went to the emergency room in a schizophrenic rage after stopping his medication. He went back on for 4 months and stopped filling his prescriptions 2 months before the murders
      </p>
      <p>
       -  Previously tried to kill his GF with a knife as well as nearly seriously injuring others with knife incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       -  Nicole (his mother) had stood him up the night prior to the murders, telling him she would meet him for dinner and instead having dinner at a different restaurant with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       -  Murders happened between 945 and `1005pm and Jason has no alibi for where he was during this block of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       - His work time card was hand-written for the night of the murders even though the time clock was operating fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       - The hat found at the crime scene had hairs that did not match OJ's.
      </p>
      <p>
       - Photos of Jason wearing an identical hat were found.
      </p>
      <p>
       - OJ, after the murders, hired a top (expensive) attorney to represent Jason even though Jason was never named as a suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       - He trained in hand-to-hand combat as well as sharp-edge close quarters combat at the Naval Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
       - As you mentioned, OJ had no visible wounds indicating a struggle with a 3rd degree black belt or even a 12yr old child.
      </p>
      <p>
       - Jason owned a knife matching the murder weapon but forensics never tested the knife to see if it was a match.
      </p>
      <p>
       - His fingerprints were never taken, many fingerprints at the crime scene did not match OJ's
      </p>
      <p>
       - He was on probation for attacking someone with a knife at the time of the murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       - Blood and skin under Nicoles fingernails did not match OJ
      </p>
      <p>
       - Jason is currently MIA. Why hide out?

       I can’t lie the Jason theory does make you wonder. But I really recommend watching Is OJ Innocent? The Missing Evidence, it addresses some of these points. The documentary also actually shows footage of him in the present day, he was followed by a private investigator. Kind of messed up that they showed it on TV.

       The last docu I saw on it was the ESPN 5 part one and they never mention the son. Interesting.

       A friend of mine told me about Jason Simpson in passing and I dismissed it, but then I looked it up just to see what he was going on about. I was shocked to see the evidence against Jason. I thought it was another OJ ploy to try and sell more books or something, but I honestly think OJ was covering for his son and was willing to do a life sentence for him.

       Somebody told me in another post that Ron was the same height as OJ but idk. The thing is OJ retired from the NFL in 1979 and the murders occurred in 1994. Ron was no slouch himself.

       The night of the Bronco chase, that concluded with AC returning to OJ's home. When they pull in, Jason runs out, are there any close ups of Jason's face and body?

       It would be something if that were the case lol. But I’m convinced Alex Roldan is Khloe’s dad. The resemblance is uncanny.
