Why cannot take nasas photos of earth or content to be real - as most of their content is cgi .. all the photos of stars and photos of earth is cgi, even the moon landings and earth in the background was faked and cropped in later, we need a timelapse of earth from the moon, no cgi lol
Its going to get to a point where its IMPOSSIBLE to tell cgi from real videos!! We need to exploit this time now and come to a conclusion with REAL FACTS, DATA, EVIDENCE its a real video, if thats possible</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea also that could be true for the flat earth model, if the firmament ( stratosphere) was 5000miles high or so, the perspective matrix will make it seem like the stars, moon, sun are setting, they are all parralell to us! Check a 3d diagram to see how its possible if you cant imagine, if the stars arent paralell they could be on the edge of the dome, creating a dome shaped sky, the sky is an lcd screen? 5000 miles high? Possibly

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely.. </p>

<p>If this planet is flat, you should be able to see tall things over massive distances.. For instance, you could go to the top of the Empire State Building in New York, look to the north west and see the CN Tower in Toronto.. You&#39;ll find that you can&#39;t see it, because the earth isn&#39;t flat.. </p>

<p>You people are being made to look like fools, fuck all the science and bullshit, you can very easily tell that we do not live on a flat planet in the middle of the universe, or whatever other theory&#39;s go along with FE.. This is madness, and very telling of the times we live in, and what nearly a century of hardcore brainwashing has done to humanity..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually... given that the atmosphere acts much like water, it is conceivable that if the Earth is flat, light from extremely distant objects would become blocked, much like sunlight is blocked from reaching the deepest parts of the ocean. Something could be in direct line of sight, but so far away that the air between it and the observer blocks all the light coming from it.</p>

<p>What is <em>not</em> possible is for the sun to be perfectly visible as a disk in the sky but partially blocked by the surface - something that happens twice a day at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>Assuming the sun is 3,000 miles above the surface of a flat Earth, even when it is 12,000 miles away (the radius of the Flat Earth) it would be 14 degrees above the horizon - more than 20 times its own angular diameter.</p>

<p>To put that in perspective, for the summit of Mt Everest to be 14 degrees above the horizon, the observer would have to be within 20 miles of it.</p>

<p>The Burj Kalifa is 0.51 miles tall. If you were more than two miles away from the Burj Kalifa, it would not be able to block your view of the Flat Earth sun.</p>

<p>Put simply, from pretty much any place on earth, you should be able to see the Flat Earth sun at all times. This doesn&#39;t happen, and thus the Earth can not be flat.</p>

The visual perspective matrix actually proves the earth is flat- if the sun was 5000miles high, small, travelling parralell and in circular motion over the flat plane - it would look EXACTLY how it looks right now, if you watch the sun set over a desert, or a clear sky sun set over a calm ocean, you can see the sun setting and it gets so small on the horizon, prooving a small and local sun!!

Apparently theres a few feet of curvaure every 10 miles or so, theres places where you can see 200 miles across lakes and oceans and .. you can see buildings with telescopes, so the curvature they tell us isnt correct or consistent.
My bet is we are living in a super advanced snow globe, (simulation)m possibly) where we have paid money to live here , other than live the standard lifestyle in that alternate future, doesnt make sense for some cases, but who knows</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The sun doesn&#39;t get smaller... the sun <em>appears</em> to get smaller because much more of the sun&#39;s rays are being blocked by the vastly thicker atmosphere they are passing through.</p>

<p>If I shine a powerful flashlight into your eyes directly, it <em>appears</em> much larger because the &#39;sensors&#39; in your retina are overloaded. If I move a filter in front of that flashlight it will <em>appear</em> to get smaller because less of the light reaches your eyes and fewer of the &#39;sensors&#39; in your eyes are overloaded.</p>

<p>But here is a question for you... how does the sun set at all? If it is just a matter of it moving away from you, it should become so small you can;t even see it... but what actually happens is it is still large enough to be clearly seen while the &#39;edge&#39; of the Earth moves in front of it.</p>

<p>The sunset as we have all seen it is utterly impossible on a flat earth. The fact you can see <em>half</em> a sun twice a day proves the Earth is not flat.</p>

Gravity isnt even prooven, theres only a few universal laws - a nuclues stays in the centre of an atom - thats the main law that shapes the universe, sun stays the centre of the solar system? Same law, there is not gravity- just atoms everywhere obiding one law, density of atoms, air is lense dense, solid objects is more dense, we are inside a super advanced snow globe petri dish, past civilisations started to ensure life goes on is my guess, but until we get sum .

    <div class="md"><p>Here is something you can do today with practically zero effort.</p>

<p>Go to the highest place you can and watch the sun set.</p>

<p>If the earth is flat you should see the sun get smaller and smaller until it is nothing but a rapidly fading pinprick of light. You should be able to see the entire &#39;disk&#39; of the sun at all times. Nothing should ever block your view of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nseZkFT.gif">Flat Earth Sunset</a></p>

<p>If the earth is not flat, but is instead a sphere rotating around the sun and spinning on its own axis, the sun should remain visible until it reaches the horizon, at which point the earth should begin to block the lower edge of the sun. As the sunset progresses, the sun will still be visible as a disk, but more and more of the disk will be hidden behind the horizon.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ss3vs5B.gif">Sphere Earth Sunset</a></p>

<p>You can also watch a sunrise and see the reverse happening.</p>

<p>This is an extremely easy experiment to carry out and it is definitive.  The Earth <em>can&#39;t</em> be flat and block the disk of the sun. If you see that happening, you have proved beyond doubt that the earth is not flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: You can just do some math and prove it can&#39;t be flat.</p>

<p>How mathematically inclined are you?  Some pre-calculus (trigonometry and algebra) can prove that the earth can&#39;t be flat.  just ask, how far away would the sun have to be to get within 10 degrees of the horizon (about the height of your clenched fist at arms length above the horizon)?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the sun set at sea level, one mile up, two miles up, and even from an airplane.  All these sun sets looked basically the same, give or take weather.  This means that, regardless of how dense or thin the atmosphere is, it won&#39;t significantly bend light (unlike, say, water, which will bend light a lot).  We&#39;ll say it can&#39;t bend a beam of light more than 5 degrees (it&#39;s actually way less than one, but I&#39;m being generous here).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the sun setting now.  We&#39;ll need to know how high up the sun would have to be on the flat earth, but we can figure that out on the equinox.  On this day, at local noon, the sun will appear to be 45 degrees in the sky at the 45 degrees latitude (north or south doesn&#39;t matter).  That latitude is about 3000 miles from the equator, so we can use some trigonometry to find that the height of the sun must be 3000 miles (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/45-45-triangle.svg">45-45-90 triangle</a>).</p>

<p>Cool, now that we have the height of the sun, we can use another right triangle to find how far away it would have to be to get within even 10 degrees of the horizon.  We can make another right triangle, and use some more trigonometry to find out.  <a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">Here</a> is a handy calculator to help out.  We can use it and set &quot;side a&quot; as 3000, and &quot;angle A&quot; as 10 degrees.  We can then use it to find &quot;side b&quot; which will be our horizontal distance to the sun.  I got 17000 miles distant.  That distance is greater than from the north pole to the south pole.</p>

<p>As it gets closer to the horizon, this number just gets bigger and bigger.  Within 5 degrees it&#39;d have to be greater than the distance from the north pole to the south pole and back.  The distance quickly gets bigger than even the biggest flat earth models could hold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loose the biased attitude, okay so its sooo obvious to you thats its a globe
But if the sun was closer, smaller, was parallel to the flat earth, traveled in a circular path over the ground, the same &quot;math&quot; would fit the equation
What is your definitive proof that the earth isnt flat, or its a globe,
How can you know if the stars are rotating around us on a fake lcd screen made by the &#39;god&#39; pretending to be on a globe or some shit, 
You need to look at nasa to even consider the earth is flat, nasa is either stealing billions for the fun of it :] or they are hiding something desperately, look up nasa augmented virtual reality, nasa fail compilation, nasa cgi exposed, most are bs videos, but most of the popular ones have good content, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you need to read what I wrote.</p>

<p>Everything I said assumed the sun traveled in some kind of circular path above a basically flat earth.  The only reason I got to use the math I did is specifically because I was assuming that the earth was flat.  My equations wouldn&#39;t have worked on a globe.</p>

<p>So, unless you&#39;re going to tell me that trigonometry is wrong (in which case I&#39;d love to hear you justify that) I just can&#39;t see how a flat earth could possibly work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never seen a car drive off toward the horizon and not get smaller, ever. If perspective affects the apparent size of the sun, is should be doing EVERY time. If there is even ONE honest video of the sun not shrinking when it gets close to the horizon, then we know perspective can&#39;t be the cause.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to try to say the flat earth is right, you need to show what the globe should predict, show that it doesn&#39;t make the correct prediction, then show how flat earth makes a better prediction. Being able to match the globe model isn&#39;t enough.</p>
