        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>I&#39;m teaching a 9th grade English class, and we will be beginning Hunger Games next week. I&#39;m looking for examples of American propaganda that resemble that found in Hunger Games. </p>

<p>For instance, in the novel, Panem frames the sufferance of the children in the Games as a noble sacrifice. For the most part, poor children&#39;s lives are used to prop up the &quot;myth of power&quot; of the state. This kind of reminds me of Army recruiting videos...</p>

<p>Another is the massive economic and social disparity between the Capitol and the districts. This reminds me of how all senators and congressmen are millionaires, while the people of Flint have lead in their water.</p>

<p>A last example could be how the police are armed with military grade weapons, and are not held accountable for use of excessive force... something seen in America quite a bit.</p>

<p>Anyways, just throwing this out there as a Hail Mary. Does anyone know of any articles, videos, or documentaries that expose these types of subjects?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>&quot;One (out of many) great examples of a whistleblowing reporter is investigative journalist and former CBC News reporter Sharyl Attkisson.</p>

<p>She delivered a hard-hitting TEDx talk showing how fake grassroots movements funded by political, corporate, or other special interests very effectively manipulate and distort media messages.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYAQ-ZZtEU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYAQ-ZZtEU</a></p>

<p>&quot;Another great example is Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winning journalist at CC, who said that they are routinely paid by the US government and foreign governments to selectively report and even distort information on certain events. She has also indicated that the government has editorial control over content.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A classic example is the Nayirah testimony,(babies in incubators girl) that is more representative of how propaganda is mediated through public relations firms, and astroturf campaigns. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfVs3WaE9Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfVs3WaE9Y</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nayirah testimony was a false testimony given before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990, by a 15-year-old girl who provided only her first name, Nayirah. The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H. W. Bush in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah&#39;s last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيرة الصباح‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by an American public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government. Following this, al-Sabah&#39;s testimony has come to be regarded as a classic example of modern atrocity propaganda.</p>

It&#39;s not really about protecting so and so.  It&#39;s not about punishing Assad when their is a chemical attack in Syria or it&#39;s not about removing Assad so that Syrians can live well.  Not when the US and its allies have supported the same terrorists wrecking havoc in Syria since 2011. Fighting terrorist and ISIS since what, 2011, when we first heard of &quot;ISIS&quot; terrorists in what, 2014? And because ISIS invaded Iraq. </p>

<p>The military&#39;s splashy shows at football and sporting events always reminds me a little of Hunger Games when they&#39;re entering the stadium and everyone is cheering for these heroes..who are being told to go kill their fellow man... while we cheer them on and have fireworks shows and cheerleaders... </p>

<p>Corporate - Comedy Central tv show - had an excellent episode on 9/11 called &#39;Remember Day&#39; where they kind of blended the way we&#39;ve completely commercialized the holidays with our extreme reverence for all things 9/11 + capitalism: <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/corporate-season-1-finale-9-11-christmas-remember-day-1201938778/">http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/corporate-season-1-finale-9-11-christmas-remember-day-1201938778/</a> (also the episode on “The Powerpoint of Death” is pretty amazing and kind of satirizes the vast power of the military industrial complex and how the business of war is so disconnected from the results of its products, etc..)</p>

<p>Apparently, the book was inspired by reality television &amp; Iraq War</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel-surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the Iraq war. She described how the two combined in an &quot;unsettling way&quot; to create her first ideas for the series</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The origin story of The Hunger Games series is perhaps quite relevant.</p>

<p>Here is an article from ABC discussing (among other things) the juxtaposition of reality TV and war footage that inspired the series: <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/meet-woman-created-hunger-games/story?id=15970640">https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/meet-woman-created-hunger-games/story?id=15970640</a></p>

<p>If you Google &quot;Suzanne Collins video Scholastic&quot; you can see the interview videos that are mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>Also: this popped up when I was googling for the ABC article and it might be interesting: <a href="https://www.cosa.k12.or.us/sites/default/files/materials/events/6-4_hunger_games_reality_tv_pt.pdf">https://www.cosa.k12.or.us/sites/default/files/materials/events/6-4_hunger_games_reality_tv_pt.pdf</a></p>

<p>Edward Bernays is the father of modern public relations.  Sigmund Freud&#39;s nephew, developed a template for engineering the consent of a democratic society using multimodal propaganda utilizing manipulation not only of news media, but also science, medicine, staging real world events, staging demonstrations, and &quot;organic&quot; movements. His work is the root of American propaganda techniques for the last 90 years.  No discussion of propaganda can be complete without not only discussing him, but also his techniques, and examples of his techniques in modern society.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if this will be helpful to <a href="/u/the_human1st">/u/the_human1st</a> but maybe others will find it interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The food pyramid is the same thing farmers use to fatten cattle. The whole low-fat movement in the 1980-90&#39;s was pretty much just a propaganda campaign to get Americans to buy sugar and corn based products instead.</p>

<p>Although this is still taught in schools today, and this could get you in trouble because so many people believe in it even though it is state sanctioned propaganda.</p>

<p>Another fun one is operation paperclip (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip</a>), where the US brought a bunch of Nazi scientists and doctors to the US after WW2 and gave them high ranking appointments in government positions. Many of the founding members of NASA were actually former Nazis. It is even speculated that Lyme disease came from Lab 257 on Plum Island which was an FDA research facility of the coast of Lyme Connecticut that was overseen by a former a Nazi scientist.</p>

<p>While it isn&#39;t so much direct propaganda, NASA is often propagandized as this innovative force for good despite the fact it was founded by a bunch of Nazis and pretty much used for propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>The FDA is often propagandized as protecting the American people, yet they run secret bioweapons research programs and let things like Lyme disease escape the lab.</p>

<p>Then you have the USDA promoting a food pyramid that is essentially the same thing farmers use to fatten cattle that has no basis in science or reality. Go visit r/keto or r/paleo if you want to learn how ketosis and fat / protein consumption is actually supposed to work.</p>

<p>Century of Self (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self</a>) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s</a></p>

<p>Books: Edward Bernays “Propaganda” as well as a copy of the book “The Devil’s Chessboard” by David Talbot. It would also be wise to research “Operation Mockingbird” as well as “Project MKUltra” and “COINTELPRO”. These are NOT conspiracies, but established and unclassified programs from within our own government.</p>
