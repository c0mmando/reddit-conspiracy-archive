<p>Anyone who wants to repurpose and repost this collection may do so with my blessing, I don’t ask for a shout out or anything, if you can make a post that goes viral and nets you massive karma, go right ahead - in fact, I must insist that you do so! I’ve said what I have to say about it, all I want are for these images to enter the public consciousness in order to create debate and hopefully affect change in the perception of ourselves as a species.</p>

<p>I didn’t create or alter any of these images in any way, to the best of my knowledge all are sourced from verified American or Russian space agency pictures. To the best of my knowledge, all of the Mars rover anomalies can be verified by checking the raw gigapans: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.gigapan.com/profiles/pencilnev/gigapans">http://www.gigapan.com/profiles/pencilnev/gigapans</a>.</p>

<p>Although every post that I have read on this subject generates multiple comments declaring that there’s nothing but ordinary rocks to be seen, everyone I have shown the photos to in person has pronounced at least a few of them artificial - curious. Your initial impulse upon first glance may to write a diatribe disparaging the perception or intellect of those who think that there is evidence of intelligent design here, but before you do, I ask that you show the photos to a few friends and ask their opinion. The results will probably surprise you. At the current point in time, opinion about these objects is simply an opinion, nothing more. Indications are that this could change in the near future, however.</p>

Plus can&#39;t tell moon from sun in the daytime sky anymore. As a kid, seldom saw the moon in the daytime sky now its like they enhanced the topography of the moon noticeable to naked eye even during daytime; ironically the sun is hazed out and whiter, brighter, yet smaller appearing now almost identical to the moon in most every way except on clear, non-cloudy days.</p>

<p>The official explanation is consistent with a globe earth model, so it&#39;s a weak argument for FE.</p>

<ol>
<li>a rocket must rapidly escape the densest layers of atmosphere to conserve fuel during the acceleration stage. A vertical ascent accomplishes this.</li>
<li>as altitude builds, the rocket tilts towards an orbital trajectory and accelerates until angular momentum overcomes gravity</li>
<li>the real trajectory is an ellipse, but it resembles a parabola from a fixed ground position.</li>

<p>Just my 2c on FE debating technique, not an endorsement for either explanation. Perceived or subjective evidence creates noise. The only convincing arguments are those the other side struggles to explain.</p>

<p>Indeed. What <em>would</em> that look like? How would you independently prove a spacecraft exits the atmosphere and enters orbit?</p>

<p>The official explanation for an arc launch trajectory elegantly reconciles with observation. It&#39;s a futile endeavour to use that same observation as evidence for a counterargument.

<p>Which specific part(s) of the official explanation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn">gravity turn launches</a> does not reconcile with ground-based parabola observation?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Outside view: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyq5eN9C4Cc">uncut HD video</a> of a rocket from launchpad until 4-5 mins into the flight. If we put aside for one moment the source, or the possibility it&#39;s CGI, what is lacking from this footage? What would you expect to see that isn&#39;t shown?</p>

<p>Inside view: agreed, I haven&#39;t seen this either. What would an inside view prove that an outside camera doesn&#39;t already do better?</p>

<p>The &quot;parabola from ground, ellipse from space&quot; effect can be reproduced in <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a>, all other space simulators can demonstrate the same phenomenon.</p>

<p>The trajectory just <em>looks different</em> from the ground versus a simulated static viewpoint in space. In this case the official explanation reconciles with observation using a simulated launch and a globe earth model.</p>

<p>Ok, but no spacecraft has ever been launched into or out of an orbit around a celestial body. So this is entirely moot. Same with a simulator. You can simulate something that never happens in real life all day. It’s just a computer simulator executing a preset algorithm. </p>

<p>The main reason is the primary sources of evidence are, admittedly, full of shit and completely untrustworthy.</p>

<p>This begs the question then: can orbital mechanics be proven even in <em>theory</em>? If so, what would acceptable proof look like?</p>

<p>I’m open minded to alternative explanations for “space”, but if they are not at least as coherent and elegant as the maths and physics that forms the basis for the official story then why should anyone entertain them?

</blockquote>

<p>You mean the famous three-body problem? Granted, it’s a bugger to model, many natural processes are hard to model, but it can certainly be explained in theory.</p>

<p>Order eventually comes from chaos given enough time. That’s a straightforward logical progression for any finite system, one which you can see all around you. “Order” is a relative term, because given even more time all systems yield completely to the second law of thermodynamics... eventually. The explanation (whether you accept it or not) is that we are in a period of apparent order after a very long period of chaos, with only eternal entropy to look forward to in the long run. Sigh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earth/Moon Vs Sun/Saturn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also explained by the same theory. Earth and moon act like a single body at the (claimed) distances to the sun and Saturn. Whether getting further away or closer, the <em>relative change</em> in gravity to one nets off exactly against the <em>relative change</em> to the other. For the moon to consider the sun a more attractive proposition than Earth, the sun’s gravitational pull would need to increase against the moon more than it increases against Earth, but given the “virtual single body” dynamic, and the huge distances involved, any differences are so tiny as to be negligible.</p>

<p>So, Sun and Moon remain together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s not some magic height you reach where pop now you’re just magically floating in an oval orbit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite right! LEO relies quite simply on going fast enough to continuously skim the globe’s circumference, effectively maintaining altitude by cancelling out the “downward” gravitational vector with the upward component of all that tangential velocity. On Earth, orbital altitude is necessary to avoid atmospheric drag which would otherwise prevent reaching minimum orbital velocity. Orbital mechanics has nothing to do with gravity getting weaker the higher up you go until you get really far away and have to model Lagrange points for trips to the moon...</p>

<p>Incidentally, with no atmosphere you could (theoretically) orbit the (textbook) moon just feet above its surface, although horizontal speed would have to be insanely high. Theoretically ;-)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In my experience I can’t detect oxygen, nor electrons. Yet here I am, breathing air while typing on this wretched smartphone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“the lunar lander looks like a fake cardboard prop”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed! Also, “homeless tweaker shelter” is my favourite ever description of the “lunar lander”... lol :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for explaining space, we don’t have to explain that other than to realize that it looks as though no one is going there and the Red Hot Chili Peppers were correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that Newtonian mechanics is such a consistent, elegant way to model orbital motion and it fits what we observe in the sky it’s too satisfying to abandon for such an ... empty replacement.</p>

<p>If on the other hand an equally compelling alternative model could be concocted it would have my full attention. Simon Shack’s Tychos and JLB’s “Bon Earth model” don’t really hit the spot either, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Can you explain the 3 body problem in theory?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Anything</em> can be explained with a theory. A general top-down approach by definition does not require specifying inputs from the bottom up. Contrast with models, which requires starting from a set of first principles at the bottom and building on each layer until a satisfactory result is obtained.</p>

<p>Do theories prove ideas? No. They put the idea in context for further discussion. The lack of context is what’s missing from a viewpoint such as “space isn’t real”.  Fair enough, now what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it doesn’t mean it exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. The question then naturally pivots to “what  could, in theory, prove that space exists?”</p>

<p>Unfortunately that answer appears to be “nothing” because there are no trusted sources of evidence.</p>

<p>I accept that I personally will likely never have empirical proof of “space”, but that fact doesn’t mean space isn’t real. The fact I can’t personally corroborate doesn’t naturally lead to the conclusion that reaching space is impossible, or that space doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>Alternative theories about what lies above require <em>even more</em> explanation than the official story, with less supporting evidence, no math, and as a result, no models universally compatible with empirical observation down here on terra firma. Alternative models, in my experience, usually fail before the official models.</p>

<p>In other words, the alternatives do a worse job at describing the same concepts.</p>

<p>That’s why my position, for now, is that the official description of space is good enough, and still the best explanation I’ve found, even though I freely admit I can’t prove it.</p>
