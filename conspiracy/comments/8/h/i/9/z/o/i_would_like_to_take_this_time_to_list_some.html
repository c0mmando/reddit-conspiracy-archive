<p>For taking our most sophisticated weapons technology and stealing it for yourself without paying the American patent holders, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For taking that high-tech military technology and selling it to our enemies, such as the Russians and Chinese, thus further endangering us, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using that weaponry in a sustained attack against a United States ship, the USS Liberty, in an attempt to sink her, thus preventing US servicemen from revealing to the rest of the world information concerning the war crimes they witnessed you commit against Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Desert during the Six Day War, as well as for the purposes of dragging the US into yet another one of your murderous adventures, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For killing 35 and wounding 170 American sailors aboard the USS Liberty, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For bribing the United States government into covering it up, preventing any justice from being done for the benefit of the families of the lost sailors – as well as the American People, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For sending your agents into Egypt and blowing up American buildings for the purpose of blaming the Arabs in an event known as the Lavon Affair, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For sending your agents into Libya during the Reagan administration, and broadcasting radio messages in Arabic that were designed to sound like “terrorist cell planning” so that the US would initiate military strikes against Khadafi in an event known as Operation Trojan Horse, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For withholding information from us concerning the planned attacks against the US Marine barracks in Lebanon, attacks you knew about through your moles in the Islamic world and about which you deliberately refused to warn us in order to further your interests against the Arabs, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For employing Jonathon Pollard, an American serviceman paid to spy for Israel in order to steal even more of our National Security secrets for your parasitic purposes, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For breaking every agreement you have made with your Arab neighbors, stealing their land, displacing, murdering, and treating them like the animals you see them as, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents within the first Bush administration to involve us in the first Gulf War, causing the deaths of American men and women, and exposing our servicemen to whatever bio-weapons were and are responsible which have led to Gulf War Syndrome, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For your role in the September 11 attacks in this country, and for blackmailing and bribing the US government into deporting back to Israel the 100 or more intelligence agents that were arrested after the attacks, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For suppressing the information from the American people of your involvement in the September 11 attacks and sending us in the wrong direction in search of answers, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using one of your agents in the US Army Weapons Lab to steal anthrax and distribute it into our mail system, terrorizing US citizens and killing several in order to blame the Arabs, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the US Government, namely, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, and the rest into initiating this war in the Middle East so that you could bring to heel all the enemies you have made during the last 50 years, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the media to lie to us on a minute by minute basis about the war, lying to us as to how “just” this cause is, and what the real reasons behind it are, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using your agents in the Christian Evangelical community, such as Falwell, Graham, Swaggert, Robertson and the rest who praise you as God’s chosen people and further keep Americans in the dark about who you really are what you have done, and what you are truly about, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For bringing idiots like Limbaugh, Liddy, Hannity, Beck, O’Reilly and Savage to the forefront as paid liars who will support you and further lead Americans astray, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For making America your attack dog, and for sending her sons and daughters to fight and die in all your future wars, we bless thee. For using your influence in the media to hide the real statistics about the war, the dead and wounded on both sides, we bless thee.</p>

<p>For using us in such a way that not only further inflames the Arab world against us, but as well has succeeded in our alienating ourselves against those nations with whom we have been friendly for over a century, we bless thee.</p>

<p>And finally, for using your influence in our media and academia to flood our minds with pornography and lies, as well as inculcating in us a hatred for our history, religion, and culture, for dividing our nation between races and sexes, and for releasing into our society all of your plagues and filth that have left us a rotted out corpse of a once great nation, oh Israel, our friend,</p>

<p>We bless thee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and Mark Glenn is a piece of shit human being.  You can find that out in about 5 minutes of reading his propaganda that he&#39;s a bigot and a bit of a nut job.</p>

<p>Israel isn&#39;t perfect, of course.  Like most countries they have quite a few skeletons in their closet.  What you won&#39;t see is a fair representation of any of the true issues involving Palestine, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey on anything he writes.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, this sub doesn&#39;t do a good job of detecting and stopping agenda groups, especially fringe religious groups.</p>

<p>**** Here&#39;s an ultra-condensed politicotruthpill of the past 80 years:  ****</p>

<p>There be oil.  There be political intrigue.  Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Syria have lots of reasons to hate the UK, US and Russia because everyone lied to them, tricked them, manipulated them, assassinated their leaders and effectively stole their oil.  Post-WWII theJjews flooded in, changed the whole economic landscape, then overthrew the governments and created an independent state.  The UK opposed it but the US tacitly supported it because of fear of Russia.  Russia sends lots of arms to arab coutnries.  Arab countries try to destroy Israel, fail, then settle in to kill each other.  Russia&#39;s plan doesn&#39;t work.  Palestinians effectively ousted by Israel, but none of their (literal) cousins will let them move in.  Literally shoot them if they cross the boarder.  Lots of crossing the other way though by holy warriors angry at Israel.  Lots and lots and lots of bloodshed in the name of Yaweh and Allah, two names for the same dude from the same books by the same author.  Pretty obvious case for religion being crazy and dangerous, but nobody cares.  Every attempt to integrate palestinians into Israel fails because of religion.  Jews and Arabs are just alike in one thing: they both have religions that send you to eternal hell if you ever intermarry with the other side.  Palestinians can&#39;t leave and can&#39;t join the main country.  Every time they get strong enough, they start killing people.  They can&#39;t expand and are over-populated.  Mess here, mess there, mess everywhere.  Nobody is in the right.  There is no easy solution.</p>

<p>=== end condensed politicotruth pill ===</p>

<p>My advice is to tell people to fuck right off if they try to get you into any of it.  The only hard facts you will find is that everyone involved on both sides are lunatics and guilty of atrocities.  Everyone is ready to lie to you in order to get you involved, even people that don&#39;t live there because of oil.</p>

<p>Every time I try to figure out why someone not from the region or related to someone from the region is raging about any of them I invariably find that they&#39;ve swallowed some propaganda horse-shit hook line and sinker.</p>

<p>I predict (but certainly don&#39;t know) that as soon as oil is no longer an issue the rest of the world is going to quietly ignore the whole region until someone does something permanent.  Then well all tell them how awful it is and try to forget it.</p>
