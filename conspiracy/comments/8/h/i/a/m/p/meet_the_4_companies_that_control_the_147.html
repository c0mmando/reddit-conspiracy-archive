<p><strong>McGraw-Hill</strong> -- which owns Standard &amp; Poor’s</p>

<p><strong>Northwestern Mutual</strong>  --  which owns Russell Investments, the index arm of which runs the benchmark Russell 1,000 and Russell 3,000</p>

<p><strong>CME Group</strong> -- which owns 90% of Dow Jones Indexes</p>

<p><strong>Barclay’s</strong>  --  which took over Lehman Brothers and its Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, the dominant world bond fund index. </p>

<p>Together, these four firms dominate the world of indexing. And in turn, that means they hold real sway over the world’s money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there is a very small group who control nearly everything. I also think there is some overlap between those mentioned in article who control stock prices and those who control the actual stocks. From this article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an internal study his firm recently performed found that the vast majority of mutual funds defined as actively managed see 95% of the assets they hold determined by an index. That means just 5% of actively managed funds really are driven by the active manager&#39;s judgment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are saying here that managers buy stocks based upon indexes and those who control the indexes control stock prices. This is largely true, which is why I said the article is &quot;interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>However, when you look at who actually controls the decisions made inside the companies, you have to go by who actually controls the boards. To do that, you look at who has the most shares. To control a large company, you must hold more than 20 percent of voting shares (yes, I said 20 percent not 50 percent as per SEC rules). </p>

<p>You will not find any single owner with that kind of holding for any of these companies.</p>

<p>BUT you will find a few dozen names that, when combined together, own more than 20 percent of most of these companies. These names are the real controllers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, the word prostitute has historically meant a woman who had sex out of wedlock, precisely to shame women who do not incentivize the institution of marriage. Women who disincentivize marriage by giving it away without commitment destroy the gravy train for all women. Whether a woman gets paid or not simply does not matter in the grand scheme of things, because she does not guarantee paternity and does not incentivize male productivity.</p>

<p>The adult man is the most desctructive force on the face of the planet (that we know of). He is also the most creative. We want to harness the creativity to build society. It&#39;s not about the woman.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I could use that line of reasoning as an argument for the opposite conclusion. Capitalism has certainly increased global production and consumption to levels undreamed of in previous centuries, but production and consumption are rather odd figures to assign to an &quot;objective&quot; assessment. </p>

<p>Yes, our technology has improved exponentially, in some part due to the particular pressures of capitalism, yet many would likely have been discovered even without capitalism. Most of the math and physics from previous centuries which provides the basis for much of our modern technology was more a product of the aristocracy than of capitalism.</p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t even take into account the fact that in the US, the richest country in the world, millions of people go hungry each night. Capitalism will always end up taking over the state, because that is what the evolutionary forces of capitalism dictate: those corporations are successful which outlast other corporations, and controlling the state is an evolutionary advantage. </p>

<p>We cannot fight this nature, we must adopt it and excel in it, the philosophy of corporatism, of many people acting as one body. This is what the corporations and states do, they act as one body, but with only a few dictating the actions. Only a similar body made up of we the people acting as one can possibly stop them, which is why they have always ensured we remain divided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, if you&#39;re starving in America, you genuinely don&#39;t deserve to get food. I&#39;d rather subsist than die. Also: I eat mostly cheap hamburger meat and eggs on about 50 dollars a week, which is 100 dollars less than the SNAP allowance in my state. </p>

<p>One last statement on this subject that I&#39;d like people to consider when they read my comments: I was raised in a fairly low income environment and I believe I have a very good grasp on the mindset of the poor in America. Yes, people <em>choose to be low income</em>. They make bad saving, purchasing, and career decisions. They do not apply themselves and figure a way out of poverty. They actually prefer to exist in their impoverished state because of the reason I gave above. <em>Their lives aren&#39;t miserable</em>. They have cable, broadband Internet, smart phones, and modern televisions. They have SNAP if they can&#39;t afford food, but most of them can, and they are typically obese. <em>They are content with their poverty because poverty in America is infinitely better than poverty in a third world country. These people aren&#39;t &quot;oppressed&quot;; they lack initiative.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t know much then?</p>

<p>Let me tell you how it works. Single mother takes care of two kids. Gone all day working full time, does not qualify for SNAP. Kids eat the shitty packaged foods their mother can afford, and the shitty free lunches at school. Most of this food is such shit that it does not get eaten at all, despite being &quot;edible&quot;. It gets nibbled on and thrown out, in favor of bumming a tastier bite to eat off a friend. The kids (and mother) stay thin because they are all getting about 500-1000 calories a day. They probably have to choose between having cable, internet and smartphones because there is not enough income to pay all three.</p>

<p>Calling these families lazy or undeserving of food is disgusting. And there are a lot of these families, look up divorce rates. These mothers work their assess off while you write bullshit on the internet with your smartphone.</p>
