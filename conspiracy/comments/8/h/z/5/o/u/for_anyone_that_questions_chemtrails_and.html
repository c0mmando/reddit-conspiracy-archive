        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The government contracts out companies, of which there are MANY to do jobs which spray chemicals into the air/clouds to change the weather. This is under the guise of &quot;Cloud Seeding&quot; which aims to fabricate more rain to produce more water for the livelihood of the farming industry and to prevent water shortages. They can also do things like create lightning and thunderstorms and even decide what size of hail they want in the storm!</p>

<p>For example there is a company that the government uses called Weather Modification Incorporated. Just the name itself tell you where they do. [HELLOOO] This company has been doing this for 50 YEARS under the pretense of said &quot;Cloud Seeding&quot;. Which is literally spraying chemicals into the air, into clouds, onto crops that people ingest and onto people themselves. If anyone says that this is not Chemtrails on a basic level then they are either BLIND or in denial. Multiple of their employees has even admitted that they do indeed spray chemicals from their plans. </p>

<p>[there is also a video of a man talking to their receptionist. She admit when questioned that yes, they do spray chemicals from planes. Also a video of one of their Pilots talking about spraying Silver Iodide; both on youtube, just look it up]</p>

<p>From their website:
&quot;Weather modification, commonly known as cloud seeding, is the application of <strong><em>scientific technology</em></strong> that can enhance a cloud&#39;s ability to produce precipitation&quot; </p>

<p>From Wikipedia:
&quot;Cloud seeding is a form of weather modification, a way of changing the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds, by <strong><em>dispersing substances into the air</em></strong> that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud.&quot; </p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;The most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide, potassium iodide and dry ice (solid carbon dioxide).&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>&quot;An electronic mechanism was tested in 2010, when infrared laser pulses were directed to the air above Berlin by researchers from the University of Geneva&quot;</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;Silver iodide is highly insoluble in water. Chronic Exposure/Target Organs: Chronic ingestion of iodides may produce “iodism”, which may be manifested by skin rash, running nose, headache and irritation of the mucous membranes. Weakness, anemia, loss of weight and general depression may also occur&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/x6F6bJz">http://imgur.com/x6F6bJz</a> </p>

<p>This picture linked shows a list of all the jobs they are currently doing in the U.S. They are also doing this in other countries, as you can see on their website: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.weathermodification.com/projects.php">http://www.weathermodification.com/projects.php</a></p>

<p>Just a couple of interesting places they are affiliated with:
-Corporate Member of the Weather Modification Association 
-Member of the U.S. Saudi Arabia Business Council 
-Member of the North Dakota Chamber of Commerce </p>

<p>This proves two things:
1. That the government hires 3rd party companies to alter the weather often enough to support an entire industry
2. Chemtrails are real and are sprayed by these companies </p>

<p>This is just 1 of many companies doing this. Imagine how many more companies have lists like this. And think about all of the things these companies do that aren&#39;t advertised on their website for the world to see. This is the air we all breathe, all over the world, all of those chemicals mixed together. Can you smell that fresh air? /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>B-b-but the shills told me that aircraft only leave behind normal jet fuel combustion byproducts. They also said if there was a classified program thats not on the list above, then too many people would know about it to keep it secret and we would already know all about it. The shills also told me that I don&#39;t understand science if I believe that the government is actively manipulating the weather and that they would laugh at me - the last thing I need is for some anonymous keyboard warrior that relentlessly patrols the conspiracy forums laughing at me for my lack of scientific knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the contrary. I don&#39;t waste my time trying to convince anyone who firmly believes in chemtrails. If they can&#39;t see the obvious flaws in the narrative, such as how do you get that massive plume of chemicals into that tiny airplane, and still have room for the passengers?, then me talking about phase change deposition and other scientific stuff is going to leave them a bit confused. But for every person here trying to convince everyone that we&#39;re all being sprayed like ants, there are many other people who are just curious and have an open mind.

    <div class="md"><p>For someone into their &quot;science stuff,&quot; your sentence &quot;how do you get that massive plume of chemicals into that tiny airplane, and still have room for the passengers?&quot;</p>

<p>Did you not read the thread? are you being obtuse? Chemicals would be in tanks that are dispersed into the exhaust gases on military, or light aircraft that are flown by military contractors under &quot;cloud seeding,&quot; &quot;solar radiation management,&quot; &quot;aerial spraying of pollution dispersants&quot;. There would not be many passengers.. and none are going to be civilians on a regularly scheduled/chartered flight.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Then why do you chemtrailers post pictures of contrails coming off passenger airplanes, claiming that the sheer amount of trails is proof they are chemtrails? Whether you dissolve it in the fuel of hold it in tanks, you still have to carry enough up to five miles altitude to create those spectacular clouds. And what would happen if you burned it in the engine? Probably instant engine failure. It&#39;s supposedly aluminium they are spraying, right? Aluminium burns to form an oxide which is one of the harshest industrial abrasives there is..... It would strip the turbine stage of a jet engine in seconds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your position is lost with &quot;chemtrailers.&quot; I can&#39;t speak for all of those who look up and see, but if you check Flight Radar against many of the flight paths leaving X&#39;s or very long trails that disperse into cloud they are not civilian. This is from personal observation which I&#39;m sure you will balk at. Surely you can&#39;t be serious in regards to the jet engine having the &quot;pollution dispersant,&quot; injected into the bypass flow before combustion happens. It is released into the EXHAUST, none of that would affect any of the &quot;turbine stage,&quot; of the engine. It wouldn&#39;t even necessarily have to come out of the wings aft of the engines, just the empennage. Do you even know how many turbines or stages there are? How an engine works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The existence of cloud seeding and other forms of weather modification (look into how much China are doing) does not mean that contrails = &quot;chemtrails.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the disputed fact, since most people who speak about chemtrails point to contrails, usually those left behind by large commercial passenger and freight aircraft, which are an easily explained phenomena if you understand cloud formation.</p>

<p>This is like pointing to the existence of skywriters and saying &quot;Hah! Spraying chemicals!&quot; every time you see a contrail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weather manipulation goes back over 70 years, so you really have no idea if the persistent contrails are the result of normal jet engine combustion or not.

<p>Are you suggesting that we&#39;re lied to about both the combustion reaction and the formation of clouds then?</p>

<p>Because knowledge of those explains contrails which any plane can produce under the right atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p>Or is every plane and pilot in on this and only spraying under those conditions, combined with the lies about how clouds and combustion work?</p>

<p>Could you elaborate on the technicalities of what you&#39;re suggesting? &quot;RF signal blocking/propagation, satellite imagery blocking, spreading smart tags and biowarfare operations.&quot; I would be very interested to learn how you think contrails could be those things, unless you&#39;re saying that this takes place separately to contrails, as cloud seeding does (need to know if you think contrails are &quot;fake&quot; first I guess)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cloud seeding was only secret when the US was developing it as a weapon in the Vietnam War. Trying to spin it as a conspiracy is a bit lame when you can find a company that&#39;ll make it rain on your garden in the phone directory. There is no connection between cloud seeding and so-called &#39;chemtrails&#39;. Seeding is done at low level, up to about 10,000 feet, by planes flying through existing rain clouds to make them start raining on cue. The contrails coming off airliners are happening much higher at 25,000 to 40,000 feet, and are just ice crystals. </p>

<li>Yes. Plenty. Both the US and UK governments have done secret spraying to study how nerve gas would disperse. This was done using aircraft, trucks, and ships moored offshore.</li>
<li>Apparently they don&#39;t need to (see above). There is an international ban on any geoengineering which would have effects across national boundaries. Some scientists are arguing for Stratospheric Aerosol Injection to be used, to cut down on sunlight. This could only be done world wide and once started it couldn&#39;t be stopped. It is a terrible idea.</li>
<li>Probably. They certainly wouldn&#39;t tell us if one of their experiments went wrong; they&#39;d explain it away as something else. It is believed one of the early cloud seeding experiments in Operation Popeye was on the hippies at Woodstock.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding question 1: Since there is a documented history of the government spraying toxic aerosols for a multitude of reasons in the past, what is the exact date that all of those types of activities ceased?</p>

<p>Regarding question 2: are there any exceptions to the ban on spraying chemical aerosols? I think you already know that the answer is yes, there are many exceptions, although you are reluctant to admit that for some reason.</p>

<p>Regarding question 3: If you do not know that innocent people in both the US and UK have died as a direct result of military aerosol testing, then I have to believe that you are not as knowledgeable about the subject as you claim and therefore can be mostly ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much it. There is a longer explanation you might like. Feel free to use it yourself. </p>

<p>&quot;Real contrails only last a few seconds. Anything else is a chemtrail&quot;. That is an often-repeated myth. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a> and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy isn’t weather modification for me it’s the last part you speak of, “poisoning us” that I just don’t buy. My grandfather has been a pipe welder for 40+ years. You say yourself in the Og post it’s been going on for “50 years”. So, if that’s the case, my gramps should be falling apart, from not only these “poisonous” chemicals falling on him from the sky, but, from breathing in welding fumes for 12+ hours for 40 years. So he’s at least 2x more susceptible to cancers or tumors from all these chemicals, yet I have to work my ass off just to keep up with him. No tumors, no cancer, no major heath risks. And he was in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada, all desert areas where a lot of “chemtrail” action happens. I believe they use weather modification, which in itself is the problem, but saying we’re poisoned  imo is a reach. </p>
