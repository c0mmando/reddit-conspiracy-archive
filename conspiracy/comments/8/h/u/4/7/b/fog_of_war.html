       This sub has been clearly taken over by anti-semite shills. All these political articles, and news about Syria and other Middle East events is such an obvious pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I pointed out to people that it is very likely that all of these news are fake, I got downvoted into hell, it just tells you how emotionally manipulated even conspiracy theorists can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck I thought people here are skeptical and now swallow the BS that they are fed. Ohhh so if the news reinforces
       <strong>
        your
       </strong>
       anti-semite beliefs, then it doesn't matter if it's fake or not... I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see people, that is not how reality works. A fake news is a fake news, and you are being emotionally manipulated like a sheep by various forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't possibly know what the hell is happening in a war zone, certainly not from shady websites making an article on them, and of course not the mainstream news either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because it's "alternative news" that doesn't mean it's genuine, in fact it's even more likely that it's fake, since while mainstream news have at least a bit of integrity in their style, the alternative media has none, and why should they? Emotional news generate clicks, and clicks generate money.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every war there is a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war">
        Fog of War
       </a>
       which means that every news outlet will be filled with fake news, literally every one of them.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Many battles will not be reported
       </li>
       <li>
        Battles that didn't happen will be reported
       </li>
       <li>
        They will reuse old photos and footage as a propaganda for recent events
       </li>
       <li>
        They will fabricate non-existant groups and put them in a situation
       </li>
       <li>
        They will report on situations in a sensational or grossly exagerated way
       </li>
       <li>
        Casualty numbers will be extremely inflated
       </li>
       <li>
        A lot of misdirection from more important events
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I mean they throw you the entire propaganda machinery at you just how Orwell described it in his journey at the Spanish Revolution. That is how war propaganda works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before D-DAY
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bodyguard">
        Nazi media was filled with bullshit
       </a>
       to deceive them into thinking the invasion will happen from Norway and Bulgaria, not France.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is how it works, that is how all war works, and you people who get emotional about 1 news story or the other, just fall into the trap of the Nazi Elites.  You are just a donkey that is just following a carrot on a stick.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So I bet most of the war news stories are fake. They even put an anti-semite spin on it now, plus they recycle old Nazi Era propaganda and mix the two together to propagate this grand
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory">
        ZOG
       </a>
       theory nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes this sub feels like a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Rally">
        Nuremberg Rally
       </a>
       , full of Neo-Nazi operatives spreading fake news to further the anti-semite agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have documented the possible existence of an underground post-WW2 Nazi network, none of the high ranking Nazis have died or they have staged their death, and their descendants could be running these kinds of operations.

       You can't possibly know what is happening there. Even now we still don't know what happened in WW2 so what happens today will be research material for historials who will live 100 years from now.

       How do you feel about the warmongering spin we see in most of the media? If we’re looking at potentially dangerous spin from articles about the Middle East, I would say that is clearly at the top. I really don’t grasp what you’re defining as anti-Semitic or not

       The other day people were posting about the protocols of zion which has been debunked a million times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also seen posts claiming the Jews run the world banking, media, and all other ridiculous claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were even posts some time ago linking to middle age anti-semite propaganda like how allegedly Jews have caused plagues.

       It's just pure anti-semitic garbage.

       They really do control banking and media. Have you not seen the numbers? The information is real, its not just anecdotal. The %ages are incredibly disproportionate.

       As an Israeli who frequents this sub and is very critical of his government, I don't see many posts here that I would straight up call "fake news". In many cases, they are well sourced. When they're speculative, misleading, or simply made up, I would call them out (or simply downvote the obvious bait and move on with my life). I do the same for anti-intellectual posts, my other pet-peeve.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there are posts (and, more ubiquitously, comments) that use real events to promote/reinforce anti-semitism. And no, I don't label any post critical of my country as such. But you would often find these posts by sorting through "controversial", which is encouraging to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would refrain from the wholesale use of "fake news" rhetoric, especially when it's obviously used selectively to dismiss information you don't like. Even if true, it's not helping your cause. Call out posts individually.
