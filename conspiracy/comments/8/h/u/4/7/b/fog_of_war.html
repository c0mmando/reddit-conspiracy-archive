        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This sub has been clearly taken over by anti-semite shills. All these political articles, and news about Syria and other Middle East events is such an obvious pattern.</p>

<p>When I pointed out to people that it is very likely that all of these news are fake, I got downvoted into hell, it just tells you how emotionally manipulated even conspiracy theorists can be.</p>

<p>Heck I thought people here are skeptical and now swallow the BS that they are fed. Ohhh so if the news reinforces <strong>your</strong> anti-semite beliefs, then it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s fake or not... I see.</p>

<p>You see people, that is not how reality works. A fake news is a fake news, and you are being emotionally manipulated like a sheep by various forces.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t possibly know what the hell is happening in a war zone, certainly not from shady websites making an article on them, and of course not the mainstream news either.</p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s &quot;alternative news&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s genuine, in fact it&#39;s even more likely that it&#39;s fake, since while mainstream news have at least a bit of integrity in their style, the alternative media has none, and why should they? Emotional news generate clicks, and clicks generate money.</p>

<p>In every war there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war">Fog of War</a> which means that every news outlet will be filled with fake news, literally every one of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Many battles will not be reported</li>
<li>Battles that didn&#39;t happen will be reported</li>
<li>They will reuse old photos and footage as a propaganda for recent events </li>
<li>They will fabricate non-existant groups and put them in a situation</li>
<li>They will report on situations in a sensational or grossly exagerated way</li>
<li>Casualty numbers will be extremely inflated</li>
<li>A lot of misdirection from more important events</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean they throw you the entire propaganda machinery at you just how Orwell described it in his journey at the Spanish Revolution. That is how war propaganda works.</p>

<p>Before D-DAY <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bodyguard">Nazi media was filled with bullshit</a> to deceive them into thinking the invasion will happen from Norway and Bulgaria, not France.</p>

<p>That is how it works, that is how all war works, and you people who get emotional about 1 news story or the other, just fall into the trap of the Nazi Elites.  You are just a donkey that is just following a carrot on a stick.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So I bet most of the war news stories are fake. They even put an anti-semite spin on it now, plus they recycle old Nazi Era propaganda and mix the two together to propagate this grand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory">ZOG</a> theory nonsense.</p>

<p>Sometimes this sub feels like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Rally">Nuremberg Rally</a>, full of Neo-Nazi operatives spreading fake news to further the anti-semite agenda.</p>

<p>I have documented the possible existence of an underground post-WW2 Nazi network, none of the high ranking Nazis have died or they have staged their death, and their descendants could be running these kinds of operations.</p>

<p>Yet all news are spinned here in an anti-semite way, despite they not even knowing if it&#39;s real or not.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what happened, what matters is how it&#39;s spinned, and this sub chose to spin it in an anti-semite way.</p>

<p>We both see the biased news articles regurgitating the same nonsense and putting a spin on it.</p>

<p>The only way to know if it you are there on the spot. Everything else is speculation, but speculation with a pre-concieved view.</p>

<p>Looking at yout post history, you are an anti-semite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you putting words in my mouth. I never said that.</p>

<p>I said that if you don&#39;t have first hand knowldge you should not spread fake news, you can speculate, but don&#39;t put out things there as facts if you know nothing about them.</p>

<p>However people do that, not just that,but they also put an anti-semite spin on it.</p>

<p>They know nothing about the events, yet they are already portrayed as anti-semitic. That is the evil agenda I am talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an Israeli who frequents this sub and is very critical of his government, I don&#39;t see many posts here that I would straight up call &quot;fake news&quot;. In many cases, they are well sourced. When they&#39;re speculative, misleading, or simply made up, I would call them out (or simply downvote the obvious bait and move on with my life). I do the same for anti-intellectual posts, my other pet-peeve.</p>

<p>That being said, there are posts (and, more ubiquitously, comments) that use real events to promote/reinforce anti-semitism. And no, I don&#39;t label any post critical of my country as such. But you would often find these posts by sorting through &quot;controversial&quot;, which is encouraging to me.</p>

<p>Also, I would refrain from the wholesale use of &quot;fake news&quot; rhetoric, especially when it&#39;s obviously used selectively to dismiss information you don&#39;t like. Even if true, it&#39;s not helping your cause. Call out posts individually.</p>
