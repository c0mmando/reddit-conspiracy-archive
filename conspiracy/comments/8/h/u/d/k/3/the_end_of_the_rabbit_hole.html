       Once we are curious enough to investigate the discrepancies and injustices we see all around us, we turn away from the “news”, “MSM”, “hive mind”, and begin to formulate our own independant thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This path is designed and inevitably leads to a feeling of anger, alienation, righteousness, and soon helplessness, frustration, and somewhat liberation.  But not enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are reading this, it’s because you have compassion, you care, and want things to be better and just.  Or you’re getting paid to argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of this entire process, we all come upon quantum physics, mechanics, the improbable odds of life ever existing at all, and may wonder why.  You also realize Freewill (a divine right) exists, and in so, analyze that everything spread across the news, governments, mafia, gangs, movies, music, tv shows, and peer pressure are designed accordingly to make sure the populace does not truely understand the power of Freewill in numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, by observing, participating, and creating, you are playing the role of God.  It’s easiest to think, understand, and truly know your divine purpose.  Every action we make is defined by LOVE. We cannot define it so easily, but it boils down to two things;  Service to Others, or Service to Self. Society as a whole cannot exist with Freewill in a Service to Self world.  God, our ultimate purpose of which we all come onto this planet, is LOVE.
      </p>
      <p>
       LOVE requires action, not emotion. Love requires dedication to other beings.  We are all of God, we will all end up as one again, whether in the soil, or the soupy source in vibration. We split from the source to experience, rebel, or guide others.  You will never die, your consciousness is an eternal gift, I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy, the secret teaching of the ancient schools, are made to hide your true existence.  Through knowledge of eternal life no man shall fear for his death, but welcome Heaven, Valhalla, Nirvana, or whatever you would name it.  Fear on this Earth is made to keep you from your true potential.  The real potential to change the world, remove power, equal playing field, and bow to no man.  If we acquiecse to any thing other than LOVE we will be bound to repeat until we learn the lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be Godlike, in both decision, form, and mind.  This Earth is all of our learning ground, paradise, and hell, not just for the few.

       At Sparta each company of youths used to sacrificed a puppy to Enyalios before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum and in the east of Sparta stood a statue of the god in chains, to show that the "spirit of war and victory" was to be kept in the city.

       This dimension rewards it, the physical plane of Earth.  Wait until you come back to the spiritual realm, and get held back, possibly demoted.  Service to others is truely the only way to grow your spirit.  Power and control here mean nothing if using it as service to self.

       As far as I can tell from my human experience, God doesn't reward anything, because everyone dies. Whatever "rewards" you receive in this life for evil acts, are but fleeting, transient things. I don't think the race for power produces joy. It produces a high, and those chasing it are like adrenaline junkies, always chasing the dragon of bigger and better. When they are down, they feel nothing but suffering, and when they win, they feel temporary bliss. Not a fulfilling way to live.

       Hahaha I think we need to find better ways to attract people to real knowledge. See their responses it is difficult to make people want to think for themself. I think we need to show them the similarities between us and build up from that. you also need to remember that all people around the world have all been thought since childhood to protect their beliefs.

       And for some that is all well.  You can infringe on others freewill, however, sometimes it is neccessary for a service to others society.  Namely, those who corrupt and take advantage of the most vulnerable.  A parent spanks the child so the child learns faster.  It is not out of hatred.

I believe humans are inherently sympathetic, thus programs like MKUltra are necessary to train empathy out of people.  The Amish get by very well, civic responsibility to their community is the motivation.

       As a former abused child, this claim creeps me out.  This statement is an assertion of trust instead of accountability when applied to politics.  "You should trust Hillary/Giuliani/Obama/Trump/corporations/military, they are not acting out of hatred" is not acceptable.

       The universe is expanding. What causes things to expand?
       <em>
        "Explosions"
       </em>
       . So logically, since we are now expanding, if you go back at one point it was all confined in one space. LOGIC, IS NOT HARD.

       Thing is, he's
       <em>
        right

       , but he doesn't take it far enough. The universe IS expanding. The Sun is expanding. (Implications?) The Earth is expanding. (Implications?)

       And I don't think it does anybody any good to limit a concept of God to some invisible landlord in the sky. For me, God is simply Truth, reality -- as opposed to falsehood. What is -- as opposed to what is not. The alpha and omega.

       Personally, I agree with everything you just said. Bongzilla did have an interesting point, but the way it was condescendingly (and immaturely) being delivered didn't stir any positive conversation, at least from my perspective. If he truly wants to use logic as his thought guide, good on him, but "the big bang" is just as ambiguous as " 'God' is the emergent property of complexity in our increasingly expanding consciousness "...
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno. You said it best. He's "right" (I would say- on the "right track") but I didn't care for his attitude about it either way.

       Well, people like you used to say god made earth, humans, and the universe. Now we know the origins of earth, evolution and big bang. You want to commit the same mistakes people have done for thousands of years (god of the gaps) or do you want to actually find out that there is no real magic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Welp, I know I don't live for mythologies and fantasies. Reality is stranger than fiction, and a personal god is a ridiculous idea. If you say "aw but god is energy" then god is still not real, energy is real. Are you ready to think or just let some myths rule your life?

       There are a few theories explaining it, but basically the big bang is a part of something bigger (o really). Like a bubble in an ocean of big bangs.
      </p>
      <p>
       No theory is complete proven yet, but they
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       <strong>
        evidence
       </strong>
       and facts to support them, unlike the hypothesis of 'god', which is absurd and ridiculously improbable since you have to add more variables to the math.

       That's just a dumb statement, I even said the opposite. But I'll go with it since you need this argument to make god a viable idea (which it never was).

       First there were no humans at all. No mammals either. Then there was. AMAZING. Something must have happened that made it possible right, or was it all divine mythological magic from a guy born of a virgin? lmao

       Jesus did not save 70 million plus from the horrors of the Bolshevik Jews in Russia.  Being an edgelord on the other hand helps no one either.  If we all wait for some Divine intervention to save humans from the horrors others are willing to inflict, we are truely just cattle.  Love does not mean refraining from doing "bad" deeds.  Love is simply service to others.

       A lot of the comments here are from ugly hating son's of bitches. Overall, writing under a false name, anonymously, without consequences or exposure of the true self, this "Reddit" unleashes the writer from responsibility for ones own words. It is therefore tipped toward evil, rot, corruption, vanity, aggression, vile thoughts, degradation. Everyone is braver standing behind a stone wall. You might say Reddit is to writing as pornography is to procreation. Conclusion: articles that tend to elevate in this venue are doomed to be turned vile and unwholesome. "Do not cast your pearls before swine for they will stamp them into the mud then turn and rend you."

       Anonymity allows people to be more honest. If any throught slightly deviating from the status quo wasn't met with "NAZI!" then perhaps face to face discourse would be more productive.

       Let's just say after a totalitarian regime takes over,
       <em>
        they order the anonymity stripped
       </em>
       , every comment is attached to the writer by IP and to the individual by context and metadata, your browsing history shows you linking to other sites with auto-password authorization prove it's

       We are one part of a whole.  The mystery schools have corrupted this knowledge to their benefit.  Religion, while great for teaching moral compass, allows people to leave their guard down against true danger.  Luciferian doctrine is inherently against Love (Creator, God).

       This dimension rewards it, the physical plane of Earth.  Wait until you come back to the spiritual realm, and get held back, possibly demoted.  Service to others is truely the only way to grow your spirit.  Power and control here mean nothing if using it as service to self.

       As far as I can tell from my human experience, God doesn't reward anything, because everyone dies. Whatever "rewards" you receive in this life for evil acts, are but fleeting, transient things. I don't think the race for power produces joy. It produces a high, and those chasing it are like adrenaline junkies, always chasing the dragon of bigger and better. When they are down, they feel nothing but suffering, and when they win, they feel temporary bliss. Not a fulfilling way to live.
