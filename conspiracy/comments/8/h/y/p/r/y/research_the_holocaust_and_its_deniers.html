        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The “Jewish Holocaust” had already been linked to conspiracies and myths regarding the foundation of the Zionist movement and state of Israel. Today, however, the Zionist state has developed and devoted this novel as an endless means of extortion under the name of “anti-Semitism.” It’s to the point that the accident has become linked morally and fundamentally to anti-Semitism and international terrorism. Whoever questions its scope or validity, or dare to criticize the State of Israel; its practices and crimes, are labelled anti-Semitic and terrorists?!</p>

<p>The question that is still under debate at the level of researchers, thinkers and politicians: How valid and credible is this “Holocaust” which has become an opportunistic pretext and an investment in the hands of the movement and the Zionist state. Naturally, the State managed enormous strategic gains from it: from the establishment of the “Jews national homeland in Palestine,” to backing and strengthening that country not only to live, but to dominate the region strategically, as well as the vast financial, moral and ethical extortions continuing to this day, which lead countries and institutions to embrace their claim and wage wars for their cause.</p>

<p>And to what extent is the credibility of the American-Zionist accusations to anyone who opens the file of the Holocaust or criticizes Israel?</p>

<p>Regarding the Holocaust, let’s recall some of the most important testimonies. We refer to the report of the American expert Fred Leuchter, who refutes the fabrications of Jews about genocide in the Nazi camps. Norman Finkelstein, the American Jewish expert in political science, who was invited to a seminar at the University of Waterloo, when a Jewish girl raised the Holocaust paper, crying, and he asked her to stop, while rejecting the crocodile tears. We recall a member of Saxon Parliament who demanded in a meeting to stop cooperation with what he called “the imposter Jewish State” and “the flourishing Holocaust industry.” Yedioth Ahronoth quoted the report, saying that these statements were not made in Tehran, but in Germany by what they described as “the leader of the extreme right” and “a new Nazi.” Holger Apfel caused a major storm in the Saxon Parliament when he suggested an “explosive” agenda under the title “No to cooperation with the impostors, Stop the cooperation between Saxony and Israel.”</p>

<p>He said that because of this issue, the representatives of the majority in the parliament tried to change the subject in fear of “harming the image of Saxony.” However, he insisted on his position. And when they asked him to end his speech, he refused to respond, as he continued to talk about the &quot;Jewish state of terror,” while refusing to step down from the podium. Eventually, he was removed from the parliament and detached from any further discussion.</p>

<p>Robert Faurisson, the prominent French scholar who devoted his life to look into the reality of the Holocaust, was oppressed by the Jewish organizations in France, as well as the courts of his own country, which convicted him in more than a dozen cases, while not having any kind of mercy for his old age as he was subjected to many physical attacks because of his research and position on the Holocaust. In an interview with the Algerian Al-Shorouk “That was in 1974, I began researching what was known then as the Holocaust, or what I referred to in some of my researches as “the so-called Holocaust.”</p>

<p>Aside from those mentioned, there are a large number of senior European and American scientists, philosophers and researchers who even doubt the validity of the accident, while others believe that there is an exaggeration in the number of Jews who were burnt. On top of that, there are countless documents that argues that the Jewish Holocaust is originally a Zionist plot and the biggest lie of the 20th century. Seeing that it has been exploited by the Zionist movement over the past decades as a scarecrow to terrify the Jews of the world and push them to migrate to Palestine, then as a scarecrow to terrorize and criminalize European public opinion, and finally as a means of financial, moral and ethical extortion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, every person who lied about it had a reason to lie about it. Do you realize that you can make a lot of money in reparations by claiming to be a Holohoax survivor?</p>

<p>The Jewish woman in that letter was in Auschwitz and said that there were no gas chambers. Why would she lie?</p>

<p>And you believe something just because some people tell you it happened? If a group of people said they saw a unicorn, would you believe them? Many, many people have claimed to have seen Bigfoot, why would they lie?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its hearsay, its worthless. What I care about is the actual evidence of the Holocaust. When I look at that, the conclusion I come to is that around 300,000 people died in the camps, some of whom were Jewish, and the vast majority died of disease and malnutrition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn&#39;t help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#39;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. They had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#39;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day. Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck. I didn&#39;t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying. Gradually I began to hate them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately that testimony doesn&#39;t contradict any of the official story.</p>

<p>She said she stayed at both Buchenwald and Auschwitz.  Buchenwald was a &quot;concentration camp&quot; and not a death camp.  It did not have gas chambers so her testimony is correct.</p>

<p>Auschwitz actually consisted of three separate camps.  Auschwitz, Birkenau and Monowitz (we have combined them today into a single name but they were in fact separate camps).</p>

<p>The reason you&#39;ve heard of Auschwitz is because it was a concentration camp and thus had a much higher survival rate compared to a death camp like Birkenau.  People left Auschwitz and talked about it, pretty much nobody every got to leave Birkenau so it&#39;s not as &quot;famous&quot;.</p>

<p>Either way, it makes perfect sense for that woman to have never seen gas chambers at either of those camps.</p>

<p>Got any other sources?</p>

<p>&quot;The difference is that today the Auschwitz II camp, aka Birkenau, has been designated a &quot;death camp&quot; by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, while Buchenwald is now officially called a concentration camp. When Jewish prisoners arrived at Birkenau, beginning in February 1942, they went through a selection process in which those who were able to work were saved while the others were destined for the gas chamber. Today, no one claims that Buchenwald had a gas chamber, nor that there was a selection process for Jewish prisoners at Buchenwald.&quot;</p>

<p>What about the holes that were identified in the roof of gas chambers (holes which were used to pour in Zyklon B).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even when most Jews think that Israel is their right? Even when most Jews aren&#39;t the true Hebrews from the Bible? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say 6 million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust from 1941 to 1945...That means the Nazi&#39;s killed 171.2 Jews every minute for 4 years. Makes sense!!</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin Freedman, a Jewish industrialist born in New York, wrote in the Economic Council Letter published there of October 15 1947: “These Eastern European Jews have neither a racial nor a historic connection with Palestine. Their ancestors were not inhabitants of the Promised Land. They are the direct descendants of the people of the Khazar Kingdom. The Khazars were a non-Semitic, Turko-Mongolian tribe.”  </p>

Makes perfect sense. Most Atheist do have a religion, it&#39;s called Scientism, and you take a giant leap of Faith believing in nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I work from the logical position that any huge claim requires major evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a difference between “blind faith” and “faith based on logic and evidence”. Science needs faith as well. Believing in a scientific axiom (which is by definition unproved) requires more faith than to believe in love like Christ taught. It is more irrational and unscientific to believe that everything exist out of pure luck than to believe that everything has a cause.</p>

<p>Not attacking you, I addressed your points with my initial reply and asked two questions that you have yet to answer. </p>
