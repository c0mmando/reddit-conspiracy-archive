       It takes a pretty narrow minded schlub, to pledge support to a candidate, just because they say controversial things and criticize the "other side".
      </p>
      <p>
       POTUS has become nothing more than a political demagogue, with a cult following of gullibles, who are drawn in by his cleverly crafted "down to earth facade"..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying, there are a number of crimes and unconstitutional policies Trump has already carried out so far in his term.
      </p>
      <p>
       The multi billion dollar Saudi arms deal
      </p>
      <p>
       The bombing of Syria under a false flag pretense...twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The support for a bump stock ban and 2nd amendment reform
      </p>
      <p>
       The installment of Goldman Sachs gangsters into cabinet positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The support for the "police state" and continuation of the wars on the boogeyman that is "terrorism"
      </p>
      <p>
       His shady relationship with convicted pedophile Jeff Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So allow key to reiterate, that if you support the president simply because he reinforces and acts out your disapproval of "liberals", then you need to reevaluate your priorities. If you're still thinking in terms of left vs right, you
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       need to reevaluate your priorities.

       I pay attention to their actions, and every supposedly bad thing he’s done has been with the full support of the Dems who are supposed to be “the resistance”. I don’t like Trump because of the shitty things he says, I like him in spite of all the shitty things he says.

       Pretty much no Democrats are backing Trump on this. What world do you live in where Democrats are just as bad as Republicans with regards to the Environment? Democrats have consistently been the party pushing for regulations that would protect the environment.

      <p>
       To believe they are the same is to ignore everything we know about these two parties.

       The EPA was riddled with corruption and needed to be gutted.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/business.financialpost.com/opinion/lawrence-solomon-the-corruption-of-environmental-regulation-goes-down-the-swamp-drain/amp">
        Here’s how the gravy train operated until now: The EPA has 22 advisory committees. Many of these committee’s board members — charged with providing independent, unbiased scientific advice for the EPA — have themselves been conducting the research they determined was needed. But they don’t do it as volunteers: Instead, these board members have for years been pocketing jaw-dropping grants from the very agency they’ve been advising. Of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee’s 26 members, for example, 24 were grantees, collectively receiving US$220 million in EPA grants. This conflict of interest has been especially egregious in the field of global warming, according to the new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, where members have the greatest financial incentives and sometimes obtained EPA grants “to the tune of literally tens of millions of dollars.”

       However, not every single one of those who are elected become puppets. JFK for example clearly went outside the boundaries, and was dealt with accordingly.

      <p>
       If you're subtly comparing Trump to people like JFK and Andrew Jackson, you have been effectively compromised by the media campaign to make Trump appear persecuted. Sad, but true.

       He is supposed to be but Trump isn't which is why they are doing everything they can and breaking laws to take him down and punish any one who worked on his campaign.  Grinding down innocent people with hundreds of thousands in legal defense debt, terrorizing family at gun point over suppoded white collar crimes, destroying reputations with unverified and unsupportable gossip and accusation so no one unapproved tries to or can find any help running again.
      </p>

       If we don't lie down and accept the rigging like they did to Sanders and Ron Paul they will use their unconstitutional powers we have them for terrorists to destroy us.

       I promise I'll make this relavent to your post. I do not support DJT in any shape or form. I despised Hillary Clinton even more. I voted for neither, but pre election I espoused to my coworkers that DJT will win, and absolutely needed to win for this countries sake. Of course as a black American who grew up impoverished, I was ostracized in part for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am of the mind that DJT is a reflection of all Americans no matter your economical or social alignment. All of his re-election antics (and post), TO ME, was merely a reflection of the behavior and or sentiment of the average American no matter your skin color or beliefs. E.g. the pussy grabbing debacle, or the appearance of animosity towards immigrants whether Muslim or Latin American. As much as we like to pretend, we ALL make jokes that are in the same realm of vulgarity that he spewed. We can say, "they are jokes, that isn't how we truly feel!". Is that really true? Even as a firm believer in altruism, I'm honest enough to admit that alot of these hot topics can at times cause anxiety to the point of saying or doing something that isn't socially proper, similar to the antics we see DJT undertake. Sure he is the PRESIDENT, and alot of time he says and does things that are really far in left field (hah), but I look at my fellows Americans and don't see much difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to me it was necessary that having someone such as DJT in office would expose our own improper behavior and clean up our acts. I'd like to think I was right when I first began making the case of DJT. Movements like #metoo, and whatever else that you can imagine made their break as a result of this idiot in office, and id like him to stay there till we fully cleanse ourselves. Funnily enough he is truly draining the swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issue is that the progress that CAN be made is being hijacked. Instances where the onus is on us who envision a proper transition into better terms, have dropped the ball consistently. For e.g. the Kanye situation. Those of you who understand what he was trying to say, kudos for not falling into the trap. Others, I implore you to listen to what a sports analyst, Max Kellerman, had to say on the topic. In other places we have Sesta to stop human trafficking. The result has been legitimate sex workers finding themselves in quite a desperate situation. I could sit here and list things from sun up to sun down, but I think that if you look at it from my lens, you will find the areas of error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I think this is the cause of the left or liberal agenda. (Remember though, all of this is a rich man tricks. There is no left and right, D &amp; R). These movements are being hijacked to Instill a culture of complete polarization and divide. Liberals vs conservatives and the what the fuckers like some of us in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I believe DJT was an inevitability, I had hoped that we with our minds in order could take the reins of sensibility and make change. Sadly we are too late and must look for out next opportunity of paradigm shift to stop this madness. I do hope it comes soon.

       I absolutely agree nothing has ACTUALLY changed in our social behavior. That much is evident. But the opposers (to DJT) have given the appearance as if we are MAKING a change. That much is a start in my book. Which is why I ended my comment with what I did, seizing the next opportunity that presents itself to make a real change. For the better preferably.

       I'm all for learning from the shit show that DJT is, if thats what you are saying, but he doesn't represent me. He doesn't represent a large majority of the population. To call him a look in the mirror is absurd is all I'm saying.

       C'mon man let's be honest here. I'm not saying he is an EXACT reflection of everything we do. That looker room talk, you've never done? I remember alot of my middle school days grabbing girls asses and bussing it up with my classmates. But I wouldn't rape a woman even to save earth from burning. You never had a conversation at work and say "they working us too damn hard. I ain't a damn Mexican"? Or is that just me? I'm a steadfast altruist, but I've still done it (still do too absent mindedly). You ever get a reeeaaaallly dirty look from a middle eastern (maybe cause I'm black idk tbh) and never mumbled "fucking terrorist" even when you know the likelihood of that is probably 0?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, what I'm saying is that Donald Trump represents us (really the whole world) to some degree, when we aren't on our best behavior. If he doesn't, then you are the messiah and we need to link up so I can be a disciple.

       No I dont talk about how I can sexually assault any woman I want lol , and no I haven't grabbed girls asses. It's pretty easy not to do. Just because you've done it in the past just means we haven't done a good job of showing kids its not okay.

       I was nwver a Kanye fan, not into hip hop or rap I'm a rock and old country (pre pop crap) gal and his antics seemed sad to me.  Sometimes amusing at the reactions.  I did admire his ability to sell his product and brand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listening to that sports guy talk about him on Tucker was eye opening.  I forgot his name but he has some great wisdom re the NFL and ESPN crap over the last year so I listened carefully.  And I agree with him.  Kanye seems to be trying hard to communicate something he feels deeply and the bravery to do that is tremendous.  It's not like the"bad behavior" celebrity culture actually celebrates ie sex and drugs and addiction etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kanye spoke of love and choices.  But his old audience can't hear. At least the loudest ones can't hear over their knee jerk outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       400 years of slavery was a choice if we think about it.  A choice among terrible choices.  The slaves in what is now Haiti made another choice and suffered for it but also reached for freedom and took it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is saying stop elevating victim mentality. Don't be victims be victors and take control of our present and future.  Stop labeling ourselves and putting boxes around people.  Quit walling ourselves off.

       Fair enough if that’s the case, I’m glad mods are keeping this sub impartial, I had a different impression months ago when I noticed a difference in what you’re describing now, but rejoined recently cause I like a good conspiracy theory. I hope it stays that way forever.

       I’ve been around for a long time, and there’s really no arguing that you only see conversations with mods like this in a context like this. I don’t know what the conversation was since you removed his comments, but it’s always something defending Trump or pro-Trump comments when a moderator is taking action like this.

       Y’all aren’t nearly as vigilant in defending Hillary LOL. I don’t blame you, Hillary is terrible, but you have to admit you mods always seem to be stepping in in defense of Trump.

       Both of those candidates "suck". You don't realize that you would be getting the same policies from HC if she had one, that you're getting from Trump. These "elected" officials are merely assets of the ruling class.

       Trump isn’t really that bad, certainly not much worse than Obama and definitely better than Bush. I agree though, it seems like the right was so desperate for a win that they’ll take what they can get.

       I would have thought that members of THIS sub above any other would understand that the media is nearly all left wing propaganda, and yet your entire worldview of Trump hate is based on their narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not going to refute your silliness point by point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is NOT about Trump.
       <strong>
        WHY
       </strong>
       does the establishment hate Trump so much? Thats the question to ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real reason is because he, and he alone, is on the side of the American people. The entire political, industrial, and media structure exists by squeezing the American public and selling them out at every turn - which is the problem because  the US constitution claims that the government is OF, FOR, and BY the PEOPLE.  This reality has been the case for decades, and in the ultimate societal struggle, the creep of the globalist left has infiltrated and taken over every aspect of US society.  The takeover has been SO complete, that even what was once the right back in the days of Reagan have been co-opted, and we are all watching the treasonous soft coup attempt as the self-appointed deep state rulers attempt to assert their dominance - they dont give a shit who won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thats the true landscape. You have to realize, one way or another in 6 years Trump WONT be POTUS, and yet all the things he has helped to reveal (and I dont think he exposed it on purpose, BTW, I think the deep state and media unmasked themselves in their desperation) about the true nature of the system will still exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can rail on with lefty media narratives about Trump did this or that, but you are ignoring the larger truth.

       I can understand the political but why would the entire media and industrial structure be so against trump? Trump has been great for the media. Trump has been good for business - lower taxes and increased spending.

       the media is a tool of the globalist left. No one who knows anything even bothers disputing this any longer - they pretended this wasnt the case for decades, which is my own personal reason for hating them. I dont hate them for their ideology, I could honestly debate that in good faith and with respect and love.  I hate them personally (the media) for their dishonesty, for their intentionally preying on the public trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for business, Trump and the Trump agenda is only good for SOME business. The multinational corps hate him. They love open borders not because of ideology, but because of cheap labor and the economics of that. The ideology is the excuse they wrap it in. Just like the George Soros' of the world.  He made his fortune betting against the British government - he isnt an ideologue at all - he pretends to be by funding social activism, but on closer inspection those groups are pushing for global leftism. WHY? Because then he can buy up the assets in that region when it crashes, as it inevitably will if the ideology he pushes succeeds - and that ideology succeeds in TWO ways, either it succeeds outright (and destroys the economy), or it succeeds by destabilizing enough to still wreck the economy when freedom - minded people fight against it.

       I was a Trump supporter &amp; am still kind of giving him a chance. He says really stupid shit every single day but also some things that are spot on. He really needs to follow through on the things that matter. He caved to the Derp State when he should have fired the top 2-3 tiers of the intelligence community &amp; the state department. He should have sacked Rosinstien. Charged Comey, McCabe, Brennan &amp; Clapper with sedition &amp; perjury before Congress. Made the UK extradite Christoper Steele &amp; charged him too.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also should follow through with normalisation with Russia because we all know he doesn’t because of the Russia Investigation that never ends. While we’re at it he should also end that dog &amp; pony show. Fire Muller too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But until he absolutely destroys a country like Bush, Clinton &amp; Obama (Iraq/Libya) I hold out some semblance of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also too many nuts like Bolton etc coming in. When the calmest man on the team is called Mad Dog Mattis -(The butcher of Fallujah) Not many people remember how much depleted uranium &amp; white phosphorus was dumped on that city.
