I know this isn’t really much of a conspiracy, but I think it’s really weird this hasn’t even made it to the front page of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. </p>

<p>It seems to me that the situation is much worse than the news is making it out to be. What are your thoughts on this topic? Are any of you currently in Hawaii and have witnessed this first hand?</p>

<p>Hint: it&#39;s not man</p>

<p>2nd hint: <a href="http://www.spaceweathernews.com">Learn to read the sun</a></p>

<p>There was a lot of solar winds last weekend causing an increase in quakes and seismic activity</p>

<p>As for why it&#39;s not talked about, well, I don&#39;t know, perhaps they don&#39;t want to talk about what&#39;s coming or something</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bunch of cosmic cycles coming to an end soon and we&#39;re due for that magnetic pole flip</p>

<p>we&#39;re in for some rough weather most likely</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking the same thing. I mean I’m far from an expert on the topic, but I’m assuming that far under the crust the volcanoes across the world are probably connected. So were seeing all this activity in Hawaii hopefully it doesn’t spread to Yellowstone. If they knew something far worse was going to come from this, they definitely would not tell us in order to avoid mass panic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suspicious 0bservers are great to get the view from someone who actually understands the whole reading the sun thing haha</p>

<p>I understand the basics of it and can follow along but wouldn&#39;t be able to make a reading and predict an earthquake lol</p>

<p>That being said I think the zone in the US they were worried about was a fault line bordering california or something. They had a couple scenarios where they think there could be a lot of damage and lots of flooding but who knows really</p>

<p>As far as Yellowstone becoming active again, let&#39;s hope not but like you said everything is connected so better be safe than sorry imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot on earth that directly effects the weather, but people often forget that the solar system is an overarching system that the earth is part of. Changes in the Earth&#39;s climate might not come as often from the sun as they do from local factors, but when they do occur there&#39;s really not much that we can do from down here that will change it.<br/>
Sure, humans have fucked south the co2 levels in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Maybe the sun is either reacting to this, or it knew this was going to occur and plans to basically flush the illness from the earth. Humans; earth; the sun... It&#39;s a system. They&#39;re all working together. We might not see it from our perspective, but they are. </p>

<p>The sun does have a lot to do with earth&#39;s environment , and it shouldn&#39;t be discounted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Furthermore I&#39;m not saying that man doesn&#39;t have an impact on CO2 levels and a bunch of other stuff, but if you factor in all parameters, the main driver is the sun, and in comparison, man isn&#39;t making much budge in a global sense</p>

<p>However we should definitely reduce our waste of ressources and change to greener tech like cold fusion or zero point energy but that requires defeating the cabal first</p>

According to that video anyway, they would only be that big around the islands, by the time it reaches the west coast it says a 30m/100&#39; run up. Still massive though, and still dwarfing 2011.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire is a major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. In a 40,000 km (25,000 mi) horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, volcanic arcs, and volcanic belts and plate movements. It has 452 volcanoes (more than 75% of the world&#39;s active and dormant volcanoes).[1] The Ring of Fire is sometimes called the circum-Pacific belt.</p>

<p><strong>About 90%[2] of the world&#39;s earthquakes and 81%[3] of the world&#39;s largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire.</strong> The next most seismically active region (5–6% of earthquakes and 17% of the world&#39;s largest earthquakes) is the Alpide belt, which extends from Java to the northern Atlantic Ocean via the Himalayas and southern Europe.[4][5]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hawaii is outside the ring of fire. There are four types of volcanoes. The type we are seeing in Hawaii is called a &quot;hot spot.&quot; Believe it or not, these are the least dangerous types of volcanoes. But as you can see, they are pretty amazing. </p>

<p>As you can imagine, a serious volcano is something truly amazing. 75,000 years ago, a &quot;supervolcano&quot; erupted in the Southeast on Samatra, the most active volcanic region in the world. This thing was so huge it almost ended human life. Some remained and repopulated the Earth eventually.</p>

<p>It is strange that there are so many fissures blowing out in Hawaii. I&#39;m not too worried yet, but keep watching just in case.</p>

<p>The chain of islands was created by these volcanoes. There is a &quot;hot spot&quot; under the Earth&#39;s crust with a huge magma chamber that occasionally pops as the crust moves at a rate of approximately an inch a year. Over time, you get a chain of islands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did research on these in undergrad (geology), wrote a 30 page or so report on mantle plumes, but new research suggests that mantle plumes likely dont exist. </p>

<p>One of my college TA&#39;s was super intesterested and had email conversations with one of the lead scientists working to prove this. He gave me alot of my talking points.</p>

<p>Huge fixed lava plumes have never been proven to exists, and no 2 mantle plumes exhibit the exact same characteristics.</p>

<p>The new alternative theory is that plates thin in the middle from being push and pulled in so many various directions that water (volatiles) mix with magma and form what we call &quot;Hotspots&quot; but rather should be called &quot;wet spots&quot;. </p>

<p>But yeah no super earthquake is going to happen, there is no plate boundary, and as far as violent eruptions, very not likely either considering mantle plumes diffuse lava slowly for millions of years.</p>

<p>The crust is thin here, so water meeting hot rock actually helps create magma and lava flows, the fact that so much is diffusing should mean that there is no eruption as the pressure is being relieved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are definitely some valid points there. Thanks for sharing. </p>

<p>Also I know Hawaii isn’t likely to have an actual eruption like a composite volcano could potentially have. My main concern was that the activity going on there could also be brewing in other locations too, especially in places where violent eruptions are possible. </p>

<p>Another concern was that the lava flows could eventually cover large portions of the island if it doesn’t cease. But my concerns may be unfounded due to my lack of knowledge on the topic which is why I asked for others opinions. </p>

<p>So thanks again! </p>

<p>I think it is an awesome spectacle, but nothing surprising. I think people just are shunning the sob-story articles trying to draw some emotional clickbait, because most people know better. People who moved to the island with the intentions of living there knew the risks or were just naive.

<p>It seems to me that the situation is much worse than the news is making it out to be. What are your thoughts on this topic? Are any of you currently in Hawaii and have witnessed this first hand?</p>

<p>Yes, My main home is in Kamuela, Hawaii, but my second home to which my daughter lives in. Is 4 miles away in Hawaiian Beaches subdivision. It is bad as over 35 homes are destroyed, and the Sulfur dioxide gas which can turn into sulfuric acid in your lungs makes it hard for residents to return to their home. It is all unpredictable. Seers hours the lava erupting out of fssures subsided. Then they let the residents go back for more belongings, Then poof they start up again with more fissures opening. I causes stress, and many residents are now starting to show signs of PTSD. Plus now all the roads in the area are cracking open so wide you can;t drive over them in many areas.</p>

<p>However though aas tragic as it seems. I built my first bome in Kalapana  subdivision in early 80&#39;s. Only to watch it burst into flames, and overrun with lava along with 330 other residents. Mark my words. Though in a lull for the past 24 hours. This is not over as Halemaumau crater ;ava pond once full to the brom on top of Kilauea has now drop way below the surface. The magma is gong into the tube system out toward the fissures.</p>

<p>People and the media in the mainland really never gave a flying fuck about Hawaii. Kauai got 50 inches of rain in one day, and 120 inches in a week and basically flooded out everywhere. Hit with Hurricane Iniki a a week after Hurricane Andrew in the past as well, and the press gives 20 seconds of coverage compared to hours of coverage with hurricane Andrew. They only perk up when it is a volcano erupting.</p>
