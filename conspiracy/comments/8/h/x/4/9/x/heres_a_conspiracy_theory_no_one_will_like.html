       All right go with me on this...the widespread use and interest in the internet started taking off in the 90's, 9/11 occurs, and the country falls into a slumber. We miss Osama in Tora-Bora, get distracted and invade Iraq. Slowly theories about the Pentagon getting hit by a missile come forth, building 7 must have been "pulled", and the twin towers fell as a controlled demolition. 911 is used as a justification of two wars, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the genesis of the 911 truther movement to a large degree was just a Russian disinformation campaign? Sow pockets of unrest, re-expose old mis-deeds of the US as proof that everything is naturally an evil plot by the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that Putin comes into power on the eve of the millenium, and as the years go on, nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-immigrant sentiment goes through the roof. Today there are populist uprisings throughout the West, in the UK with Brexit, the latest election in Italy, Trump in the US, all culminating in weakened unity against Russia and their interests. I think it's more or less proven Russia has influenced as many national elections as they can get their hands on, so I'm just wondering if they laid the foundation for all of this at the dawn of the millenium.

       I'm not aware of a formal government investigation into the truthers. I just see parallels to what's going on in social media, fake Russian accounts sharing memes on Facebook, twitter, hell even Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the videos and sources in Loose Change and The Ring of Power seemed to not necessarily have the best grasp of English, a whole lot of antisemitism, and a strange foundness for the Romanov family.

       No. The internal organisation that it took was widespread, needed vast coercion and co-operation and had to be done from within. Putin's clever and he's wily (but he's not a magician). It's telling that these days I have more respect for Putin than any of the past Administrations. 
The absolute best summation I've found on 911 came from James Perloff.

       Ah, but do you know about Russian proto-911?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On the boarder with Dagestan, a Dagestani separatist group bombed some apartment buildings, claimed responsibility for it. But then, apartments all over russia started getting bombed...moscow, st. petersberg. Suddenly, these bombs were going off everywhere, however, the original Dagestani group did not claim any of these other bombings. People were scared.
      </p>
      <p>
       At one place,
       <strong>
        Ryazan
       </strong>
       , some locals saw a sketchy guy go into a basement so they called the police. The police caught the guy who turned out to be an FSB agent. The stuff they found under the building tested positive as being hexane, only produced in a state-lab in siberia. The government obfuscated the findings. Putin, prime minister at the time, enjoyed an enormous wave of support when he promised to find the terrorists ('even if they're in the shitters') and prosecute them at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       He used that wave of support to institute a coup, kicking out Yeltsin's circle, nationalizing industries, culling a certain circle of oligarchs so he could place his own. He's been president ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was in 99.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll remember, Bush and Putin were buddy-buddy. Even today, I think we regularly see the fingerprints of Putin's right hand propaganda minister
       <strong>
        Valdislav Surkov's
       </strong>
       ideas at work in our own society every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       More like, maybe we got the idea for 911 from Russia.

       Bush attempted to warm up to Putin, but he's a Russian and the former head of their intelligence agencies; naturally he started warm but later showed he was cold as ice. As W's administration continued, their relationship grew chillier. By the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Putin was invading South Ossetia.

       I'm usually a fan of finding the simplest solution, if it makes more sense that the more complicated one.

       A small group of Russian bloggers start poisoning a few jaded people, and slowly but surely it starts to spiral into the truther movement.

       Or, ya know, thousands of American government workers all agree to stage a terrorist attack on American soil, because of oil? Regime change? Some sort of coup to democracy?

       Under well-run compartmentalization it could be easily done by government officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best example of compartmentalization, and when I say best I mean most shocking, is probably the Dutroux affair. I'm sure you've heard of it, but if not, give it a once over. It's eye-opening

       while its easy to blamemputin for a lot of the shit we are being force fed these days, imo, the truther movement is not one of his creations. He may have made use of it but as far as Im concerned it was the people behind  PNAC that are responsible for creating the truther movement.

       I did for a time. The argument put forth by ae911 was what made the most logical sense to me. But believing in it did me no good.  Frankly I'm waiting for definitive proof, like when the next plane hits a skyscraper, I'd be very curious to know if it tips over and crumbles, or falls straight down.

       Russia is not doing anything that the us, china, and other countries aren't doing.  The suggestion that they're sowing dissent by retweeting legitimate articles that simply don't look good is actually retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refer back to the intel report they released around the time of the one claiming russia hacked the dnc.  They cite RT stories against fracking, and third party candidates as evidence of a conspiracy to undermine america.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you're not retarded, you read that and you say what a minute... scientists in the us have studied and found fracking causes earthquakes.  That's just a fact.  It doesn't matter if cnn covers it, or rt.  The story is the same.  It's not an anti american story if RT shows it.  It just isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that the intel community presented that as if it was means that they have nothing.  There is no russian conspiracy.  No, russia didn't do 911.  That's just bullshit.

       The truther movement was created because of the various explainable aspects to 911, along with either outright lies or concealment of information from the government.

       The drills?  What are the odds that a major terror operation just coincidentally takes place at the same time most of the military forces that would stop such an attack are busy drilling for similar scenarios and are unable to stop anything?

       I'm not saying the US comes from a moral high ground. I'm actually of the opinion the US does a lot of bad shit, including rigging elections, turning countries upside down militarily and economically. I'm just trying to stay on point.

       Nah mate, as an Irishman I can tell you that most of Europe considers the US to be a rather large parasite. Yours is a country that aggressively pushes its agenda and dialogue onto others. Yours is a country that has a hand in most conflicts world-wide. Yours is a country that places sanctions on others as to squeeze them for more resources and control. Yours is a country that takes pride in lying to its citizens and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should definitely try and set straight the problems abounding in your country before even lifting your head to look at others.
      </p>

       We're laughing at you (US), but crying for the rest of the Earth.

       TL; DR I disagree, but rather than say muh Russia, I provided a long response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are looking for an explanation to people choosing a viewpoint you don't seem to agree with.  The fact that you propose Russia is behind it, implies you don't think free thinkers would pick those viewpoints willingly, unless they were somehow duped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalists' viewpoint comes from actually understanding facts/data around the issues.  There are easily 2 billion people who would immediately improve their quality of life by just moving to the US (the actual number is closer to 5 billion).  While I'd love to help everyone, we can't have open borders and survive.  And they aren't sending their best and brightest.  We are getting their rejects and in many cases their criminals.  Add in the fact that citizens seem to actually be prioritized behind immigrants in many cases (Starbucks hiring migrants over citizens for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Migrants coming in to a country and increasing rape and murder statistics can make people nationalists real quick.  Germany and England are shit shows.  Rape gangs in England, Germany telling girls to wear longer dresses to school so they don't get raped--it isn't Germans doing the raping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Russia is hesitant to push any 9/11 truth because of one of their stolen missiles (Kursk submarine) was likely involved in the Pentagon attack (and possibly the towers if you are a no planer). Iran has no such fear, and they pretty much told you who did 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've seen no evidence Russia has their hands in ANY elections (so not proven), but the US has manipulated elections all over the world.  Russia took a different approach on espionage.  They sowed the seeds of dissent a long time ago, 25-30 years ago.  If anything, Russia may be behind people thinking it is xenophobia that drives a nationalist viewpoint--which is the epitome of intellectually laziness.

       Forget Russians. A generally intelligent machine was created in the ’50s and has been covertly manipulating world events in order to proliferate microprocessors. Ever seen ISIS or Taliban in a city where they manufacture computer chips? The machine is influencing the Russians, Americans, terrorists, and populist uprisings.

       Russia was coming out of collapse in 90s and even today is barely a player worldwide.  Canada has a higher GDP, for example.   Russia has huge social problems, from one of th ehighest suicide rates per 100,000 to drugs and alcoholism and other addictions.   While having a relatively homogeneous society, they are several IQ points lower than most white averages.  Combined with a developing nation from post-cold war and it just does not seem plausible for this country to be able to field the most technologically advanced cyber warfare team and influence elections in the world super powers all while rebuilding and dealing with massive social issues.  They have about a 1/3rd the US population as well.  The mere thought of them being able to do the things they are being accused of is laughable.  China, US and Israel are the main players in these fields, yet none are accused of anything.
