       Check out this video. It's a mean tweets video off of Jimmy Fallon. Scarlett J reads out a tweet which ends in 'i hate white people'. Is that normal? To air such hate on television?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would they let Anthony Mackie read out the same tweet saying 'i hate black people'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Both would and are very messed up. I don't know who approved this but I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it.

       Yes, if you go by way the media and loud twitters say, anyone that speaks against those that speak against whites is a “crazy far right neocon racist bigot”. For normal people, though, no. Not really.

       It's all part of the greater scheme to dismantle western civilizations. Fester hate against whites; import foreigners. Fetishize cuckoling. Make abnormal men the norm. And we all know (((who))) is behind this genocide perpetrated against whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they are very much succeeding on making it normal though. For instance, check the difference between
       <a href="/r/blackpeoplegifs">

       and
       <a href="/r/whitepeoplegifs">
        /r/whitepeoplegifs
       </a>
       . One contains people doing cool shit the other contains people doing stupid shit. Guess which one is which.

       On the backs of the poor and middle class, obviously. The tools aren't credited for the creation—the creator is. When humans are used as tools, they're no more entitled to credit than the shovels and guns.

       Civilisation has always been envisioned and directed by the elite, an elite that recycles itself from time to time. Think of the labourers and other workers as organic AI robots who do as they're told in exchange for remuneration or not being killed.

       Nope, slavery wasn't necessary; civilisation could have progressed without it. However, it did expedite the process, but with considerable blowback that we're seeing today, and in my opinion, the blowback is worse than the free labour was beneficial.

       I'd say predominantly the people we'd call 'white', 'brown', and 'yellow'. Most of human civilisation is the product of the Fertile Crescent and those who moved west of it to Europe and the Americas, as well as those who moved east of it throughout the rest of Asia. The wealthy, powerful, educated elites of these societies directed civilisation to evolve as it has. 'Whites' just happened to dominate the last five centuries or so, but civilisation was born around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, very roughly bound by Egypt to the southwest and Persia to the northeast.

       Northeastern Africa, where Egypt is, is a part of the Fertile Crescent. Homo sapiens may have originated in Sub-Saharan Africa, but most of us had the good sense to leave it and start civilisation. Those who remained in the Garden of Eden remained blissfully ignorant.

       I'm genuinely interested in what major infrastructure projects slave labor was used for in the United States.  Can you give me some examples please.
      </p>

       BTW.. The white house is a largely contested item, and only one.  Please provide more.

       Here’s a list of 8 other major projects slave labour was used for. This is by no means an exhaustive list, a simple google search will show you many other things their labor was used for.

       I said slave labor was used in the projects. I didn’t say they whipped out the measuring tape. “Built on the back of” implies that they did the heavy lifting, which they did. Why are you so vehemently against admitting slave labor was used to help build many things in the past? If I said that these same things were built on the backs of horses, I bet you wouldn’t fight this so hard.

       I'm not.  I've admitted as much.  Why are you so vehement in insisting that some minor roles in construction literally means society was built on their backs?

       Why do you falsely equate leveling ground with the actual heavy lifting of mathematics, design and the absolute bulk of construction?

       If you said that society was built on horses' backs--your initial premise--then yea, I would.  That would be a silly thing to say.

       This unironically. They are pushing whites into a corner and the only logical outcome will be facism. Whenever I point this out white people get defensive because they realize it's true. However luckily real life isn't a social media environment, so normal people know who is really what in the outside world.

       I'm neither white nor American and I can see that white males are heavily combated in the media for some reason.

       Fathers are also heavily fought. Always painted as incompetent idiots or dead beats who run out in their families. On the other hand, a life of being a playboy is glorified.

       Yea, they played into existing trends so of course people would show up. Don't try to make more out of it than it is. They created anti and pro "islam in america" events for example, on the same day, with about 200$ in ads, couple dozen people showed up to both events is what I gathered from skimming this article.

       It's a terrible analysis. Don't believe me? Let's take a look.
      </p>
      <p>
       An analysis is a detailed examination of the elements or structure of something. Can you show me explicitly where you provided a detailed examination of what it is you're talking about? It's not in your comments anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding your article: just because it's on Forbes don't mean shit. It's also a guest post. A guest post from  Alex Nowrasteh, who's undoubtedly left. He's also pro-immigration, which is pretty conflicting with the right in your country. So from the start we have a relatively low-quality post from a biased observer with an agenda. Great. Objectivity here we come.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his post you see that he creates four groups for his analysis. They are Islamic Terrorists, Nationalists and Right Wing Terrorists (you can be a nationalist in my country without being Right Wing, but whatever), Left Wing Terrorists (that's a nice way to narrow the Left) and Unknown/Other. Before I move on, do you see the problem with this? He applies a different grain for each group. Why would you separate terrorist attacks into religious beliefs (only Islamic belief too) and political ideology? You do know there's a centre too, right? Where are they in his groupings? Where are the Christian terrorists? Environmental terrorists?  Jewish terrorists? The groupings make no fucking sense at all. If you were in any way decent at practicing science then you'd see the folly immediately. There's no basis for a strong methodology of comparison. Not to mention his research skills regarding statistics are abysmal at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       He assess the terrorist attacks that took place between 1992 and 2017. You read the article, you know the story. So Right Wing terrorists have been ten times as deadly over this specific period than Left Wing terrorists. Funnily enough though, Left Wing terrorists have killed almost three times as many people as Right Wing terrorists since the start of 2016 (up to the date of publication of the article). So in actuality, at the moment, Left Wing terrorists are definitely more deadly. See how I make statistics shift my way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, regarding your last comment: the article clearly shows that Left Wing terrorism is more of a growing threat than Right Wing terrorism. Left Wing terrorism has been rising exponentially relative to other forms. So I suppose that's the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, that's not the problem. The problem is people like you who propagate and peddle divisive dialogues for your own agenda, an agenda derived from your narrow, biased analysis of the world around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't follow a particular ideology. Representing the entire political spectrum on a one-dimension was never going to be a good idea. Besides that, you need both wings to fly my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of implicit and explicit global terrorism, the USA leads the charge for being the most malevolent and destructive force on the planet. From unsustainable consumption to extortionate production, from kicking in the conceptual front-door of nations you have no place being in to resource-robbery of more noble nations than yours, you are the bane upon this earth and it's all the better if you wipe yourselves away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alas, this is not the case though. Instead we're left with insidious and short-sighted plebians like yourself, spreading your hateful and *very poorly analysed* opinions.

       ). It's far more likely that attack was caused by an amalgamation of his alcohol and drug abuse, bouts of depression up to the attack and his lack of commitment to anything.

       Regarding the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting: Nikolas Cruz was CLEARLY unstable for a good portion of time prior to the attack, (

       ) and to attach the motive of his attack to his political ideology is, once again, terrible analysis. Also, trying to tie right-wing people with racists is a huge part of the left's problem. It's what makes them think they have the moral highground. Not every racists is right-wing, and certainly not everyone who's right-wing is racist. That's a bigoted comment on your part. Do you know what a few synonyms of bigot are? Racist, fanatic, extremist, maniac, zealot. Look it up yourself if you don't believe me. So you're a bigoted left-winger. Just as bad as a racist right-winger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Affiliating those of the right-wing with racism makes it impossible to have an educated and intellectual discussion between both camps. You're a problem. You in particular. You are an exemplar of the problem with left-wingers.

       I'm going to reply to both of your comments here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mental health "excuse" (incredibly insulting for those who actually do suffer form mental health issues, which I can tell you, as a psychologist, many people suffer from) is a fine card to play if you can back it up as I have. Just playing that card with no evidence does nothing to support your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, it's not your fault that white power and white nationalist people tend to be right-wing, but it doesn't invalidate all those on the right-wing immediately. The whole left-right thing shouldn't be based on who you are, but on what policies you think should be adopted and accounted for by the government, because that's what it is at the heart of it. The fact you yanks like to carve your entire identity through politics is part of your problem. You have to do the work to separate who's who and what's what, as you're the one engaging with the dialogue. The same goes for those on the right who consider those on the left to be whingy social-justice warriors rife with contradictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's a war? A competition? You all live in the same country. Those are your brothers and sisters and you should work hard to see eye-to-eye with them. Just because you think left-wing policies are best, doesn't mean that all right-wing policies are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also:  white power and white nationalist groups *kind* of tend to be Republican and support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you admit yourself that you can't blanket bomb right-wingers as being racist, yet you're still arguing that point? You need a lesson in language my friend.

       I was calling it an excuse because it allows you to conveniently dismiss the murders. My point was that I could most likely make a case for every single terrorist murder that it's just their mental health. It's a bullshit cop out

       You call me a yank so I assume you are southern, but if we take politics out of our identities you would suddenly lose a fuck load of Confederate flags and Confederate war memorials. Politics is part of everybody's identity. You can't separate it from who you are.

       No it's not a competition but it's hard to argue with a base of people who are willfully ignorant. You've probably seen the videos of Republican rallies of people shitting on Obamacare but then also saying how much they love the affordable Care act. Same shit like that happens daily. Now do you argue with someone like that?
      </p>

       Yes I realize we all just want to make America better , but why is it largely a republican thing to tell liberals to get out if they don't like it here 🤔

       I try to remain objective, no not all right wing policies are bad, but when fear and ignorance is what drives your base, how do you argue with people's emotions and perception of reality that's bullshit?

       Im sure some are, but nowhere near what the righties have been putting out for the past 20 years or so.

       There were those right wing "militia" groups that were getting a lot of features and were being added to FBI lists to be kept an eye on. The fact  the average republican voter is driven by fear as studies have captures, its no wonder they are more radicalized in this point of time.

       I don’t understand why people always say this shit. It’s like they only base their thinking on bullshit media. I’m a white guy, and more than half of my closest friends are black. At my previous job I was accepted straight into a mainly black friend group. I don’t think race relations are bad right now, the media just wants to make it look that way. My advice, fuck the media, be friendly to everyone and they will be friendly back. The media wants us to be divided, DON’T fall for it. I feel like the only people who believe this are the same ones who don’t get much exposure to people of other races.

       You don't understand what the claim means. Basically you don't know the english language. Something to be 'normalised' means that it is dismissed as no big deal, socially acceptable to do, hip or even trendy to partake in, that it is somewhat promoted by culture or culture-shapers (media, celebrities, etc), and that the criticism of it is considered some sort of fringe radical thing to do ('hurrdurr opposing your demographic genocide means you're a lunatic neonazi thug').
      </p>
      <p>
       Do blacks still enslave other blacks and sell them to jewish slavers to be sold to wealthy whites in the US? No. Despite it not happening, is it 'normalised' ? Most certainly not, rather it is heavily criticised, opposed and politicised in order to incite hatred in blacks against (all) whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does lynching still occur in the US? No. Despite it not occuring, is it 'normalised' ? Most certainly not, rather it is heavily criticised, opposed and politicised in order to incite hatred in blacks against (all) whites. Does black on black mob-lynching still occur outside of the US? You bet your ass it does, but if whitey isn't doing it there is no political gain to be drawn and thus the jewish media does not use it for their means.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can do the other ones by yourself. The police one is especially hilarious because blacks collectively refuse to face the reality of their own disproportional criminality. Of course police treat them differently but it is not prejudice when it is justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks don't experience institutional racism in this day and age. Whites however do (under the guise of equality, humanitarism, and diversity).

       You should continue your train of thought. If you think blacks don't face institutional racism but yet exhibit higher rates of criminality, then what? What does that lead you to conclude about black people? I always like getting to this point with people that make the argument that you do. Please, continue...

       You should try 'thinking' and reflecting on complex issues, rather than resorting to mantras 'he racis!' like you've been programmed to like a pavlovian dog. You'd grow as a person. It's sad that I knew for a fact I was wasting my breath explaining these things to you, and you've proven my prejudice right. You don't even know where the term 'racist' comes from.

       Yeah, of course. The same people that brought us the utter garbage that is modern art (a result of relativising beauty), and which are now relativising gender, were busy relativising race back in the days when the 'nature vs nurture' debate was happening. And since these people have had a monopoly on media in the US since around 1912, they had a very easy time winning the debate (in the eyes of the public) by turning 'racist' into a slander term. The argument was that there is no such thing as race and all differences are a result of socioeconomic background etc. They were 'nurturists'. 'Racists' insisted, there is such a thing as race. And there is, obviously. And they're all beautiful and worthy of being preserved. There is nothing wrong with people having mixed-race babies, obviously. But when there is an internationally organised effort to demographically genocide whites, they have good reason to be concerned (google: Kalergi Plan, Hooton Plan, Kaufman Plan).

       Yeah I agree, he probably thinks he won the argument just by calling me a racist. Rather than addressing any of my points or arguments. That's how bad things are in this day and age. Can't reason with the brainwashed.

       Dude, you literally answered that there are genetic differences between us. Man up, make a statement that we can evaluate and maybe even provide evidence. There's as much or more genetic differences between tall and short people than there are between races, so saying "genetic differences" is pretty fucking vague.

       I've written so much and much such a compelling and high-effort case for my main argument, which you're not even addressing. Instead your skipping that and demanding that I now put equal effort into some other side-argument that you've started because what I said triggered you. Clearly I've wasted my time trying to so hard to explain my point, so I won't waste more time trying to explain this point you. Reply to my main post or leave it, I don't give a fuck. There's nothing more frustrating than putting effort into a post, talking about very important issues, and have the core argument of your post be completely ignored. Go waste someone elses time.

       Your views on nature vs nurture and the meaning of genetic differences, as well as your fear of an oxymoronic"demographic genocide" are at the direct heart of your argument. If you cannot see that I'm done here.

       You should continue your train of thought. If you think blacks don't face institutional racism but yet exhibit higher rates of criminality, then what? What does that lead you to conclude about black people? I always like getting to this point with people that make the argument that you do. Please, continue...

       I really don't feel like talking to you as if you were a little child, you seem worked up enough about this issue already. I'm not going to let you bait me into a discussion about semantics regarding a minor digression miles away from my core argument. It's the equivalent of me talking down to you for making a spelling mistake or claiming that your entire point is invalid because some authority has declared that the term 'vocab' means xyz, when that was marginally relevant to your point at best. Do you even follow? You're clearly very passionate about how right you are, I'm assuming you're late teens to early twenties at best. Just keep an open mind and the world will start making sense to you at some point throughout adulthood.

       Awww a backhanded age insult. If I'm older it means that I'm immature, very clever word play dude. I bet I could find a nonverbal shibboleth from the eighties that you wouldnt be able to Google search to find the correct answer. Maybe I'll reply with it if I think of one. You're cute

      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't an 'age insult', or insinuating that you're immature. Just inexperienced. I've insulted, belittled, and debated people who I believed were horribly wrong about everything, dumb and full of bigotry, hate and ignorance all of my life until around my late 20's when I got interested in politics and realised that the world is very different from what I thought. But I was just as sure of myself as you are. As all young people are.

       My favorite part of this last comment is that you say you started checking out politics in your late 20s LOL. Please catch up I'm in my 30s and have been paying full attention since 17. Figured if I was about to be eligible to die for my country I should start learning about it. I expect better from my elders

       Lol @ intellectual honesty. You do know how to formulate an argument, right? I've addressed the core thesis of your argument without directly responding to it and simply didn't address your evidence which consisted of a bunch of statements about how you think society is currently functioning. Please, show me where I'm wrong.

       He didnt say blacks dont face institutional racism lmao. He said that racism against whites is normalized meaning its not seen as a big deal. Blacks face way worse racism but its still not normalized.

       Indeed. It's really frustrating that the black community won't face the facts when it comes to crime statistics. And yes it's unfortunate that the police work under a quota system which therefore causes them to heavily patrol black neighborhoods so they can make more arrests. But the statistics are on their side. Also the single motherhood problem in black communities fall on deaf ears. It's close to 90 percent.... Which IMO could solve a the majority of problems for them if fixed but nah that's racist to bring up now apparently??? Not surprised at the reply you got from the dude above either, even tho every thing you said was true. No thoughtful reply... just "yer racist".

       Oh okay so when does that line of thought end.  Who decides how far back we go?  To where?  Do we pick and choose events and places?  Do we each get out notepads and tally up oppressive events against people who look like us?  Can I go back in time to before I was born?  Can I go back and cite an era that maximizes my victimhood?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell can I use this general idea to dismiss any sort of complaints?  Tell the homeless guy on the street to fuck off, my great grandpa almost starved to death in the dust bowl.

       Or better yet can we just start countering racial arguments with even more extreme ones?

       What? When looking at something as large as racial issues yes you go back and see what lead us to here. That's how context works? It's not "adding up oppression points" it's examining what institutional racism black people have faced and continue to face in America alone. Which is why we don't mention the Armenian genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not some super long ago mysterious historical event. Jim crow and the civil rights movement  was about 1 to 2 generations ago, the drug war is still continuing today, the criminal justice
       <em>
        today
       </em>
       still is harsher and less forgiving for black people and other minorities. It's not some fucking slippery slope when analyzing these events. When talking about strictly America, it's nothing compared to "I hate white people". It doesn't carry the same institutional weight that racism on black people carried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said we should still condemn ignorant statements like that, but it's ridiculous to act like it's the exact same

       But I don't think anyone claimed it is the exact same, or even more pervasive.  The claim was that it was more normalized.  Meaning, it is more socially accepted, and more likely to be dismissed.  If you don't agree with that, then okay - but his entire point was about current social norms, not the social norms of our parents or grandparents.

       Where exactly is there a push or process which does that to racism against black people? Whereas OPs example might be a questionable fit for that definition, it kinda fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not american btw so no skin in this game, I just don't get your point. Yes, black people do face "worse" racism today than whites and they definitely faced some gruesome racism in the past. That doesn't have any influence on OPs question here though since normalization js an active process that requires main stream push, which racism against black people (in the way of OPs post) definitely isn't getting at the moment. All imo and open to yours of course.

       I dunno man.. I don't think its a widespread mainstream thing but there's some stuff that makes me scratch my head. For example, I'm a white guy and I had a convo a few days ago with an asian guy who used to be a friend of mine before we drifted apart. He's become a progressive and is quite militant about his beliefs. I was a bit taken aback when he staretd telling me that due to "white privilege" it's impossible for him to be racist towards whites, despite some of the ugly things he was saying during our convo. Furthermore he contended that white people, regardless of who they are as an individual, are automatically racist by default due to nothing other than being white. I was a bit saddened that an otherwise intelligent person couldn't see the hypocrisy in his "i can do no wrong and you're automatically wrong by default" kind of views but what I found really messed up is he said this is the viewpoint that is taught in the social sciences (he's a gender studies/philosophy major). Now I'm not a social sciences student so I don't know if that's actually what's being taught or if that's just what 1 man with a chip on his shoulder decided to learn.. But if universities are actually teaching people that to be born white is to be born with some kind of Original Sin of racism then I think that could lead to some serious trouble if those kinds of ideas ever reach a tipping point. But yeah anyways.. I guess I'm still a bit dumbfounded by homeboy's beliefs and attitudes. He used to be a pretty chill guy, it's a shame.

       Notice how you have nothing to bring to the discussion. I went to a similar course for philosophy and social science and I was told not to speak up so much in class because I'm a white man and therefor representative of the majority demographic. I was the only white kid in the class. And now I'm openly racist.

       I think it depends where you live. If you live in a very left wing liberal place it may seem that way. I have a hard time with the concept of racism altogether. It’s technically about systemic oppression. But I live in a place where immigration is so common that white people are outnumbered by people of color, the people of color who come here have more money than the white people who have lived here their whole lives, and then they buy properties that sit empty or open businesses and don’t hire white people and don’t do any business with white people. This is something I struggle with daily because I’m trying to figure out where I should morally stand with it all. The people I see struggling the most are people who are white and were born here. So who’s really struggling systemically? And if racism is about systemic oppression as we see written all over the media then wouldn’t that mean that, in places like where I live, it’s fully possible to be racist against white people? I don’t know. But I do believe the volatility around it all is driving more of a wedge between ppl and now white folk are starting to feel attacked regularly. Then there’s the white ppl who literally hate themselves for being white and talk about it so casually. It’s sad. And the fact that some POC are pushing that and encourage it just shows that for some the racism fight isn’t about equality or equity at all. Scary and weird time we’re living in.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: i think racism against white people is possible in some circumstances and it is extremely encouraged in mainstream media which is scary to me

       Funny that you have to mention it that way...possible in some circumstances? Anyone can be racist towards anyone, all they have to do is prefer their own race over another. EVERY race does this. People distrust those who look or act different than themselves, since always.

       Not, racism against white people is not normalised or being normalised.

      <p>
       You feel threatened because equality is spreading and the white man's holdouts of power are becoming a more browny colour.

       In America i would say yes, in many African Countries, some european countries and most Asian and south American countries its pretty Alright. I am white and i have lived in most of these places for a while. The only place where it felt weird just being me was America and increasingly Europe. Otherwise the only racism im exposed to regulary is the Good kind (White skin and Blue eyes are quite exotic in most places in the world. Helps to dress well and speak the local language)
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why i get along with every race so far is because i treat them equally. In america and Europe you people start treating each other differently. Sometimes in Good ways, sometimes in Bad ways. As long as the law isnt colorblind this will just get worse and Swing in whatever direction. Currently its bad to be Black and White in America. Thats a fucking a shame. Always loved your country, but racism is something you just dont seem to get under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was trying to list what you people could do, but it summerizes best with this "You are one People, under one flag with one National Spirit."
      </p>
      <p>
       America needs a Government that tackles those problems. An Administration who runs solely on bringing the people together. Revamp the Electorate system, getting rid of those small advantages and big disadvantages that come with race and sexual affiliation. Those things are a distraction, intended to divide you as people.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe the american people have the Capacity to find a good Solution. You landed on the Bloody moon. How hard could solving Race problems possibly be!

       Yeah most definitely. Its definitely manufactured too. Last time I checked race relations were doing just fine in the 80's, 90's, and 2000's this bloody obsession with race has only started back up in the past 5 or 6 years i would say. Some girl told me a few weeks back that Im not allowed to have an opinon on what I find racist or not because of my whiteness. These people really need a history lesson if they think whites are the worst oppressors in history and the only ones who had slaves haha. Theres still open air slave markets in Lybia.

       I don't think so. At least since trump has been in office. And yeah I don't take part in it... it's a bit hard to ignore now seeing as that's all anyone talks about these days. But hey according to them I'm not allowed to take part cause I'm white anyway.

       Last time I checked Los Angeles was set on fire in the 90's because of race riots. But I suppose black people really need the history lesson here. According to you race relations we're doing just fine.

       So tell me history professor; what do you think those riots were about since you have declared they
       <em>
        were not
       </em>
       about race relations, I think we would all be enlightened by your knowledge on the subject.

       I believe that whites are being set up for (hot) genocide. Demographically that can only happen when there's nonwhite majority in the policeforce and military. Depending on how fast immigration progresses and how efficient the UN is at funding its NGO's that handle logistics, it'll start getting very uncomfortable within 20-40 years in central Europe.

       My advice would be to stop watching television.Go out into the world and start meeting people.My second piece of advice is to stop feeling like a victim.There are black folks who think TV is trying to normalize the feminization of Black men.I guess if you are looking for a certain narrative you are going to find it.There was a time awhile back I really thought racism was fading out,it was definitely there but I really thought with each new generation racism could start to fade.Now here we are in 2018 and if you watch your TV or go on Reddit or a YouTube comment section you will see hatred is on the rise and I can't help but think we are all being manipulated to hate each other.I refuse.I'm not scared of people who are darker than me.I can talk to gay people without the fear of being "turned gay".The only thing I can do is treat people the way I want to be treated.I promise you it makes life a lot easier.

       This is more true than many would believe. We get target fixated with more than just our eyes. If you assume there is racism, feminization, etc., in something, you will find it naturally.

       Exactly.I don't want to talk shit about the guy because I'm trying to be more positive.Black folks are being murdered by police and the guy is trying to say we are being made fun of by Jimmy Fallon and the sitcoms always portray the White father as a bumbling idiot.The dumb dad who gets himself into comedic situations only to be saved by the wife in the last 22 minutes is the oldest television trope there is.Get a grip man.

       Okay that's cool and all.  I do go outside, I am not afraid of black people either(I am white and I am married to one!).

       But I prefer to know about the bad stuff than not know.  So even though I don't care much for mainstream television, I do like to know about stuff like this.  I do think there is a bit of the problem along the lines of what OP suggests, and I think it is wrong, and when I see it I will say it's wrong.  And I like to know who says it and on what show and channel.

       Every new TV show, and especially commercial's portray White Men as bumbling fools. This is true on all channels... Especially Disney. They portray the 'boss' as a black or Hispanic  woman, and all the employees worthy of respect except of course the Straight White Man. Sadly this is not new.  Watch reruns of Sanford &amp; son, good times and other early 1970's shows, that's when it began.

       Pop Culture, cable news, online magazines, twitter - it's becoming more and more okay to throw shade at "generic white man" because they probably voted for Trump and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the real world, white men still dominate this country from the top down.  They're the judges, the politicians, the business owners, the cops, etc.  White people are having their moment being mocked on twitter, but they still have all the power.

       Yes...there is a joke/meme that 'you can't be racist unless you're white' that some actually believe, that you can only be racist if you have power. Just non sense, all the people telling you not to pay attention to it are missing the point.

       for example. They switch out headlines and articles absolutely shitting on white men and replaces it with "Jewish man" instead of "White man" and you really see okay it is to hate white people in media.

       I am white too and I have encountered very little open racism, as far as I can tell, despite living in an area where white people are the minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, let me tell you a secret... I am around minorities a lot.  I watch what goes on around me.  I am married to a minority.  I have literally never witnessed anyone else experience racial oppression either.

       I had a conversation with a Co worker about this. I work in a hotel and last week was derby, so many elder people came in at once apart of a group. I assumed they were family/friends. They started drinking, small talking, and then started singing my old Kentucky home.
The front desk employee came to the kitchen and stated how angry she was they were making so much noise and said she hated white people. I know she's liberal and was probably expecting me to go back and forth about how white people are bad, like I assume she has done frequently with other people considering how easily she said it.
I took the other way, I told her I don't appreciate racism in my kitchen and that I don't care what she believes in but saying things like that is very disrespectful.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was stunned to say the least. That was probably the first time anyone has held her accountable for saying something so absurd.
I talked to her more about how she's white and that she should take pride in her heritage, just like if she was literally another ethnic group, you should always feel pride for who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most anti white sentiments I see are from fellow white people. People who have been brainwashed into believing this way, through liberal arts universities and mass media.

       One of the primary objectives of both world wars and the American Civil War was the planned extermination of formidable white alpha males. And it's not just whites, even though they were the biggest threat to world domination just due to a more advanced level of technology, education, weaponry, etc. The string pullers want us pitted against each other. If capable, thinking humans stood together, it would be much more messy and difficult, if not impossible, to control and repress them.

       It's all part of the greater scheme to dismantle western civilizations. Fester hate against whites; import foreigners. Fetishize cuckoling. Make abnormal men the norm. And we all know (((who))) is behind this genocide perpetrated against whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they are very much succeeding on making it normal though. For instance, check the difference between
       <a href="/r/blackpeoplegifs">

       and
       <a href="/r/whitepeoplegifs">
        /r/whitepeoplegifs

       . One contains people doing cool shit the other contains people doing stupid shit. Guess which one is which.

       Exactly.I don't want to talk shit about the guy because I'm trying to be more positive.Black folks are being murdered by police and the guy is trying to say we are being made fun of by Jimmy Fallon and the sitcoms always portray the White father as a bumbling idiot.The dumb dad who gets himself into comedic situations only to be saved by the wife in the last 22 minutes is the oldest television trope there is.Get a grip man.
