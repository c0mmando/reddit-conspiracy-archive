<p>My life isn&#39;t a certain way that causes me to notice their harassment, it&#39;s just too much harassment to not notice, forget the constant remote torture or any of the weird coincidences, I see an organized effort to corrupt humanity with constant wars, religions, false governments, corrupted education system, legal system, healthcare system, controlled media, etc. </p>

<p>1984, Snowden, Atlantis falling because they didn&#39;t control their knowledge or technology, scientists warning of a technological apocalypse, people relating mark of the beast to microchip implants, the emerging threat of a total surveillance state has been a topic repeated so much in media and is undeniable at this point IMO, getting to be one of those in your face things that comes to fruition in time.  </p>

<p>My best guess is experimentation and destroying some normal people&#39;s potential to create good change in the world. Giving a job to obedient people as a means of stabilizing the economy while at the same time harassing certain individuals and recognizing people&#39;s behaviors through time, slowly shaping their desired hierarchy and separating classes according to our behavior towards the state, deciding who gets to die early or who gets to be their next favorite actor.  </p>

<p>I have lot of important connections and very talented in art, I&#39;ve been harassed a lot between Iran and US, at 24 I&#39;m tortured everyday with technology that creates painful sensations in my body for doing specific things. They always know where I am or what I&#39;m doing like every body has a unique resonance and my brainwaves are connected to a machine that sends synthetic signals when it&#39;s in specific states. I believe it&#39;s a joint effort between intelligence agencies of different countries and/or cults, who else would care enough to carry out an operation of this magnitude but those that believe they&#39;ve been ordered by God, you don&#39;t have to accept these people&#39;s reasoning for their actions to accept that they&#39;re doing these actions, they believe very strongly in what they do and that&#39;s what matters.</p>

<p>Government officials act like we need war and they are all pawns acting out a script because they love to perpetuate hate between people, it&#39;s their life mission.</p>

<p>I liked this at the end of Jim Keith&#39;s book Mind Control, World Control someone might appreciate it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Key to understanding mind control is understanding the 
capabilities of life itself, and that may be salvation for the 
population of this planet. <strong>Mind control is a reductive process by 
which a life unit is reduced in power until it is placed under the 
control of the manipulative agent. It is the means by which man 
is turned into an animal, or a machine.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The direction is obvious. It is our challenge to decondition ourselves and our fellow humans from all of the various modes of 
mind control that currently shape and warp our lives, both the 
dramatic ones I have focused on in this volume, and the less 
dramatic ones that have been applied since time immemorial.</strong> 
Brain control implants, yes; psychotronic generators, yes; but 
there are a host of more subtle control techniques that must be 
confronted: television, advertising, schooling, religion... political 
correctness.</p>

<p>At one end of the scale there is the psychiatric-conditioned 
animal, the human reduced in intellect and taught to drool by 
Pavlovian dog training techniques. The other end of the scale of 
possibilities open to humanity knows no definition. Although it 
may be a controversial viewpoint, I believe that the potentials of 
humans are unlimited after they have been progressively freed 
from limiting beliefs and delusions, all of which communicate to 
them that they are puny things who must carry out the wishes of 
the controllers. <strong>Technology can, in fact, be utilized to destroy 
limitations to human freedom, and that is another part of the 
challenge, to harness technology in the work of liberation.</strong> 
Ultimately, all barriers to our evolution can be shed. All limits 
to human freedom are imposed by mind control.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize how much governments like to create wars between people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some questions that might bring up bad memories. Don’t answer if it’s too much to relive, of course. </p>

<p>-What’s the most unbelievable “strange thing” that has happened to you? 
-What about most disturbing? 
-Has there been anything that made you laugh or at least smile? Either at its absurdity, or in kind of a “touché” moment? I am not wording this well, I’m sorry if it’s rather broad and vague.
-Was there one particular moment of epiphany? Or more like the Last Straw, the incident that finally propelled you through the door?
-Have you told anyone IRL? </p>

<p>These are sensitive questions, I know; I don’t mean to upset you. I just feel like I can’t ask <em>anything</em> in the gangstalking or targetedindividuals subs. They are, not surprisingly, rather paranoid. I don’t want to interfere too much. So I’m kind of just laying out questions for you without elaboration.</p>

<p>Do you ever feel paranoid yourself? Or more like in fight or flight mode? Anything specific set that off?</p>

<p>Does it seem like men are more likely to be targeted</p>

<p>I’m not looking for anything it particular, just a sharper picture. I don’t expect you to reply, because it’s overwhelming or too personal. But if you answer anything, my thanks!</p>

<p>Telepathic communication with tall Nordic alien that appeared in my mind&#39;s eye, pretty sure it was caused by technology and inducement of pain everyday on specific times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about most disturbing?</p>

<p>Squeezing of my heart like 20 times a day for 2 days.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With the constant remote torture and organized harassment against my family for 10+ years I find their stereotypical street theater fucking hilarious.  </p>

<p>Was there one particular moment of epiphany? Or more like the Last Straw, the incident that finally propelled you through the door?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about a particular moment that made me certain of my targeting it would probably be when I first found out about targeting and they did a series of different things to me in about a week: increased stalking, squeezing of my heart, induced different emotions, forced crying like pushing a button, induced heavy pressure under my scalp, different voices, on the last night they induced a virtual reality dream of being murdered, none of this kind of stuff happened before or since.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you told anyone IRL?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lot of people, even stood with a sign about electronic torture in Tehran and tried to explain about remote influencing technologies to strangers. Most people would act empathetic towards my situation but I spread this info cuz I&#39;m worried for our future and I believe making people constantly worry about their own life is a trap cuz we really need unity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you ever feel paranoid yourself? Or more like in fight or flight mode? Anything specific set that off?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO organized harassment against me and my family for 10+ years (I&#39;m 24) has changed me a little but not in significant ways, the only time I&#39;ve really felt paranoid was when they induced it technologically one time.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it seem like either men or women are more likely to be targeted? Or at least more likely to connect with others and talk about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe everyone is targeted to a degree, the tactics can change according to how our behavior changes I&#39;ve noticed the more I talk about this topic my harassment increases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand there are a lot of people that suffer from paranoid delusions of grandeur and that it feels real to you, but this is a problem the human mind has faced for thousands of years. They used to believe mental illness was caused by demons and witches, always assuming an outside force, and now some people believe in mind control technology (believe me, if you spent some time talking to a neuroscientist you&#39;d understand how controlling specific neurons is less likely than demons popping out of the ground). You are giving very specific descriptions of mental illness (I&#39;m not a psychologist but it screams schizophrenia to me) that are significantly interfering with your life, and I think you might find yourself much happier if you got help and saw a professional. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just assume I&#39;m some government agent sent to fuck with you for no discernible reason but honestly I just get sad when I see people living this way and refusing to get help.</p>

<p>I know doctors man talking to people or asking for help isn&#39;t an issue for me, I&#39;m more worried for the future of Earth or other people&#39;s kids than myself atm and I use reddit as a therapeutic activity, in other words to ask people&#39;s help for this important cause, not to whine or ask for their tips on how to mitigate their torture.

<p>that&#39;s exactly what I was referring to, even you understand on some level that you would be better off without your illness, you just believe that none of it has anything to do with your own mind. I&#39;ve done research into electromagnetism and its effect on the human brain, this is all paranoid and completely unscientific from people who also seriously need help. I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t bad things in the world, but this really isn&#39;t it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply . . .</p>

<p>Can you elaborate or what “squeezing” of your heart means? Does it hurt, or effect you breathing? I get these random, very brief pains, more like “catches” they’re so brief, and it’s hard to tell if it’s heart or lung related. So your comment about that caught my eye.</p>

<p>How many in your family? How far extended? Do they all notice?</p>

<p>Have you read The Mothman Prophecies? Nordic alien sightings go way back, you might be interested if you didn’t already know about those accounts month alothers.</p>

<p>I understand if you don’t want to share anymore if you feel at risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it a bit more likely that you are simply making typos and not noticing them till they are &quot;published&quot;?</p>

<p>This is why professional outfits that produce copy (newspapers, book publishers, etc) tend to put everything to several pairs of eyes before it sees the light of day. </p>

<p>Proofreading your own copy is very hard work indeed, and a recipe for more work than you originally intended. (FWIW the only semi-reliable trick to get round this flaw in human perception is to read everything you write, but backwards so you can&#39;t get into the &#39;flow&#39; of it and start making unconscious assumptions.)</p>
