<p>Who said they aren’t? Notice that only one specific FBI investigation seems to be leaking like a broken faucet? Do large RICO cases normally leak details of the investigation on a daily basis? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think my optimistic view is both built in (genetic) and based on personal experience. I work in a large institution in a poor neighborhood and have repeatedly (especially 10+ years ago) left my purse in the cafeteria, or my wallet. Every time I got a call to collect it. The people who called me make 1/10 of what I do.  I once left my purse on the subway, where it was found by the MTA people.  I got a call from them to collect it (before they sent it to lost and found).  I have met and cared for (I am a MD) criminals and murderers and found that they are loved by their family, and that they love and care for their children. </p>

<p>I also have observed that even people who i think are doing the wrong thing, are often earnestly trying to do the right thing, within the narrative or social construct they work/live in.   This is why the fake news/post truth thing bothers me so much. People end up believing narratives that are far from true. Ie Nazi germany and stereotyping Jews. Or white people believing their problems are because of non-white people. </p>

<p>as for what you say about people doing the wrong thing while trying to do the right thing, does good intention make up for undesirable outcome? it doesn&#39;t. there is simply just no way that the majority&#39;s good-oriented efforts are hampered by social and cultural limitations. i think you&#39;re unsucessfully trying reconcile the contradiction between what you think is how people generally behave vs the end result, which does not reflect the efforts you say they try to make</p>

<p>The RNC and DNC dont even need to hold elections. They could technically just pick a candidate if they wanted to. So the coordination with the Hillary campaign was super stupid but it&#39;s their right to do it. </p>

The media was incredibly complicit in hiding information from the average low information voter. Those who worked tirelessly over the last 10 years to expose obama and hillary were mocked and ridiculed by the same people who now want justice because they hate trump. </p>

<p>Too bad he hasnt broken any laws, which is why endless false narratives and over the top drama is needed to sway public opinion. The media has it&#39;s own agenda and it&#39;s quite clear from reading David Brocks &quot;manifesto&quot; about driving and controlling narratives and talking points through media matters. </p>

<p>They tried to poison peoples minds against trump in favor of hillary. Unlike 2008 when hildog was running against obama. The people wanted real change, not empty words and another useless politican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The investigation is merely a way to ensure Trump continues the war machine and to keep people from really questioning how the Democrats could possibly lose to such a crass and inexperienced opponent.  Also, you have to keep pushing this narrative to further the lie that Russia is responsible for our election outcomes and other political quandrays.</p>

<p>Clinton will never be investigated because she is just another tentacle of the permanent state.</p>

<p>In reality, an actual investigation would find that all of the highest level politicians regularly engage in illegal and unethical behavior at the behest of moneyed interests and the only actual goal of either party is to further that hierarchy so that regular folks can never acheive undue influence in the geopolitical sphere.</p>

<p>Left versus right is largely a philosophical struggle and not reflective of real issues that genuinely impact the general public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of separate issues which exist independent of each other: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is HRC guilty of one or more offenses against the United States, possibly including charities fraud, pay for play, etc.?</li>
<li>Has Trump fulfilled his campaign promise to prosecute her for those crimes?</li>
</ol>

<p>1) is an open question, though I would lean towards expecting that she&#39;s likely guilty of at least some federal crimes that could lead to hard time. My opinion on that is largely formed by the fact that <em>anyone</em> involved in DC at her level for that amount of time is essentially guaranteed to have committed multiple federal felonies. </p>

<p>2) Pretty clear he hasn&#39;t followed through, and I can only speculate as to why. </p>

<p>My point is that these two issues have no real bearing on the truth of the other. Trump could have pursued Clinton even if she were innocent, and Trump not pursuing her does not imply that she is innocent. </p>

<p>Claiming Trump&#39;s decision not to prosecute (yet?) has any bearing on HRC&#39;s guilt is whataboutism. </p>
