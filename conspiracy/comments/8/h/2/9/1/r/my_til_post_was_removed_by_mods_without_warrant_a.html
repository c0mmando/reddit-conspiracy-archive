        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mods from TIL removed my post within 2 minutes. It was &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/8h1gee/til_global_populations_of_fish_birds_mammals/">TIL global populations of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles DECLINED BY 58&amp;#37; between 1970 and 2012 and by 2020 could decline by as much as 66&amp;#37;</a>&quot; They cited Rule 4, as Political...</p>

<p>I plugged in Ceddit for r/TIL to see how many posts were removed for &quot;Rule 4: Politics&quot; and it&#39;s a TON. The censorship on r/TIL is astounding. Seems Rule 4 is a catchall for anything they don&#39;t want on the front page.</p>

<p>So, How to use Ceddit? Basically replace the &quot;r&quot; in Reddit with a &quot;c&quot;. That&#39;s it. (It may take a few seconds to load). Shows all removed and deleted comments and posts.</p>

<p>Also, here is a list of interesting posts I found removed from TIL after a few mins research:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting this from an earlier post.</p>

<p>I used to be a mod of TIL starting october 11th 2012 but I quit after a few months because the mods couldn&#39;t agree on the best way to recruit new mods among others such as the best way to enforce the rules they had at the time. Looking at their mod list now it really hasn&#39;t changed at all except they have like 8 new people. For a subreddit of that size the small number of mods they have seems odd.</p>

<p>Honestly unless those new 8 mods that were added since I quit have taken charge. I think they&#39;re just as incompetent now as they were then.</p>

<p>Are you failing to note the difference between a public forum that is a privately owned, for profit business serving, the &quot;public.&quot; 
Discrimination is not allowed for race, religion, or sex. (this is not about the recent effort to include LGBT).</p>

<p>Public forum that is a tax supported and created entity, like the internet as a whole, government owned parks, roadways and like your local city hall meeting, or Congressional home visit meeting.</p>

All this turffing is building a false impression that we supported this coup that paraded as an election in 2016 and that we are accepting it, including insanely false polling.  And please there is no polling going on, thanks to the data collectors, they can create the poll results they want and still pretend they are scientific. </p>
