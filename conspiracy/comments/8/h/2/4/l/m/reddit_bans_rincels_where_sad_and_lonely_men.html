<p>Incels are sad and pathetic men who can&#39;t get laid. Maybe they didn&#39;t have a good male role model or they&#39;re overweight or they suffer from some mental problems. Don&#39;t try and help them be better people. We&#39;re told to accept women with all of those issues but when it&#39;s men, fuck em.</p>

<p>So r/incels got banned but they have a sub called r/inceltears to make fun of incels. TwoXChromosomes types that would not tolerate the reverse of this shit.</p>

<p>Who is behind this bullshit and what are they trying to accomplish?</p>

<p>They&#39;re not realy &quot;integrating&quot; as much as finding another place to talk. Integration assumes a broader meshing. But that&#39;s what r/conspiracy is. When r/politics went full Corporatist pro-HRC, when r/WikiLeaks switched mods, when r/pizzagate was shut down, many people, myself included, found our way here. This is the beauty of r/conspiracy. It is the home of the dispossessed, the silenced, the minority. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to agree on anything at all, other than that we are all here to talk and seek the Truth. That is the ideal, at least. </p>

<p>People like you are part of the problem... all on the left are intolerant losers that can&#39;t handle opposing viewpoints without breaking down in tears... It&#39;s just as bad as assuming all people on the right are racist bigots or all Trump supporters are uneducated zealots. </p>

If doxxing material is posted on a subreddit and it is quickly removed by the moderators, then we should ban <em>the subreddit</em>?!? Holy shit.

If you don&#39;t want to believe it that&#39;s fine for you to just carry on oblivious in your own little bubble.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t be arsed to pore through the net to find a bunch of shit for you to just claim is false.</p>

<p>The recent one that got some press was the pony power site which was being used to gather and publish personal information on Antifa members.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Antifa or any violent demonstration whatsoever this was just something I remember reading about recently so could find in two minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/09/06/how-right-wing-extremists-stalk-dox-and-harass-their-enemies/">https://theintercept.com/2017/09/06/how-right-wing-extremists-stalk-dox-and-harass-their-enemies/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t like this website but it has the screen grabs all in one place if you scroll down and I couldn&#39;t be arsed to get all different screenies that are available and upload them to an albulm on imgur so take from it what you will.</p>

<p>In these grabs, they also talk about documenting and doxing liberal teachers and professors. </p>

<p>I can almost guarantee you&#39;ll respond with some low effort BS like Fake News or w/e. But let&#39;s see. Maybe you&#39;ll just continue denying reality while thinking that it is only liberals that have scumbags in their ranks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay but THIS ISNT THE GUBMENT. Your right of free speech is protected AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. Your right to free speech, in a public setting (sometimes with permits being required) is PROTECTED. Your speech on a private website, public website, inside a corporation’s building (you’re “in” reddit’s Building when you post here) ARE NOT. like this isn’t complicated AT ALL. You can claim that this is a precedent all you want, but if you’re doing that then you should be fighting reddit’s Terms of agreement, not some free speech crusade. Your entire premise is so beyond misguided. You’re essentially saying that I should be able to walk in to a church, stand on the pulpit, and preach about Satan cause: speech. That’s not how this works. Your free speech is only protected in a public space not owned by any entity, and you’re allowed to speak against the government without fear of punishment</p>

<p>You are NOT allowed to post on a private company’s forum about raping women if it goes against their TOS.....technically you’re “allowed” to in that the gov can’t prosecute you for it unless it’s a specific threat, but that company is under ZERO obligation to host your comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve missed the point entirely. As I said elsewhere, places like Reddit, Google, Facebook, etc; are so large, so heavily trafficked, that they effectively function as public spaces. They are where the majority of people get their news, share their lives, and search for information. To simply &quot;leave&quot; such a large platform is genuinely unfeasible. </p>

<p>These platforms are being used with this loophole in mind, to censor Free Speech. They always start with the weak targets and move on to larger ones, getting everyone used to it as they go along. You are a perfect example of this- you are defending this bullshit like it&#39;s personally effecting <em>you</em>. And it will, one day, when the bullshit you so foolishly support comes back to be used against you. Maybe then you will learn.</p>

<p>In the meantime, have fun being angry, and defending the elitist scum who are using the censuring of one groups Rights to eventually destroy your own. Maybe one day you&#39;ll wake up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright great you think they should be classified as public spaces. They aren’t. So either run for office to change it or gtfo cause at the moment the people you’re complaining about being oppressed are actually the ones breaking the rules. Not the ones doing the “oppressing”</p>

<p>Let me ask you this....CP watchers feel their being oppressed for their feelings that they can’t help. Sure they’re fucked yo beyond belief, they’re monsters, but should the internet companies allow them to view their fucked up wishes? How’s the part where you say “of course not that’s illegal” and here’s the part where I say Great!! But according to the TOS, that everyone agrees to when they create an account on this site, these fucks are “illegal” to the company. They know what website they sign up for. </p>

<p>To paint this as a free speech issue is disengenouis. This is a corporatist issue not a free speech issue. If you want to attack these companies attack their TOS, but using the 1st/free speech is just showing a basic lack of understanding of what the 1st is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Pretty much what I expected. Do you believe they should be banned from the internet?</p>

<p>Radical feminists have the same beliefs.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry#Radical_feminism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry#Radical_feminism</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Andrea Dworkin criticized the biological determinist strand in radical feminism that, in 1977, she found &quot;with increasing frequency in feminist circles&quot; which echoed the views of Valerie Solanas that <strong>males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a gendercide</strong> to allow for the emergence of a &quot;new Übermensch Womon&quot;.[14]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mary Daly&#39;s utopian vision of a world in which men and heterosexual women have been eliminated is an extreme example of this tendency.[18] Daly argued that sexual equality between men and women was not possible and that women, due to their superior capacities, should rule men.[19] Yet later, in an interview, Daly argued &quot;If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males.&quot;[20]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their 2001 book, Spreading Misandry, analyzed &quot;pop cultural artifacts and productions from the 1990s&quot; from movies to greeting cards for what they considered to be pervasive messages of hatred toward men.[22]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some feminists &quot;have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex&quot; as &quot;a hot anger toward men [that] seems to have turned into a cold hatred.&quot;[25] She argued it was a misandrist position to consider men, as a class, to be irreformable or rapists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>feminist Mary P. Koss&#39;s discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that &quot;rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are extremists on both sides. All of these radical feminists have written books and give talks on college campuses.</p>

<p>Should they be banned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would personally like a place where all speech is allowed. However, reddit is a private company and that is clearly not their goal. I fully understand why they would ban a subreddit connected to a mass murder, where the posters are supporting said mass murderer and calling for more such actions.</p>

<p>I would imagine reddit would do this with any such subreddit. Until that subreddit is making headlines though, the will let them fly under the radar.</p>

<p>If reddit existed when Andy Warhol was shot, I would imagine related subreddits would be banned.</p>

<p>There might be people trying to frame them, or they might be trying to downplay what they said in the past, but it&#39;s pretty clear that some sad, lonely, and eventually homicidal people have been attracted to the rhetoric of these sites.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also quite possible that given these recent high-profile mass murders and news articles, that the people on these sites might want to downplay that connection. They might even be saying their most heinous speech is planted by their critics.</p>

<p>Even on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> one random forum post agreeing with you is a pretty low bar for evidence.</p>

<p>the so called feminazis, radical feminists with either an axe to grind or a power base to build and maintain.</p>

<p>as Simone de Beauvoir describes in her book &#39;The Second Sex&#39;, females go through stages in their sexuality, the teenage clitorial stage, some stay there forever and deny the adulthood male sexual stage, ie sex with men and marriage and motherhood.</p>

<p>radical men hater lesbians are stuck in this teeny phase.</p>
