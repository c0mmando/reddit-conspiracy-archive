       Yeah man, but at the same time, you gotta realize not everyone has to think the same way as you. People can be 'blind' and shit, but they can still be fun to hang out with. I know it's agonizing to hear them talk about issues like they know something when they're completely wrong, but just keep your mouth shut, smile and nod.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're social creatures. We need social interaction to be healthy and happy. A truly wise man understands that everyone is on their own journey, and if you're truly wise you can council people without berating or belittling them. You can see their problems for what they are, but also understand they need to learn at their own pace, and maybe they'll never learn, and that's okay.

       Socializing with the herd can be mentally or spiritually damaging to one who has found their center of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the herd is scary cuz they have the ability to move me off my center of power.  At the very least, I often have to hold my tongue.  Once or twice, no biggie.  All night?  One can only smile and nod and deflect for so long.

       Well, what do believe is right that you could only save by becoming anti-social. There’s a lot shit going on in the world that is terrible, stupid, or a combination of both. But thinking that you alone see it or can fix it is letting all that win. Like they say in AA, if you meet more than two assholes in the course of your day, you’re probably number 3.

       I never talk about it here because this is a conspiracy sub, but I couldn’t agree with you more. The entire plot of the show is almost like it was written by a conspiracy theorist. It’s like you said, the whole plot is to be truly free. The government in the show is deeply corrupt, the military is even allied with the “strongest” pirates(the evil ones).

       Fuck it lol. I don’t care about upvotes, I’m just super excited someone knows what I’m talking about man. If they’d seen the show they’d understand. They are probably just dismissing us as stupid weabs, but they are the ones missing out on a great show with very relevant topics.

       Yeah man, It is super good. Still ongoing too, they are on hiatus to make the next bit (which I prefer because they dont have to make a bunch of filler to keep everyone entertained while they make it back to the good stuff). But it just keeps getting more and more intense. they just took out the equivalent of drug lords and slave trade. Shit, the enemy was giving children experimental drugs through candy that made them turn into giants but killed them at a young age, also had crazy withdraw symptoms. shit gets real in One Piece

       Furthermore, this is why truly intelligent people usually like to be alone and are introverted. Once you see/know various things about the world around you, you can no longer unsee them. Trivial matter(s) become unbearable.

       This is how I feel. I wish I could find others who feel the same. It hurts to keep certain things in sometimes. Some times, small talk is pretty painful to me honestly. Its like a pre-written social dance that I do not want a part of sometimes because I'm too tired.
