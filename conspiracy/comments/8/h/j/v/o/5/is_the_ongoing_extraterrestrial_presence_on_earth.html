        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is ample evidence now that civilization is older than the Egyptians and Sumerians, although we know next to nothing about this civilization. There is ample evidence that the Catholic Church burnt down the Library of Alexandria which held extensive records of what the Ancients knew in an effort to exert more influence over their mostly illiterate followers, the little bit that survived was enough for a few bright minds to spark the Renaissance and bring us to the Space Age. Think about that. </p>

<p>There are hundreds of eyewitnesses of dozens of incidents revolving around UFOs disarming nuclear warheads and missiles, the ETs have taken a much greater interest in us during WWII and after. The Cold War never got hot because the US and USSR were able to figure out what the Nazis figured out, the US employed any rocket scientists from Germany under Project Paperclip. In 1947, the Roswell incident happened and the CIA was formed 90 days after while the Air Force became a separate arm from the Army. </p>

<p>From 1947 to 2017, the number of sightings kept going up and 95% were easily dismissed but 5% was not. That 5% still leaves thousands of incidents, hundreds of highly trained eyewitnesses (pilots, military officials) radar reports, videos, photos. Media and academia are fed a lot of disinformation to make the whole area seem kooky and make anyone who comes out afraid of ridicule. With the work of Steven Greer and Tom Delonge (let me know if there are others) over the last few years, the truth is slowly coming out but it&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>What do you think? I can&#39;t stop learning about this subject and wondering, I just want to talk about it here and discuss. Maybe there are some gaps in my outlook or missing pieces of information or something that I need to watch/read next. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why is that disclosing this information is extremely bad for national security. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a malicious thing to do, the brightest minds on the planet are working behind the scenes with billions in funding but simply need more time. Whatever civilization(s) have interacted with Earth, have had thousands, maybe millions, more years of evolution than us. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a combination of fear of breaking down the social order, protecting national security, waiting for the right time (they have been leaking stuff little by little for decades). My hope is that we will get the truth in bigger doses in coming years and eventually we can all get on the same page: we need to become an interplanetary civilization or we are just asking for extinction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just the fact that they haven&#39;t killed us all yet is a positive sign.

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. I don&#39;t think they need technology from us but maybe there is something special about Earth and about human beings that we are unaware of since we haven&#39;t explored anything outside of this planet yet? </p>

<p>I think the flood really happened in ancient times and it wiped out a civilization 12,000 years ago. There is geologic evidence of an asteroid hitting the Arctic around that time and it caused enough disruption to force civilization to start over. Maybe that was not a natural event? </p>

<p>I listen to JR a lot and I think he is right. However, based on everything I&#39;ve gathered from the best possible sources out there...they are advanced for sure but there is a moral code that advanced civilizations seem to follow where you can&#39;t &#39;just do that&#39;. A few do go rogue and exterminate or conquer planets but it creates conflicts with other races? This is all speculation. </p>

<p>They must have a reason, a plan. Maybe they are waiting for the right moment. Maybe they don&#39;t need Earth or humans, they are just concerned that are now a nuclear-building, space-faring civilization that is only a few lightyears away from them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too, Egyptian, Indian, Mayan, Incan, Hopi too for me. I find the concept of &#39;cargo cults&#39; fascinating, how island peoples worshipped WWII cargo planes and their crew as &#39;gods&#39; when they landed. I think something similar happened in Ancient times around the world and the Church was able to erase that with the burning of the Library of Alexandria. Isolated fragments of the stories are still there all over the world but the narrative now is that &#39;they were just pretending, it wasn&#39;t literal.&#39; Which makes me wonder, how do you know which parts are literal and which are not? They sounded pretty serious to me, considering the subject matter. </p>

<p>In India, it&#39;s the least thinly veiled. The Nazis sent teams of people there to collect obscure texts about ancient flying crafts and metallurgy. We actually don&#39;t know where Sanskrit originated from, it&#39;s the world&#39;s oldest language and it&#39;s complexity is still beyond most people&#39;s comprehension.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I get into &#39;conspiracy&#39; culture the more im starting to think we might have it reversed. Perhaps what we know as mythology actually holds more truth than the main modern pillars of religion, which came about copying and pasting most of the old myths with a twist anyways to suit their transition... Maybe they are the fake gatekeepers that had to replace and safeguard the old truths? Who knows</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That statement doesn&#39;t really have any value, though. (I mean no offense by this.) </p>

<p>Questioning is how you change your viewpoint on literally everything. </p>

<p>An atheist that becomes a Christian got there by questioning. A Christian that became a Muslim got there by questioning. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t refute that it would bring things into question, but it certainly doesn&#39;t destroy the narrative. There are theists that don&#39;t rule out that we as a species were &quot;created&quot; by mortal extraterrestrials, for example.</p>

<p>Suspend your disbelief for a moment, <em>If a god, some extradimensional being- a creator of our dimension, could manifest himself in a physical form on some rock and speak to the intelligent life on that rock with their language</em> do you think such a being could not also do this on other rocks? (and if these beings dont have this origin story) Couldn&#39;t a being with a mind play favorites?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not an argument for religion, or for deities. I&#39;m just making the example that people&#39;s beliefs are pliable and even if theyre brought into question holes can be (and honestly always have been) patched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your examples all are minority and specific people. The majority of believers will question their faith (which is a problem for the religions but great for humanity) thus resulting in a great shift in our society - once based on religion, but now no one is sure since religions don&#39;t really stick to people&#39;s minds anymore.</p>

<p>Also, no atheist will ever be converted to christianism/any other religion. Once the need for <em>belief</em> is lost and reason is in place, you never go back. It&#39;s impossible, since proving god is ridiculously absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that I went from being an atheist to believing in God, but in the process my idea of &quot;God&quot; changed drastically. I don&#39;t follow any pre-packaged religion, which is effectively institutionalised spirituality (wherein &quot;spirituality&quot; simply refers to the study of consciousness), but I&#39;m constantly following and adapting and updating my own &quot;personal religion&quot; which is tailored to my life, my ever-changing understanding of the world, and my ever-changing circumstances. And I believe now that &quot;God&quot; simply means the ultimate state of all things together in unity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My late father, why by no means was a ufo theorist told me a story a couple of years before he passed.</p>

<p>We were watching some ufo show about sightings and I kinda scoffed. He got dead serious and told me he was in bentonville Arkansas one night driving with my step mom. They say something the size of a football field moving slowly and silently not far above them. They stopped at a gas station to observe it and went to get the attendant to show him, but it zipped up and was gone.</p>

<p>After dad passed I asked my stepmom to IM me the story for posterity and it was exactly as dad described it 4 years earlier.</p>

<p>I have personally never seen anything resembling a ufo, but like I said, my dad wasn’t the kind of man to just make something like that up. And as far as I know they never told any neighbors or friends about the incident.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it absolutely is, op. Have you ever smoked DMT?  You should, if you want an alien encounter yourself. And for a much better researcher than Greer, check out Richard Dolan, who wrote &quot;UFO&#39;S and the National Security State.&quot; The other piece of the puzzle is the ancient Gnostic mythology. Check out the works of John Lash on that. Humans are the spawn of a divine intelligence, which created this planet, but we also have enemies, called Archons,  which seek to destroy us. Each force is producing its own drugs to manipulate us in opposite directions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have and I know exactly what you mean. I had more of a spiritual experience that transcended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">samsara</a> the first time. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/772gfc/report_of_first_ever_ayahuasca_experience_and/">I did ayahuasca in the Colombian Andes under a very old Ecuadorian shaman.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been rethinking that whole experience in the context of what I know now about ETs and looking back on my lifelong wonder about the Cosmos and the biodiversity throughout it...</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird crossroads to be at to be honest. There aren&#39;t a lot of people you can talk to after you&#39;ve experienced things like I have. I&#39;ve grown closer to the God Of My Understanding in the process, which has given me a new pair of glasses to see the world through. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 28 years young, I am working on some projects that I hope can help prepare the world for disclosure and also increase our chances of becoming an interplanetary species. There isn&#39;t anything else I&#39;d rather do with my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of us! Feel free to PM me. I love the direction you&#39;re going. Yes, we live in a world teeming with many higher intelligences. DMT is the easiest, but far from the only, way to access certain of them. There are good and bad forces, and probably some that aren&#39;t as easily labeled good or bad. Now is the moment in history to push this reality hard.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever going to get formal government alien disclosure. I think it has to come from the grassroots, educating people and spreading tools for people to have these types of experiences. I live in the mountains in Colorado, and an extraordinary number of people here have had alien encounters. It&#39;s really fascinating how widespread it is in certain areas. Nobody looks at me funny talking openly about this stuff out here, while back east where I&#39;m from it was a harder sell.</p>

<p>My ayahuasca and DMT experiences were so out of this world, I&#39;m now convinced that my Colombia experience was an interdimensional ET encounter. Did you read it? I don&#39;t think I could just imagine something like that, it was stuff I&#39;ve never seen, felt, or heard before. </p>

<p>Skinwalker Ranch was bought by billionaire Robert Bigelow who figured out something there because he got government funding after, special contracts for space projects as well. The place has a new owner now and is extremely hard to access, the road has been closed off even. </p>

<p>Not only have I had my own DMT breakthrough alien encounters, but I&#39;m passionately committed to breaking this story to the mainstream. People need to know, and the DMT/aya phenomenon is the best example of alien encounters we have, for many reasons, including that it&#39;s easy to replicate. I&#39;ve been collecting DMT stories and art for a while now, looking to eventually turn it into a web site. Sorry this is long, but check some of these out, below. The more clear stories we have by sane, rational people, the better we can make the case that this phenomenon needs to be seriously studied.</p>

<p>I got so much to look at over the next few days and nights. Jeez, not just this list but all the stuff other people have messaged me or commented here. </p>

<p>Let me know what you think of my experience, if there are any connections to anything else you&#39;ve seen or read. I&#39;m new to this train of thought still, trying to understand some parts of my experience still.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve known since I was a little kid that I have some &#39;mind powers&#39; that not everyone has. I&#39;ve never written about this anywhere or told anyone but after what I&#39;ve learned recently, I am not the only one and this has been described in ancient India as &#39;siddhis&#39;. You know anything about this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve heard the term siddhis. There are reports of this sort of mind travel all throughout history.</p>

<p>Your story is absolutely classic, my friend. People on ayahuasca, especially open-minded ones who are ready to see the truth, are often shown astounding things such as the origins of human creation. There&#39;s a very famous story about this in &quot;The Way of the Shaman&quot; by Michael Harner. There&#39;s an intelligence on the others side of the DMT/ayahuasca experience, and she/it seems to show you what you need to learn, what you&#39;re ready to see. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be curious to hear your thoughts after reading some of those stories. You&#39;re hardly alone; in fact, we&#39;re all interconnected at the level of DNA.</p>

<p>Man this is extremely fascinating. I feel like I have finally started to unravel a mystery that has eluded me for most of my adult life so far. I&#39;ve been trying to reconcile what the ancients described with objective reality (nature) and my life experiences. </p>

<p>How old are you? I&#39;m 28. </p>

<p>Yes, everything is connected at all levels. Maya (&#39;illusion&#39;) is the word in Sanskrit, all problems of the world originate with the idea of duality, political and religious dogma are perfect examples. All solutions for the world&#39;s problems originate in unity, science and technology are perfect examples. There are instances of scientific dogma and religious unity though, a total paradox I know but I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think, at the deepest level, the &quot;grand conspiracy&quot; is the conspiracy of the suppression of consciousness, and that every other conspiracy is simply an off-shoot of that, filtered down through different respective societal lenses and such. The conspiracy to hide the alien presence on earth is huge however, and almost on the same tier as suppression of consciousness, but yeah, imo I think consciousness is just a bit higher. I used to come here for the politics, then moved onto the more &quot;out there&quot; stuff (aliens, alternative history, paranormal etc), and now I mostly come here just to keep generally updated on the place and to comment.<br/>
What I personally use this place for nowadays and what I take from it is purely for self improvement on a soul level. I believe we humans need to work on discovering our true potentials as conscious entities, our true origins, the mechanics of consciousness, and love. I believe everything is the same universal consciousness at the core, just split into infinite things to experience being from an infinite number of relative perspectives. I believe that once we, as humans, come to realise that (or at least once enough of us do - a lá &quot;hundredth monkey effect&quot;/reaching critical mass point) then tyrannical power structures will simply dissolve as a natural result of that collective self realisation. And so that&#39;s the reality I&#39;m currently manifesting.  </p>

<p>I wrote a fat comment thread/essay on it in a round table discussion a couple months back, so here&#39;s the link to that. I do touch on aliens though (albeit briefly) in the last comment, and I include some links to documentaries, lectures, and interviews that I think are some great resources.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. The connection between the suppression of consciousness is central to the UFO phenomenon. For a long time, people have looked at this issue from a nuts and bolts angle instead of a higher dimensional one. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% with you, my only goal in life is self-realization. Everything else is secondary. I see and feel the unity of all things but have a hard time talking about it with anyone for long.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it is out of the question that they exist, we just need to figure out, if we can modify human perceptive abilities in some way to improve perception of these entitities.</p>

<p>Right now we have the situation, that these phenomenons appear under certain circumstances/settings/situations/environmental factors but 99+% of the time we do not perceive them.</p>

<p>That BAAS Bigelow study group research approach to look at the human body as a molecular benchmark system for residual effects of encounters with these phenomenons - while leaving out the consciousness/perception aspect - was a good idea I think.</p>

<p>I see everything under a control system and once in awhile, we find out something we are not supposed to know about. We&#39;re supposed to be distracted, divided, dismissive of anything &#39;out there&#39; under the guise of intellect. The only world history people know of is the one we are taught by schools and by media, there are missing pieces of the story when you lay it all out in front of you. </p>

<p>Also, by the time you get past the shock of seeing a UFO, getting your phone out of your pocket, frantically opening the camera app (maybe a few mistries as your fingers are shaking), then that UFO is long gone. Just try it, it may take up to 10 secs to get it out of your pocket and start video recording (I just tried it, it took 11 secs, incl. aiming the phone). So lets add another 3-4 secs for the shock and getting the idea of getting your camera out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>basically everything you mentioned is some kind of half truth.</p>

<p>First off There is basically zero evidence that Extraterrestrials have visited earth before the 1940s (which i will get into).</p>

<p>Also what makes you think that the Ancient People where dumb? I look at us and i see plenty of idiots. However we are still able to built Particle accelerators in the size of Cities, we have total mobilization, insanely advanced Computer technology and we even are getting into Quantum computing slowly but surely. Same with the ancient folks. They built the Pyramids, they where able to cure many diseases, they has professional agriculture and where abt astronomers and great mathematicians. They had language and law. I myself am currently living in a city that dates back 8000 Years of civilised history. Thats 6000BC for ya. </p>

<p>So, we did that all by ourselves as a collective force.</p>

<p>You take a walk through a city, see glass and steel see those giant LED panels and powerlines, mobile phone transmitters and such. Thats something we built. No one individual could ever recreate that. However as a collective we are capable of incredible things. So no, there is absolutely no evidence for an continuous alien presence for (except that one time in nurnberg in the 15th century) thousands of years.</p>

<p>Its quite likely that aliens noticed us in the 40s. As i posted  many times before due to our Fission experiments. They keep popping up now and then and seem to stay close to the oceans nowadays for obvious reasons. </p>

<p>The nazis didnt figure out the technology involved. The ones that got interrogated by the OSI where found to be kinda full of shit trying to get the same sweet deal as other more high profile Scientists. Reading the Interregotation transcript basically confirms that. Mumbling about technology that he may can reproduce, but if they dont do it fast...the russians gonna be there first. No nazis, sorry.</p>

<p>Does the US Gov know about this? Sure they do, but what good would disclosure do? Think about it. They properly know a little more then you or i. But not thaaaat much more. So you are confessing to a presence of a far more advanced that you cant really do something against and against which we would not stand a snowballs chance in hell given open warfare.</p>

<p>Other then that confirming the presence would instantly cause a armsrace to reverse engineer the technology. Countries would pump in Billions into those projects. Better organised and efficiant countries (china, for example) with far deeper pockets then the US would arguably come out on top in such a scenario. Which would put that country into an absolute dominant position. </p>

<p>To the nukes.</p>

<p>I think those incidents at the Silos where accidental and not intentional. The UFO was far away and due to EM radiation the Perimeter radar and guidance radar where on the fritz. That would disable a nuclear missile silo. Those radars are 60s tech though and could arguably just malfunctioned if someone suddenly opened a running microwave somewhere nearby.</p>

<p>Other then that nuclear warheads can be disabled by a strong neutron beam. By causing partial fission in the nuclear core. Something well within the capabilities of a race with Faster than light technology.</p>

<p>The intent of the UFOs seems to be Research for the most part. Its unclear if the UFOs are even manned. They could be drones or communication network satellites. </p>

<p>Not sure what is scarier. A vast government conspiracy, working with aliens for thousands of years that somehow never gets revealed. Or our governments being helpless, giving them space but know that even the mightiest nation is hopelessly outmatched.</p>

<p>Sure they may have come here, but they may hardly hgave recognised us as a intelligent species. That may justn been recon or simple research. would we recognise a species as intelligent if they havent harnessed fire yet?&gt; I dont think so. so while aliens may have visited fro,m time to time it wastnt really specia, we are nothing special given galactic scales.l</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found the interview with the grey alien interesting. (Smuggled out of Area 51 apparently). Especially as he apparently talked about how the soul goes on and wasn’t really interested in scientific stuff the scientists were asking. That kind of made some sense. But I do not think aliens, if they do exist, come from outer space. More likely inter dimensional, and it does just seem to be the Russians and Americans that get hold of them, during the Cold War, hmmmm. </p>

<p>Ancient civilisation almost certainly goes back a lot further than we know and it’s very likely a lot of technology has been lost over the years, that would be advanced for us today. And having seen that archaeologists get their grants severed if they come up with outlandish theories, such as laser cut stones (for which there is proof) and machine cut stones (again proof of those as well). We may never know.  But why would they hide it ? That bit is what I don’t really get </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite bit of ancient alien evidence comes from India&#39;s epic, the Mahabharata. There, a great warrior named Arjuna is asked to fight off space invaders called &quot;Nivata-Kavachas&quot;, which translates to &quot;those who wear air-tight skin suits,&quot; aka space suits. He goes into the heavens, along the path of the milky way, stopping at various worlds where the various gods are said to live. It&#39;s one of the few ancient documents that I can&#39;t explain any other way than ancient Indians believing in aliens. </p>

<p>They were malevolent ETs in my view. There are physical traces of a nuclear explosion in the Indus River Valley. You can&#39;t fake something like that, nor can you cover it up. Arjuna is also the main character of the Gita. We are the same, I think Ancient India has left the most clues all around. The Mediterranean had a lot of clues but many were destroyed or hidden, only the structures and some writings are left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll check them out today! I am a skeptic by default but something about the dots I&#39;ve been able to connect in the last week makes me feel like I have stumbled into what other believers have. I know there are a lot of crackpots and delusional people out there with a lot of misinformation but I know that just like 5% of the ufo encounters are legit, some % of all the leaked information is legit too at a gut level. </p>

<p>Never heard of Law of One but you won&#39;t believe this but what I just read in the first few pages is 100% congruent with what I&#39;ve believed for the last decade (I&#39;m 28). I&#39;ve had some strange otherworldly experiences myself but never talked about them out of fear of sounding crazy. Maybe there is an outreach group I can find. Also, the overarching ideas of One and the Wave are the SAME as what Vedanta (the peak of Vedic thought) teaches. Interesting parallel. I&#39;m going to digest all the material little by little and hopefully I&#39;ll remember to message you to discuss it!</p>

<p>I believe the key to space-travel and even time-travel is centered in consciousness, the physics of consciousness is tangible but our Earth-based physics is yet to reach this point. Maybe some unacknowledged groups in the US know about it like some of the leaked info suggests. Maybe everything the Egyptians, Greeks, Vedics described is true, not just the parts that we can understand in our current paradigm.</p>

<p>We are alike in this regard, I have been deep into this subject for awhile but I have a lot of cognitive dissonance in my life as I was sorting through my personal life. I have a much clearer sense of identity now and have revisited this topic with new eyes. I mainly gleam info from documentaries, interviews, podcasts, then I Google names/terms/organizations and connect dots. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest learning everything you can about Robert Bigelowe (the smoking gun...everything connects to him and he confirmed ETs in a 60 minutes interview a few months ago), Ben Rich, Jacques Vallee. Maybe Steven Greer is full of shit but I think Tom Delonge and his connections are legit. Everything he said about disclosure did come true because the NYT article that came out in December confirmed it. </p>
