       Why is being critical of Israel considered hatred? They're a country just like any other. It's not anti-semitic to criticize their foreign policy, and our Nations role in it.

       I'd be asking the same question if we constantly saw articles telling me the same things about South Sudan or any other country.  Just by the amount of anti-Israel posts here makes me feel that someone has an agenda and wants the people of /con to agree with them by bombarding them with propaganda.

       I think it's in part because we are supposed to believe that Israel isn't all the bad things some have come to believe of them. I don't disagree that someone may have an agenda, but fact remains when our "greatest ally" does things some would consider shady or downright rotten, and then proceeds to claim they are the most innocent thing since cherubs, people become more critical. We already know Sudan is rotten in places, but we have no illusion about that. Israel on the other hand is quite a different story.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, of course people will be critical of a nation that can, will, and has drug us to war if they aren't the most saintly of nations. Especially considering this "middle eastern fatigue" phenomena some Americans are claimed to have.

       IF you see truthful anti-Israel posts here - posts that expose Israel as a puppet regime and pariah in the region - yet not on the mainstream media. . . that's the real question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you have to come here to see the sins of Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "Why does everyone hate Israel", implied the world except the US and Israel does not vote against Israel and consider their actions inhumane and a form of genocide (human rights violations for 40+ years, on top of what is clearly a post-imperial invasion of European Jews (up until the 70's) for Geo-political control of the region).
      </p>
      <p>
       What's not to hate?
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'love' or even 'neutrality' of Israel in the US is inflated by the MSM. You're supposed to hate Israel if you fucking have a human soul. They are a nation of banker originated (Rothschild) ethno-conscripts, born into a constant state of war, and violate every progressive idea in the world, why the liberal league supports blanket immigration ONLY to get Jews into Israel for a possible one/two state solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plans are in fucking writing DUDE!  Everything but the bank statement for the supreme court building in Israel is FOIA, if not boasted about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ethno-national conscripts who think they are the 'chosen people' (this means a variety of things), following a religion of Talmudic oral tradition, in which SLAVES are promised when the messiah comes. Fuck that evil shit. The rest are born into the ethno-natioanl identity game, and are a majorty atheists. Lireally useful idiots to a 20th century invention of the 'ethnic-jew'; meanwhile, Israelis HARVEST beta-Israel organs and sterilize them, because they're black.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, why not look into organized crime and sex trafficking in Israel.  Mossad is more mafia than 'state'.

       Israel has never allowed IAEA inspectors into Israel to verify their nuclear weapons. They won't even openly acknowledge they have them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their attempts to hold other sovereign nations to a standard they actively skirt is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their treatment of immigrants, especially black immigrants is an abomination to human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their imposed apartheid state on the Palestinians is inhumane. Their non stop encroachment on Palestinian land with their UN condemned settlements is illegal.

      <p>
       Their killing of unarmed protesters at the border are war crimes.

       IAEA are not allowed to inspect nuclear weapons in Israel. Not only that, Just 5 days ago this story has Benjamin Netanyahu not revealing if they do or don't.

       Israel has forcibly sterilized black immigrants and actively pushed them out of their ethno-state.

       Israel demonizes Iran for developing any nuclear technology. Even peaceful technology that has been authorized by the UN and the USA... all the while denying IAEA access to their own nuclear facilities or weapons.

       Israel built themselves an Ethnostate that engages in imperialism, they annex the territory of neighboring countries that arent as well off as them through expansion of their borderwall.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been caught red handed intentionally killing unarmed Palestinian Civilians, and they chose to punish the whistleblowers severely.
      </p>
      <p>
       They advocate every other first world country flood themselves with dangerous migrants (Sweden let in 200k and became the rape capital of europe and gun murders rose 40%)
      </p>
      <p>
       They heavily advocate LGBT acceptance in the US but are extremely anti-LGBT in their own country.
      </p>
      <p>
       They operate shill companies such as JIDF which attempt to hide the truth and control online narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       They funnel endless billions from US taxpayers and provide almost nothing in return.

       How about this?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The pro-Israel lobby does most of its work without publicity. But every member of Congress and every would-be candidate for Congress comes to quickly understand a basic lesson. Money needed to run for office can come with great ease from supporters of Israel, provided that the candidate makes certain promises, in writing, to vote favorably on issues considered important to Israel. What drives much of congressional support for Israel is fear — fear that the pro-Israel lobby will either withhold campaign contributions or give money to one’s opponent.
In my own experience as a US senator in the 1970s, I saw how the lobby tries to humiliate or embarrass members who do not toe the line.

       Seems to me like Israel is being set up for a fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past five years or so criticism of Israel has gone from 'taboo' to 'edgy' to
       <em>
        almost mainstream
       </em>
       among 'conspiracy' or 'alternative' channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now mainstream mainstream people like Chomsky are getting in on the act.

       It's weird that every time I criticize them I get brigaded by people who insist it's racist or anti-Semitic.

       I don't particularly hate Israel either, but I do know from history that a radical political doctrine fueled by religion always leads to bad things. Almost like there would be less antisemitism in the world if they just stopped acting like giant dicks.

       So far right religious extremist are ok? You're supporting ISIS. You're supporting Mormonism and Talmudism that allows girls that have had a period to be married and fucked by 60 year old men. You need to have a psych evaluation. Fuck your religion. Keep it to yourself, but we expect you to act in a easy that all men are to act regardless of religion. Or is that bad?

       First off, I'm NOT even Jewish, and I didn't say I supported anyone I asked why your being hateful towards a group of people. And wtf are you talking about Mormonism? Your talking about practices that Arab countries do, are you aware of this? You literaly just made up a bunch of shit out of nowhere and it was kind of psychotic. I never said anything about my view on isreal, and asked about your hatred towards a group of humans, most of who have no say in what there goverment does.

       Yes all far right religious nuts... They beed to have their minds changed or be jailed and separated from society. If your beliefs say you can have sex with a girl after puberty, you need yo be temoved from society. If you can kill bc of your religion, you need to be separated. Do you wanna live next to a rapist?

       I've never known a Jew who thought underage sex was ok, ever. So your making shit up. Also muslims actually do believe this is ok (using them as an example), and has historically practiced this...genocide? They are responsible for the most murders of any group...so where are your rampage coments about them? You care about these issues right? Where is all of your rage for them then?

       Your bias is obvious. I was in Israel for 3 months. While most people don't see that as ok, there religious zealots thought It was ok. She isn't underage if she bleeds. They said if a man rapes her, he must pay her father since her marriage value goes down... That's the problem with religious extremist, while we are a girl must be 18 to 20 to consent, religious nuts think 12 13 is legal age. Killing Jews and slavery were once legal. Is that a moral arrow? Fuck Talmudism.

       <p>
        For extorting from me and my fellow Americans $4,000,000,000.00 a year for the last 4 decades, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For taking our most sophisticated weapons technology and stealing it for yourself without paying the American patent holders, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For taking that high-tech military technology and selling it to our enemies, such as the Russians and Chinese, thus further endangering us, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using that weaponry in a sustained attack against a United States ship, the USS Liberty, in an attempt to sink her, thus preventing US servicemen from revealing to the rest of the world information concerning the war crimes they witnessed you commit against Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Desert during the Six Day War, as well as for the purposes of dragging the US into yet another one of your murderous adventures, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For killing 35 and wounding 170 American sailors aboard the USS Liberty, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For bribing the United States government into covering it up, preventing any justice from being done for the benefit of the families of the lost sailors – as well as the American People, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For sending your agents into Egypt and blowing up American buildings for the purpose of blaming the Arabs in an event known as the Lavon Affair, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For sending your agents into Libya during the Reagan administration, and broadcasting radio messages in Arabic that were designed to sound like “terrorist cell planning” so that the US would initiate military strikes against Khadafi in an event known as Operation Trojan Horse, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For withholding information from us concerning the planned attacks against the US Marine barracks in Lebanon, attacks you knew about through your moles in the Islamic world and about which you deliberately refused to warn us in order to further your interests against the Arabs, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For employing Jonathon Pollard, an American serviceman paid to spy for Israel in order to steal even more of our National Security secrets for your parasitic purposes, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For breaking every agreement you have made with your Arab neighbors, stealing their land, displacing, murdering, and treating them like the animals you see them as, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using your agents within the first Bush administration to involve us in the first Gulf War, causing the deaths of American men and women, and exposing our servicemen to whatever bio-weapons were and are responsible which have led to Gulf War Syndrome, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For your role in the September 11 attacks in this country, and for blackmailing and bribing the US government into deporting back to Israel the 100 or more intelligence agents that were arrested after the attacks, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For suppressing the information from the American people of your involvement in the September 11 attacks and sending us in the wrong direction in search of answers, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using one of your agents in the US Army Weapons Lab to steal anthrax and distribute it into our mail system, terrorizing US citizens and killing several in order to blame the Arabs, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using your agents in the US Government, namely, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle, Abrams, and the rest into initiating this war in the Middle East so that you could bring to heel all the enemies you have made during the last 50 years, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using your agents in the media to lie to us on a minute by minute basis about the war, lying to us as to how “just” this cause is, and what the real reasons behind it are, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using your agents in the Christian Evangelical community, such as Falwell, Graham, Swaggert, Robertson and the rest who praise you as God’s chosen people and further keep Americans in the dark about who you really are what you have done, and what you are truly about, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For bringing idiots like Limbaugh, Liddy, Hannity, Beck, O’Reilly and Savage to the forefront as paid liars who will support you and further lead Americans astray, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For making America your attack dog, and for sending her sons and daughters to fight and die in all your future wars, we bless thee. For using your influence in the media to hide the real statistics about the war, the dead and wounded on both sides, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        For using us in such a way that not only further inflames the Arab world against us, but as well has succeeded in our alienating ourselves against those nations with whom we have been friendly for over a century, we bless thee.
       </p>
       <p>
        And finally, for using your influence in our media and academia to flood our minds with pornography and lies, as well as inculcating in us a hatred for our history, religion, and culture, for dividing our nation between races and sexes, and for releasing into our society all of your plagues and filth that have left us a rotted out corpse of a once great nation, oh Israel, our friend,

       As an atheist, the religious prophetic importance of the "Gathering of the Exiles"is voided, therefore several layers of biblical justification are removed.

       Israel was created and stocked with Hebrews by Roman Britain for the purpose of creating a patsy, mainly for Americans to believe that their gov't has become corrupt under the influence of, and is in collusion with, Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       This stems from the engineered false belief that the USA was ever independent. The USA had to believe that, as it was pre-destined to grow to epic proportions and perceived power, and it wouldn't do to have its populace calling for rebellion against its off-shore governance - so it was faked that it had happened already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesuits use their global "refugee services" to ship people into countries that are culturally alien, while affording them all kinds of state subsidies that the nationals won't get when they fall victim to engineered strife and poverty. This in order to create division and civil upheaval, which result in public call for greater socialist governance, rules and military-styled policing - and even fascist dictators they've trained and are waiting in the wings; as was the most obvious case with Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       They repeat this pattern on any nation that exhibits notions of causing slight trouble within their globally-managed system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebrews are a thorn in the side because they maintain strong family links (and that cannot be allowed) and support their own internal networks of businesses by feeding their own spoils back into these enterprises: a self-supportive growing independent rival network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although socialist of its own nature (as are all organised Vatican religions - which is how Muslims are also ab/used and controlled) it could become an independent threat vying for the same control as already held.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Palestinian game is maintained between perceived sides for part purpose in instilling hatred among viewers on the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fake "Iron Dome" fireworks display is to create perception among those living in Israel that they are constantly under attack. It's basic trauma-based mind control; employing falsely-sounded klaxons that have everyone running for cover out of the blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no rocket attacks upon Israel, though if that's exposed "Jooos" will receive blame for conspiring to invent the hoax situation themselves - in the same manner that they were blamed for the Jesuit "protocols of Zion" and the falsification of 6 million gas-chamber "Jooos" (they were furnaces, and everyone against the Catholics got it - including Catholics who'd served their purpose and knew too much) - which was used to create victims of them, so they could be moved to other places, including Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iron Dome fraud creates a suppressed inner hatred for their perceived assailants among those living there. As a result, they do not mind military conscription and beating on Palestinians/Muslims outside, thus giving seemingly-genuine "news" reporting a chance to show this abuse in media while sporting excuses for their actions along the official narrative lines of "well.. they ARE always under attack", while the controlled-opposition always uncovers that "they're in control of the media and they're engineering all these false claims of persecution themselves".
      </p>
      <p>
       You see what level this is operating on now? It's not a surface level.
      </p>
      <p>
       All presidents of Israel are masonic knights. They do not work in the interest of regular Hebrew people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't support organised religion as that part of it ties them all to the Vatican and they always flounder and fail. Some church Christians are the best conspiracy researchers out there, but they always screw up when they begin to give over responsibility to ever-on-the-horizon external saviours and crazy literal interpretations of scripture. Basically, they're still putty in the palms of the ruling priesthood and are still doomed to failure.

       I think like most criticisms of countries, the issues have little to citzens, but rather those in power.  I think Americans have a hard time making this distinction because they are condition to hate entire nations, thus making it easier to let the US government to kill them.
