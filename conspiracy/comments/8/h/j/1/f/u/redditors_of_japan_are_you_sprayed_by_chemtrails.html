    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is. You can ask 100 people here about it and 90 will say it&#39;s happening. We are a very small country, not even 1 million citizens. So, it&#39;s easier for information to travel from mouth to mouth. There is a British army base here, and specifically in my home town, and it&#39;s sort of like common fact that they spray the clouds/produce chemtrails. It&#39;s almost like a fact to us that the British can manipulate our weather here. And it amazes me to see so many people in America believe that it&#39;s just a silly conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture of my country being completely covered in chemtrails:</p>

<p><a href="http://famagusta-gazette.com/clients/famagusta-gazette/2-18-2016-7-43-47-AM-6671807.jpg">http://famagusta-gazette.com/clients/famagusta-gazette/2-18-2016-7-43-47-AM-6671807.jpg</a></p>

<p>The people here tried to push for an investigation a few years back but of course, no results came back. So, it&#39;s like an inside joke. We know it&#39;s happening but we also know the &#39;high ups&#39; ain&#39;t gonna let any information about it or &#39;prove&#39; that it&#39;s indeed happening.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is fascinating to me.  Thanks for replying.
So there&#39;s a feeling in Cyprus of: Yes we know it&#39;s happening but there&#39;s not a thing we can do to change it.</p>

<p>Is the British airforce ever compelled to respond to these claims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, it&#39;s always swept under the rug. Here&#39;s an article from 2 years ago, when people tried to push for an investigation. </p>

<p><a href="http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/02/17/minister-pledges-probe-into-chemtrails/">http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/02/17/minister-pledges-probe-into-chemtrails/</a></p>

<p>But of course nothing was ever done after that. </p>

<p>The thing with Cyprus is that we&#39;re such a small island and such a close community that most people know most people. I know many people who work in the British army base and they will never claim this to be false. of course, there&#39;s no factual evidence, as in scientific papers or whatever it takes, but it&#39;s common knowledge. Especially with how they can manipulate the weather here and specifically the clouds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha. I can actually tell you alot about this. My friend who I&#39;ve always generally ranted to went to Japan and stayed at a homestay. He said the woman who ran the homestay with her daughter ranted about chemtrails non stop. Always showing him pictures of trails, taking photos outside, and pinning them to their fridge. So yes, Japan ppl are just as concerned as we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Japan has the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-highest-rates-of-autism.html">highest rate of autism</a> of all countries. Since learning about the imaging of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763">high concentrations of aluminum in autistic brains</a>, I&#39;ve been on a hunt for all sources of aluminum. Yes, they are aluminum adjuvants in vaccines but I had trouble accounting for the geographical clustering of autism in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/autism-clusters-californiahighly-educated-parents/">California</a> and <a href="http://nj1015.com/why-new-jersey-has-the-highest-rates-of-autism-in-the-country/">New Jersey</a> until I looked at reports of chemtrail sightings. Opened up skywatchmap.org and what do you know? giant chemtrail clusters right over New Jersey and California. Youtube is full of insiders stepping up to confirm aluminum as one of the chief chemicals being used. The fact that Japan is reporting sightings and experience a surge in autism corroborates with my research. This is so messed up. </p>

Nothing needs to fly over SA because it is not on the route from anywhere to anywhere else. And aircraft are always 20 miles or so from their departure airport before they reach contrail height.
