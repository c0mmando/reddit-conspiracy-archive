       Hello everyone, and thanks for viewing my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problems stemming from a media empire have been known for quite a while. Despite what people say about Trump, Clinton, mainstream narratives the "conspiracy theorist" know this to be a show. The power of repetition in mind control cannot be undermined and year after year, cycle after cycle, it's the saaaaaaame old shit. Nothing ever seems to change... In light of all the tragedies occurring in the world, the corruption, the mass murdering of the innocent, the theft, the lies, people are starting to become more aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       Computers and the internet have allowed the massive tumor to grow almost uncontrollably. With such speed government, military, and enterprise were able to throw a net around the entire populace. A populace that could be graded, tracked, sold to and organized. Technology has certainly allowed the machine to run more efficiently for the operators, but what about the people? When Marshall McLuhan was putting together his four laws of media, he identified one law as the reverse effect. What happens when a medium is pushed to its limits? The reverse is essentially the "flip" that every medium tends to undergo. The truth is media needs to be flipped. The old world of centralized top down media is clearly finished. Internet media is on a sharp rise the past few years and it WILL replace cable soon enough. Already content creators are switching to Platforms like Youtube and Vimeo. The platform being different from the network because it is a system the supports to underlying users and content. Within the platform the users can upload a large variety of videos or consume a large variety. The choice it theirs. While a platform is a way better option, is it fair to say Google (an extension of the Military Industrial Complex) is likely to be fair with this technology? Of course not...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who frequents truth/conspiracy categories on YouTube is already well aware of the abuse. Consistently top conspiracy theorist have their altered, subscriptions hidden, accounts closed/suspended, demonetized, etc. While this may seem like a small deal right now, look ahead 3 years. A company like Google is well on their way to controlling this market, do you really think they're really going to be fair about this in the future? It's not just that...Google is making an absolute killing! They have one of the highest profit-margins in business and get to be extremely picky with their partners. The power that be know that TV is moving to the internet, and they've been preparing the switch for quite a while. We can even see that Youtubers can even subscribe to cable packages through Youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, my point behind this wasn't to bring attention to issues you're already aware of. The point of the post is because I KNOW there are a lot of smart, passionate, and skilled individuals floating around on the sub (prolly a lot of shills too). We're seeking additional members for this project and I'd personally love if most of them were aware of what was going on in the world and wanted to change it. The second part is...We're making a non-profit corporation. While we will be able to charge for services, subscription this will only be to run the platform, not to make a profit.  Even day-one founders won't have any value in their equity. Given these circumstances, there is no opportunity in getting rich. A good paying job yes, but not your normal startup jackpot potentiality. In my humble opinion it's cap tables that reward the largest shareholders which is ruining the world. Under the non-profit structure we have the ability to undercut giants like Google.
      </p>
      <p>
       **What about the project?** - The platform we're building is essentially a cross between Youtube &amp; Medium. Users can create a profile, sub accounts, anonymous accounts, and get their accounts verified. Users can watch, subscribe and purchase content from Creators. Creators have the ability to create their own channels, in addition to Networks which can be managed/contributed to by multiple individuals. Creators can setup monetize with ads, subscriptions, paid and donations. The platform is derived of an upvote/downvote system that expands out to highlight more distinct voting criteria (funny, smart, shocking, etc). I could expand much further, but my last point to make is we also have a solution for the "fake news problem". Instead of attacking the content itself, why not attack the actual vote manipulation? The bots, the vote brigades, the manipulators? We've devised a way to achieve this through supervised learning algorithms. We even have ways to fight future GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) train bots that have yet to surface fully. Needless to say we have a lot of improvements for today's media, social media, and bot detection.
      </p>
      <p>
       **What about the team? Are you even qualified?**
      </p>
      <p>
       As for myself my background was original in Growth Marketing. The blackhat marketing was what lead me to become a conspiracy theorist in the first place. I've worked for 3 years with startup and also have about of year of experience in Blockchain and ICOs. Also have a year of A.I. research experience in addition to filling some advisory roles. As for the others...we've yet to set the concrete team with this project we have about 5 that have contributed to the project thus far all of which have exceedingly good backgrounds. I've also chatted with over 20 industry experts about the project, but like I said. The bigger focus is on individuals who truly understand what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       **So..what do you need? How can I help?**
      </p>
      <p>
       As a general rule of thumb we're looking for individuals who **A)** Know what's going on and **B)** have a relevant skill or attribute to the core project. I'm investing my own money in the project and while we are technically "hiring" we're really only doing so for the roles we **Must** fill. With that being said we're seeking skilled... UI/UX Architects, Developers, Data Scientist/ML Devs, Growth/Marketing/PR Experts, Legal, Designers, Video Editors, Business Developers and potential others. If you're interested feel free to reach out to me via a PM and I'll get back to you quickly. I can pass along more info/designs + set up a following conversation on slack/skype/phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       **I'm interested in helping, but don't fill one of those roles/don't have time.**
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a problem, feel free to reach out anyway. We will be building a core community around the idea and will have a slack setup for users to chat with the team, make suggestions, get updates, etc. We're not simply trying to run a nonprofit, we're seeking to make a better platform for media than exists today and transparency is a huge part of it. We need community involvement and users keep check &amp; balances on team plans/development.
      </p>
      <p>
       **Conclusion**
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to spam out site details or try to astroturf the sub. I'm simply tired of the media issue and know others are as well. A dedicated group effort that seeks to accomplish this without economic incentives are the businesses of the future? Does anyone realize how much human energy/resources/time is waged on businesses just fighting it out on their shilly merchandise? This continues till the product either becomes obsolete or a necessity to which then it oligarpolized among a few. Imagine if your media platform wasn't taking 100&amp;#37; of the profits....imagine what type of money, entertainment, or potentials that waste could be funneled into. I firmly believe we can built a better platform and already have some of the talent to do it. Feel free to reach out if you think you can contribute to the cause. Either way, the problems we're seeing today WILL NOT be solved at the highest levels.

       Agreed, we're trying to role this out in less than 6 months. Hopefully achieve video side sooner than that. In terms of presence, I can't think of a better time. Blockchain/Crypto have already shaken the mainstream up a bit. I think we stand a good chance, but who knows. Worth a shot! Thanks man!

       No, sorry for not being clear. The algorithms are used to detect voting patterns of users. This is an excellent way to detect bots, bot nets are not perfect in judging by the actions, time of actions, frequency, we can mine the patterns necessary to better predict whether a user is botting or contributing to vote manipulation. At a certain threshold we'll allow for mod intervention.

       Feel free to go to blackhatworld.com a check out just how easy/cheap it is to buy likes, retweets, youtube views, likes, etc. For almost anything. This is a huge problem in terms of astroturfing, fake news, brigading, etc.

       To this point LinkedIn is the only one I know who has a system like this already implemented in terms of the giants. Facebook, Reddit, and Youtube certainly don't.

       Sounds like a great idea, man. I really respect you're plans to make it a non-profit, because it means you and the other devs will care about the mission more than the profit and product.

       I'm a programmer myself, and would be interested in contributing if its FLOSS. If it's not, I'd still be willing to help in other ways that I can. I've modded this sub for over a year now, and understand at least some aspects of what does and doesn't work for certain goals.

       That's great and thanks for reaching out. In terms of FLOSS, I'd say as far as the software goes we haven't gotten there yet. There are some drawbacks even being a nonprofit, but it could honestly go either way. Would love to follow up with a PM and discuss this further.

       I know this is going to sound crazy, but I guarantee that cable companies would love to have a service like youtube that competes against youtube and is owned by cable companies.  You could come up with some sort of license deal for funding.

       Please - and I think a part of you knows this if you're posting on this sub - but know that being so open to the public means that at some point if you show that you mean business - and the poers that be catch wind - your project WILL be infiltrated and sabotaged. It's not a matter of "if".

       I have been to sites that are made to get around MSM censorship. I love the idea, but in practice, all of those sites are brimming with reactionaries. What is your plan to prevent the site from being entirely one sided and how do you plan to bring a better cross section of people in?

       Agreed with that completely. First I'd like to say I'm not a political person, but I'm very much a "conspiracy theorist", I believe there's a lot of truth to the ones I subscribe to. With that being said, politics, conspiracy, etc if filled with so much garbage. Why is this? Well... they're highly volatile areas with a lot of stake. Commonly manipulated by higher ups etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we don't plan to focus on any of this material. We're merely a platform our job is to make sure what is being posted is not being technically manipulated, to make sure delivery is good, to provide a wide range of features that improve social, media, basic functionality, etc. In addition to that we're here to make things fair, but by using an assortment of methods in a transparent fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key is to provide areas for people to congregate. User generated areas that are free from mod corruption. Being a mod is a thankless job, but if we allowed communities to take a % of the advertising revenue for transperent mods all of these sudden it becomes a real job of real importance. This is the real shift we're witnessing today, because our online mediums are THIS important. Mods of a large subreddit DO carry a lot of weight in the amount of people they effect. We need to allow people to make money off these areas like jobs, but in exchange the enter a new domain of public service. That comes with transparency, talking with the community, explaining yourself, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seemed to have babbled on but could say a lot more. The point is mode content/channels/networks will be tagged by creators. This allow people to target there content a bit more. In addition to this, comment sections can be tagged as well to look for specific content if you're researching (similar to amazon).

       The time is now and needed for the alternative to youtube...while YT continues to sink into the darkness, this new platform could be getting started and gaining strength while YT has no hope of being something cool ever again.

      <p>
       Freedom of speech is becoming more difficult for people to grasp...the trigger mentality is getting unbearable as people seem to get offended at the slightest notion if something doesn't fit neatly into their perspective...and the call for censorship rears it's ugly head no matter what you try to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck. I  sincerely hope it takes off. I will join as soon as I am able. The world desperately needs a place where truth can be spoken...no matter how difficult it is to deal with.

        ...We also have a solution for the "fake news problem". Instead of attacking the content itself, why not attack the actual vote manipulation? The bots, the vote brigades, the manipulators? We've devised a way to achieve this through supervised learning algorithms. We even have ways to fight future GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) train bots that have yet to surface fully.

       Now that Internet Reputation Management has become an industry, I highly doubt that you will be able to effectively combat their operations. Maybe for a few weeks/months until they've figured out your oh so glorious system. After that it's back to normal.

       This always does come into play with certain systems, but in terms of bots. 80% are probably low quality. They might be connected into an API that spams actions, few are actually build upon the GUI. This alone would be a big step to detecting bots, yet for some reason the biggest companies do not do this. In terms of tracking bots/manipulation a GAN trained bot would be way way ahead of anything we've seen that's state of the art. Even looking that far into the future we can easily defend against this by using an assortments of similarly trained bots against out own network in a supervised capacity. This is the point where you have bots training bots, but I digress. This is not even enough. We create human supervised layers as well in the form of mods, users, reports etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       To go a bit further we start referencing common voting patterns over a period of time. Add to this a hidden reputation threshold based on attributed like age, reports, etc and we're well on our way to figuring out this puzzle. Not saying it would be impossible to be, but it's highly unlikely when you add so many points of perspective with large amount of data to cross reference. These are only 4 or so prongs, imagine an 8 pronged approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Botting and Vote manipulation are at the highest levels I've ever seen. It's basically a given at any high end marketing agency these day. Don't expect it to last. Users will get smarter and smarter like they are now.

       Hmm, you actually make an excellent point. I think we'd actually have to do S-corp for certain aspects, but this is certainly something we should bring up with a lawyer. I do believe you're right and that could have been termoil for the git-go =P. See this is why I'm crowsourcing the project. Thank you sir, good eye!

       We'd not use a protocol like Bitchute. Bitchute is good for what it's supposed to do. Allows users to upload anything and guaranteed that it won't be taken down without the whole network collapsing. This could be very valuable in a lot of cases, but not for a mainstream network. Imagine a ton of terrorist or pedo-friendly videos you could never take down. Even with the filter system this is going to cause problems in a mainstream setting.

       I've been thinking about this for a while now. But to me the problem resides in the bandwidth costs. How do you expect to be able to stay up without sinking insane amount of dough? I've checked p2p things like zeronet and a few others similar to that and they all seem to be lacking functionality and require users to install stuff which 99% of mainstream users won't do so it's bad for critical mass. Also with P2P you risk losing data in the network if users go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess sia-style/p2p/blockchain thing where users are credited for sharing bandwidth? Then the problem becomes making sure illegal shit doesn't get on the users PC's. It will happen, either by bad people or people that want to shut us down. I'd like to help, I've been thinking about this for years but I don't see a technical viable solution for now. Do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also regarding blocking bots, this will be a huge issue of vote manipulation and you'll be accused of things, will you make your tech to detect this public so that people know exactly how the filtering is happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I prefer no voting. Back to the usenet, with today's search engine abilities. Let people argue instead of press arrows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think also regarding
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and in general with data, it would be nice to have crowdsourcing tools for data mining when we have large dumps of data coming our way like with dcleaks/dnc. To organize, flag in the documents, link pages or sentences to outside sources for better picture, a timeline like you can see on
       <a href="http://ukraine.csis.org">
        http://ukraine.csis.org
       </a>
       is good stuff too. Any plans for that sort of thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically it will need to draw people in, and to do that you give them something to do and you'll have a core base of people that will be coming regularly. It's easy after that to see who's actually invested in this vs people there to derail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, quite exciting to see you already have a bunch of people on this. Let me know if I can be of help, I'd like to. I'm not technical but do product design from functionality to interface and can dabble with blockchain and have some very strong AI ressource I could convince if this is serious.

       Youtube is part of the corporate conglomorate..... I saw this coming when google removed the definition of fascism from their automatic search results. Before it had the proper definition relating to corporate controlled gov. Now it is something something nazi like fascism, and noention of corporate controlled gov.

       We need a safe space so to speak, to rally, discuss and share information so that we can organize, then act offline if neccessary. It is impossible to rally and organize offline now, we saw that we occupy protests that got shut down. Big fiance sees the internet as its last obstacle, hence net netrality being under attack. If it falls even a startup like what we are proposing could be throttled. Short of a blockchain net, the internet is our last hope at the moment. We must rally without successful intervention.

       I've been thinking about an idea like this for quite some time. I had never really considered the non-profit route, and had always imagined instead more of a decentralized social network. Feel free to PM me if you'd like to discuss my vision in that regard.

       Its about time someone stepped up. Your heart is in the right place too, there is actually a high chance this can work IF everything goes to plan. 
As someone who has considered creating conspiracy content for YouTube, but is nervous about the sinking ship that it is, i am glad to see that people are willing to create a better space. 
I can't offer any practical skill, but you have my support. If there is a slack for updates i would like to be added, im excited to see where this project will go

       I'm curious about any such project. So here's a couple of questions that you should answer yourselves, before you get into it and lose all your money for naught:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) What's the business model? - you either have to be self sustainable through donations (not reliable), through subscriptions or through sponsorships of some kind. Non-profit is great, but if you're just bleeding money and don't have some other commercial venture that yields you enough money to cover for such expenses, you're doomed to fail eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) How do you plan on reaching the critical mass of userbase needed for such a project to work? – Google+ failed miserably due to not having enough people on the network to keep it going. There are other linked concerns:
      </p>
      <p>
       2.1) Longevity of the platform (tied to financial stability) - large content creators won't come to you unless they see that you're a viable option for long-term monetisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.2) Options to make money for content creators (Will refer to CC further) - since you're creating an alternative to youtube, you've got to offer CCs something that youtube doesn't. But most of all, you've got offer everything that Youtube
       <strong>
        DOES
       </strong>
       (Reach, finance, stability etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       2.3) Ensure you've got proper policies in place to stop any kind of internal cancer that seemed to have captured Youtube. So takeover of the service is a threat, have to have multiple decision makers that can overrule a potential bad decision. There have to be certain commitments akin to constitution that will never be broken under any circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) You have to be able to comply with laws about distributing illegal content (child porn, ISIS vids and copyrighted material). Any plans on how to balance that while remaining loyal to your fanbase and your core principles?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an investment analyst and look at this project from financial side. It's the most important one to balance out so that it doesn't impact your core mission in a negative way (running out of money vs turning into a profit machine)

       It is almost impossible to set up competition to youtube since it is run by intelligence agencies. You need to be willing to sponsor the project with hundreds of grands of bandwidth costs per year to make it even exist, and even then the chance to become popular is astonishingly small.
      </p>

       Only P2P based solutions can work because as long as there is someone paying the bills then there is someone to easily compromise.

       I've been around DLT/Blockchain for well over a year. Truth is the technology is very early stage and is entirely dependent upon the usecase. Most blockchain/DLT solutions I've seen to this point are totally missing the boat. There is some great stuff out there like IPFS, but at the same time ALL of it's early stage. All of that big rollouts from this type of technology are going to come from those with a very high cap.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the tech will be there in 5 years, it simply isn't there now. The idea of a nonprofit is complete seperate of the p2p option however. The point is to centralize certain costs so that you can scale the network, pricing, marketing, etc across the board. We're allow to charge for our services founders just don't make any money. This is the same idea that every tech giant is running upon, including Youtube except they have to turn a profit and they do very easily. The bandwidth costs are really a myth at scale. Yes you have tons of bandwidth but you're also monetizing the platform with millions/billions of users.

       See, you simply are not only competing with a company that makes profit. In fact, does youtube even make porofit? For the longest time they ran on loss, so it is a sponsored venture with no real need to make money, their mission is to corner the video streaming market and then exert influence, and they are executing it perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a page would get the tech-fancy people first, and they tend to have adblockers = no monetization.

      <p>
       But what about racist content? Or antisemitic content?

       I'm woke enough to judge everyone on an individual basis. I recognize their are a fair amount of Jews, just like Christians, Catholics, and Atheist who are playing a role in the NWO agenda. I've know about the centralization of the media, the jews, the vatican, etc.

       Despite all this, I think it's better to go after the specifics than an entire religion. It's something that should be looked into at the highest levels, but I don't believe the team of power hitters serve any one religion or group outside of themselves and eternal life.

       Sounds like the kind of project that will be much needed, going forward, as I too expect the censorship of any and all social media to increase many fold in the  coming few years.

       I think you should advertise your effort also to alternative left subs, such as Way of the Bern, Kossacks for Sanders, etc. For myself, I can't speak for any right leaning alternative news sites, but I can see making a case to them as well.

       Personally, I am far less fearful of astroturfing than of outright censorship that hides content, however that's done. I prefer to be the arbiter of content rather than some faceless suspect entity doing the judging for me.

       Also, could you comment on the differentiation from DTube?
