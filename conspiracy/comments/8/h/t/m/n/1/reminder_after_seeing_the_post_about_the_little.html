       Still have yet to see any proof of climate change not being a natural phenomenon. Everything being said has constantly changed. First we were gonna freeze then burn now its just changing even though we know the climate has constantly changed on Earth.

       Have you been to no parts of the planet destroyed by pollution or deforestation? All it takes is travelling to see what's been destroyed to know something isn't right. The natives have seen the changes decades ago because they live off the land, you do too but obviously you are so separated from it you dont realize the effects.

       Deforestation and pollution have nothing to do with climate change. I live in the mississippi river delta. I see the changes that happen to our planet. I see all the plants dying cause Monsanto’s Dicamba drifts to wherever it fucking wants. I see the color of the sky as a grey instead of the bright blue it once was. What I dont see is a lack of water or it getting hotter or any species native to here dying out. I see species from outside sources flourishing. What I do see is a government constantly lying to us and any scientist that gets taken seriously being paid for fake tests. I see models that are so far off that they look like a grade schooler made them. I see any alternative theory to the current proven false be swept under a rug just like any technology that would help our planet. Climate Change is propaganda to force all countries under 1 banner. The same people pushing for this are the same ones that constantly lie to us about everything. Why should we believe their proof that is about as real as the proof that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction or that Syria is chemically attacking its citizens?

       So is 40&amp;#37; of the amazon not gone due to cattle ranching? Is animal agriculture not the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases? Climate change is real. The cause is being hijacked, thats what you are making the connection that we are being lied to. Because you really .

       I saw a post about this on facebook so i went and googled "what happened to _____?" And just punched in next ice age, global warming, and climate change and found out it's about the timescale and honing in on more precise details that allow for better models. The Next Ice Age from the 70s was looking out 1-2 thousand years. And it is coming. That is your long-term trend. In the meantime, scientists found a global heating trend that correlated quite heavily with the release of noxious fumes from all these new fangled factories. The planet will get hotter, sea levels will rise and the ice caps will melt in the next 100-500 years til our shores as we know them do not exist. And the result of that trend is climate change. Weather patterns that get more and more erratic as time goes on. I think most of the confusion comes from not talking about these things in relation to each other.

       At multiple points all the land you are talking about were underwater. Currently there are ruins underwater. The only thing we know for certain is that Earth’s climate changes. We have identifiable proof this happens. What we don’t have proof of is that it is manmade. We know it changed before man and we know it changes after man. Everything the mainstream scientists say is a theory. Every theory has been proven wrong by a lot. They have not been close. Its pike the same scientist paid by Monsanto that say Dicamba isnt volatile and doesnt drift on its own, but every scientist not paid by them says it does. The people paying these scientists are the same ones lying to us about the Syrian gas attacks, about different countries have weapons of mass destruction, and many other things. When I was in High School I did a report on an alternative theory on what was still ‘Global Warming’ at the time. The theory was published in a scientific journal and had charts and graphs that matched up with the Earth’s climate change during the past. It was a theory on Electron Clouds and Solar Rays. One that if you try looking up now you dont get the full theory or even find that publication I referenced in my report. Its all terrible made sites that make it look bogus. So why do they keep pushing these theories of doom and gloom that dont hold up and all other theories just disappear? Its simple. They’re trying to use this to create a single world government so that they can control everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The natural history of our planet is that the ice caps melt, that the sea rises, that it gets colder, the sea freezes, the glaciers carve up the land, and that they then melt again. Thats nature. I’m not arguing that deforestation isnt bad. I’m not arguing pollution doesnt exist and doesnt affect us. I’m arguing that they are lying to us about the nature of our planet in order to control us.

       Not sure what to say about your pesticide problem. Monsanto is evil. But you know even the oil companies have been researching this and keeping it quite for the past 40 years, right? You know they've been using the same PR and legal team as the tobacco industry did to keep shit under wraps about smoking? You want to talk about TPTB wanting to control us? Why don't you look at the guys who've profited from pushing our planet over an existential cliff so they can squeeze a few more dollars out the oil barrel why they muddy the waters with all their hand-wringing "oh it's just a theory" bullcrap? It just shows that people don't understand the difference between normal people theories and scientific theories. You want to talk about control? Who's going to be in control when most of our land is uninhabitable? Only the people who can afford to prepare. And They have already done a pretty good job making sure most of us can't prepare in any meaningful way. Is it easier to control a planet of 7+ billion people IF we somehow manage to pull in the reigns on this runaway greenhouse effect? Or is it perhaps easier to control the millions that might survive after droughts cause a collapse of global agriculture markets? You fail to realize the enormity of our influence on the planet. And all this to what end? You think that the elites are going to control us with solar panels and sustainable farming practices? But at the end of the day, if you can't/won't accept the vast majority of research on this topic, I'm not sure what could be done to convince you.

       Human harvesting of meat has more of an effect on the climate than the sun or the moon? This is a fantasy scenario for people who seek vengeance for the animals that are slaughtered and devoured. This represents the jealous archetype that is Cain.

So selective breeding of certain cows by humans for their valued genetic traits, then over breeding those cows way past what would be possible under natural conditions, then using human made industry to cut down huge portions of naturally occurring and essential forests to provide pasture for said cows, only to then load them up with anti-biotics and growth hormones to keep them alive long enough to grow to monstrous proportions to be served on mass in heavily processed foods using chemicals never before found in our food chain is your idea of Natural?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets not even talk about how the waste from this industry that is draining water tables all over the planet and polluting natural water reserves and the ocean itself... Natural, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The planet itself is truely a magical system that requires very careful balancing to maintain conditions that are favourable, if not essential to our survival, to disregard this need for balance, sustainability and compassion is why we are all headed towards a hellish future if we do not correct our course very very soon. The planet is warming, ice sheets are melting, extreme weather is getting more common and more extreme, desertification is happening in a lot of regions where it hadn't before, chronic illness is rampant, autism is on the rise, our food and water supply is more polluted than its ever been before.

       This situation is akin to being onboard the titanic and seeing the iceberg, trying to warn people only to be met with arrogant quips like "do you have anything interesting to say?" when typically, and i can almost say definitely in your situation there is no actual research done, but an ardent and aggressive need to defend a delusional reality in the face of just being humble and accepting you dont fully understand the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again back to you, what research have you actually done?

       Factory farms are bad, but, free range are not. TPTB are trying to get you to think meat is bad. It's not, and humans need it. Vegans/Vegetarians wouldn't last a day in my shoes on the 150+ acres that I have.

       veganism is a deep subject, that not many can understand at first.  but it warrants investigation.   once you understand why people go vegan you will understand why we get so passionate about it.

       Keto is a reddit circle jerk. Not meant as a long term solution. The bad cholesterol will still cause heart disease, animal products still contribute to cancer. Keto doesn't nullify that I have no idea where this info is coming from. It was a diet designed for short term use in medicine. It's not suppressed, it's just not a very good diet.

       The majority of fats are only bad if they are taken in combination with carbohydrates. Otherwise the cholesterol in your blood is just being transported around you cells to provide energy. It's high levels of carbohydrates that cause cancer and disease.

       Sure, but you said humans need meat. And that's just a lie. Every person doesn't need to eat animal products. Humans can fully sustain themselves on plants alone. However, I don't doubt that in certain situations it can definitely be beneficial to consume animal products - namely in colder climates where it's difficult to grow plants in the winter, so high-fat/high-protein foods like milk, cheese and meat would then help to sustain you through that time, until you can live off your crops again come spring. But it's just not necessary to consume animal products at the rate at which we currently do in most of the western world, nor is it beneficial to the planet.

       What's important is where the meat and animal products come from and how they are raised and processed. Rather than consume  factory farmed eggs, I pay more for the free range eggs from a farm that rotates chicken pastures that to help build diverse ecosystems. It's good for me, and the planet, and I'm using my financial capital to reinforce the positive food systems that I want to see more of in the world.

       The question isn't whether or not it's possible to survive without meat. The question is, does the absence of meat negatively effect human health. The answer for a lot of people in my experience is yes. Saturated fats are necessary for optimizing male sexual functions, and complete proteins are necessary if you intend to keep your muscle mass. It's pretty darn difficult to get all of your micro nutrients on a vegan diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no wonder the diet has been sponsored by the UN. It's NWO diet in my opinion.

       Hmm, that's a good point. I don't know the absolute answer to that, but I can intuitively figure that in some scenarios the absence of meat would negatively effect human health, whereas in other scenarios it wouldn't. Look at India for example. Over a billion people, and most of them follow the Hindu religion. Almost every Hindu follower is vegan or vegetarian. The ones who aren't, at least in India, usually aren't because it isn't easy/convenient to be vegan given their living circumstances and they would need the animal products to survive.
       <br/>
       And yeah, you make a good point to bring up micronutrients. It's difficult to keep on top of that if you aren't very well educated on what exact nutrients the human body needs. But thankfully, as humans, we are intelligent, and we have created the Internet, and on the Internet you can find out that information and then use that to make a diet plan to make sure you get everything you need. If we were still hunter gatherers then it would make sense to rely more on meat. But we've evolved past that. We should be looking towards how we can sustain ourselves and get everything we need, but still be as good to the environment and live as sustainably as we possibly can, because that's now within our grasp. I mean, sure, we could just not do that... But then we'd stagnate. The world would not be able to keep up with that level of resource extortion and waste production. We'd kill ourselves and everything else on this planet if we continue down the road paved by animal agriculture. I'm not saying everyone needs to go vegan, because it clearly doesn't make sense for everyone. But the majority of people in the western world don't need to consume anywhere near as much meat and dairy as we currently do.

       Quinoa is a complete protein, and coconut oil is high in saturated fats. These are the staples of the vegan diet. Not sure why you picked saturated fats and complete proteins as a criticism of the vegan diet, when those are the two easiest solved problems.

       We might not need meat but humans do so much better on a high fat protein diet. The food pyramid is a complete lie. Keto is far superior a vegetarian diet for most people. Good on you if you can supplement enough but the human body is not optimized for your diet.

       Keto inst sustainable for the planet, I think you are missing the point here. 40% of the amazon is gone due to cattle ranching. If everyone went keto...what would change? Nothing. Meat consumption would probably even increase.

       If the developing world stopped breeding like rabbits it wouldn't be an issue. Carbohydrates are what has mistakenly enabled the population explosion in the first place. Humans shouldn't have to live in a state where they sacrifice their well being and many will go to war to keep it the way.

       Your brain changes all your life due to a range of factors. Wanna eat less saturated fats? Your brain will respond by also having less saturated fats. Wanna specialise in a certain area of knowledge? Your brain will respond by increasing the size of that respective area of your brain. Traumatic injury to a particular part of your skull? Your brain will adapt by not growing near the area of trauma and make up for it elsewhere. This is simple neuroplasticity. What's your point?
       <br/>
       I consider myself smarter than I was a few years ago - mainly due to the fact I was keen to continue my education out of school - but if you're trying to say that going vegan makes your brain smaller and that makes you dumb then you're gonna have to back that claim up with something.

       Humans are a tropical species. You can look at our (lack of) body hair and tell we wouldn't last the night naked in most places, let alone the winter. Fruit is everywhere in the tropics. That's what humans are designed to eat, for millions of years, prior to the advent of fire and tools.

       I disagree. Meat has dense vibrations and lowers our consciousness. Overcoming attachment to killing animals is a part of our necesary evolution.

       B12 is injected or fed into animals to begin with so through injections or supplements JUST like animals get it but without the middle man. Everything else is through food. Omega 3s and 6s through things like flax seed. Healthy fats through foods like avocados. Being vegan is so much easier than eating and handling meat.

       From what I can figure, if you're eating meet you need to fast occasionally to give your body time to recover. Human body is not designed for meet. Just compare our digestive system to carnivores (say, cats) and compare to frugivores (gorillas).

       The solution is something like ending cafos for holistic pasture/rotation, agroecology, silvopasture permaculture. Beefalo. Beef is very very good for you. Cholesterol is a myth. Fat is a myth. Think about it.

       the fertilizer is chicken poop from factory farms. and ESPECIALLY if they buy organic veg. Facts matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the motivation is to improve the lives of livestock they could change everything if they would ban together and start eating humanely raised meat. By supporting the resale of factory farmed poop they continue to support animal cruelty and put money in the hands of their enemies.

       It's a self defeating strategy obviously.  Most self righteous people are more concerned with going through the motions and virtue signalling than actual integrity to values in the face of the truth so it's no surprise.

       A common counter to the the "meat/dairy industry is the leading cause in climate change" is the argument that soy farming is a big factor in deforestation. That's technically true, but the vast majority of that soy goes to feeding cows bred for McDonald's burgers. Rearing animals purely for meat consumption is one of the most inefficient methods of getting nutrition. If that crop went straight into the food line and got eaten directly by people, as opposed to being used to fatten up cows (who are much better off on a grass diet - it's just that soy is cheaper) then we wouldn't need to continually deforest the amazon via slash and burn "farming" techniques for more room to grow soy to feed the cows.
       <br/>
       However, I'm not opposed to eating meat entirely. It's just that in most of the western world it's not necessary, and not beneficial in the long run to eat meat. On a small scale, say on a local farm where fruit and veg is grown and a few animals are reared naturally off the land, then it would make sense to humanely put the animal down as it's coming to the end of its life and use its meat to feed yourself. That's not at all detrimental to the environment, nor is it inhumane to the animal. It just doesn't make sense to only rear meat to eat.

       "No. I NEED MY MEAT" And then the fat greasy meat eaters posting about their depression(this doesn't get fixed by going vegan, unfortunately. but being vegan makes you feel better about your self to a point where its not that bad), acne, whatever else and weight issues, asking why it's like this. "Why does no one want to date me?" he says as he drinks his third diet coke and finishes his second Mcdouble.

       But I run 3 miles a day and have 3x the muscle mass you do as a vegan. I'm stronger. In faster. I'm more agile. My brain is healthier thus processing information faster. Protein is necessary for all of that. Protein from an animal. Artificial protein doesnt provide the same benecits eating meat and vegetables provide.

       Human advancement is linked to....dum dum dummmmm the high protein diet we were eating as omnivores.

       What artificial protein are you talking about?

       You're talking about this like vegans have to eat capsules full of futuristic protein substitutes.

       Bruh, i deadass eat the same thing as you, just without meat.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no difference between meat protein and plant protein.
      </p>
      <p>
       100 grams of chicken has 27 grams of protein
      </p>
      <p>
       100 grams of peanuts has 26 grams of protein

       100 grams of red kidney beans has 24 grams of protein.

       <a href="/r/iamverysmart">
        /r/iamverysmart
       </a>
       bit, congratulations? I'm not sure what to tell you there bud. I'm glad you're fit an healthy. I'm fit and healthy too. Only difference is how you apparently owe it all to meat, right? It's why "My brain is healthier thus processing information faster"? Idk, I feel worlds smarter and like my brain functions more cleanly since I've cut out meat. I personally believe its because I no longer eat greasy chewy fat filled Slabs of flesh and instead run off clean plant nutes free of any of the nasty shit that's in meat. Idk what they feed those cows, the quality of the water, whether or not the meat I'm eating even came from a healthy, happy cow. But I know what's in my homemade soil, I know my veg is grown with clean water, good soil, and they're only benefitting the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       what about all the vegan body builders and athletes who are strong as hell and most definitely more fit and healthy than either of us?
      </p>
      <p>
       And sorry about the stereotype thing. I could say the same to you, Mr. Meathead. Fuck off with your bullshit and acknowledge the truth. All that muscle mass isnt gonna be fun when you're sick as hell in your 60s. If you're as concerned about your health as you seem, you'd be vegetarian.

       What exactly do non meat eaters miss? You're saying "not just protein but fat and other things". What fats and other things?

       We've already thrown the protein argument out of the window. You can easily eat enough or more protein per day without meat or weird shit, just plants and nuts.

       Omega 3 is the only one I ever questioned. Turns out, that too, we don't need meat for.

       It sounds like you're just convinced you need meat. Which I don't blame you, we all grew up being told that. But that's a lie, and we're on a conspiracy subreddit, so it would make sense you'd find the truth here. But we don't need meat. Actually, we're better off without it.

       Here's the thing, just about every vegan/Vegetarian you meet will say this same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I feel better since I stopped eating meat"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you see, lots of people ignore that this happens and insist on keeping to their carnivorous ways. Like, deadass if you're reading this, just take a second look at it. Maybe you don't need meat and the doctors are wrong? What if you can save money, be more healthy, help the environment, and save some animals, all just by not eating another beings flesh?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll suck at first, but after the first few weeks, you'll feel better than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI, that was a major reason behind me going vegetarian two years ago. If meat is so healthy and safe, why did I feel like shit and crave it when I stopped?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some might say that's a "sign you need meat". I say, I've survived 2 years running daily, being active as hell, and have only gotten stronger, smarter, and healthier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna say the people who are against it are only against it because the only thing keeping then ticking is how good that hamburger tastes. Yeah, life might be shit before they go back home to shitty kids and an ungrateful wife, but at least they get a few minutes alone with this burger. Only to go home and have steak for dinner. Wake up, bacon and eggs for breakfast. Chicken tenders for lunch. Rinse, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to them in the hospital at 40 bc a heart attack. Astonished at what could've caused this. "It must be all stress".

       Totally agree -- one probably shouldn't do a hard cut from Standard American Diet to pure fruitarian. It should take several months, maybe even a year. For me, it was several years, almost by accident, after I moved to the tropics -- fruit is so tasty here, and meat is kind of a pain to prepare.

       No, I'm saying it puts people off. That's all. My best friend is a vegan and I understand what you're saying, but I never insinuated anything you said. Just stating the fact that being so condescending about anything instantly creates a dislike for that person and/or belief.

       The thing about finding someone to be condescending (especially via text) is that it's subjective. It's an
       <em>
        opinion
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Opinions are influenced by your emotional state. Declaring that someone is off-putting requires both a subjective belief, and an emotional response to the belief. We are two layers deep in subjectivity and in a discussion of objective, measurable facts of empirical evidence, it is nothing more than an empty excuse you have manufactured from your own emotions.

       Yep I am! And not because I care about the animals but because I don't approve the mass and manner in which animals commodified. I actually despise when people over-value animal life. Pets absolutely included. But force breeding domesticated mutants in captivity to harvest their offspring to feed to already obese Americans, I'm just not willing to support that. Catch a wild hog? Roast 'em up. That's in balance. That's the circle of life, not moseying down the freezer aisle at 10 o'clock at night to pick up some microwave dinners.

       Apparently about 78% of beef is factory farmed in the US, which is certainly 78% too high, but pleasantly lower than I expected. Anyway, it's perfectly feasible that any random person could be consuming part of that 22%.

       Lol free range steak? You say "responsibly raised" as if that's common.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you see those cows, it's safe to assume your meats "free range" sticker doesn't mean shit. Same with eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple different people have brought up the soil and the current farming methods. That article is literally talking about moving cows around a big pasture all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man most of the farmed animals America eats doesn't even see a pasture before it's killed
      </p>
      <p>
       We could do all of this stuff with farming them, switching regulations, and medicine to counteract all the negative health effects, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could just suck it the fuck up and skip that hamburger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, with the amount of meat Americans consume, I highly doubt that method of farming works. If you have 20 cows and your own plot of land, yeah. But there's factory farms killing thousands (in some cases hundreds of thousands) of cows, pigs, chicken per day. I doubt it'd actually be doable to work that method on a scale as large as needee.
      </p>
      <p>
       how about this, if you want to eat meat so bad why don't you raise and kill it? That's how it worked for thousands of years. If you're so dead set on eating meat, work for it. The only people who "need" meat are the same people who hunt it with fucking Spears and shit.

       Unlike factory farms, sustainable farms do tend to let people visit and see the animals. Probably because they have nothing unsavory to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "negative health effects", I lost all those when I cut out the plants. That right there says to me that meat is what I should be eating, so meat is what I shall be eating.

       Tell that to your biologically crafted teeth, because they're made to rip meat and flesh much like the iron-infused teeth of a beaver are made to rip through wood on a daily basis.

       Oh? I want to see you a) kill, and b) tear through the raw hide and eat the flesh of, say, a cow (prime meat animal, no?) without the use of tools or fire. Hell, I bet you couldn't eat half a raw, feathered chicken without vomiting.

       Your "canine teeth" are meant for tearing through the tough skins of citrus fruits, like grapefruits and oranges. Science and reality are 100% on the side of fruitarians here -- from teeth to stomach to gut to anus.

       You don't rip through the flesh of uncooked meat not because you can't, but because you could die of infection or disease genius. Wild animals sometimes die the some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tools and fire were a natural part of evolution, and in no way discount your sharp teeth, otherwise we would have already disregarded them in our genetic makeup.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, who the hell uses teeth to peel an orange? That's what another natural tool, your fingernails, are for. Not to mention many cultures don't even peel the damn thing they rip it in half and eat it without ever removing the peel. Your ignorance to culture is grossly apparent. By the way, the rock and stick were the earliest tools of men, and are still in wild abundance to this day. To suggest men used their teeth over readily available objects in the wild is stupendously desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah I'd hate to eat a raw chicken and die from salmonella smart guy. After the first few people died that way I'm sure they quickly discovered the benefits of the open flame which wouldn't you know it made all food better and more accessible.

       So wild animals cook their food? Or are you suggesting there never was a time when humans didn't have tools and know how to make fire? Were we just placed here, complete with knowledge, from some higher being? I'm struggling to form a consistent worldview from your assertions.
      </p>

       And no, you CAN'T rip through the raw hide of cattle with your bare teeth. Go try it. YOU CAN'T. Natural humans make shitty carnivores, terrible design for killing and eating animals.

       You're so predictable.

       Humans are the top of the food chain because of their intelligence, upright posture and opposable thumb. Your teeth aren't sharp so that can chew lintels (it makes me laugh out loud that you believe this) they're sharp to chew through steak.
      </p>

       You fail to grasp the concept of intelligence over brute force. Mankind doesn't need brute force to eat, because he has intelligence.
       <strong>
        We aren't designed to live that way.
       </strong>
       At the same time, it doesn't mean we aren't designed to eat meat, we simply don't have to be savage when we do it because we are am intelligent species and like everything else we were designed in a unique fashion.

Since they're drained to do that, their teeth also self-sharpen. We don't have teeth like that because we're not designed to chew through hard shit like morons, ultimately leaving us with no teeth. We have intelligence instead and use tools, like something as basic as a rock or stick.

       The "endless circle" is caused by you refusing to answer direct questions and instead redirecting the argument to areas already addressed. Specifically:

       You have yet to quote and respond to the vast majority of points I've made; instead you ignore them and revert to your point of origin, which is a psychological signal that you know you're out of ammo (could be due to ignorance on the subject or you know you it's bullshit but due to pride won't admit it.)

       They ate meat, genius.

      <p>
       "But as steak tartare proves, humans can eat raw meat as long as it’s cut into bite-size pieces. Lieberman and evolutionary biologist Katherine Zink, also at Harvard, were curious about the role this “mechanical processing” might have played in our evolution, especially since there is evidence that hominins were making tools and
       <strong>
        eating meat as far back as 3.3 million years ago
       </strong>
       —and that they increased their meat consumption around 2.6 million years ago—yet evidence for cooking doesn’t turn up until about
       <strong>
        500,000 years ago."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another snippet:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Human teeth are nearly incapable of breaking down raw meat. Instead of the scissor-sharp points found on canine teeth, most of our teeth have a flat, grinding surface. A new study looks at how we may have overcome our dental limitations—and finds that chopping raw meat with stone tools may have reduced the need for heavy jaws and teeth and freed up our heads for evolutionary change."
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only are our teeth
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       like a canines as you have ignorantly repeated multiple times (you've gotten almost everything wrong) but your entire point about my not being able to eat through cow hide is false, because our ancestors could.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But Zink and Lieberman believe that the major changes to the head and teeth seen in early species of Homo, namely the decrease in teeth and jaw-muscle size that emerged in Homo erectus (which dates from 1.89 million to 143,000 years ago), could have occurred before cooking, purely due to the invention of tartare."
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the advent of cooking, we have evolved (I tried making this point to you earlier but as everything else, you ignored it to your own downfall because now everything is falling down on top of you at once, and you have no way to escape).
      </p>
      <p>
       You lose.

       Okay. So I want to see you hunt and eat any creature over 1 kg without the use of tools or fire. Could be a chicken, a squirrel, a cow, a goat... anything. Then tell me how useful those "scissor-sharp points found on canine teeth" are.

       Our ancestors could do that, because they needed to. We don't do that, because we have evolved and saved room in our mouths to make more room for our brains after discovering tools. We lack the same teeth and jaw muscles

       And I love how you've gotten so desperate that you've belittled yourself into making up your own realities in order to aid you emotionally (also predictable, but failed to forecast being busy today.) It's great, because you do it as though all of our words aren't written and public for everyone who sees to cross-reference.

      <p>
       As I pointed out, even your first line in this response was emotional, and you'll continue to get worse as this goes on. You've lost the debate, and therefore all you have left is to try and make a jab at me, but in doing so you only expose yourself and prove me right.

       Thus, no matter what you do from here on forward (aside from admitting you were wrong) will only serve to dig a hole for yourself that will become exponentially worse over time.

       How bad it gets from here is an issue of your pride. It matters not to me.

       bit, congratulations? I'm not sure what to tell you there bud. I'm glad you're fit an healthy. I'm fit and healthy too. Only difference is how you apparently owe it all to meat, right? It's why "My brain is healthier thus processing information faster"? Idk, I feel worlds smarter and like my brain functions more cleanly since I've cut out meat. I personally believe its because I no longer eat greasy chewy fat filled Slabs of flesh and instead run off clean plant nutes free of any of the nasty shit that's in meat. Idk what they feed those cows, the quality of the water, whether or not the meat I'm eating even came from a healthy, happy cow. But I know what's in my homemade soil, I know my veg is grown with clean water, good soil, and they're only benefitting the world.

      <p>
       what about all the vegan body builders and athletes who are strong as hell and most definitely more fit and healthy than either of us?

       And sorry about the stereotype thing. I could say the same to you, Mr. Meathead. Fuck off with your bullshit and acknowledge the truth. All that muscle mass isnt gonna be fun when you're sick as hell in your 60s. If you're as concerned about your health as you seem, you'd be vegetarian.
