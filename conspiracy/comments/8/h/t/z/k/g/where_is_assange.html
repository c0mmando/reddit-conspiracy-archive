       True, but then he'd be picked up and extradited to the US, most likely. For some reason he's still considered a criminal by most governments, and the russian collusion hoax hasn't really helped in that regard.

       Assange expects me to believe wikileaks never got gop emails that showed anything that's why he says they never released them.

       It's not that unlikely IMHO that they never got any GOP emails. Think about the requirements for wikileaks getting those emails:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)GOP needs to backroom dealing. This is a given IMHO as it's the core business of political parties
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Someone gets evidence of said backroom dealings. This is a lot harder, either requiring a hacker or an insider leaking. It's a possibility, but it requires the GOP to run an equally leaky ship to the DNC and have less trouble with dissenters.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)The leaker or hacker gets it to wikileaks. This is the step I think is a lot more difficult for GOP info compared to DNC info. The stuff wikileaks usually reports actually (even in the case of the DNC leaks/hacks/whatever) are about the small people getting fucked over by the elites (either through fraud, false promises, pushing for war, etc. etc.). For the GOP, the small people getting fucked over is actually their core business, so a leak is a lot less likely. If it's a hack, it also means it's more likely they'll get blackmailed for it and less likely the hacker immediately publishes the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find Assanges explanation thus plausible. But of course it doesn't mean it's true either. We don't know at this point.

       He gets delivery chinese food 3 times a week. The delivery boy goes in and then comes out. This time the delivery boy went in weraing a wig and extra clothes. Assange put on the uniform, wig and hat and snuck out disguised as the take out boy.

       His mom joined twitter recently (@AssangeMrs) and is trying to raise awareness of his isolation. There's also a #PostcardsforAssange campaign happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone explain to me how wikileaks can be such a humongous elephant in Mueller's room, what with the absolute media blackout on Assange? Media has asserted - despite the absence of evidence - that Russia provided wikileaks with the DNC emails. Pretty freaking central precept to the Russia investigation, right? Yet, not one shred of evidence... in fact, evidence to the contrary has been presented (that the speed of the download indicates it was local).
      </p>

       Did you know they handcuffed and removed a journalist who dared mention Assange at Ugly Prom (White House Correspondents Dinner)? Unlawfully detained a human for
       <em>
        speaking
       </em>
       at a press event. Is meta-irony a word yet? Because that's some next level shit right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key questions are
       <strong>
        who had Assange silenced this time and what info are they concerned about coming to light
       </strong>
       ?

       What does a media assertion or their lack of evidence have to do with the actual investigation?  Those are two separate things.

       I'm failing to see your point. In their coverage of the Mueller investigation, legacy media continues to report without evidence that Russia hacked the DNC. For example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Investigators are also asking questions about Trump's longtime relationship with Stone, the Republican operative, according to witnesses. Investigators have asked about Stone's contacts with WikiLeaks during the campaign and if he's ever met with Assange.
       </p>
       <p>
        "They wanted to see if there was a scheme. Was Stone working on the side for Trump?" after he officially left the campaign, one person interviewed by the special counsel's office said, adding that it seemed investigators wanted to know, "Was this a big plot?"
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia stole emails from the DNC and Podesta, according to U.S. intelligence officials, and released batches of them through WikiLeaks starting in July 2016 and up until the election.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>

      <p>
       If Mueller had any solid evidence rather than just the word of some intelligence operatives, where is it? Why hasn't the evidence been revealed? Legacy (mockingbird) media is a tool in the intelligence community's belt.

       He was posing as Q Anon until his internet got shut down, then someone else picked it up. The day his internet was cut, the page he was on was moved to somewhere else saying that page was compromised. He also put that he would be going offline the day before it was cut. I think "Q" was created by him, with the help of Roger Stone, with the data from CA, or Steve Bannon or someone like that. Also, the fact that his own people at Wikileaks leaked their convos with him because he was supporting the GOP in the election. There is just too much smoke for me to say it isn't him.
