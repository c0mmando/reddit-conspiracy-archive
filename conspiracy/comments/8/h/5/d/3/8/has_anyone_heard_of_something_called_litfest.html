       I am so fucking angry I am posting here rather than jumping in my car and laying a beatdown on people because r/conspiracy is a place I know with people who know shit and people who are rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       My daughter, a high school senior, has had her car papered with an ad for LitFest at her school parking lot. Lit Fest was tonight from 7 to 11 at a local hotel banquet facility. LitFest is, according to this ad, a party for high school kids. She got sick after her prom, a lot of her friends did too, and she was bummed out, and after leaving work tonight at 10 at the mall she thought maybe this LitFest thing would cheer her up.  I am shaking so much I cant copy the link but LitFest Orland Hills is the event. I hate doxxing myself but fuck this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What she described happening to her from leaving her car to her fleeing makes me so fucking angry my instincts are to beat people to death and ask questions later.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is home and safe but I am so irate I cant breathe.  I will post a follow up tomorrow but I would rather hang with her tonight to help her than deal with this but this “high school” event where at least 5 people between the ages of 20 and 40 tried to get her to “hang” with them in their rooms before she even got to the door to enter this shit show has me wondering how the fuck this can go on.  She literally ran to her car and is sick from this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, sorry for the lack of info but I have to sort shit out and make her feel better,  but something wasnt right here. She is shaking and I am trying to help her out but I would rather be beating someone to a pulp if I could.

       Sorry , I am so angry I am ranting. She went to prom last Friday. A lot of kids got norovirus. Her core group of friends are still sick. She was sick but being a non drinker, non smoking vegan she is better.
      </p>
      <p>
       She went to work tonight to cover a friends shift who had norovirus. Without telling my wife or me she was down, and every day this week she got ads on her car at school about a high school party at a hotel banquet facility that is on her way home.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all her friends sick she remembers this ad had a 10 foot talking robot she wanted to get a video of. She stops in this hotel to get a video of this robot to make me laugh, and her sister laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between getting out of the car and the entrance to this banquet room she was approached by what now soumds to be six men. Not kids. Men. These men ask her to come with her for a drive. Go to their room for a beer. Walk with them...
      </p>
      <p>
       These arent kids they are old men. At some point in the future I will be angry with her. I get that she should have expected nothing else. But fuck that. She is a great kid. Like I was. I am a big guy, always have been. If u fucked with me u were fucking with danger. This is my daughter. She deserves the same respect I get. More so maybe, she has a 4.3 gpa due to as in ap classes. I was a fucking moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sorry again I wasnt clear. I am fighting the irge to grab the hotel owner and manager and beat them to death. She made a mistake, but she is a kid. She should not be judged any different than me because she is a young woman, the bottom line is if a hotel hosts a party for high school kids I believe they should watch for 30 uear old men trying to lite children to leave with them or lure them to their room. While I am proud of my daughter for leaving I am terrified a more vulnerable kid could have their lofs destroyed by one of these predators

       I’m a mom and I can easily imagine your rage. However it doesn’t sound like she did anything wrong at all. She was an innocent victim of something designed to target naive young women like her. Don’t get angry at her, I promise you she is already angry at herself. Remember to keep your anger squarely where it belongs  - on those dirtbag scum. Once the emotions are calmer talk to her about how she can better recognize potentially dangerous situations, how to get out of them more quickly, etc. Also, talk to her about never, ever thinking that she must be polite in situations that are unsettling or frightening. Girls are trained from an early age to be pleasing to others, and it sets them up for danger. I highly recommend she read “The Gift of Fear” by Gavin DeBecker. I learned something from that book that I believe saved my life. Good luck to you and your family, let us Redditors know how it all turns out.

       No I cant be angry at her, great point. I was hit with the reality that I have lived a charmed life when I heard my wife tell her this happens men are assholes and it happens to her too. If anything I am not angry. I am ashamed I didnt know tstuff like this happened to my wife. If my mom was still alive I would feel worse. I am sure this happened to her too.

       I took a picture and put it on Imgur.  Let me know if this works.  And as a caveat I am relatively certain the promoter and the people who run the event are decent people.  I lost about four hours last night trying to find out who they were and they seem to be decent people.

       I have up until now believed that a lot of the trafficking thing was a myth. If I saw this flyer she received I would have called the police in advance. If it isnt a trafficking event it certainly was on the radar of people trying to lire young women, and maybe men, the party was for kods 14 to 18 only, no parents.

       Again sorry I was unclear but I am going to beat at leadt six people into the groumd as soon as I k ow my daughter is ok

       This is it. Thank you. The hosts may have had the best of i tentions, the hotel may have as well, but something stinks and I am not happy. My daughters arent stupid, and they deserve the same respect I had. The fact I was a big kid who played football should not have made me different. My daughter is a good kid who is very bright and deserves better. If anything these predator scumfuxks should have said hey you did well in school where is that asshole dad.

       Bro, just find out when the next one is and go in there with your phone filming and run up on any old dudes, and accost them and demand to know what they're doing there, and then just post their faces and shit on the internet and blow it up.

       My wife has been talking me down. She thinks because this was advertised on facebook they latched on. I am more cynical. I do know my daughter is a cynic and when I saw her try to make this seem funny bit saw the tear in her eye it didnt matter why they were there, it mattered that they were there. She has a boyfriend she has been with for three years, he is sick from this norovirus thing he caught at prom all week. She has a sense of humor and wanted us all to laugh and get past everyone getting sick, but to be asked by an adult male slightly younger than me if she wanted to grab a beer in his room while he was standing near the check in desk I am righ, this is fucked up

       Kudos to you, for not beating the shit out of people (whether deserved or not). Consider this a Cautionary Tale. Keep an eye on her, and teach her well. The last thing she needs, is her dad (her anchor) in jail. The world is a sick dark and fucked up place. Teach her that, but not to Fear the world. Trust instinct, intuition, logic, and gut. I'd venture to say 95% of people do not teach that to their kids.

       She's safe now (so you said), and nothing happened. A Cautionary Tale.

       Thank you. I am not an asshole. I think being a big tough kid from a bad neighborhood, a poor kid, I felt I saw everything. I havent , apparently , but I will see to it this doesnt happen again. When, or of, I see a party invite for kids 14 to 18 where parents arent welcome I am going to show up and make sure.

       There's a couple spots in my area that did this when I was in HS a few years back. Back when project X was a thing everyone would try to throw their own. Dumb I know, but they would end up throwing them at these banquet type venues, posting the add all over social media, then get mad when their "lot turn up" turns into a weirdo sausage fests. When it's not regulated by a school and anyone can show, you best believe a few creeps will

       So stupid on my part. Of the 400 kids who went to her prom 120 got norovirus. Prom was so important to her I would have encouraged her to go to this. She felt guiltyher boyfriend got sick and was devestated and saw an ad for a ten foot robot she wanted a pic to cheer him up and make me happy. This made me physically ill. I will see to it her friends, or kids younger than her, dont get lured by something like this where the school or parents arent involved
