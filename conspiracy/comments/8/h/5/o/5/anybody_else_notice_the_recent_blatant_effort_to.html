    <div class="md"><p>1st of all with regards to the protocals.  Does it matter who wrote it if the stuff in it is overwhelmingly accurate?  All of our problems are due to banks?  Let me add to that.
Who controls the biased on all sides media?
Who controls the brain washing, society destroying television entertainment?
Who controls the tobacco companies?
Who runs most of the worlds organized crime?
Who runs most of the worlds white/sex slavery?
For that matter who were the slave masters that brought the blacks to America?
Who is behind the epic spread of extasy, LSD and other &quot;mind fuck&quot; drugs?
Communism?
Socialism?
WW1?
WW2?
WW3?
I can keep going.  Really.
And before you call me a moron come with some facts jack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rotate the &quot;n&quot; in new world order 25% clockwise  and you will have the correct title. The jew world order has throughout history been squashed at every attempt. They are far from infallible, and to be fair their track record, taken as a whole is actually quite pathetic. </p>

<p>This should be an interesting run for them though, seeing as how up until now they have always had an alternative less informed population  to go leech upon after their host countries wised up and expelled them. With the world community shrinking as it is, looks like their only haven will be Israel. </p>

<p>And we all know how much the world loves Israel. :)</p>

<p>(As a side note it should be mentioned that the Jews are incapable of living solely amongst themselves. They require a host population to exploit for their own parasitic survival. So basically this appears to be the  all or nothing round for them. And if we use history as a guide, well... it does not look good for these &quot;old white people&quot; who are in fact not white people at all, but the four thousand year old scourge known as the Jews.)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you have more power than you think.  </p>

<p>Eg. it is becoming clear to individual investors now that Goldman Sachs and their clique have been manipulating markets, even governments.  Hence they are less likely to place their savings in the conventional places for fear of being caught in a game heavily rigged against them.  </p>

<p>If enough little guys do that then it will at least cause some discomfort for the NWO parasites, forcing them to adapt.</p>
