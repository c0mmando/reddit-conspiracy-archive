       All for banning guns. If it's banned from all civilians, police, security, private security. No reason to have them unless it's military. So it's not just.. Oh we can have them but you can't.

       How the fook are guns a natural right? You do realize the only reason our government “can’t” infringe on it is because our government said so, right? They can amend that whenever they want.

       Compaired to how many articles about Stormy Daniels? I think it's more important that people know the risks in healthcare than know who Trump boinked 11 years ago.  It's not making headline news.

       This is such a stupid comment I’m not even sure how to respond. First, I don’t know why you decided to turn this into a Trump thing, seems a bit weird to blurt out a whataboutism on something entirely unrelated. Second, the Stormy case has been in the news because Trump has repeatedly lied and flip flopped about the issue, being constantly at odds with his lawyers, in which there’s a possibility he broke the law and used campaign funds to cover up the whole thing. Lastly, and what makes your comment so stupid, how many literally countless issues aren’t the current headline because
       <em>
        they already headlined and are now in public knowledge?
       </em>
       Let me repeat that to make sure you understand, this was already covered fairly extensively, so why would it stay in the headline with no new information? Yes it’s important, and has been covered a lot. The fact that it’s not currently headlining is moot. WWII was one of the most important events in human history, why is it still not headlining? Cigarettes cause cancer! Water is wet! Alert the media!
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that something has called out of headlines is no reason to be ignorant about its coverage or existence.

       LOL.  Add to that 100,000 Americans killed by CORRECTLY prescribed medication each year.  Add the tens of thousands who die from incorrectly prescribed medication, and the tens of thousands who die from severe reactions to general anaesthetics.  Then the other tens of thousands who die due to other medical practice (both malpractice and standard procedures) and you are getting close to a million per fucking year.  The medical profession is and has been on a killing spree that matches Hitler's.

       Well yeah,  if the agenda was to actually make us safer they would be improving our roads (40k/yr dead from auto crashes as OP notes) or making a serious attempt at tackling the opiate issue (which also killed approx ~40k last year).
      </p>
      <p>
       For every 1 person killed by a semi auto rifle,  one hundred were killed by car wrecks and 100 more were killed by opiates... but assault rifles are super important....

       That is a cloudy picture. I have Lupus and if the lupus attacks my heart and kills me my death certificate says I died from heart disease, not lupus. They were trying to correct this, but so far same old same old. I think big pharma has a lot to do with that.

       Im talking about speed limiters of 70MPH on every car unless its made for a race track. Also a face sensor in every car to make sure the driver's eyes are on the road at all times that way they cant text and drive. Which reminds me. Hand sensors for the steering wheel so that hands stay on the wheel at all times.

       These may or may not work but makes me feel safe.

       Cars are much harder to obtain and use, have way more regulations and are necessary to survive, unless you live in a city and can walk or bike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns aren’t necessary for survival 99% of the time, are too easy to obtain and have little regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get a license, register your car, have a title, wear your belt, have up to date tabs, license plates identifying you, drive the speed limit, have insurance, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can walk into a store and buy a gun in less than an hour and after that you’re in the wind and the gun could be sold to anyone. No title, license, registration, tabs, insurance, identifying numbers...
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, they’re so weird to want more gun regulations.

       No you can’t buy a gun in less than an hour but your point is very valid. People who own guns need to keep them registered. Proof that they are kept in a safe place. Have references etc etc. the problem is everyone who owns guns agrees with that and everyone who doesn’t own a gun thinks you shouldn’t have a gun at all. I’m generalizing obviously.

       You can buy a gun in less than an hour.  I still remember getting my first gun at Walmart. It was a surprise.  We walked up to the Counter and I picked out my 20 gauge shotgun.  That’s was 30 years ago and we walked out in about 30 mins.  My most recent purchase being a .30-06 2 years agoand it took me well less than an hour.  CBS had a report and it took them 38 mins, and just last week a guy in VA recorded himself purchasing an AR-15 in 10mins at a gun show

       Also, in a family of about 20 gun owners, I can attest to only one other person who agrees to any regulations at all...If I mention safe, background check, or anything about what someone should have to do with their gun they just scream at me as if there’s only 4 words in the entirety of the 2A, “SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED”

       I noticed that too. But it seems like the more logical posts are in the positive while the less thought out and/or emotional posts are downvoted.

       I think this is the wrong comparison. People need to be held responsible for their actions. There is NO good ending to a system where the government holds tyrannical control over all people so that they never have the chance to do anything wrong. The problem with that should be obvious to anyone who has studied recent history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only solution is for people to be better than behaving like this. That people should be in control of themselves AND responsible for their own actions. Most of these assholes who kill a bunch of people (be it with a car or a gun or a knife or whatever) typically think that they are more important than anyone else AND act like they are victims in some manner (like incels). This kind of victim mentality where the big bad world needs to pay for not giving you whatever fantasy you thought up is never addressed...this 'mental illness' is not genetic, but a learned behaviour over years of poor upbringing, bad morality and a poorly thought out religion (everyone has a set of beliefs that define their actions, even atheists, this isn't about god). When that goes awry, for whatever reason, you end up with some pretty shitty people.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are solutions to these things. Many of which we've already known about. But the reasons these things keep getting worse is not because there isn't enough gun regulation...but because a) we aren't discussing the root of the problem and b) there are political forces that want to establish a tyranny who are using these events to push solutions that will benefit no one but themselves.

       All for banning guns. If it's banned from all civilians, police, security, private security. No reason to have them unless it's military. So it's not just.. Oh we can have them but you can't.

       Yes but many of them are anti-violence in general. To me I see a shift from a focus on the violence of our foreign policy, to the violence happening domestically.
