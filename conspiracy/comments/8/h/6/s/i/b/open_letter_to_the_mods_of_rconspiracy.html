I have had a conversation on here with a 1 year club member who has posted, at least as far as I&#39;m willing to look back, to only 4 subreddits. 2 of them contradicting the others. The account looks like it&#39;s been taken out of a page of AIPAC and/or JIDF. why is this not allowed to be pointed out? On a conspiracy subreddit, why is this disallowed, unless the sub is compromised. Why? Tell me exactly why? Shouldn&#39;t these accusations not only be allowed, but investigated? Is this sub controlled opposition? Is their not shills? Should they not be allowed to be called out and readers make their own call? Is it that it&#39;s so true that their is no shills that we can&#39;t question it? Are we dealing with AIPAC/JIDF or are we dealing with real people?</p>

<p>If you have actual evidence send it to the mods and document the process.(I mean I guess this is only acceptable if you believe the mods here are unbiased which is a topic for debate in itself)  If the only &quot;evidence&quot; you have is someone disagreeing with you or somebody that has a different ideology than you then I would suggest you don&#39;t have any evidence at all and nothing is gained by screaming &quot;shiiiiil&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly easy to blame the mods for everything one perceives as wrong with the sub. </p>

<p>Mods are between a rock and a hard place. The conspiracy community (such as yourself right now) clamors for the ability to fight shills, and for the mods to join them in this battle. The non conspiracy community takes every proactive measure by mods as overly hostile and close minded.</p>

<p>Call out actions for what you think they are. You don&#39;t need to call someone a shill directly. Just point out that you see them repeatedly make forum sliding comments, or that they never contribute anything of substance, or that their voting patterns are obviously manipulated.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll push back with their nonsense talking points. But they&#39;ve already lost, because you called it out. The more strong users we have who are willing to push back against the onslaught of trolls and shills, the greater the conversion rate of the normies. </p>

<p>If someone is shilling then it shouldn’t be a lot of effort to refute the data. If you’re unable to do that then perhaps you should reassess your position on the matter. </p>

<p>This is the answer to a particular problem. I hate watching people get slaughtered in this sub because they can&#39;t articulate their point (which I often agree with) and just end up calling people names instead of attacking the data and discrediting their position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shills are not children, they are professionals running psyops.</p>

<p>Sure, but if they aren&#39;t changing your mind then what&#39;s the risk? If it&#39;s changing someone else&#39;s mind, the only way you&#39;re going to defend against that is with superior data. </p>

<p>Reddit has millions of visitors 90% of them are exclusively lurkers.</p>

<p>These are the people shills are designed for, they are aware the more passionate people with accounts who regularly comment will not fall for the typical psyops.</p>

<p>But they specialize in creating arguments that sound quite convincing on the surface but are filled with hard to detect fallacies and intentional misrepresentations. </p>

<p>These arguments are meant to convince the numerous lurkers who dont have an established opinion they are willing to argue for, and be especially difficult to argue against, and if do decide to refute them it usually can take multiple paragraphs to point out the flaws with their argument, and then they will cherrypick out a small piece of your dozen sentences and overconfidently act like you are a fool.</p>

<p>And even if you unequivocally defeat their argument, they just dont respond and you just wasted large amounts of mental energy you could have dedicated to furthering some actual constructive discussion which might aswell be a win for them</p>

<p>I don&#39;t for one second believe a word that comes out of our current government&#39;s mouth or by extension the BBC but I sure as shit don&#39;t believe a word that comes out of the mouth of superpowers such as the US and Russia.

If a country has the rescorces to sow discord and deliver disinfo that shows them in a better light on the world stage then the will do it. </p>

<p>Yeah its a labor intensive job, but so what I bet 100 people on here would volunteer for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti conspiracy view points? The very essence of investigating a conspiracy is to be very skeptical and not accept the popular consensus without thinking critically about the actual evidence. Are you insinuating people could just accept conspiracies at face value and not investigate the truths within at all? We should just accept these conspiracies and any debate against them should be investigated and punished by the mods? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I am insulating very credible theories, that once dug into are extremely compelling, are regularly laughed at and deemed debunked and hoaxes.</p>

<p>I am for constructive debate, if you want to explain why PedoGate is fake go ahead, and Ill judge your specific arguments based on their validity.</p>

<p>But the more common argument is to attack the character of the conspiracy poster, and ridicule anyone who believes in said theory without ever actually having a solid refutation of the stated theory and displaying a clear lack of understanding on the topic.</p>

<p>And you may say &quot;well give them a clear understanding&quot; and I will type of 3 paragraphs of explanation only to have them cherrypick 1 sentence, ignoring multiple paragraphs of legitimate information on the topic and making their entire response about the weakest single sentence they can find.</p>

<p>Just because someone is not very good at debate, has weak arguments, or even intentionally commits logical fallacies thst does not make them a shill. Do yourself a favor and look up what the word shill means. </p>

<p>You should know that answer, as you point out YOU just said you went through my 15 days worth of undeleted comments. Did you find anything? No, because you would have shoved it in my face. But hey, never a bad time to defend Trumps LARP crew and their fantasy LARP narratives. </p>

<p>I respectfully and wholeheartedly disagree. Shills are here. They&#39;re a plague. It shouldn&#39;t be a problem. At the very worst it&#39;s just calling someone a name. We&#39;re all adults here, so no big deal. At its best it&#39;s pointing out manipulation and the carrying forward of a narrative. </p>

<p>Of course shills exist, but they are very hard to positively identify. For the most part, they are indistinguishable from useful idiots (which we could define as people who are shilling but who don&#39;t realise it). </p>

<p>Ok. That&#39;s a valid point. I don&#39;t agree that shill is really that personal insult though </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty tame, but virtually every single discussion in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would contain numerous shill accusations, if we didn&#39;t have a rule against it. Attributing bad faith for another person&#39;s comments - especially when you can&#39;t prove it - is a distraction and a conversation killer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I repeatedly get accused of being a shill or being a Russian Bot because i go out of my way to defend Russia and hit back on slide threads where Neocon shills attempt to blame Muh Russia again and again.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t make me upset at all. I revel in being accused of being a shill. I wear that as a badge of honor!</p>

<p>I think a lot of readers here would learn to toughen up and not be just like SJW cry babies who&#39;re constantly policing each other&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; speech by lurking moar on /pol/. If you can last on /pol/, nothing anyone calls you will phase you. Hell, i&#39;ve been trashed talked by mods there and banned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just words. I&#39;m more offended by not calling out an obvious shill as a shill, than i am about Mean Words. as long as i don&#39;t have to scroll through endless posts of spam, i don&#39;t care what anyone calls anyone else.</p>

<p>back in the Golden Age Internet, it was implicitly understood that if you were intelligent enough to even be online, then you&#39;re intelligent enough to handle Adult Conversations and not need mods holding your hand and hugging you if you get a boo-boo from something you read.</p>
