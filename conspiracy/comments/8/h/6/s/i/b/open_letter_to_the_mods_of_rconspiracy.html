       not being allowed to call shills out should be viewed as a conspiracy in and of itself. I have had a conversation on here with a 1 year club member who has posted, at least as far as I'm willing to look back, to only 4 subreddits. 2 of them contradicting the others. The account looks like it's been taken out of a page of AIPAC and/or JIDF. why is this not allowed to be pointed out? On a conspiracy subreddit, why is this disallowed, unless the sub is compromised. Why? Tell me exactly why? Shouldn't these accusations not only be allowed, but investigated? Is this sub controlled opposition? Is their not shills? Should they not be allowed to be called out and readers make their own call? Is it that it's so true that their is no shills that we can't question it? Are we dealing with AIPAC/JIDF or are we dealing with real people?

       I would imagine the reason for this rule is it is very common for people that hold views that go against a particular view/post to be called shills for no other reason than they don't follow another persons viewpoints.

       I am fairly sure you could PM the mods and give any evidence you have uncovered to them without any ban taking place.

       because all it becomes is two sides calling each other shills while sticking their fingers in their ears and shouting "naaa naaa naa I cant hear you" Trying to keep conversations clean and readable isn't the same as protecting feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have actual evidence send it to the mods and document the process.(I mean I guess this is only acceptable if you believe the mods here are unbiased which is a topic for debate in itself)  If the only "evidence" you have is someone disagreeing with you or somebody that has a different ideology than you then I would suggest you don't have any evidence at all and nothing is gained by screaming "shiiiiil"

       No they're protecting shills. I don't care if anyone calls me a shill, it's demonstrably stupid and untrue. I don't care if literally every comment I made is met with a shill accusation. The only people who stand to gain anything by the implementation of a rule where you have to pretend shills aren't shills..... are shills.

       No--they're protecting conversation. Accusing someone of being a shill (as you so often like to do) is a transparent attempt to shut down the conversation without having to rationally defend your position.

       It's certainly easy to blame the mods for everything one perceives as wrong with the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods are between a rock and a hard place. The conspiracy community (such as yourself right now) clamors for the ability to fight shills, and for the mods to join them in this battle. The non conspiracy community takes every proactive measure by mods as overly hostile and close minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call out actions for what you think they are. You don't need to call someone a shill directly. Just point out that you see them repeatedly make forum sliding comments, or that they never contribute anything of substance, or that their voting patterns are obviously manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll push back with their nonsense talking points. But they've already lost, because you called it out. The more strong users we have who are willing to push back against the onslaught of trolls and shills, the greater the conversion rate of the normies.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know if the suspects reach the top, but their many on our side taking up the good fight.

       Discuss shilling all you want. Don’t call other people shills, or nazis or fascists or anything else as this signals the end of the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is shilling then it shouldn’t be a lot of effort to refute the data. If you’re unable to do that then perhaps you should reassess your position on the matter.
      </p>

       This is the answer to a particular problem. I hate watching people get slaughtered in this sub because they can't articulate their point (which I often agree with) and just end up calling people names instead of attacking the data and discrediting their position.

       Sure, but if they aren't changing your mind then what's the risk? If it's changing someone else's mind, the only way you're going to defend against that is with superior data.

       Reddit has millions of visitors 90% of them are exclusively lurkers.

       These are the people shills are designed for, they are aware the more passionate people with accounts who regularly comment will not fall for the typical psyops.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they specialize in creating arguments that sound quite convincing on the surface but are filled with hard to detect fallacies and intentional misrepresentations.

       These arguments are meant to convince the numerous lurkers who dont have an established opinion they are willing to argue for, and be especially difficult to argue against, and if do decide to refute them it usually can take multiple paragraphs to point out the flaws with their argument, and then they will cherrypick out a small piece of your dozen sentences and overconfidently act like you are a fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if you unequivocally defeat their argument, they just dont respond and you just wasted large amounts of mental energy you could have dedicated to furthering some actual constructive discussion which might aswell be a win for them

       that is literally what I said in my 1st paragraph in my reply to the OP and I stand by that comment.

       Do you mean green as in gullible? I would consider a person such as yourself that is apparently so in touch with the way things really are taking a Russian diplomats word as gospel truth about what happened in the UK pretty fucking gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't for one second believe a word that comes out of our current government's mouth or by extension the BBC but I sure as shit don't believe a word that comes out of the mouth of superpowers such as the US and Russia. Why the fuck would anyone tbh. They are all playing the same disinfo game whatever country they are from. If a country has the rescorces to sow discord and deliver disinfo that shows them in a better light on the world stage then the will do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of them should be trusted, all information will be slanted in a way that benefits them, be it the US the UK or indeed Russia.

       The mods themselves should take a role investigating suspicious "anti-conspiracy" view points for evidence of shilling, or atleast look into accounts being accused and message the accuser with why they think the accused are not a shill or have a publicly available criterion for what puts someone under suspicion and explain how someone being accused fits the criteria in whatever way.

       Yeah its a labor intensive job, but so what I bet 100 people on here would volunteer for it.

       And shills derail discussions all day so you get caught up arguing about your premises validity rather than getting to deeper discussion and understanding of that premise

       Anti conspiracy view points? The very essence of investigating a conspiracy is to be very skeptical and not accept the popular consensus without thinking critically about the actual evidence. Are you insinuating people could just accept conspiracies at face value and not investigate the truths within at all? We should just accept these conspiracies and any debate against them should be investigated and punished by the mods?

       No I am insulating very credible theories, that once dug into are extremely compelling, are regularly laughed at and deemed debunked and hoaxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am for constructive debate, if you want to explain why PedoGate is fake go ahead, and Ill judge your specific arguments based on their validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the more common argument is to attack the character of the conspiracy poster, and ridicule anyone who believes in said theory without ever actually having a solid refutation of the stated theory and displaying a clear lack of understanding on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you may say "well give them a clear understanding" and I will type of 3 paragraphs of explanation only to have them cherrypick 1 sentence, ignoring multiple paragraphs of legitimate information on the topic and making their entire response about the weakest single sentence they can find.

       Nobody is talking about pedogate right now. You're the only one that brought it up so obviously it must be on your mind. You are talking about the usage of logical fallacies. Everyone commits logical fallacies at some point (some people more than others) and that's not what being a shill is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone is not very good at debate, has weak arguments, or even intentionally commits logical fallacies thst does not make them a shill. Do yourself a favor and look up what the word shill means.

       You should know that answer, as you point out YOU just said you went through my 15 days worth of undeleted comments. Did you find anything? No, because you would have shoved it in my face. But hey, never a bad time to defend Trumps LARP crew and their fantasy LARP narratives.

       Hey I’m just a regular r/conspiracy user..... I have no conspiracy posts and it’s unclear which conspiracies I believe in, in fact all my posts are to r/webcamgirls and r/anime, and I show up within 15 minutes of any post made about NASA to write 300 word essay style comments about how we definitely went to the moon and the earth is definitely a spinning ball, but I’m just your garden variety conspiracy theorist Reddit user who does it for fun..... just because I like to “call out bullshit....” or something. Anyway thanks mods.

       I respectfully and wholeheartedly disagree. Shills are here. They're a plague. It shouldn't be a problem. At the very worst it's just calling someone a name. We're all adults here, so no big deal. At its best it's pointing out manipulation and the carrying forward of a narrative.

       Of course shills exist, but they are very hard to positively identify. For the most part, they are indistinguishable from useful idiots (which we could define as people who are shilling but who don't realise it).

       It's pretty tame, but virtually every single discussion in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would contain numerous shill accusations, if we didn't have a rule against it. Attributing bad faith for another person's comments - especially when you can't prove it - is a distraction and a conversation killer.

       I repeatedly get accused of being a shill or being a Russian Bot because i go out of my way to defend Russia and hit back on slide threads where Neocon shills attempt to blame Muh Russia again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't make me upset at all. I revel in being accused of being a shill. I wear that as a badge of honor!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of readers here would learn to toughen up and not be just like SJW cry babies who're constantly policing each other's "problematic" speech by lurking moar on /pol/. If you can last on /pol/, nothing anyone calls you will phase you. Hell, i've been trashed talked by mods there and banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just words. I'm more offended by not calling out an obvious shill as a shill, than i am about Mean Words. as long as i don't have to scroll through endless posts of spam, i don't care what anyone calls anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       back in the Golden Age Internet, it was implicitly understood that if you were intelligent enough to even be online, then you're intelligent enough to handle Adult Conversations and not need mods holding your hand and hugging you if you get a boo-boo from something you read.

       Forgive me for seeing irony in this comment even though you will have no idea what in talking about. But I really do see what you're getting at and I fully agree that there is a full blown war going on over the control of the mind.
