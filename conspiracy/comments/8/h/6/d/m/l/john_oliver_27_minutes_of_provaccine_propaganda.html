      </p>
      <p>
       thinking back, it seems that people like this guy is one of the reasons i quit watching TV in the first place. the canned-laughter-after-an-un-funny-joke routine gets old fast
      </p>
      <p>
       6:35 mentions Dr Wakefield's study
      </p>
      <p>
       7:00 "could not find evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism" (for some reason they must not have bothered to ask any of the multitude of parents who can give them example after example)
      </p>
      <p>
       7:10 "distorted the data" and "acted unethically", lost his medical license, Lancet paper retracted
      </p>
      <p>
       7:35 claims that the claim that vaccines cause autism has been debunked, in spite of the "debunking" existing merely of examples of people failing (on purpose) to find the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       7:45 ahh, so Wakefield talked to the Somalis in Minnesota. that explains how this particular "fake news" story came to be
      </p>
      <p>
       7:55 RFKjr, Alex Jones, Rob Schneider
      </p>
      <p>
       9:20, im not anti-vaccine, BUT
      </p>
      <p>
       10:20 rant about fish
      </p>
      <p>
       11:00 mercury in vaccines isn't the same kind of mercury as in fish. its organic mercury, which contrary to its hipster-sounding name, is not more safe than inorganic mercury
      </p>
      <p>
       11:05 no link between thimerosal and autism. notice how the narrative is constructed so as to be technically correct, but incredibly deceiving? they condition their statement by limiting it to thimerosal and MMR, which is but one ingredient among many, and one vaccine among many
      </p>
      <p>
       11:15 Thimerosal removed from childhood vaccines except flu
      </p>
      <p>
       11:50 why was Thimerosal taken out? (as a red herring, to draw attention away from Rubella and CRS/ASD)
      </p>
      <p>
       12:27 "proving a negative is an impossible standard" (yes, exactly Mr Oliver, that is why when you claim that studies prove that vaccines do not cause autism, we know you are lying, because no study could ever prove any such thing.)
      </p>
      <p>
       12:50 no evidence Dan Burton is not a donkey fucker. excellent point. i think his script writers really messed up by including this logic in his monologue, because it will come back to haunt him, as any vaccine debater has already figured out through hard earned experience)
      </p>
      <p>
       13:15 Seth Mnookin, a well documented propagandist
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Mnookin">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Mnookin
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "we are as positive an anyone can humanly be that there is no link"
      </p>
      <p>
       Mnookin is as confident in A as he is in B, because
      </p>
      <p>
       15:10 he can go on and on and it will never end. gee, i wonder why that is. other topics aren't quite as controversial. when was the last time you heard people debating whether Pluto was a planet or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       15:20 "coincidence" vaccines happen just before regression into autism
      </p>
      <p>
       15:28 "correlation is not causation" (standard vaccine shill talking point. this idea is so embedded into the "thinking" of vaccine cult victims that they are to the point where they automatically reject vaccine side effects, specifically because there is a correlation, as if they expect every causation to exist outside of any correlation
      </p>
      <p>
       15:34 "thats why scientific studies are for" (so the establishment gets to pick and choose which studies they want to bury or promote, and use their cherry-picked science to claim there is a consensus that vaccines are safe and effective, in spite of countless examples to the contrary)
      </p>
      <p>
       15:35 "the link is not there" (because the data were removed by the CDC)
      </p>
      <p>
       15:45 talking about how vaccines cause autism takes away resources from finding the actual cause(s) of autism. right. so in spite of the fact that the establishment has concluded that there is a scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause autism, and therefore have already (supposedly) been looking for other causes of autism. in spite of having many years to find alternative explanations, they have failed to do so. in the meantime, more and more parents witness their children regress into autism after a vaccine, and the establishment just points to their own "science" and says they can't find evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       15:59 Alison Singer, Autism Science Foundation
      </p>
      <p>
       16:14 "you have to say enough" (did she ever find out what caused her child's autism? studies show she is 99% more likely to deny vaccines caused her kids autism because then she would have to accept responsibility for the permanent brain damage her bad decisions have caused
      </p>
      <p>
       16:23 definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. but that didn't seem to stop the establishment from doing the same thing over and over and over... so why did they do it? so they can point at their pile of studies and say "we can't find evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       16:38 "memes aren't facts". (except when John Oliver delivers 27 minutes worth of pro-vaccine memes, presented as "comedy", but taken by vaccine cult victims literally
      </p>
      <p>
       16:55 parents ask to space out vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       17:09 Dr Bob Sears alternative vaccine schedule
      </p>
      <p>
       17:33 spacing vaccines sounds like it makes sense, but it doesn't because eating soap doesn't make sense
      </p>
      <p>
       17:46 too many too soon
      </p>
      <p>
       18:10 because children encounter thousands of naturally occurring antigens, its safe to inject vaccine ingredients into babies. because children are "fucking disgusting", its safe to inject vaccine ingredients into them
      </p>
      <p>
       18:35 "where is the published, peer reviewed evidence?" excellent question Mr Purple Tie Revolution, where is the published, peer reviewed evidence that the CDC's vaccine schedule is safe and effective?
      </p>
      <p>
       19:20 Oliver completely ignores Sears rationale, that spacing vaccines may help encourage parents who might not have otherwise vaccinated, and goes on to imply that by delaying a vaccine you are putting your child at risk of certain death
      </p>
      <p>
       19:50 "selective" vaccine schedule... can get vaccinated for measles at late as 10 years old
      </p>
      <p>
       20:00 vaccines do not cause autism, except when they do
      </p>
      <p>
       20:13 "opportunistic quacks" (isn't every doctor opportunistic?)
      </p>
      <p>
       20:30 the dangers of spacing vaccine are very real (memes aren't facts)
      </p>
      <p>
       20:35 CDC says children are at risk of getting disease entire time vaccines are delayed, and those diseases are dangerous
      </p>
      <p>
       20:47 Measles causes 134,000 deaths each year. So the people who are most concerned about the negative impact of human activity on earth, are the exact same people who want to "save" millions of lives through vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       21:08 "Herd Immunity; the more people who are vaccinated the harder it is for a disease to spread".
      </p>
      <p>
       21:25 Herd Immunity for Measles is around 95%
      </p>
      <p>
       21:30 Measles Herd Immunity drops, Measles outbreak in France.  "at least 6 people died" (hedged facts are fake facts)
      </p>
      <p>
       22:50 shill formula: not everyone can use vaccines, therefore everyone else must
      </p>
      <p>
       22:58 Rhett Krawitt, the grandson of a man involved with Glaxo Smith Kline. i wonder why they didn't disclose this fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       23:50 "newborns too young to be vaccinated". so on the one hand, a newborn baby is "old enough" to get a Hep B vaccine on the day they are born, and per 18:10 children can handle multiple vaccines, and "too many too soon" is a myth... why don't they give every vaccine to the baby on the day it is born?
      </p>
      <p>
       24:20 anchor yourself to what we know to be true about vaccines and autism "there is no link"
      </p>
      <p>
       24:30 other side effects happen less than 1 in a million.
      </p>
      <p>
       25:00 "non existant or wildly unlikely harms" (explains vaccine maker immunity from lawsuits)
      </p>
      <p>
       26:10 you may hear scary vaccine stories from other parents or on the internet, and its hard not to be terrified
      </p>
      <p>
       26:56 Oliver vaccinating his premature baby on schedule. not sure why he is delaying the full vaccination, per 21:35 he is putting his child at risk for diseases while he follows the vaccine schedule instead of stepping up the pace

       I didn’t say it kills. I said those that survive lead a lower quality of life. I know a guy whose parents didn’t believe in the vaccine. He’s a rich guy, but what’s the point when you have a clubbed foot and can’t walk more than 100m without needing s break.

       measles and chicken pox have been with us for many years, and have generally been considered mild childhood illnesses
      </p>
      <p>
       before the measles vaccine, over 95% of the population acquired measles naturally
      </p>
      <p>
       and the vast majority of the people had no long lasting ill effects
      </p>
      <p>
       they would have 'measles parties' to deliberately expose children who had not had measles before to child who had measles
      </p>
      <p>
       measles parties were considered safe, and since measles infection was nearly ubiquitous, measles parties provided a way to control the time and place of measles infections
      </p>
      <p>
       measles itself can be considered an essential part of developing the immune system, and growing up and being exposed to a lifetime of pathogens that will challenge the immune system
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately, children are not allowed to be exposed to natural measles anymore, and instead are subjected to MMR vaccines which have all sorts of ingredients that the immune system and body is not equipped to deal with

       yes, measles has always been a mild infection, and it wasn't hyped as a death sentence until after the vaccine was invented and needed a sales pitch

      <p>
       today autism is much more prevalent than measles, probably due to widespread vaccinations with MMR

       Really all you do is fling shit. I don’t want to prove it because you won’t understand it. You say I can’t think when in fact it is the other way round. Look around and see what sort of people are in your camp. That is a good indication of what your think is is. My thinking? I get paid handsomely for every hour of my consulting, that’s the company I keep. You have lost the ability to see straight. All you see is crooked lies and conspiracy. Like some religious nut job who thinks god is everywhere and such. No proof, but tries to shout the other guy down with ‘hurr durr I’m so intelligent I can go against conventional wisdom’.

      <p>
       the so-called 'red-shift' you assume you are measuring is not the same as the pitch-changing sound you hear when an ambulance overtakes you on the road
      </p>
      <p>
       in your expanding universe theory, everything is moving away from everything else, at the speed of the Hubble Constant (H)
      </p>
      <p>
       so we assume we know the frequency of a certain stars light, and when measured that frequency is not what we expect, or its more red than we expect, we jump to the conclusion that the star must be moving away from us!
      </p>
      <p>
       and when every star we measure has this inexplicable red-shift, we conclude that every star must be moving away from every other star...
      </p>
      <p>
       and when you try to find out just how fast these stars are supposedly moving, which is H the Hubble Constant, you will not find any satisfactory answer, but only vague extrapolations based on absurd assumptions
      </p>
      <p>
       suffice it to say, if you try to find the speed of H, you will discover that the answer is H approaches C, aka the Cosmological Constant aka The Speed of Light
      </p>
      <p>
       so in your expanding universe theory, the universe is expanding at the speed of light
      </p>
      <p>
       H=&gt;C
      </p>
      <p>
       now, lets assume that its true that the universe is expanding at H = C
      </p>
      <p>
       would that explain why, when you put more energy into a photon, the photon will change its frequency, but it will not change its speed?
      </p>
      <p>
       is it because as the speed of the photon exceeds C , it also exceeds H, which means the photon travels into anti-time aka -t
      </p>
      <p>
       and this fluctuation of the photon between time and anti-time is what we measure as frequency and see as light
      </p>
      <p>
       or maybe the earth really is the center of creation, right on Mt Zion like the bible says

       I believe the universe is expanding. You believe in anti-time?? Because you are really not clear what your stance is. And my belief has actual evidence. Not made up evidence like that measles chart which does not match anything I can search on the internet. Geez, you can dismiss anything as ‘casual’. You guys need to win the nobel price for rediscovering ‘science’. I find it highly amusing you think I am from the Hilary camp when there is nothing about our discussion that related to her. I was specifically referring to your ability to dismiss anything that is well documented and search for only half baked garbage. People like you aren’t conspiracy theorists. You guys are conspiratards. Where instead of finding s conspiracy like improperly tested vaccination schedules, or chemicals, you guys question vaccination itself. Geez. Couple generations down from you, you guys will worship electric cables because of the magic of electricity or something. Lol.

       Lol. Google measles infection rate. See and if the dozens of charts dumbass. I encourage you to actually use the internet to educate yourself rather than hang out with nutjobs. You are really really a piece of work if you think a of science is a conspiracy. So wired to feeding on bullshit you are, that you feel there is a conspiracy where there need not be one, for example, what effect to daily life is there whether space expands or not? Measures experiments have observed it expands, what’s so hard about accepting it? Instead you call all the observations bullshit and believe earth is the centre of the universe, anti-time and all other PROVABLE bullshit, which no self respecting scientist or college expounds. Why? Why do you have to be against such frivolous things? Because it’s your nature. That’s why. You can’t help but be this because your identity is linked to being the dumbass conspiratard that talks bullshit about innocuous things. So no, I’m not you. My identity is not linked to crying wolf for every thing. But it is linked to thinking for myself and building upon other works that are acceptable to me, and can be replicated.  You say replication. Replicate the proof the earth is the centre of the universe?? That’s there is anti-time?? You got nobels waiting for you buddy, if you do any of the two. BUT YOU CANT, because all you can do is regurgitate half baked occult bullshit. I know types like you, liberal and conservative. Being your brand of retard has nothing to do with politics. 
All you do is say ‘established facts are not facts because I say so. And if anyone says access the easily accessible data I’m gonna our my fingers in my ears and shout LALALALA’. That’s your call. And it’s successful in echo chambers of conspiratards. Just don’t convert this gold sub into one of them.

       Yep figured out how to cure cancer, not. Figured out how to cure heart disease, not. Figured out how to cure autism, not. Seems like disease whack-a-mole to me. For every "cure" modern medicine comes out with 5 more diseases rise to take it's place.

       It's simple, fewer toxins in the body, work must be done to remove toxins. Staying regular and well hydrated is something most people don't do, they eat shit(junk food), bathe in harmful radiation, have poor posture so their circulation is shit, are overloaded with stress, and binge on more junk food. The food they eat(when they go out to eat) is laced with rancid oil which produce free radicals. And instead of actively seeking to improve, these same people succumb to convenience and elect to mask their symptoms with designer poisons which numb them to the signals of the body.

       We have poor health habits and our health statistics reflect this.

       Yes 35% effective is a horrible metric, it's even worse for the vaccine as 35% is the upper limit of it's effectiveness and it goes down on every subsequent shot. So
       <strong>
        at least
       </strong>
       65% of people who take the vaccine will find it completely useless, possibly more. That's complete shit, who the fuck wants to buy shit that only works 1/3rd of the time. Who would buy that? It's like buying a car that only starts 1/3rd of the time at best, or a door that only opens 1/3rd of the time. Just useless and pathetic like someone I'm talking to.

       No, anatomy and physiology is not “simple”. You have a very simple, very uneducated understanding of personal health.  Nothing you’re saying is based on real knowledge, I would bet money that 100% of your sources are jusg personal anecdotes from random individuals on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should educate yourself.  Not only that, you should place more stock in self-doubt because you’re nowhere near being informed on these issues.  Learn to verify your sources, look for proof of concept, and don’t trust random assholes peddling too-good-to-be-true stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all that bullshit about “toxins” in your body is jusg new-age hippie bullshit.

         If you work with cars then that enables you to talk about cars.  If I had a car question I would defer to your experience.  Since you haven’t studied anatomy or medicine for 25 years I imagine you don’t know as much about the body as cars.  That’s fine, just, don’t get so pissy about it when someone corrects you.  Just say “oh shit I was wrong, this is a good opportunity for me to learn something f and better myself.”

You didn't even know what cortisol was, you're exposed, go learn something so that maybe some day you can make more convincing bullshit.

        High Cortisol Symptoms
The symptoms of too much cortisol develop gradually and mostly overlap with many other conditions and include[1-3]:
Depression
Fatigue
Weight gain, especially in the face, upper back (“buffalo hump”), and torso
Obesity, especially abdominal obesity/central obesity
Back pain
Thin skin
Decreased concentration
Swelling in the hands and feet
Low libido
Acne
Impaired memory (especially short term)
Female facial hair or female balding
Insomnia
Poor skin healing
Irritability
Menstrual abnormalities
Blood sugar dysregulation/high blood sugar
Decreased bone mineral density
High blood pressure
Easy bruising
Muscle wasting and weakness of arms and legs
Reddish purple streaks on skin
What Causes High Cortisol Symptoms?
Rarely, having too much cortisol is caused by Cushing disease—a hormone-secreting tumor of the adrenal gland. More often, however, high cortisol is caused by prescription corticosteroid medications (including corticosteroid injections into the joints).[4]
Even more commonly, too much cortisol is caused by chronic stress. Chronic stress dysregulates the body’s stress response system (the hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis). The HPA axis is a critical physiological system that mediates responses to all types of physical and psychological stress. When that stress is chronic, the delicate feedback system that is the HPA axis becomes damaged.[5] This can result in chronically high cortisol levels and lead to high cortisol symptoms.
Certain conditions are well known to cause the types of chronic physical and psychological stress that damage the HPA axis and lead to high cortisol levels. These conditions, which are often associated with high cortisol symptoms, include[6]:
Depression
Panic disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder
Anorexia nervosa
Bulimia nervosa
Alcoholism
Diabetes mellitus
Severe obesity
Metabolic syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
Shift work
End-stage kidney disease
Major life stressors
Chronic pain

       When did this come up? You claimed that oxygen was a toxin, meaning it is created by living creatures. Oxidation chemistry is a bit later on in the course called 'very basic science discovered since 19th century' you're doing poorly in.

       It's just our nature to age and destruct. Oxygen is my personal theory. Gives us life but also destroys it. Oxygen is highly flammable. It's in our water. It's toxic when combined with carbon. It rusts iron. Oxygen giveth and taketh away.

       Oxygen is highly reactive, and is involved in our metabolism. Free O2 is actually considered a radical species, and why anti-oxidants like berries and teas are good for you. Not only do they have fiber to keep you pooping but the anti-oxidants keep you from over oxidizing.

       Cancer is the body poisoning itself with uncontrolled reproduction. It's caused by damaged DNA. The ignorance of you trolls is staggering.

       Like the flu vaccine? A thousand new strains every year, they take the top two and mix them together and hope it doesn't mutate too much to make it irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet every year a shitton of people get the flu.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not so sure I would say avoid your polio vaccination...but certainly some of this shit is just big pharma being big pharma and I would think it prudent to be wary. To just stick yourself with whatever cocktails they are making in their basement taking their words for it is more than a little stupid consider their track record.

       My dad remembers when people used to die all the time from Polio. He even had friends who were crippled of life because they caught it as a kid.

      <p>
       So no, this isn't accurate.

       The reason Polio is such a great vaccine is because the guy who invented it gave it away for free. No big pharma involvement whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I don't trust the flu vaccine is because the flu is too mutagenic and I don't trust big pharma to have any goal other than to try and make as much money as possible. If someone paid them enough to fuck up their vaccines to kill people, I would expect them to do that (as long as they were paid enough ie: if they do get caught than the legal fees would be far less than the extra money they made kind of calculation).

       We'll never be perfect and I think that's an admission missing from healthcare debates all the time. Like you said, a government would have to restrict available treatments just like private healthcare does because neither system has unlimited funds.

       That female is a clown because the ~50,000 dead Americans in Vietnam constituted a very, very small proportion of men in the US. Kill a thousand men and if theres one left he can fuck his way through 50 women a week. Post industrial societies are the perfect population control because birth rates always slow; Japan is in a birth crisis right now because WWII shook their etch a sketch hard and pushed them to modernization in a huge way
      </p>
      <p>
       My limited understanding of the Vietnam war: it was a proxy war sold as "domino effect" to the us public. Its real purpose was fighting USSR and funneling billions into the military industrial complex. War makes certain people super fuckin rich, just like Bush Jr helping his friends and neocons with wars in the middle east.

       Have you ever looked into the death rates from any of the normal childhood diseases in North America from 1900 to the present?
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you aware that as ordinary sanitation and the standard of living improved with children simply being better looked after when they contracted one that they all went steady down well BEFORE there were any vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that despite all of the vaccines that have come along since they've been steadily introduced that there's actually been no appreciable change in those rates at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what a "true vaccine" like the one for small-pox was? Were you aware that it was simply a skin scratch that contained ordinary cow-pox that is a distant relative of small-pox that actually produced the immunity to it? That there was nothing synthetic or artificial about it, no toxic metals or poisons like formaldehyde in that skin scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
       No dead monkey or chicken tissue, DNA, and unknown viruses common to them but not to humans that the vast majority of those that have been introduced have all been cultivated in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how rare and completely unknown it is for anyone to have more than one disease at a time? Is it so difficult for you to understand that that the increased number and an combinations of them can actually "confuse" the immune system and how it functions?
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, do you honestly think that all the so called experts involved in the vaccine industry whose work is soley dedicated to maximizing the profits of the companies they work for and not human health aren't fully aware of all that?

       Ahhh ok. Old times were the best. Child mortality was the same then and now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you Amish or are you purposely turning your back to science? I can understand if you are Amish, but you are a dumb fuck if you turn your back to science. Kiddo, CHILD MORTALITY FELL A TON around the world in the last 100 years. Babies that didn’t stand a chance, that died at childbirth, or shortly thereafter, life full and productive lives today. Google it, it’s not that hard. When children died, almost always there wasn’t a technically accurate reason. They just got buried. My niece died to sepsis because she has underlying genetic defect in glycosylation. Even a couple of fucking decades ago no one would have known why the fuck she died. A retired head of pedriatic department suggested just feed orange juice and regular food and all will be well. He was fucking wrong because his knowledge was outdated. 
Just because you are a simpleton doesn’t mean the world is simple. 
Why don’t you revert to simple techniques of homemade remedies and drink your own piss every morning(ppl actually do this btw). It boosts the immune system and you will be fine. Don’t need no vaccines or modern medicine for the likes of you. Too bad you wouldn’t be interested in k owing about the lives of polio survivors who are hobbled and in intense pain from a young childhood. It didn’t happen to you, so probably it doesn’t exist.

       Now 3.3 billion dollars has been paid out to families with children who have been permanently injured by vaccines they received and there was no doubt whatsoever about those vaccines being the direct cause of those debilitating injuries to what were otherwise normal and healthy children before that happened to them. "It didn't happen to you, so probably it doesn't exist." you smarmy little weasel.

       There's a causal connection between mercury and aluminum in vaccines and the rapid rise in autism in children and early onset dementia in adults with both of those groups in particular being pushed to get the flu shot every year despite how ineffectual they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the recent outbreaks of measles and mumps that been reported have occurred not in any unvaccinated individuals but in ones that all had been inoculated against them just for good measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also had a longer and more difficult recovery than anyone who isn't vaccinated at all typically encounters with those diseases and who actually will be permanently immune from ever getting them again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more you look the more questions and doubts that continually arise concerning vaccine efficacy and safety and there is a concerted and well organised effort to try to cover-up and deny that there are any real dangers or real problems due to them. There are all kinds of them and they are growing worse by the day.

       There are all kinds of things you can eat that won't harm you in any way but will kill you deader than doornail if you ever injected directly into your bloodstream. It's a false and disingenuous argument that seeks to deceive people into thinking the danger is on the same level. It isn't. It's countless times more dangerous when it comes any toxic substances.

       I wasn't specifically referring to vaccines merely pointing out a straightforward fact you don't seem to want to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you can swallow (ingest) snake venom and provided that you have no open cuts or lesions in your mouth you won't come to any harm otherwise you'll get seriously poisoned.  The same thing applies to any minor cut or wound you might get that venom in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't be necessary to have this point raised if we weren't talking about the known "poisons" in vaccines being compared to levels of them that can be safely ingested and not getting them directly under the skin and rupturing tissues and blood vessels in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ingesting a toxic substance like that is a very different thing from getting it under your skin and they aren't the same thing.

      <p>
       OK, so tell me what the safe level of ingestion is for the specific poisonous substances within vaccines you have in mind. You're kinda just rambling off your rocker at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are groping blindly around a valid point, that how you encounter something can impact toxicity, but none of this has legs on its own. Pick an ingredient, tell me what level it is safe to eat it at and then tell me what level it is safe to have injected in your deltoid.

Potential Chronic Health Effects: CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. MUTAGENIC EFFECTS: Mutagenic for mammalian somatic cells. TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Not available. DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY: Not available. The substance may be toxic to kidneys, liver, spleen, bone marrow, central nervous system (CNS). Repeated or prolonged exposure to the substance can produce target organs damage. Repeated exposure to a highly toxic material may produce general deterioration of health by an accumulation in one or many human organs.

       Well you encounter poison all the time. That's precisely why you have a liver and kidneys. If you want to be a weird puritan and ignore the basis of toxicology (dose makes the poison) that's great. You can do that.

       You haven't made any points, ignorance about nutrition and physical health will hurt you in the long run and taking vaccines won't fix that. In fact vaccines have a lot of poisons no sane person would willingly take.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's a good idea to willingly take poisons that have low % of effectiveness on the hopes I won't catch a mild disease that I should be able to fight off with a healthy immune system.

       That's cool. You can do that. I wouldn't recommend
       <em>
        you

       get the vaccine, or me. But if you were a country with a low quality of life where the chance of you living where a minute component of 0.5mL vaccine is an issue, then that obviously changes the risk-reward equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the contents of these and other vaccines will not have any impact on your health. The beer I had yesterday is worse for me than getting any vaccine.

       The person you replied to made a pretty reasonable argument. Whether you agree with it or not, he lays it all out and is being rational about it. Is it right or wrong? That's a good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your reply that is just full of insults and idiotic suggestions is the biggest red flag that you are arguing from a point of complete ignorance and forming your arguments completely from emotions. It is very clear that you are not someone who thinks.

       You are stupid is what you are. There are enough specialisations to be able to precisely address your point. But you don’t  understand that. I have every right from now on to call you a dick and an asshole since your blood flows in all those regions. Lol you so stupid, it’s funny!
Your explanation tho.. that makes it even more funny!!

       This is what I worked on back in 2003, I went into engineering after that. Today, I do work in combustion chemistry particularly in modeling radical species propagation, and internal combustion engine thermodynamics, specifically running LES CFD. Before that I did a lot of validations engineering for NOAA equipment, I learned a lot of thermodynamics and aerodynamics there. My real passion is cars though, I own my own shop and build and tune them. I also do independent contracting for major manufacturers, mostly in motor sports.

       Congrats. Even harder to explain your apparent lack of belief in evidence based research. It boggles my mind you believe in F=ma but not in antibiotics or evidence based success of vaccination. That they have made life better. 
You are not god to decide who lives or who dies. To let ‘nature’ take its own course. Even one life you can save, is a life you MUST save. Those principles lead us to a beefed tomorrow for our children.

       I’m not interested in your treatise in why F=ma is such an approximation. If you feel saving someone’s life, by medical advances, is such a stretch, it’s on you. Humanity is what separates us from animals, not that I expect you to understand. 
You can be good at one thing, it does not make you automatically an expert at every other thing. Have the humility and put in the effort to understand before forming opinions. If you would have said vaccination industry is milking humans for money, like other industries, I would have been on your side. But saying there is no need to treat humans and let the strong ones survive, is fucked up and stupid thing to say.

       Medical advances, hahahaha. The only medical advances are in robotics and lasers for surgery, and material advances. Medicine has improved only because computers have improved but the philosophy behind western medicine is just a bastardized version of eastern medicine. Innoculation wasn't even invented in the west, it was something they were doing in India circa 2,000B.C.

       But now eugenicist Bill Gates spread his bullshit polio vaccine and ended up crippling almost half a million kids. Of course they just label it "non-polio acute paralysis" because there's no chance it was the polio vaccine. Despite wild polio being prevalent and acute flaccid paralysis was almost non-existent before the eugenicist brought his poisons.

       I don’t see much sense in continuing this discussion now. You want to say anything that has a semblance of sense and fling it at me, sometimes you refuse correlation and causation, sometimes your argument is built entirely in correlation and causation. You think for yourself and decide the course you are on, is it by your guys or by your brains, and the type of people you find in your corner, are they talking by their guts or by their brains. I never said and never will say vaccination is safe. But I will not justify killing some ppl for my own version of purity of humankind (the sort that doesn’t live in the gutter, evidently)

       Further, even basic research will show you vaccinations have worked. Across the world. And diseases have nothing to do with standards of living. They affect everyone. You don’t see much in the West because the standards you mock, keep you from the rest of the world. Lose it, and you are no different from the other parts for the world.

       Vaccines prevent illnesses and deaths. Take a gander at the sequelae of measles, polio, diptheria, and so on and then come back and chide us about death rates. People on a ventilator aren't dead from polio but, damn, they're still on a ventilator.

       No thank you. Unsubstantiated claims like all is hunky in a world without vaccines, is enough out of you. I lived in a childhood of people scarred with diseases we didn’t vaccinate against. Maybe the gullible will believe you, but I’ve seen what smallpox and polio can do, and I am glad they are no longer amongst us the same way they were earlier.

        Symptoms
Most people who get infected with poliovirus (about 72 out of 100) will not have any visible symptoms.
About 1 out of 4 people with poliovirus infection will have flu-like symptoms that may include—
Sore throat
Fever
Tiredness
Nausea
Headache
Stomach pain
These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days then go away on their own.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ok so 74% of people show no symptoms 25% show mild flu like symptoms that go away on their own after a few days. Out of that 1% who experience serious symptoms only 1 in 200 become paralyzed. So one in 200 out of 1% of people with polio will have any serious side effects. More people are born with microcephaly yearly.

       Stop, just stop with the fables and bullshit, save that for someone like you. I'm better than you, your weakness doesn't affect me at all.

       You saying you are ok with a small fraction of proper being disabled or dead from polio reflects on you more than it does on me. Not just polio, what about measles, smallpox, and other diseases?? What changed, Einstein, that cause childhood mortality to drop so much in the last 100 years?? Really, you are either ignorant or suppressing the fact that vaccines ACTUALLY saved lives. Tell me lives are not worth saving, and we can discuss that. There is no way any proper study will shot vaccinations did not reduce mortality rates around the world. Unless you like quoting hacks or your whacky uncle bob or something.

       Lives are only worth saving because pharmaceutical companies can't collect money from dead people.

       As far as what people dying means to me, sucks, but what are you gonna do. If you want to live in filth and eat shit, and not take care of your body, I can't feel bad for you if you die from easily preventable diseases. You made your bed, now sleep in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't feel bad for people who spent all their time partying doing drugs and making bad health choices. They did that all on their own, and since no one listens to me anyway I'd be wasting my breath. All I can do is be the change I want to see.

       Because people

       die from Measles- almost 160 million people worldwide in 2011, for example. Who was the last person who died from Autism?

       right, and if those people had not died of measles, they likely would have lived a horrible life of poor heath due to a dysfunctional immune system.

       My two sons (1 and 3) were both vaccinated.  I am not against vaccination, but I think the schedule that is imposed is too early.  This is my own personal observation, but my oldest son was developing normally, then he had his vaccinations and soon after started having difficulties with speech, comprehension and delayed walking.  He was behind other kids by about 6 months to a year.    My youngest son, we delayed his vaccine schedule by about 6 months, even though we received reminders to have vaccinated.   So long story short, in my personal opinion, it’s not a good idea to inject vaccines into a baby who’s brain is still developing.  Delay the vaccination schedule if you can.

       Bad idea.  Do NOT delay vaccinations.  Vaccines prevent highly-contagious diseases from doing permanent damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts - your baby was going to develop those speech issues regardless of whether or not he was vaccinated.  The only reason you think the vaccines caused the issue is timing - he just happened to develop the issue after getting vaccinated.  This is why people used to think certain vaccines caused autism, the timing.  They would give these kids a vaccine right before the first signs of autism become apparent, so, they drew a false conclusion based on timing.

       Thing is, all the kids you're comparing him to also had vaccines. Yeah, we can follow the thread it's vaccines, but what about the myriad of other things? Why should parents look at your comment as a glimpse into what to do with respect to vaccines? It's a tough pill to swallow but the connection you've made in your mind with vaccines and your son is not necessarily the truth. And there's a lot of science out there that disagrees. Your son may be delayed developmentally, but he was dealt the best defense he can get for a host of pathogens he never had to deal with. I know several autistic people and while, of course, it's a spectrum, autism is hardly a nightmare on its own. When you cut down the big killers the only thing left looks like a giant.

       Propaganda? No. This seems like propaganda to you because you don’t understand it. Rather than try to educate yourself you’re using your lack of education to justify rejecting these FACTS.  Let me show you an example of what I mean:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7:00 "could not find evidence that the MMR vaccine causes autism" (for some reason they must not have bothered to ask any of the multitude of parents who can give them example after example)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, this means that a study of vaccinated and non-vaccinated children could not prove a link between vaccines and autism. How did they come to this conclusion? They probably studied hundreds, maybe thousands of children, they counted how many kids were normal and how many kids were autistic, and there wasn’t enough evidence to say “vaccines increase your chance of autism”.  That means the autism rates in vaccinated and non-vaccinated children were so close that they couldn’t draw any conclusions from the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let’s talk about what you just said, and why your criticism here means nothing.  When you say “they must not have bothered to ask any of the multitude of parents who can give them example after example,” what exactly are you saying? Are you suggesting that individual parents who BELIEVE (but have no proof) their child became autistic from vaccines are more reputable than the doctors and scientists who spent years studying this?  How many THOUSANDS of children do they have to include in their study before you find their correlations believable?  Why do you trust random schmucks more than educated medical professionals?

       Genuine autism is and was "congenital", meaning the children afflicted by it were born that way and it was believed to be caused by some genetic anomaly that afflicted about 1 in every 10,000 children, up until very recently, that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have now and that is being called "autism" for convenience sake and to deliberately confuse this issue is more and more children who were born perfectly healthy and developing normally, some as old as six, suddenly starting to regress with a loss of motor skills, the ability to talk and within a matter of months display all of the same symptoms as the children who were actually born with autism that is affecting more and more children all of the time. At least 1 out of every 150 children and getting steadily worse. A crisis of huge proportions by comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       This steadily increasing number of children not born with it but afflicted by a condition
       <em>
        from some exterior source
       </em>
       that produces a condition virtually identical to it directly coincides with the ever expanding number of vaccines being mandated and given to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines that are known to contain "neurotoxins" that will invariably damage some part of anyone's nervous system including the brain that is almost completely composed of nervous tissue.
      </p>
      <p>
       There can be very little doubt that what has happened to those children is not only a completely new phenomenon that is steadily increasing but that the incidence of it has grown apace with the ever expanding vaccine schedule. It's too big of a coincidence for anyone to be in a state of denial especially when the CDC itself has admitted in documents made public that the neurotoxins in the vaccines risk reducing any child's IQ by at least 10 points due to the damage they cause, which they considered to be "worth it" for the immunity they believe the vaccines provide.

       None of that is true.  You show me one source that claims a child went through normal development until 6 years of age and I’ll show you how that source is biased or just wrong.  Autism symptoms usually show up before 2 years of age.

       Do I need to bother going through the rest of your completely uninformed post?  You seem to be making shit up left and right.  I honestly don’t know how to have a conversation with someone who doesn’t use facts to inform their opinion.

       Children that never developed normally right from the very get-go. That's "autism" and what has historically been called autism until only very recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no such thing as any normal and healthy child rapidly and suddenly losing all the developmental skills they'd already acquired during the first six years of life in the medical records prior to the last fifty years.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are, however, plenty of accounts in the prior medical literature of poisoning with toxic metals and chemicals that have done just that to any number of children and adults as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is no explanation being officially offered besides referring to these other cases as "autism" and including a wide range of such rapid onset neurological disorders and claiming that they must somehow be genetic in their origins although there is still no definitive genetic cause that is know even for the children that are actually born that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about neurological damage here often with high concentrations of aluminum in the hair samples of these so-called other late developing autism cases just as high concentrations of aluminum have been found in the brains of Alzheimer's victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are also seeing an inordinate number of dementia and Alzheimer's cases appearing among adults in their 50's and 60's as well as older seniors while "senility" which is what those symptoms were previously described as was a relatively rare thing and happened mainly to people in their late 70's and beyond simply due to their age and the general physical decline that comes with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you want to do some homework instead of being a completely biased critic trusting a profit driven system that has manufactured and prescribed all kinds of drugs that had to be stopped and withdrawn from the market due to the inordinate amount of harm they did to people in too many cases to count, that's tor affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to do something useful go look-up the toxicology on mercury, aluminum, and formaldehyde for openers and what the results of being poisoned by them are. From there you can procede to check the other ingredients in them as well.

       Autism can't be diagnosed in newborns.  The first symptoms of autism (delayed speech, developmental issues, etc.) can appear around 1.5 years.  In a newborn, the only way to prove they have an autism spectrum disorder is to dissect the brain postmortem because autistic brains develop differently during pregnancy.

       Yeah we're still working on determining if it's a genetic component that gets activate during pregnancy, or if it's the result of some type of exposure to something during pregnancy, etc. we're studying shit that happens during pregnancy and fetal development, not after birth, because autism is something that happens to you during fetal development.

        We're talking about neurological damage here often with high concentrations of aluminum in the hair samples of these so-called other late developing autism cases just as high concentrations of aluminum have been found in the brains of Alzheimer's victims.

        We are also seeing an inordinate number of dementia and Alzheimer's cases appearing among adults in their 50's and 60's as well as older seniors while "senility" which is what those symptoms were previously described as was a relatively rare thing and happened mainly to people in their late 70's and beyond simply due to their age and the general physical decline that comes with it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is likely due to the increase in senior population.  Our healthcare is better than ever, people live to be older, so we have more senile people in general.

       I don't watch John Oliver but I am very pro vaccine. You are suggesting people take anecdotal evidence as fact and thst found trump actual evidence. I firmly believe in the science of vaccinations and also become their is a huge disinformation campaign being waged against the same kind of people who resist this sub as well as smaller and religious communities. It's pointless arguing the science of vaccinations because they have already been said a thousand times over. The antivaxors are nit only holding humanity back but always risking the lives of everyone around them. It's not about YOU. It's about everyone you can infect that fire some reason are unable to get vaccinated due to circumstances instead of by choice. Your selfish choice could cause their misfortune. But you don't care. Somebody told you that it causes autism so better safe than sorry right? God forbid churches denounce vaccinations in small towns and oddly enough whooping cough outbreaks occur but lord all mighty somebody told them vaccinations give people autism. Can all those children who have to suffer and potentially die due to an entire communities negligence. This very subject pisses me off but you know what really jerks my chain?? Selfish people like yourself who continue to spread this backwards campaign of misinformation and anti science. It truly is shameful.

       There are these guys who pan handle at street corners with signs saying how they are poor and homeless and need money. If you pass by that spot every day you will also see them doing drug deals with each other and buying packs of smokes, tim hortons coffees every morning, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put shills a few rungs lower than these people and assume they also need to feed a bad drug addiction so they've thrown their morals and humanity out the window to accomplish this. Maybe one day with some therapy and a lot of self reflection they can move up and become pan handlers.

       Were you aware that as ordinary sanitation and the standard of living improved with children simply being better looked after when they contracted one that they all went steady down well BEFORE there were any vaccines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that despite all of the vaccines that have come along since they've been steadily introduced that there's actually been no appreciable change in those rates at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what a "true vaccine" like the one for small-pox was? Were you aware that it was simply a skin scratch that contained ordinary cow-pox that is a distant relative of small-pox that actually produced the immunity to it? That there was nothing synthetic or artificial about it, no toxic metals or poisons like formaldehyde in that skin scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
       No dead monkey or chicken tissue, DNA, and unknown viruses common to them but not to humans that the vast majority of those that have been introduced have all been cultivated in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how rare and completely unknown it is for anyone to have more than one disease at a time? Is it so difficult for you to understand that that the increased number and an combinations of them can actually "confuse" the immune system and how it functions?
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, do you honestly think that all the so called experts involved in the vaccine industry whose work is soley dedicated to maximizing the profits of the companies they work for and not human health aren't fully aware of all that?

        High Cortisol Symptoms
The symptoms of too much cortisol develop gradually and mostly overlap with many other conditions and include[1-3]:
Depression
Fatigue
Weight gain, especially in the face, upper back (“buffalo hump”), and torso
Obesity, especially abdominal obesity/central obesity
Back pain
Thin skin
Decreased concentration
Swelling in the hands and feet
Low libido
Acne
Impaired memory (especially short term)
Female facial hair or female balding
Insomnia
Poor skin healing
Irritability
Menstrual abnormalities
Blood sugar dysregulation/high blood sugar
Decreased bone mineral density
High blood pressure
Easy bruising
Muscle wasting and weakness of arms and legs
Reddish purple streaks on skin
What Causes High Cortisol Symptoms?
Rarely, having too much cortisol is caused by Cushing disease—a hormone-secreting tumor of the adrenal gland. More often, however, high cortisol is caused by prescription corticosteroid medications (including corticosteroid injections into the joints).[4]
Even more commonly, too much cortisol is caused by chronic stress. Chronic stress dysregulates the body’s stress response system (the hypothalamic–pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis). The HPA axis is a critical physiological system that mediates responses to all types of physical and psychological stress. When that stress is chronic, the delicate feedback system that is the HPA axis becomes damaged.[5] This can result in chronically high cortisol levels and lead to high cortisol symptoms.
Certain conditions are well known to cause the types of chronic physical and psychological stress that damage the HPA axis and lead to high cortisol levels. These conditions, which are often associated with high cortisol symptoms, include[6]:
Depression
Panic disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder
Posttraumatic stress disorder
Anorexia nervosa
Bulimia nervosa
Alcoholism
Diabetes mellitus
Severe obesity
Metabolic syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
Shift work
End-stage kidney disease
Major life stressors
Chronic pain

       My dad remembers when people used to die all the time from Polio. He even had friends who were crippled of life because they caught it as a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, this isn't accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Polio is such a great vaccine is because the guy who invented it gave it away for free. No big pharma involvement whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I don't trust the flu vaccine is because the flu is too mutagenic and I don't trust big pharma to have any goal other than to try and make as much money as possible. If someone paid them enough to fuck up their vaccines to kill people, I would expect them to do that (as long as they were paid enough ie: if they do get caught than the legal fees would be far less than the extra money they made kind of calculation).

       This is what I worked on back in 2003, I went into engineering after that. Today, I do work in combustion chemistry particularly in modeling radical species propagation, and internal combustion engine thermodynamics, specifically running LES CFD. Before that I did a lot of validations engineering for NOAA equipment, I learned a lot of thermodynamics and aerodynamics there. My real passion is cars though, I own my own shop and build and tune them. I also do independent contracting for major manufacturers, mostly in motor sports.

       correct, polio was not as bad as the establishment hyped it to be
      </p>
      <p>
       kinda like those WMDs that were used to sell a war
      </p>
      <p>
       vaccines literally cause idiots. i would strongly suggest you lay off the vaccines, lest your brain damage becomes even worse CPTSD

       logic says that injecting aluminum, mercury, peanut oil and DNA into a baby is not preventative health care, its child abuse

       but, since your brain has already been addled by vaccines, i don't expect you to understand this

       there is absolutely no evidence that the small pox vaccine eradicated pox.

       you know what actually eradicated small pox?
      </p>
      <p>
       my prayers!
      </p>
      <p>
       theres as much evidence that my prayers eradicated small pox as there is that the small pox vaccine eradicated small pox

      <p>
       before Rubella vaccination, autism was caused by the highly unlikely chin of events whereby a pregnant woman was infected by Rubella, and her child went on to develop CRS, and then went on to develop ASD
      </p>
      <p>
       today, we bypass the natural but highly unlikely Rubella-CRS route, and instead go with the more common, man-made route and induce ASD directly with MMR vaccine

       you obviously do not know anything about vaccines, or the side effects of vaccines

       you obviously do not know anything about the DSM either

       perhaps you should keep your mouth shut until you understand what you are talking about?

       if you would bother to do some real research into the criticisms of vaccines, you'd be amazed at the amount of quackery and fraud you'd find
      </p>
      <p>
       everything you think you know about vaccines came from consuming unsolicited vaccine propaganda
