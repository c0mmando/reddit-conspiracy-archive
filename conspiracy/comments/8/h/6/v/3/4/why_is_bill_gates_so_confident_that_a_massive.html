       No, I just assumed that someone talking about the Zika virus would know even a tiny bit about it. It was first isolated around 1950 in Ugandan monkeys and mosquitoes, first human infection was in 52, and ever since then it has slowly spread around the world, most notably in Micronesia in 07, Oceania in 13, and South America in 2015. This was the most severe outbreak and new evidence suggested it was likely linked to microcephaly. After being in South America it spread to Florida and other southern States. There is not anything suspicious about it, I've work with biology and pathology for a living, this outbreak wasn't even that spectacular. It's any season now until we have an actual influenza season, or avian flu outbreak, or anything like that.

       That's an interesting way to look at it, does this law only affect homosexuals and men though? how many guys are going to ask a girl if she will get an STD screen to be sure and expect her to stick around.

       Really? guess its just something that doesn't come up much in Canada as much as a public topic though I agree on responsibility and maintaining a level head, I am 24 and this tindr/grindr/whatever generation just scares the hell out of me in terms of them taking any personal responsibility

       Not all stances an individual takes is personal, it should be logical. Specially in regards to the laws of our country. If that weren't the case, ya I wouldn't give a shit, since I'm married. However, it's having the good of others in your motives and not only caring about yourself.

       But I bet I'll get some snobby ass remark back from you.

       This thread is a mess. The real reason for the legal change is specifically to stop the spread of HIV. Previously they either broke the law by keeping quiet or had to tell their partners every time. When faced with that, people would rather doubt that they have it and just not get tested.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new law lowers the penalty to encourage individuals to get tested and get treated, which greatly helps reduce the rate of HIV.

       Lol housing goes up because of illegals? Minimum wage has been increased state wide and will 15 an HR by 2020 that alone will make housing costs increase.

      <p>
       Yes, if you actually have common sense when there is more demand and limited supply, rent prices go up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets take it a step further though. When there is more demand for housing (apartments, condos, and houses), it makes INVESTORS REALLY FUCKING INTERESTED and they drive prices up even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       They really don't teach shit in schools anymore if you don't understand the most basic concepts.

       Yes, paying rejects and losers too much money that they don't deserve makes all costs go up significantly.

       Yes they do. You have no common sense. Even if people are leaving LA because of high costs because of illegals, that makes it go up in other areas as well. It goes up slowly.

       You don't get to bill gates stature by being a nice man. Maybe he's changed and really does want to help humanity but let's not pretend he got to where he is by being benevolent. It's easy to preach about socialistic ideals when you already have all the money you will ever need a thousand times over. But then again.. maybe he really has changed..

       So vaccine-caused polio cases? Are you suggesting it would be better if they had no vaccine -&gt; normal/wild polio cases -&gt; recurring epidemics? I'm not seeing how Polio eradication can be a bad thing if it makes Polio so rare that there are more cases caused by the vaccine than the wild virus.

       Er... Your chances of getting polio from the vaccine are quite clearly much lower than your chances of getting wild polio just from existing as a human. Otherwise we wouldn't be talking about eradication, but the ongoing, man-made polio epidemic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you explain how those children are being sacrificed? More of them get polio and die without the polio vaccine.

       You are not God, who rightfully decides who lives or dies.  There is certainly evidence you have no respect for your fellow human being’s rights to self determination and informed consent. How can you possibly be so arrogant!  How do you call hundreds of thousands of deaths saving lives?  You are majorly deceived and have no concept of right and wrong. You will ignore me and label me ignorAnt while you have no idea of my knowledge.  But, that does not change the facts many, many children are being sacrificed daily bec arrogant bAffoons take it upon themselves to rule the world.

       Did you happen to notice all the nih publications, peer reviewed articles?  So common to use personal attacks when you can’t defend your callous indifference to human suffering and loss of life. It appears you are disconnected from the activities you support and their effect on real humans. You are one to talk about crazy

        vaccine-caused polio cases?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are a lot of different types of vaccine. Many people don't like shots, so Gates helped fund development of a nasal spray delivery system, and maybe tablets to dissolve under the tongue (I'm going from memory here, too lazy to google right now). Usually vaccines are made from viruses that have been chemically treated to be chopped into smaller bits, so that there isn't any fully formed virus left to try reproducing in the body. The pieces of virus are still large enough that the human immune system can identify the protein structures specific to that virus type, and react with normal immune response to those proteins. Unfortunately, such vaccines don't always produce a strong immune response in all people, so the person may be at risk of contracting the virus from the wild without a prepared immune response ready to destroy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With nasal and sublingual vaccines, the immune response is more likely to be a weak response as compared to an injected vaccine. To combat this, newer nasally administered polio vaccines use polio virus that hasn't been broken down as much. As an analogy, think of the live virus as an apple. The injected vaccine is made from apples that have been run in a blender for several hours, whereas the nasal vaccines are made from only a couple of pulses in the blender.  In these vaccines the virus may still be considered "live" because there's a small chance that some of the viruses in a given sample are still fully capable of reproduction. Although most will be  broken down enough that their RNA (or DNA in some cases) is no longer capable of replicating the virus, but with larger chunks the immune system has an easier time recognizing the pieces as a serious threat and a proper immune response is developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where the problem happened. Either some batches ended up having a very high amount of "live" viruses, to the point that they were able to reproduce to full infection levels after being administered, or immunocompromised individuals were given the vaccine, which allowed the few "live" viruses available to infect the host unimpeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there, polio began spreading from those who had been given the faulty vaccinations to other people who had not received any vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several points may be wrong, but that's the best I can do from memory.

       No that looks like pretty much what I've read. My point is that without the vaccine, there is WAY MORE POLIO to get in the areas where it still exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the vaccine, we see these cases caused by the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the vaccine, we would see thousands of times more cases caused by the wild virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WHO recently mandated a switch to the injectable vaccine that uses an inactivated virus specifically because we have reached the point where the vaccine caused virus is starting to be responsible for some of the last remaining cases. Is that a bad thing? That we have vaccinated so many people that the original virus barely even exists?

       I may have replied to the wrong comment. You and I are on the same page. Hopefully the Anti-vaxxr who was responding reads up on the actual data. It's definitely a worthwhile trade-off to accidentally infect a few people with polio in order to save the rest of humanity from the disease.

       Really it would be the perfect weapon. It'd be impossible for anyone to get blamed for it and it would almost exclusively kill the poor and uneducated that can't be bothered to wash their hands and wear a mask or practice even more extreme quarantine measures.  Seems like no downsides.

       CRISPR technology requires very little investment. For a few hundred dollars, a person can have a lab setup in a studio apartment. With CRISPR, the potential exists for any genetic code from any organism to be inserted into just about any other organism, although the concern is with viruses and bacteria. Sure, there's a lot of trial and error involved when trying to do something specific. But it is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. A malicious person could engineer the common cold to produce botulism toxin, or alter bacteria commonly found on your skin to produce estrogen. With a little extra funding, the person could obtain antibiotics and develop antibiotic resistant bacteria, and then engineer that strain to produce deadly outcomes for anyone infected. CRISPR has few limits, and is easily accessible.

       I've worked with crispr before, I had a whole semester studying it, it's fascinating and promising but it's still new and none of these things is really doable. It could be in the future sure, but as of now this really isn't something to be worried about

       I think it's because this year marks 100 years since the 1918 Influenza Epidemic, we are overdue for another massive viral infection. Back then it killed 50-100 MILLION people in one season, imagine the devastation it could cause now

       Jimmy Savile was diddling and fucking little kids while he gave millions to kids hospitals and the like.  He had a kids show and on the surface was their best pal.  He used and abused his position and power.  It was even covered up and ignored because he gave to those organizations, because sick kids need money.....but the trade off is cocks in their asses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, as with Bill the stuff you see on the surface is not all that is going on.  Bill might be a "philanthropist" by name but what he does or what he is also into could be the entire opposite if you were to be privy to it.

       His malaria stuff is only the surface level he wants to show you.

       I think these guys like Jobs and Gates, Musk and Bezos with Zuckerburg of course finishing the lineup were chosen by the CIA or some other government entity to drip out this technology and we were just given good startup stories.. it be in the intelligence community and governments best interests to be able to do much more then just record phone calls, they basically have access to what you like, how you think, who you know, what you do and what you want to do.

       Thanks for the history lesson on Saville. This thread, however, is about Bill Gates. You can admonish him for his business practices in the 90's, but to compare his philanthropic work to what Saville was doing behind closed doors is disingenuous at best. Try judging the person on
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       actions instead of picking a random person you dislike.

       Viruses mutate.  It is almost never the virus' intention to kill the host, it's just that it mutates in order that it can more easily spread from person to person, species to species.  It is always a ticking time bomb, because the mutation process often leads to a strain being deadly.  Spanish Flu managed to kill millions in a single swipe, then it mutated and stopped killing the hosts.
      </p>
      <p>
       With world travel being much more common, the odds of a mutated killer virus infecting someone grows with each day.  If you want to stay safe, live far away from anyone else.  The biggest problem is, in today's world, by the time you know a disease is on the rampage, it'll be too late!

       I work a lot with animal pathology, and one of my co-workers used to work with influenza, and it's crazy how unprepared we are. We haven't had a true flu epidemic since 1918 and it's just a matter of time until it happens again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antibiotic resistance is a huge deal but most people agree massive epidemics are much more likely to be viral, not a bacteria so that wouldn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get your flu shots people, even if you get the flu still, it's much less severe. Almost everyone who died of the flu this year were people who didn't get the shot, even though the shot was only moderately effective

       Though, to your first side of the debate.....anything you can equate to the hollywood side of things is probably the wrong side to be on.  That is just me, just my opinion but hollywood is for entertainment.  If you brain goes to the hollywood side of things, that is exactly how certain people in powerful places would love for you to react like.  Irrationality and knee jerk reactions that in those extreme situations, enable military or police in some equally extreme fashion is perfect for the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that aside I would like to participate in that chat as well.  It should be easy to show at least one side of the paradigm and expose it as one that benefits only certain groups of people in power positions.

       This is an often missed point. It's not like the flu is gone, it's just mutated and the general population is immune to that phenotype. It'll be back, like any other disease.

       The flu this year was brutal. They kind of talked about it but not as much as they should've. It was a huge ordeal in California.

       I think he was bringing it up because it's been exactly a century since the 1918 influenza, a flu season that killed 50-100 million, maybe more. It could EASILY happen again, we are just waiting for it

       Because he's right. It doesn't take a genius to look around and see that the planet is overpopulated, the toxicity of the ocean is getting worse, plastic garbage gyros the size of countries are a thing, the amazon is being cut down and replaced with soy, and the coral reefs are dying.

       Ecological imprint or overpopulation, what is your actual argument? Those are two different things. If we continue to improve on renewable energy and waste reduction then we would leave less of an ecological imprint.
Either way, the earth isn't overpopulated.

       Both are the same, when carrying capacity is overshot the systems depended on a degraded and eventually after the transient spike over carrying capacity there is a die off. We are in an unsustainable intensification trap and if you are familiar with the rate of renewable deployment and our balance of fossil energy use that does not come from the grid you will see that we are not transitioning fast enough and are unlikely to make it through the next 70 years without going through a bottleneck with an excess mortality of at least 1.3 billion people

       I think there is plenty enough room for everyone in the world.  I think overpopulating small areas like New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, London are asking for trouble because they require so much maintenance (food, petroleum, electricity, health care).  Concentrated populations will suffer greatly if "the machine" every breaks down.

       And everything you pointed out is just the tip of the iceberg. All those things are almost irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.

       The planet is warming faster than our worst models anticipated. Some people think we already passed the point of no return. Not even stopping everything that produces CO2 could save us any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great pandemic is already overdue. It used to come every 50 years and we haven't had one in exactly a hundred years by now. Somehow we got really lucky and every big disease that appeared in the last hundred years was not a fast killer. HIV is bad, but it spread so much just because it takes years to manifest itself and kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is just going to get worse and worse and nothing we do will ever be able to change that. Thank the people who made money out of gasoline.

       Unfortunately, pandemics used to be fairly common.  It's a natural phenomenon, it's just that humans have learned how to avoid it for now.  With population growth and mass transit, it's only a matter of time.

       Not to mention antibiotics are so over prescribed they're basically becoming worthless, and that's going to lead to disaster.

       I highly doubt this will be how the next pandemic will come about, it will much more likely come about by a normal virus mutating or by a bacterial infection that is immune to Antibiotics. The 1918 Flu Epidemic killed 50-100 million people VERY quickly, this could easily happen again and in a much larger volume

       If things were arranged differently, the ability for people to take care of themselves is certainly possible.  No one has to babysit 6 billion people, that's the false idea.  The idea to get you to expect  such a thing to happen (even if you did survive), and even advocate for it.

       Bill Gate's shitty foundation has created millions of third worlders who are alive artificially. I.E. provided with medical care, food, and basic necessities without the economy or education to support their lives as productive adults. Makes sense he'd want an illness to cull the herd a little bit.

        Why is Bill Gates so confident that a massive disaster in the form of new unstoppable diseases is on the horizon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's his hobby-horse. And fair play to him, he has pumped a lot of his money into trying to combat killer diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Not always wisely. I remember with horror his plan to administer mass vaccinations in Africa via genetically-modified mosquitoes, which is the sort of scheme that would give a Bond villain pause for thought. Presumably, someone talked some sense into him on that one.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, he is right. Pandemic killer diseases don't happen frequently, or predictably, but they happen and they happen with no advance warning. History is full of bottlenecks in which large percentages of the Earth's population were simply slaughtered by a new illness turning up.

       A lot of third world countries give out prescriptions for things like malaria and then those prescriptions are fulfilled with low end versions of the prescription that are less dense with antibodies or whatever makes them work. This has the effect of allowing the diseases to adapt through exposure, instead of being obliterated by a prescription with like twice the density of the antibodies. This has the effect of weakening better medicines over the long haul.

        . Despite concerns that new cases of SARS would emerge in the region, no new cases had been reported as of July 1, 2007. The world's attention has instead focused on the potential for a global avian influenza pandemic due to the H5N1 influenza strain.
       </p>
       <p>
        WHO has today revised its initial estimates of the case fatality ratio of SARS. The revision is based on an analysis of the latest data from Canada, China, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Viet Nam.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case
       <em>
        fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50%
       </em>
       depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%.

       There's always a pandemic or epidemic every century or two.  We never used antibiotics in all our livestock.  Eventually an antibiotics resistant strain emerges.  People travel the globe now like never before thanks to airplanes.  I'm pry biased from playing Plague Inc.  Sars happened but thankfully it was contained.

       I'm so sick of hearing opinions from billionaire elitists as if their money is some reason I should take them seriously. What the fuck does Bill Gates know about pandemic diseases? He made his money from operating an anti-competitive tech company that obtained a monopoly on PC operating systems, not biological research. If gates wanted to tell me where he saw Desktop Linux in 5 years or the future of X86 personal computing, or how to obtain a monopoly in my software area, I'd hear him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Musk. He doesn't know shit about Mars and made his money getting lucky on bullshit / being bailed out after wrecking paypal. If I want to hear an opinion on how to run a company into the ground, maybe I'd listen to Musk.

       I think these guys like Jobs and Gates, Musk and Bezos with Zuckerburg of course finishing the lineup were chosen by the CIA or some other government entity to drip out this technology and we were just given good startup stories.. it be in the intelligence community and governments best interests to be able to do much more then just record phone calls, they basically have access to what you like, how you think, who you know, what you do and what you want to do.

       Thanks for the history lesson on Saville. This thread, however, is about Bill Gates. You can admonish him for his business practices in the 90's, but to compare his philanthropic work to what Saville was doing behind closed doors is disingenuous at best. Try judging the person on
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       actions instead of picking a random person you dislike.

       I've worked with crispr before, I had a whole semester studying it, it's fascinating and promising but it's still new and none of these things is really doable. It could be in the future sure, but as of now this really isn't something to be worried about

       No, I just assumed that someone talking about the Zika virus would know even a tiny bit about it. It was first isolated around 1950 in Ugandan monkeys and mosquitoes, first human infection was in 52, and ever since then it has slowly spread around the world, most notably in Micronesia in 07, Oceania in 13, and South America in 2015. This was the most severe outbreak and new evidence suggested it was likely linked to microcephaly. After being in South America it spread to Florida and other southern States. There is not anything suspicious about it, I've work with biology and pathology for a living, this outbreak wasn't even that spectacular. It's any season now until we have an actual influenza season, or avian flu outbreak, or anything like that.

       They had an amazing run. Can't believe such silly-ass shit stayed on TV for that long. Also amazes me that people (besides my weird self) loved that show. I thought I was the only one with that kind of sense of humor. Glad I was totally wrong.
