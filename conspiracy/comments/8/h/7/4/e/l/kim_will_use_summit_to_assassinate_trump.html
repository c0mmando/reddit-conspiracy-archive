<p>Moths to the flame.  His supporters also regularly turn on &quot;republicans&quot; who won&#39;t get with the new program.  You realize he hijacked the Republican party right?  You go to the_donald right now and you&#39;ll see more anti establishment comments getting voted to the top than you&#39;ll see here in /Conspiracy.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to agree with Trump to see that his detractors have erected a massive strawman-trump to make their version of reality clumsily mate with what everyone else sees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had considered this, but doubt very much that it would be KJU who is responsible. Though I am pretty sure he would still be blamed by TPTB for it. Wouldn&#39;t even be surprised by a gulf of tonkin type of situation, where it never actually happens, but Trump is said to be killed anyways, while he quietly disappears into retirement from his acting career. S Korea is nice, but N Korea is better real estate if you wanted to duke it out with China, or even just wanted to put pressure on them, and It would not surprise me at all if TPTB had the guile to pull something like your title suggests to justify taking the north.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what they would have to gain is that Kim knows a reunified Korea with him as the leader is not possible. How else can he reunify Korea and continue to be the leader? It certainly sounds more implausible as I type it out, but he needs to be able to invade South Korea to take over because part of North Korea&#39;s goals is a reunified Korea with the Kim family leading. A world war would be a solid smokescreen to help make that happen.</p>

<p>Now, if this did happen, would the US not hesitate at all in bombing North Korea out of existence? That would probably be our first target. Unless there are additional workings in place to put us on the defensive. </p>

<p>I can believe some wag the dog machinations are taking place behind the scenes as well to &quot;expose&quot; an assassination attempt that justifies a US-led invasion, but the ramifications of that are too long to believe we would be attempting some kind of subterfuge like that.</p>

<p>Though I don&#39;t think anything will actually happen beyond diplomacy, I can&#39;t help but be wary with how quickly this is taking place. Perhaps Kim just recognizes he needs stability and time and will use this to buy themselves that and nothing untoward but a pretend peace will occur. He&#39;s playing the same game as his dad, even if it seems further along than what&#39;s come before.</p>
