       I do not trust Kim Jong-Un. What are the odds he attempts an assassination on Trump during the summit? I imagine he doesn't show up for the meeting or sends a double and bombs the building. Is this how WW 3 will start?

       I can't imagine people aren't warning him that Kim may try something unexpected, but Trump seems to think they're on even grounds of crazy and respect one another.

       This is true. Perhaps the fear of what will come down is too great for any type of subterfuge to occur. I can't help but wonder if there's something more going on, though.

       I disagree, obviously. The rhetoric and tribalism that he fuels will affect us for a decade. We shouldn't need a megalomaniac to teach people that the system is fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ, not even all of his supporters see the system is fucked. Right now they're braying on about "you gotta vote republican to keep him in there!" That's not even close to the anti- establishment realizations we need. He's fueling more of the same shit all over again.

       Rhetoric and tribalism are ever present period, regardless of who won the election or if they embraced tribalism to win it.

       Spoiler alert:. You don't win without embracing it.

       He is only a megalomaniac because people keep repeating it.  If he didn't defend his own ego then he wouldn't have one left at this point.

       Moths to the flame.  His supporters also regularly turn on "republicans" who won't get with the new program.  You realize he hijacked the Republican party right?  You go to the_donald right now and you'll see more anti establishment comments getting voted to the top than you'll see here in /Conspiracy.

       You don't have to agree with Trump to see that his detractors have erected a massive strawman-trump to make their version of reality clumsily mate with what everyone else sees.

       While I agree the ramifications of this administration will fuck us up for years, I certainly don't want Trump to be assassinated. Punched in the mouth a little bit until he shuts up, but not murdered by an insane foreign power.

       I had considered this, but doubt very much that it would be KJU who is responsible. Though I am pretty sure he would still be blamed by TPTB for it. Wouldn't even be surprised by a gulf of tonkin type of situation, where it never actually happens, but Trump is said to be killed anyways, while he quietly disappears into retirement from his acting career. S Korea is nice, but N Korea is better real estate if you wanted to duke it out with China, or even just wanted to put pressure on them, and It would not surprise me at all if TPTB had the guile to pull something like your title suggests to justify taking the north.

       I think what they would have to gain is that Kim knows a reunified Korea with him as the leader is not possible. How else can he reunify Korea and continue to be the leader? It certainly sounds more implausible as I type it out, but he needs to be able to invade South Korea to take over because part of North Korea's goals is a reunified Korea with the Kim family leading. A world war would be a solid smokescreen to help make that happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if this did happen, would the US not hesitate at all in bombing North Korea out of existence? That would probably be our first target. Unless there are additional workings in place to put us on the defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can believe some wag the dog machinations are taking place behind the scenes as well to "expose" an assassination attempt that justifies a US-led invasion, but the ramifications of that are too long to believe we would be attempting some kind of subterfuge like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I don't think anything will actually happen beyond diplomacy, I can't help but be wary with how quickly this is taking place. Perhaps Kim just recognizes he needs stability and time and will use this to buy themselves that and nothing untoward but a pretend peace will occur. He's playing the same game as his dad, even if it seems further along than what's come before.

       Is Kim even in charge of North Korea, or is he a figurehead? IF any assassination attempts occur I would be more likely to believe that it was a faction trying to make Kim look responsible to possibly try and erase all of the progress made with the countries involved. Makes more logical sense than Kim going through all of this just to guarantee his own assassination.

       Kim is definitely in charge and he's estimated to have killed over 300 people since entering power. Many of those are supposedly family members who had tenuous claims to lead. That's all anti-North propaganda, and at least one of the people he supposedly killed (ex-girlfriend pop star) supposedly turned up on video being very much alive, but I do believe it for the most part.

       I disagree, obviously. The rhetoric and tribalism that he fuels will affect us for a decade. We shouldn't need a megalomaniac to teach people that the system is fucked.
