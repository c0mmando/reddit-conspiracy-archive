       The time has come fellow Redditors. A global awakening have started. Issues surfaced in the public eye that previously have only been discussed in obscure places. Division, hostility and confusion is at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paid shills, shady mods and bot armies are spreading disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm here to stop that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I possess information that will help clarify the situation for everyone. This is an outline of my thesis. It will all be explained supported with sources and evidence, point by point in the following parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only ask of you one thing: Have an open mind. I expect every one of you to be sceptical, but try to let go of all biases and contemplate what I am saying.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The world is run by a secretive group of individuals who have amassed human and financial resources beyond comprehension.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They have been actively trying to shape world events to the advancement of a mysterious agenda for the last 2-3000 years, with varying success.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         By now, their tightly knit web of influence encompasses governmental, military, civil, scientific, economic and intelligence organisations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They control the media and entertainment industry, using it as tools of psychological warfare, shaping public opinion and conditioning the masses.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Through health institutions, the food industry and the pharmaceutical complex they deliberately keep us sick, dependent and docile.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         While they preach democracy and liberalism, they are slowly reducing individual privacy and freedom through the pretext of security against threats that they themselves have created.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They propagate atheism and enlightenment while they indulge in occult rituals and worship (including human sacrifice, orgies and child abuse) behind closed doors.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With the use of globalism and liberalism they destroy our culture and traditions erasing our history and ancestry keeping us from knowledge our ancestors had. Meanwhile they only breed between themselves and pay keen attention to keeping their bloodline (DNA) pure.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their numbers remained the same throughout the years, counting approximately 6000-8000. However, the number of their servants and followers are much, much more. By brainwashing and taking advantage of human weaknesses (greed, lust, vanity etc.) they build their pyramid of power with themselves on the top.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All this is to separate us from nature and to hide the truth about the true nature of the cosmos.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All of this will be explained, point by point with persuasive evidence in the following parts. Till then, you are welcome to ask questions, provide proof or counter-arguments. I will try my best to answer everyone. Just one rule: Be polite and civilised.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just an appetiser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I have your attention?

       This is very accurate, well done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being aware of this is VERY important, so we know what we are up against and therefore how to fix it.

       Yo man, I honestly believe if this is the case, there's not really shit any one of us individually can do about it. I've just tapped out of society completely, I feel like these other cats are on their own. Society itself is 'for psychopaths, by psychopaths'...they dictate the terms of engagement, so any of us normal people will never get to their level, or will always be stuck in a losing position. As others have mentioned, I think this has been going on for such a long time that their methods of control are almost complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe me, try telling this stuff to a random person...you'll be met with derision and ridicule. Mental slavery. 'My conception of the world is true, and this contradicts it, so you must just be crazy'. People will trip over themselves trying to justify horribly unnatural systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, they're all fucked. Fuck 'em. Can't free the slaves that don't even understand they're enslaved. You just gotta cultivate dope, likeminded people in your life and do your own thing.

       That is true to an extent, but I still thing it's important to spread awareness and at least try to wake up people as best you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       With an abundance of misinformation, disifnormation and downright total propaganda being spread everywhere, people that have knowledge on what is actually going on should at least try to spread some semblance of awareness about it (of course first of all try to make sure that the info your spreading is actually good information and not simply more misinformation and disinfo). Even if it's simply by participating on Reddit or some other public forum and speaking your mind, or perhaps speaking your mind in real life in front of people (if you can and you're brave enough, you can even do this in front of people that are totally "in the machine" and will likely laugh at you as a "crazy conspiracy theorist" - remember to have compassion for them as best you can, many are often brainwashed and indoctrinated by propaganda beyond belief).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, if nothing else, at least try to spread compassion. That alone is an enormous detteretn to all the plans those in power have to divide us and keep us at war with each other, hating each other, fearing each other. If we see the living being in each other and in all of life as best possible (including animals, plants, all of nature), we can find greater peace within as well as become a beacon of light that helps counteract the fearmongering propaganda, the anger, the division, the lack of unity and brotherhood. Understanding the other, seeing them as more than a mere object in your mind, seeing them as a living being that seeks happiness and wishes to avoid suffering, can bring great change into your own life and the lives of anyone you touch. This alone is, in my opinion, one of the most powerful antidotes to the powers that be's poisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, maybe I just hang out in that kind of crowd, but people are becoming more and more aware every day. Not only in real life, but on the Internet as well. Their voices are being quashed, but they are speaking up and taking a stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, there are a lot more people awake on this planet now than you might think. And that number is steadily rising.

       That's why I'm an artist. The ability of stories to make certain information more palatable to people (in fact, some people literally understand life through the guise of the stories they've heard...shouts out to Harry Potter and Jesus)

      <p>
       "at least try to spread compassion"
      </p>
      <p>
       Compassion is a super power. It completely neuters fear in it's tracks (at least for you, often times for the other person as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to do all those things man. But I've realized I'm just one dude and people will really only hear what they want to hear; if they're not ready, they won't receive the info. So, cultivate a dope friend-base and try to live as an example for others. That's all you can do.

       You may be one dude, but what you are doing through your art, your realizations, your compassion is likely spreading further than you may think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we all do what you just said, use art to express ourselves creatively and use it to spread awareness and bring light to people, become better humans, more compassionate, more united, cultivate connections with like-minded individuals....we will definitely bring down the "Illuminati".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no one of us that will bring them down, but if each of us does our own thing and we connect with each other, the power and awareness generated by that will be miraculous. And there are a lot more people following their own light now than ever before, more than either of us may think. Knowing this helps us follow our own light, create, help out, introspect and act, knowing that we aren't alone on our path. I would definitely say we are far from alone, now less than ever.

       Positive thinking, love the sentiments, and I'd love to believe it brother, and I hope it's true. I'd call myself the most cynical optimist ever, but I doubt I'll see it in my lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, a person dies, an idea doesn't. I'm just saying, I'll avoid the disappointment of watching people bang their heads against the wall and flounder by just stepping away from it and doing my own thing. Maybe some ideas expressed now will be picked up by future generations and expanded upon, or finally implemented. For now, though, I see a sinking ship that everyone's attempting to plug holes in with their fingers, but it's already halfway underwater. I think all you can do is construct your own lifeboat. I guess maybe other people may see you've made a lifeboat and will try to construct your own. I don't know, though.

       Exactly. Do your thing, live your light and be an example of it. Then if anyone asks for help, you help, if people want to stay asleep, you let them stay asleep.

       But simply by being your best self, by creating from that, by acting from that, you are inevitably changing the world. You touch people in ways you can't even fathom. Even one post on a forum like this can change the course of someone's day and perhaps even their whole life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being the light, speaking the light, creating the light in whatever way is best for you - all of that is saving the planet.

       People do wake up though. Some of my close friends in college did. They stuck with me through my bullheadedness until I finally realized my extreme aversion to even hearing them mention it was a means to hold on to my false sense of safety. Then I woke up. Since then, I have woke up my parents to these things, and at least 10 other friends. The key is you have to keep trying, stay away from belittling practices and come from a place of compassion and caring. Waking up is a terrifying process which is why so many don’t even want to hear about these things as possibilities. So you have to give people kindness and friendship in this process so it’s less scary and more palatable.

         yes tht is true, that has always been the case. because power and wealth go hand in hand. and only very few people have the true knowledge and power to implement the knowledge to guide humanity towards the future. Leaving humanity to its own devices threatens the existence of us all, because evolutionary we are just advanced apes with advanced tools. Emotional thinking and primal urges still persist even in the smartest of men. And those who arent educated in history, in ways that work and dont work in all areas of progress of humanity are doomed to keep making mistakes and keep stagnant the progress of humanity and evolution of our species.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         its not a mysterious agenda... The human with varying intelligence is not ready yet to be a space fearing individual, because he can not yet be trusted to not succumb to his primal emotional ways and play god with others. Oppression is still everywhere, entire capitalism is build on class divide after all. So the playing the game of culture and world building there is NO RIGHT WAY, every system becomes corrupted every system runs the risk of oppression, so the world if you look at it, has many different types of governments ideologies and market systems. We are slowly eliminating those that dont work, and promote those that do. once a system runs out of steam like communism of soviet russia it is forced to change and adapt to use the pointers of countries which are very successful in this case it was capitalism of US. At this stage in out timeline US capitalism has run out of steam and needs to change, adapt evolve utilising pointers of other nations socialist policies to move humanity, society, individual condition forward.

         No there are many world elite, there is no longer single one power. Historically it was UK colonialism, then it was US democracy now its something else. Basically bankers, the intellectual world builders the powerful individuals all get together and igure out the next step. The world is very complex so in comparison to the 8 billion people, few hundred is just a tiny group.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They do, but they are the western elites, eastern elites, European, middle eastern etc. They all have a role in psychological and media control of their region, as the world becomes more globalised those elite get fewer, as power becomes more consolidated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. But it is also all systematic experimentation in population and culture control, systems needed for world building people control.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That is from the westernised oppressors (leaders elite), since there is Eu, Ru, China as main global leaders they spread their own ideologies in their regions of control.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         that is just, yeah, rituals are important for marrying the future secularism and historic origins of their ideologies.

         I Would argue it is to take the unevolved man and civilise him, to grow him. Remember humans were animals, it took generations of society building and oppression that they managed to get past religious oppression, out of fuedal oppression, slavery, kigns, tsars, and soon to be capitalist elite and then bankers master of monetary systems. There will be a push back to nature, becuase we have played god and fucked up our planet, so they will be pushing to marry the civil man, with savagery of nature. To create a symbiotic relationship to help earth survive. We have already killed many species and ruining our air, water, earth. We will need to look after earth if we want us humans to survive on it, with it.

       Over all good analogy but I feel it is still biased to westernized ideological base. Because the world is west and east and middle the europe, africa(is like backwards but still there), meaning ideological history and current path towards the future, is still intertwined with many different backgrounds. I tried to address some of these with the pointers ebove, but I am sure it goes much deeper than that, because this is a very complex area of discussion.

       The human trafficking has been a problem because its justice was suppressed intentionally and only really targeted the sellers, once you go to the buyers, you find the root and a rabbit hole of collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect to check out is the suppressed antigra, free energy, and healing tech. Those pioneering and promoting them have been dominated.

       yes, this is the reason I have started to question the capitalism as it is done now, because it promotes exploitation and suppression of emerging technologies, free technologies for the benefit of existing large profiteering agencies. The whole discussion of curing vs healing that is going on in the american health industry because curing diseases cuts into profit margins of repeat customers. Which relates back to evil for profit corporate interests, and the elite who benefit from such exploitative practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for human trafficking, or slavers. yes the rabbit hole of collusion of debt enslavement, wage enslavement, straight up slavery of sex workers, no low wage immigrant workers. Its exploitative. From their perspective to get shit done they need cheap easy labour, nothing cheaper than a slave.

       The fist monetary system is designed to be a bubble, also promotors scarcity since it drives up profits. It is one of the primary tools that gently guides us like a carrot on a stick.

       We have been STOLEN from to put it succintly and most accurate. That fact may drive the communal (communism) aspect of the pending gold standard. Check HR 5404.

       If we are owed even 50 years of debt created from Fiat based solely on our labor, it would make sense to provide the basic needs for humanity as a wage - especially if healthcare and energy are profitless.

       I guess the trick is to leap into the next era of human technological prowess with automated factories is to make them work for the people, and not for the very few the top 1 percent of population for their gain, and only theirs as the products are sold to the people....

       I have no doubt it will happen, people revolutionized in the early 1900s and late 1800s out of feudalism and oppression from kings and exploitation of production guilds. And they will again, from industries that are controlled by a few for the benefit of the few, to a broader more equal, more democratic, more society orientated enterprises. But its not going to be done without the rich putting up a fight.

       Funny enough we are seeing such battle now I US. with even as basic things like internet ISPs spending billions on lobbying to try and stop municipal internet...i am sure there are other examples thats just one. And cryptocurrency movement is there to take away the banking financial system profiting of our fiat money as they get a cut with every transaction, but not with crypto. Well not with all, as currently bitcoin is an expensive bitch. I hope we can figure it out without the very few becoming too greedy and ruining for everyone.

       Thank you for leaving a reply!
It is very akin indeed to the now 'memefied' illuminati conspiracy, however I believe this goes a step further.
 It explains the 'why', not just concerning them but the whole cosmos, through a union of spirituality, science and conspiracy.
But who knows? Maybe for some of you this won't be new. For someone it will all be very shocking, I'm sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whichever person you are, I think what ultimately counts, is that we, the 'conspiracy loons', who know about the illuminati/shadow government/deep state danger, are getting together and uniting for once.
 To form our ideas into a single thing, to get organized, and to eventually fight back.

       This is the time for that. In the ultimate month I saw a HUGE increase in two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Synchronistic 'meaningful coincidences'
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         'Awakening' of the people, both to the undeniable existence of the aforementioned conspiracy, and to a forgotten spiritual reality.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Jung argued that we, as a species, have a collective unconscious. In this case, the concurrency of these 'broadening of perspective' in individuals, are not mere coincidence, but the effect of a shift in the collective mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I refer to as awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is happening for me on a personal level, however I see the same thing happening on a grand scale through the internet.
I see people openly calling them out. Almost everywhere. 
This was completely unheard-of in the 90s or even the 2000s. 
Wasn't it?

       i mean, this isn’t just your info. Many researchers ahead of you have pieced this all together + wasaay more, so be humble. if you have something new to share that goes beyond their bodies of work, then just hop right to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the way you’re presenting things in this post sounds like such a limited hangout / savior complex / esoteric/occult guru kinda thing, which is a trap for truth seekers.

       Thank you for your feedback. 
I'm sorry that you see it that way. 
I'm merely someone who wants things to change for the better. I firmly believe that at this point our only chance is to come together and get organized. 
And the synchronistic phenomenon of the previous months, both globally and on a personal level, points towards this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As if a current in time-space would boost us towards this path naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already went too far ahead, which I really don't want to do. 
I want the posts to speak for themselves, and explain my thought process and perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without in depth explanation, the concepts can not be put into a logical frame, cannot be truly contemplated, or at least that is how I feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       During my research, I have used a mix of comparative analysis and pattern recognition on various subjects of history, science, and philosophy, to connect the dots, so to speak, and format them in a 'scientific' way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I didn't even do any work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just unraveled itself over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we will be able to openly discuss and develop it through a united scientific platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully soon into a single theory of the world. Who knows?
I believe it kind of explains all or most other conspiracies and natural/supernatural phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
       See this is the catch though. I came to believe over the years, that spirituality is in fact the missing piece of the now somewhat 'mainstream', illuminati conspiracy. 
Through this union, a single, cohesive working theory of the world emerges. A theory to explain all enigmas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so it comes that it requires a little faith. But a faith that can be proven to every individual without fail through a definable method.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I must stress once again, that I will properly present sources, data and a series of logical deductions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then, I expect everyone to remain skeptical, but I beg to stay tuned in and challenge my thesis. I believe open civil discussion on these matters would bring substantial fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay tuned if you can and spread the word. If not for the post, than for the comment sections. Let's make a thinktank!

       First of all, welcome to the grounded spiritual team :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Needs to be said first: Thank you for your work, I can't wait to read it in the future, and please do not hesitate to continue by anyone who -even subtly- shows signs of seeing your work in a bad light, however that might be; you are needed and I thank you again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, on a more personal note, as a fellow traveller, I have tried many methods to do the parallel works of Healing, Awakening, and Gathering Data regarding our true history and future.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I liked in your post was the fact that you stressed that spirituality was the missing key. I was on a similar boat, only worse. I was very spiritual from a very young age, outside any religion, feeling a deep connection with shamanic practises. There were some "dark times" of my life, where I put forward my politics and left my spirituality as something "not to be discussed" or "messed with" my course in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the biggest mistake. Take it from someone who left that path for some years, and then re-discovered it as the perfect solution out of the ontological ping-pong between Existentialism and Nihilism:
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic is just the one thinking-pattern that is "okayed" by society in order to analyze and create. This is the trap that made us make science into religion (see: Scientism). Just like in the middle ages, we do not question the authority of any specialist in any field. Doctors, big pharma and the law system is something that just by questioning it actively, you are being put on a list somewhere. In some countries, even labeled as a terrorist (greece, from where I am).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that a Spiritual re-theorizing of a revolutionary approach to the Existent Reality, is not only a necessity, but something imminent, as we can see by works of people like you and me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I happened to put easter eggs into my music and art, and lots of people got them - they were designed in a way that they commanded an answer. Try to do that in your work, just a small tip from me ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, without instilling fear into your heart, I am sure you know that such revolutionary work (like yours) will draw attention. Be mindful of that, and just be centered. Gone are the days where we were labeled as "crazy conspiracy theorists/gurus/hippies/whatever".
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in days where we are heard, and the only weapon we should have is love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weaponized Love.

       Humans are a spiritual vessel, we can do a lot of amazing things through consciousness. TPTB destroyed the knowledge that kept these practiced going, and the knowledge died with the elders who didnt pass it on.

       Hi, I do have questions;
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of misinformation going around these days, why do you believe your theory over other popular theories?
       <br/>
       Are these elite secret keepers provably sinister?
       <br/>
       If you do see them as doing bad, how are you reaching that conclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is plausible that a major secret project has been ongoing for a very long time, at huge cost, and no public accountability; if this premise is true, then it is also true that we belong in a lower class of person, not worthy or important enough for the truth, which sucks.  Over the past few years, there has been many times when a unbelievable conspiracy suddenly is trending against common logic; flat-earthers, simulation theorists, hollow-earth, 2012, there are many.  This could hint at an effort to discredit any leak containing actual truth by lumping it in with dozens of entirely fictional storylines, each story with their own group of believers and evangelists.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, it is not a stretch to imagine secret projects that would be better completed if the whole thing was kept secret... maybe, for instance, the best course of action necessary to evade an extinction level event might be ethically impossible for a representative government, or maybe the cost of such an undertaking is fiscally impossible in a free-market.  Maybe there is a calculated manipulation of the masses going on, ultimately "setting up" the world in a way that leads to a good, but otherwise unlikely outcome;  a lasting world peace, or the obsolescence of currency, I don't know, something objectively good for everyone...  Maybe there is a considerable fraction of people who are deep into projects to make human labor obsolete while simultaneously creating a logistical management and resource distribution system with incorruptible decision makers?
      </p>

       I apologise if that makes no sense, thanks for your time.

       Thank you for your contribution.
I see these existing trends as different attempts at explaining certain enigmas of the cosmos, each showing certain underlying correlations, an archetypical truth.
A mythos.
What I come to present is more of an attempt at explaining all of these phenomena, but with a synthetical approach not an analytical one, looking at how all these scattered contradictory clues work together in the bigger picture.
 A single dynamic model of the world.

       I am open minded, and do believe in what you are saying, but unfortunately they keep a real tight wrap on everything so it is hard to expose.

       PizzaGate was the last real thing that we have to try and expose their sick ways. If your links provide to be truthful, I feel we can all band together to get this out into the publics attention.

       I'm currently working on molding it all into a unified, easy-to-follow theory with constant references. However it proves to be quite a challenge. It's just such a vast topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I am touched that there still are people like you out there who are on the right track to figuring all this out.
I might start posting in smaller segments. I will notify you if part 2 is posted. Maybe in the next few days.
But really, thank you for your comment. Please try spreading the word if you can. Share the links of this post(part1).
We need to come together, those of us who know the global conspiracy.

       Yeah i can imagine, trying to open up minds to relatively new ideas and having to wake up to such an ugly truth people need it for it to be easliy understandable - referencing helps to not sound like a crazy person :D

       It was linked in  a comment i think, so i kinda stumbled on your post that way. I feel like im aware of few things and conspiracies arent new to me. I would want to spread the word but as im a little shy about my thinking then, if at all, i would do that anonimously as i am not yet established myself, and don't have real facts and that much knowledge to argue also kinda need to improve my english in like terms of speaking(if talking about arguing in real person cause i feel eventually we all will need to have our say in all of this) but thats not important now :D And i was wondering about 2nd part cause that way i feel there would be more information, facts, references so i could safely spread the actual post as you seem to know a thing or two and have actually done some research, best of luck finishing and having inspiration to do the right thing, cheers man
p.s. english isnt my first language so i might not word something correctly as i would think or speak in my own language but it might be fine anyway :D

       Yo man, I honestly believe if this is the case, there's not really shit any one of us individually can do about it. I've just tapped out of society completely, I feel like these other cats are on their own. Society itself is 'for psychopaths, by psychopaths'...they dictate the terms of engagement, so any of us normal people will never get to their level, or will always be stuck in a losing position. As others have mentioned, I think this has been going on for such a long time that their methods of control are almost complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe me, try telling this stuff to a random person...you'll be met with derision and ridicule. Mental slavery. 'My conception of the world is true, and this contradicts it, so you must just be crazy'. People will trip over themselves trying to justify horribly unnatural systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, they're all fucked. Fuck 'em. Can't free the slaves that don't even understand they're enslaved. You just gotta cultivate dope, likeminded people in your life and do your own thing.
