       I am getting tired now every sub I look at, it's filled with hateful anti-semites. At first I just thought it might be a few crazy high-school kids on drugs, but now I look at it it's much more coordinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of subreddits are now infested with crazy antisemites, and this is not a coincidence, the level of coordination here indicates a massive conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is every 3rd post here about Israel? Has anyone really verified those news at all? Could easily be fake antisemite news? In fact the level and frequency of it smells like an
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agitprop">
        agitprop operation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not all of it, now people start posting abot regular Jewish people too, basically regurgitating the old Nazi era propaganda with the Protocols of Zion and the rest of the nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       While normally these are just a buch of high school neckbeards on drugs, the level of it in the present smells something more organized.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a joke, the atmosphere in Europe is already very tense, we see Neo-Nazis marching on the streets, hatecrime commited against innocent Jewish people. It looks exactly like the 1920, and I fear history could repeat itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the hell are people so dumb to not realize this, and why are people so hateful against the Jews. Every single anti-semite I have talked with sounds like a deranged mentally ill person, you can't even argue with these people as they are completely closed minded hatemongers who can't realize that they are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I will probably be called a shill just for making this post. People already called me "Schlomo", what the hell that supposed to mean? I am not even Jewish, but I really don't like the totalitarian atmosphere that is hovering around us in Europe and in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it looks like a coordinated effort of Neo Nazis to gain power again. I have documented a possible underground Nazi network post WW2, I fear that they might have something to do with the resurgence of anti-semitism today.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are not vigillant, we can lost all our rights as these mindless zealots will do the bidding of their masters and introduce tyranny once again.

       It could be totally fake news, I haven't looked into it, but whenever I hear that "children" are being hurt, sounds like the exact same propaganda that they said about the "children" that were invading europe and raping women in major cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be completely garbage propaganda from the left trying to equate military aged aggressive militants with "children". It's a common tactic.

       Idiots like the guy above cannot fathom for the life of them why people have a problem with Israeli's and zionists.  In their eyes, the

       How do you know that is even happening. It could be easily fake news.

       The level of propaganda in the media is insane, leftists were running hoaxes when the asylum seekers came into Europe, it can be all rubbish.

       No I am not and I quite frankly don't even care about the middle east. I only care about Europe, and looking at the climate in europe due to the neo-nazi resurgence, I wonder how bad this can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       I view Jewish people as natural allies against tyranny, they have been the most persecuted ones out there so, it would be in their interest and in europeans interest to stop the neo nazis until it's not too late.

       If you don't care about the Middle East, then your opinion is worthless. It has no bearing on this discussion. I'm sick to death of dealing with apathetic scum who only care about their shitholes. Sorry, but the world doesn't work that way.

       Nope. I said if you don't care about the Middle East, your opinion is worthless. You don't have to be Middle Eastern to care about it. You don't have to be European to care about Europe. If you're talking about a war going on in a continent, and you don't care about the people living in it, you should just fuck off. You were dropped on your head as a child I am guessing.

       I agree with you OP, it is ugly, and shameful, how hard the anti-Semitic  conspiracy is pushed.  Those kinds of conspiracies are always false. They keep people divided and blame a minority or sometimes majority (S. Africa) for all the damage created and imposed by the people who are really doing all the oppression.

       What does that mean?

      <p>
       The top 1% includes incomes that are as low as $450K/year and where  and the average is $1.3Million per year, but in fact an income of $450/year is only what used to be called the professional middle class.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To be certified as a one-percenter, you’ll need to bring in even more income each year. According to statistical data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the top 1% had an adjusted gross income of $465,626 or higher for the 2014 tax year. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth put the average household income for this group at $1,260,508 for 2014.

       Don't  you know in the U.S. until the 80s, and in most other nations, the true middle class is the professional class which includes successful small business and farmers, the lawyers, engineers the doctors, the mid and upper management mostly professions that require at least a 4 year college degree.

      <p>
       The "middle class," is only used for laborers and blue collar and serving people in the U.S.

       It is so fucking charming,  the Reagan administration promoted the working class to the middle class just as they began the draconian wage suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Middle class used to be something the working class aspired to, now they are called middle class and they are poorer than they have been since 1939.

       None of those professions will make you 450k, unless you are at the very tip-top of your industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesnt feel like a real argument you could possibly believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       By definition, the 1% is only 1% of people.
      </p>

       It is literally insane to think that someone making enough to have a mcmansion (maybe 2 or 3), a vacation home, multiple luxury vehicles, fly private jet, wear $30,000 watches ect ect ect.

       Is middle class.

        <p>
         good home, good cars, could afford dental and health care.

       All my research shows that the production studios are owned by British and US elites, mostly of Irish and Anglo-Saxon origin.

       There are now even Chinese that are buying up major studios.

       Israel is a far right ethnostate that imperialistically expands it's borders though violence. Israel has a border wall around much of it dividing the pure Israel form the degenerate Islamic world. Israel is a "Jewish" state, yet claims to be a democracy. How can an ethnostate be a democracy? Why can't gay's marry in Israel? American Jews are so progressive about LGBT rights but Israel looks like the 1950's. It is these contractions that drive what you see as anti Semitic, but in reality is a legitimate observation. Again, pattern recognition is anti Semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organization such as aipac and other jcrc organizations promote international economic policies and open border policies. Yet Israel is one of the most difficult counties for someone who is not Jewish to emigrate to. Why is that? Why do your organizations promote open borders for us, but an ethnostate for you?

       People wouldn't hate you if you didn't try to meddle in other people's culture. Keep to yourself and the pogroms will stop. It's because you are a parasite that latches on to a civilization and exploits it's people through usury. Why do all of your elite work in law, media, and banking at a disproportionately over represented level?
      </p>
      <p>
       Usury is the reason your people are hated. The parasitic nature of your race is your downfall. Learn a lesson from you neighbors. Plant an olive tree instead of burning one down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess pattern recognition is anti Semitic.

       Israel is a conservative democracy, people who try to compare Israel to Nazi Germany are completely hateful anti-semites that can't put things in perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is surrounded by enemies, militant arabs that have been very hostile to the Jewish people for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Jews will be skeptical about the left and be more conservative, every group that is under constant attack tends to become more right-wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your comparison is baseless, it is the most technologically and morally advanced culture in the entire middle east and africa, so it's not even comparable to other countries in the region.

       How do you know that is even happening? Just because a few biased leftist newsites are reporting it that doesn't make it so. If it's so outrageous then major news would report it too, yet I see no reports whatsoever. Or are you saying that the media is totally controlled? Well that would be absurd, there are tens of thousands of news outlets around the world you know.

       Only a few conspiracy altwebsites are promoting this, most of them with neo-nazi ties. That should tell you the accuracy of those news reports.

       Most people there are not even Jewish or have only a Jewish spouse.

       The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn't help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn't help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. The Jew had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn't remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day.

       Hating Israel is anti-semitic, there are arabs there and Jews of all variety, you can't hat every single person in there, it makes no sense, as you don't even know them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holocaust denial on the other hand is just insane, I have first hand knowledge about the atrocities that the Germans did. I knew people personally who described how Germans started rounding up people in small villages people had to run to the forest where they were hunted down with dogs and murdered on the spot, most of them weren't even Jewish just regular villagers, there is overwhelming evidence for this. Only recently they started the archaeological survey of the forest,  many thousands of bones were found.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazi Germans were the utmost bloodthirsty savage barbarians that you could imagine, there is no reason to doubt that they have carried out the Holocaust, people who deny that are insane.

       That is very insulting to Holocaust survivors. The "were you there" argument sounds like the young earth creatards who question the existence of dinosaurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandfather on my mother's side had a farm-hotel in a rural area and the Nazis came for him because he allowed some Jews and resistance fighters to be sheltered there, he had to run away with only a suitcase, he hid in the forest where he saw other people from nearby villages running in there and being hunted down. They had a no survivor policy, and hunted people day and night with dogs, anyone who they found there they executed on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandfather never laughed and joked around, he was always a very silent and sad person, what he experienced there in those days made him a psychological wreck for the rest of his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that he made all that up? He barely even talked about this he only talked about it a few times to my mother when he was older, he always teared up when he talked about it.

       The arabs are the only semites in Israel, and Israel treats them like subhuman animals, in accordance with the talmudic beliefs that only jews are humans. Thus hating Israel is most definitely not antisemitic. Any person with a strong sense of ethics and morality rightfully hates the zionist entity for its crimes against humanity.

       You should look into genetic studies, there was a paper in 2005 I believe that proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Jewishness is an ethnicity that is strongly tied to Judea and Samaria regions by genetics. Askhenazi Jews have more in common with Arabs than with Caucasian Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all Jews have a legitimate claim to Israel region.

       This white genocide bullshit. Do you realize that 85% of Europe is white, and you people get histerical if that drops 1%.

       That is just xenophobia and racism. Though I am against the immigrations too, but not because of the race but because many people who they invite are gangsters.

       African and middle eastern immigrants are bad, I'd rather have asians or north americans coming to europe.

       Well then atleast you seem like you're not a completely brainwashed individual. If you're 25 years old or younger, just sit tight and watch carefully. You will see this 'bullshit' unfold before your very eyes a few generations from now.

       The antisemites are entrenched as mods and admins. They allow tropes and the most vile things on subs like worldnews and news and ban people who stand up to these pieces of shit. I commend you for not only noticing this garbage but saying something about it. 
Thank you.
