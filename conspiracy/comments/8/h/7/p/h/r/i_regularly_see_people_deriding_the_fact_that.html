        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Vaccines are being studied (and used) as a means of sterilization and population control.  </p>

<p>Those that worship Western Medicine refuse to accept that vaccines can be used for nefarious purposes. </p>

<p>FFS, the World Health Organisation has a goddamned task force exploring the use of vaccines for population control,  and... </p>

<p>they started this line of exploration IN THE 1970&#39;S.</p>

<p>The ** WHO Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation** is one of several Task Forces, consisting of international, multidisciplinary groups of scientists and clinicians collaborating in research on specific goals, established in 1972. Its accomplishments are reviewed here. The Task Force convened a meeting in 1974 to select criteria for tissues and molecules capable of mounting antifertility responses. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1874951/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1874951/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes. There is a Task Force on Birth Control Vaccines at WHO. This journal paper focuses on a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin B (hCG). There is a heading in the FASEB paper (p.1382) called “Ability of antibodies to neutralize the biological activity of hCG.” The authors are trying to discover whether a state of non-fertility can be achieved by blocking the normal activity of hCG.</p>

<p>Another journal paper. The British Medical Bulletin, volume 49, 1993. “Contraceptive Vaccines.” The authors—RJ Aitken et al. From the MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.</p>

<p>“Three major approaches to contraceptive vaccine development are being pursued at the present time. The most advanced approach, which has already reached the stage of phase 2 clinical trials, involves the induction of immunity against human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Vaccines are being engineered … incorporating tetanus or diptheria toxoid linked to a variety of hCG-based peptides … Clinical trials have revealed that such preparations are capable of stimulating the production of anti-hCG antibodies…”</p>

<p>The authors are talking about creating an immune response against a female hormone. Training a woman’s body to react against one of its own secreted hormones. The authors state, “The fundamental principle behind this approach to contraceptive vaccine development is to prevent the maternal recognition of pregnancy by inducing a state of immunity against hGC, the hormone that signals the presence of the embryo to the maternal endocrine system.”</p>

<p>Stop the female body from recognizing a state of pregnancy. Get the body to treat the natural hormone hCG as an intruder, a disease agent, and mobilize the forces of the immune system against it. Create a synthetic effect, an engineered effect, by which the mother’s “maternal endocrine system” does not swing into gear when pregnancy occurs. The result? The embryo in the mother is swept away by her next period—since hGC, which signals the existence of the pregnancy and halts menstruation cycles, is now treated as a disease entity.</p>

<p>The authors put it this way: “In principle, the induction of immunity against hGC should lead to a sequence of normal, or slightly extended, menstrual cycles during which any pregnancies would be terminated…”</p>

<p>Miscarriage would then be the “normal” state of affairs. These authors leave no doubt about who the target of this vaccine would be:</p>

<p>“During the next decade the world’s population is set to rise by around 500 million. Moreover, because the rates of population growth in the developing countries of Africa, South America, and Asia will be so much greater than the rest of the world, the distribution of this dramatic population growth will be uneven…”</p>

<p>Two other vaccine methods are described. They “aim to prevent conception by interfering with the intricate cascade of interactive events that characterize the union of male and female gametes at fertilization.”</p>

<p>Your numbers are horribly exaggerated. &quot;Hundreds of thousands dying or paralyzed yearly by polio&quot; is a complete fiction. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the non-propaganda perspective.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes down to the facts, there’s nothing to claim. No one can truly claim that the polio vaccine eradicated polio in this country. Here’s what we do know:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Through redefining two different types of diagnostic criteria (plus the reclassification of the term “polio epidemic”), an enormous number of potential polio cases in the post-vaccine era were discarded.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccination and tonsillectomies can provoke or cause polio infections, which may have inflated the epidemics that occurred in the 1950s. Vaccinations continue to contribute to the incidence of polio-like illnesses such as transverse myelitis, GBS, and aseptic meningitis, today.</p></li>
<li><p>Transverse myelitis, GBS, and aseptic meningitis, which began to be documented separately after the introduction of the polio vaccine, currently impact the population at a similar rate as 1950s polio epidemics.</p></li>
<li><p>What we have been told to believe about the eradication of polio is a manipulation of the truth.</p></li>

<p>Hilarious joke when I saw the article that you linked.</p>

<p>What leads you to believe an anti-vax/pseudoscience site called Health Freedom Idaho over actually sourced articles with actual data?</p>

<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio">https://ourworldindata.org/polio</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The interactive visualization below highlights the global decline in the number of paralytic polio cases from 1980 onwards. <strong>In the early 1980s more than 350,000 people suffered from paralytic polio cases every year</strong>, in 2016 this number was only 46 paralytic polio cases. In the 1980s the world saw 20-times as many paralytic polio cases every day than today in an entire year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The World Health Organization relies on a similar methodology when estimating the total number of cases. This visualization by the WHO compares the number of reported cases with the number of estimated cases and arrives at <strong>very similar estimates to ours with the estimated global number of paralytic polio cases being above 400,000 in the 1980s.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Global expansion of polio immunization resulted in a <strong>reduction of paralytic disease from an estimated annual prevaccine level of at least 600,000 cases to fewer than 1,000 cases in 2000.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have nothing to say about the linked sections from my comment? </p>

<p>First of all, the article only has anything to say about the US polio epidemic in the 50s. None of its points are relevant to the worldwide success of the polio vaccine. Is it suggesting that every single other health org in the world reclassified polio in 1955 as well? </p>

<p>We have the technology to be able to identify viruses. We know if the polio virus is present in a patient.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why <strong>anyone</strong> would believe an article like this over half a century of people <em>not getting polio anymore</em> and research confirming the vaccine&#39;s effectiveness. </p>

<p>Now we do...   Back when illnesses that weren&#39;t polio were being diagnosed as polio,  we didn&#39;t.  We didn&#39;t have the ability in the 50s to prove that every patient diagnosed with polio actually had polio. The tech wasn&#39;t available.   Illnesses that weren&#39;t polio were being added to the tallies.... your data simply isn&#39;t correct,  despite it being from your hallowed official sources. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make much sense that everyone who lived through the polio era would be fooled by a reclassification, and it doesn&#39;t make sense NOW that everyone in the regions where polio was rampant until the worldwide movement to vaccinate would be just as easily fooled.

<p>People are so short sighted not to see this.  And the astro-turfing anti-anti-vaxx shmear spin machine is in full effect.  Western populations are being prepped for the legislation.</p>

<p>&quot;Questioning vaccine safety or administration schedule or your individual right to choose?  You must be a flat earther too!&quot;</p>
