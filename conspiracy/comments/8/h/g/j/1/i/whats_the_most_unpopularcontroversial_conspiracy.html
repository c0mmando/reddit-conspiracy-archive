       My opinion is it comes down to perception and I like to believe that it is flat. Outside, with my own two eyes, most stuff point to it being flat.

       Plus, most of my other conspiracy theories ties in nicely to this.

       I'm trying to discuss, you don't bring up any valid points.. I can only go by what you give me.. If asking for proof is some kind of tactic, I can obviously see this isn't going anywhere.. Beat your chest all you want, it doesn't change the fact that you've presented no truth, and no discussion.. You're obviously very insecure about yourself and no amount of projecting will help you..

       I'm with you bro. Globalists... globalism... scientism It becomes so clear they are a cult and want us to believe whatever they tell us. All part of putting us in a metaphorical box. We've got to think outside that box and the fake paradigm they've created.

       We live on a beautiful plane of existence and we don't need to believe in the fantasy that is finding a planet and abandon this world. Say no to NASA/Space X CGI propaganda.

       Time is more than just a human invention. Sure, minutes and hours are made up measurements, but just like feet and inches, they measure a very real thing. Time can pass at different rates depending on how fast you are moving or how much gravity you are under, so depending on your definition of time travel, it could be said that its already proven to be possible. Travelling
       <em>
        backwards
       </em>
       , however, has no evidence of being possible currently.

       The mandella effect has shown me we almost certainly live in a simulation. Just not like we know something a little more than a computer.

       Well this is where it comes into speculation. I don’t see it as our future selves or anything like that. In fact strangely enough it makes the bible make more sense. I’ve never been a bible bashed let’s get that clear. But from what I’ve seen I really do think the earth was made for mankind by god. It’s just what you believe god to be. Like an entity or like we are all part of god. Our real selves exist on the other side and we are having a human experience. It’s really open to interpretation. But let’s just say it took me down that road and I’m not religious.

       It depends on the purpose of the simulation. What small piece of history can we change to see if the inhabitants of the simulation notice, and how they react, sounds like a fascinating experiment to me.

       <em>
        deliberately

       leaving the memories in tact, but changing all physical evidence to point to something else. It's be fascinating to see how people rationalise that change and try to explain their (seemingly) false yet consistent memories, and if the simulation was run by a dystopic entity it'd be potentially useful to them in seeing how far they can rewrite their own history.

       Because in the real world, you can change physical evidence (records of the event, remnants left behind) but you CAN'T change the memories of people who have already read about it or were witnesses to the event. Modeling the extents you have to go to to make the new history be accepted as fact, and how people respond to the contradictory information, is potentially useful.

       The Kardashians are faking their pregnancies, ala Beyonce. Most celebs are drug addicts, and their handlers/record labels like them that way (easier to control, convenient excuse if they need to get rid of them later). Your television is more toxic than most people will ever be able to understand.

       I have two, that may not be controversial per say, but I do find them kinda hard to articulate accurately and they are relatively recent, so allow me to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, as more and more time passes I’m slowly coming to the opinion that Bernie Sanders’ 2016 primary election was a DNC psyop. I was in college at the time and a big Bernie supporter during the primary and saw first hand how popular he was around colleges. As well it was obvious at the time that the DNC was fixing the primary against him. I could understand at the time why he  didn’t make a big deal about it at the time and ultimately capitulated to Hillary because he didn’t want to be a scapegoat for a possibly (and as we know how definite) Trump victory a la Ralph Nader in 2000. But since then it seems he’s completely just became a doormat and agrees with the Democratic Party instead of trying to creat a real and different political movement which is a desperate sentiment of the National attitude. Lastly there are details of his campaign that don’t feel right in retrospect, first there are specific emails where Hillary staffers scold Bernie for bringing up specific topics and mention “not being part of the deal”, his meeting with Obama early on the race, what did they talk about, was he getting instructions, Bernie’s whole “enough about the emails” statement which was a huge service to Hillary. To me it seemed the DNC used Bernie to galvanize the youth vote and then shift that over to Hillary after Bernie’s lost (from personal experience it always bothered me how people who had voraciously supported Bernie during the primary immediately shifted to adoring Hillary a mere few months later, especially when she represented many of things Bernie had criticized) as well any holdouts to Bernie could be lambasted as “Bernie bros” and this bullied into supporting Hillary and more importantly not criticizing her.
      </p>
      <p>
       My second theory is about Richard Spencer. Something about this guy has never sat right with me. First let me state emphatically that I am disgusted by racism, antisemitism, white nationalism (or any extreme nationalism for that manner) the kkk, etc. and I do think there has been an increase in these movements in the past few years especially in the context of the alt-right. But when it comes to Richard Spencer, the supposed leader of the alt-right, it always seems as though the media is right behind him getting footage of what he’s doing. In my opinion at worst he’s a CIA plant or at best the media has agreed to give him an undeserved platform. Doing so allows the media to focus on the alt-right and it’s brand of antisemitism and racism. They then can take the term “alt-right” and slap it on anyone who criticizes the neoliberal/neoconservative order. (I’ll give a personal example. About a year ago, early summer 2017, I started getting Jordan Peterson recommendations from YouTube, I watched a couple out of pure interest and I found them really boring and tedious, just generic self-help stuff to be honest. So months later I start noticing Peterson in the media and everywhere it always puts him in context of being “a leader or leading figure in the alt-right” so natural I dismissed him as a Richard Spencer like academic. It wouldn’t be until I read about the horrible Cathy Newman interview in The Atlantic, surprisingly if all places, and then revisited Peterson’s videos on YouTube to find that he wasn’t this alt-right figure, I didn’t become a fan of his as many others have but I don’t think he’s a monster like the media make him to be. Since then I’ve personally had to revise how the media uses the term”alt-right” to dismiss people who have differing opinions)

       Spencer, totally agree. Bernie.. I don't think a guy who has been independent on his own for decades would do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Bernie wasn't good for Hillary in the 2016 primary. If he was part of the plan how come she wouldn't even say his name for so long? Why we're all the DNC debates scheduled during college football games? According to your theory they would want him front and center for all to hear, but it didn't go that way. Don't see it..

       I honestly think Richard is just a nationalist, but because of that he is automatically labeled as a "neo-Nazi", "racist", "xenophobic" (all of those words were on his Wikipedia page for months, might still be on there), without any research into his actual views. He doesn't seem like a racist - he does ask important questions about race and ethnicity, but not in a bad way (imo).

       It was a pressure release valve.  The Republicans tried to use Ron Paul to the same end, but his 2008 popularity snuck up on them.  It was relatively uncharted territory.  Not so much a decade later though.

       And it’s not empirical data, but I believe caucasians sought refugee on Earth and enslaved its people. Also, ancient Egyptian pictures depict the people as light brown to dark with black hair. From what I’ve seen, there weren’t many representations of those with White skin, if any. Caucasians can’t bare The Sun as  do people with darker skin.  According to evolution, you would think they would have adapted to the natural climate of this planet after many years.

       Evolution selects out punishes traits that affect your odds of reproducing. The degree to which we get affected by the sun doesn't really change our chances of reproducing. Also even if there are differences in skin cancer rates, I would guess that that usually shows up after people have already passed childbearing age

       Evidence can possibly be in the form of O negative blood, which was quite common in Germany and pockets of Europe.  O neg, is universal blood donor, villages Medieval Europe which were predominantly O neg, were resistant and at times totally immune to the bubonic plague.  I know of a few very close people to me who are O neg.  They are never sick. Never.  And the weird thing about rh negative blood types (blood type lacking rhesus factor) is that the females cannot naturally reproduce with males of positive blood type.  It's almost like they are in fact a different species. Without recent advances in medicine (namely rhogam shots) The women reject the fetus, much like the animal kingdom and species too far apart.  An example maybe like mules and donkeys unable to further the genetic line.

       Some subsection of the elites of the world participate in ritual sexual abuse and murder of children.
Probably for the purpose of secret keeping and blackmail, i.e. if you want to be in the 'in-crowd' you are forced to participate in these acts in a way that make it 'impossible' for you to tell anyone about this without being personally ruined.
This allows the elite to induct new members, while everyone is kept in control by everyone else by their shared rituals.
There is probably also some who participate for 'religious' reasons, i.e. they are Luciferian and believe human sacrifice provides them with sustained power, wealth, and more time.

       I watched a documentary last night that was I guess slightly similar to this. In Afghanistan all the higher ups in the police force and government have little boys who they keep on the police compounds and I quote " To fuck their asses at night,if they don't have the little boys, whose asses are they supposed to fuck? Their own grandmothers?" Also if the little boys try to escape they are shot or severely beaten, there have also been cases where kids have shot each other.

       The Holocaust was a hoax. Yes, lots of Jews died; and so did lots of other people. But no, I don't believe the Germans were gassing thousands of Jews to death and burning mountains of corpses to ash. It's not even feasibly possible. And anyone looking at the evidence objectively should come to similar conclusions.

       That religion has been (for a long time) weaponized for psychological operations against US citizens to control their minds at the deepest levels, preventing people from accurately perceiving events while also encouraging and dissuading a range of behaviors and thoughts.

       There's not a lot of info on this in the public domain, and I don't know of a single source that has compiled all the known evidence on this, but I'd point to some of the topics that I've researched that led me to this conclusion.
      </p>

       There's been a significant uptick in the frequency of unannounced military satellite launches carrying top secret payloads in recent years, and seemingly sudden interest from Trump in establishing a Space Force program. The X37-B program is also particularly interesting, along with DARPA's Falcon project, and China's Shelong space-craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a surface level article from Bloomberg:
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/there-s-a-new-cold-war-brewing-in-space">
        https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/there-s-a-new-cold-war-brewing-in-space
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The scarce details the government releases on space capabilities (communications, surveillance, recon, electromagnetism, kinetic weaponry, etc) are already very impressive - and given that the public's knowledge of secret tech lags far behind current capabilities, it's hard to imagine what can actually be done now.

       The Outer Space Treaty prohibits placing WMD's in space or on other celestial bodies (like the Moon, or Mars) but leaves the door open for new types of weaponry - like kinetic bombardment. It also doesn't address weaponization or warfare between man-made platforms, like spacecraft or satellites.

       Mine's almost an anti-conspiracy theory - many conspiracy theories are the result of people at the top not knowing well enough what they are doing, and making arbitrarily decisions that could look like they form a conspiracy, and they are happy for these theories to propagate as they project an air of influence/power.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Note that this
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       preclude conspiracies actually taking place -- NSA/GCHQ et al. is a well-founded example of how competency and conspiracy can overlap -- just that I feel many theories are asking for a degree of competency and foresight that probably isn't always there).

       Kinda similar but I feel a certain strange pity for the elite, whomever you may consider them to be. I imagine that they must use powerful mind/thought control techniques, like what you hear about North Korean defectors being afraid of their dear leader being able to read their minds from hundreds of miles away. After going through a few prolonged bouts of existential paranoia myself I can understand how being afraid of seemingly inescapable threats can affect you.

       Astrology is real, the elites know about it and use it in their daily lives. Egocentrism prevents people from realizing we're at the mercy of the Sun, which generates all life and 99% of energy in the Solar system. Why is then so difficult to believe other planets might be influencing life in some similar fashion, though with invisible sources of radiation and energy? It's impossible to get any kind of sensible debate on the matter.

       That Saturn used to be in front of our sun! Also there were very advanced civilizations that recorded this but something happened that sunk Atlantis and pushed saturn away giving its rings. Supposedly the hexagon storm on it holds some power. I guess most information was lost in the great library of Alexandria but some scrolls have been found in tombs in Egypt and all over the world reporting this phenomenon.

       While I do not subscribe to the FE theory, I do dabble in it as an exercise of how deep our reality could be controlled if there was an agenda at play that was the extreme long game.
      </p>
      <pre><code>In my somewhat limited research of the theory I have crossed the strain where the earth is taught to be round with the end game being that we would come to believe a universe so vast and so unimaginably large that it makes our minds incapable of believing someone or something created it.  (Bear with me now) 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       WHAT IF the biblical story of the devil being cast out of heaven and given a period of time to get humans to stop believing in God were true?  What a fucking genius plan that he (the devil) would take his millennia of time that he would be given to play this loooong game. Generations and generations of humans teaching their children that the universe is huge and so complex that there is no way that it could have been “created” it must have happened through hap and circumstance. Look at where we are now.  There is a tangible shift in our generation and the next of disbelief in god.

       It’s just something I find really interesting. It’s given me the mentality to never completely disregard any idea since we don’t really have concrete proof of a lot of things. I enjoy exploring theories no matter how “far fetched” some people might think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, before the fucking villagers with the torches head up the mountain to burn the monster that is Flat Earth start in on me. I don’t believe the earth it flat because I have yet to come across any concrete tangible proof that I can test and see and perform experiments on my own to prove it to myself. That being said, I don’t have proof to that degree of the earth being round either.

       The Bible is God's word, and contains the true history of the world. Also, Jesus Christ is God's only begotten son. The Bible is the most hated and censored book in the world. The Bible is banned in public schools around the world, and "progress" has long been defined in popular culture as moving away from God and biblical ethics.

       Spencer, totally agree. Bernie.. I don't think a guy who has been independent on his own for decades would do this.

       Also, Bernie wasn't good for Hillary in the 2016 primary. If he was part of the plan how come she wouldn't even say his name for so long? Why we're all the DNC debates scheduled during college football games? According to your theory they would want him front and center for all to hear, but it didn't go that way. Don't see it..

       I'm trying to discuss, you don't bring up any valid points.. I can only go by what you give me.. If asking for proof is some kind of tactic, I can obviously see this isn't going anywhere.. Beat your chest all you want, it doesn't change the fact that you've presented no truth, and no discussion.. You're obviously very insecure about yourself and no amount of projecting will help you..

       I honestly think Richard is just a nationalist, but because of that he is automatically labeled as a "neo-Nazi", "racist", "xenophobic" (all of those words were on his Wikipedia page for months, might still be on there), without any research into his actual views. He doesn't seem like a racist - he does ask important questions about race and ethnicity, but not in a bad way (imo).

       The Outer Space Treaty prohibits placing WMD's in space or on other celestial bodies (like the Moon, or Mars) but leaves the door open for new types of weaponry - like kinetic bombardment. It also doesn't address weaponization or warfare between man-made platforms, like spacecraft or satellites.

       And it’s not empirical data, but I believe caucasians sought refugee on Earth and enslaved its people. Also, ancient Egyptian pictures depict the people as light brown to dark with black hair. From what I’ve seen, there weren’t many representations of those with White skin, if any. Caucasians can’t bare The Sun as  do people with darker skin.  According to evolution, you would think they would have adapted to the natural climate of this planet after many years.

       Evidence can possibly be in the form of O negative blood, which was quite common in Germany and pockets of Europe.  O neg, is universal blood donor, villages Medieval Europe which were predominantly O neg, were resistant and at times totally immune to the bubonic plague.  I know of a few very close people to me who are O neg.  They are never sick. Never.  And the weird thing about rh negative blood types (blood type lacking rhesus factor) is that the females cannot naturally reproduce with males of positive blood type.  It's almost like they are in fact a different species. Without recent advances in medicine (namely rhogam shots) The women reject the fetus, much like the animal kingdom and species too far apart.  An example maybe like mules and donkeys unable to further the genetic line.

       Sure but they were testing how easy it was to mislead the people and how well they could be manipulated using the technology to carry out a simulation like this. It gave them an insight into how well Project Blue Beam would work.

       It was a pressure release valve.  The Republicans tried to use Ron Paul to the same end, but his 2008 popularity snuck up on them.  It was relatively uncharted territory.  Not so much a decade later though.
