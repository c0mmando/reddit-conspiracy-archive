       I know my title is alarmist, but I think marijuana is about to become a very big problem for America, and that this is a deliberate effort to sabotage our society's ability to function independently once and for all.  I also suspect that the 1960s flood of drugs - including marijuana - was an effort to pacify the population and divert our rebellious energy into bullshit that doesn't make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please actually read this and don't do a kneejerk stoner downvote because I'm not praising your precious herb.  I don't favor weed being illegal, I just think it has harms that the media are downplaying because people like George Soros are pushing wider and wider cannabis use in the public.  People can make their own choices, and weed isn't terrible for everyone, but it has risks and downplaying them is a conspiracy I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll explain the current push.  Then I'll explain why I think weed is harmful (to society).  Next I'll cover the topic of legalization (I don't personally thing it should be illegal, but I don't believe there's a "conspiracy" to keep it illegal, the conspiracy is to push it on the public).  Finally, I'll explain how weed might have been used to pacify the public in the 1960s.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, there's a push to normalize weed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When I say normalize I don't mean legalize.  I mean this thing where Jimmy Kimmel shows your grandma getting high, where ABC News shows a mom of 3 kids regularly getting high.  Where getting high is made to seem completely benign and fun, and less harmful than even alcohol use.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2596471/George-Soros-spent-80million-pot-legalized-US-Uruguay.html">
        George Soros pushing weed.
       </a>
       If you google "weed vs alcohol" you'll notice almost a dozen top links with the same general headline - "weed is safer than alcohol".  Many are the usual subjects (huffpost, Vox, etc.).  This reminds me of JournoList and gamesJournoPros, and the coordinated cross-media messaging that often occurs.  Well, it shouldn't be a surprise, since we know Soros money is there.  Think about this next time Jimmy Kimmel does a bit about how funny and harmless marijuana is.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been smoking weed for a long time, but normalization is new.  The illegality of weed, better or worse, has created a taboo against weed.  It has also made it hard to obtain, or at least inconvenient to obtain.  This has suppressed overall usage.  People who did it in college or party with it, keep it out of their day-to-day lives.  This is changing.  In Oregon, for example, daily use of marijuana among college students has reached 40% when previously it maxed out at 33% across the board.  Wanna bet it won't cross 50 once more and more kids perceive it's safe and normal?  In Colorado and California, pot consumption is up, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll explain next about why I think weed is harmful, but one of the reasons is that I think it's more strongly habit-forming than what is normally claimed ("it's not even addictive").  I predict we could easily get to 60-70% weekly usage by Americans with complete normalization, simply because cannabis is a good evangelist - it sells itself, IF you choose to try it.  This isn't necessarily good.  Opium sells itself too.  That's why people stay away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If marijuana is harmful, then 70% of people regularly using it would produce negative effects that cost society perhaps more than we can afford to cope with.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Second, marijuana might be more harmful than people think.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Forget about lung cancer.  Forget about long-term IQ and memory loss (legitimate concerns for teens who heavily use, and
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       adults who heavily use).
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed, as far as this discussion is concerned, has two negative features: "weed is wonderful" effect, and emotional dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Weed is wonderful" is the effect whereby people perceive cannabis to have better qualities than it really does.  It's also the effect which causes people to
       <em>
        be in denial
       </em>
       about harms
       <em>
        because they literally have diminished self-perception
       </em>
       due to the effects of THC.  Basically, THC affects the areas of the brain which deal with mood and emotional validation.  When you do well on something you've been working on and someone congratulates you, it makes you feel good and you believe that the thing you did must have been inherently good.  THC self-validates its own use by hacking this system, and users - even after one use - can be
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       that cannabis itself is inherently good.  They believe that they are inherently more creative and thoughtful and open when they are high.  This isn't necessarily the case, because it could be that they simply perceive this emotionally.  Thus, weed creates a feedback loop that obscures its negative effects from its users.  It also over-emphasizes its positive effects.  You don't just feel good when you're high, you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that your good feeling is righteous and inherently the best thing you could be doing with your life.  This makes cannabis very insidious, liable to spread far and wide even with clear harms.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the main harm of cannabis?  In this context of conspiracy, it's that cannabis puts the emotional system out of balance.  The little subtle mood validations that help us be motivated and act out of moral conviction get totally thrashed by THC.  THC makes people believe everything is alright when it often isn't so great.  It causes a sense that good vibes can make the world better (hippie logic) when actually hard work and sacrifice might be absolutely necessary to solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditionally, people have been exploited by societal structures.  So rejecting sacrifice has seemed valid because society is corrupt and morality is too.  In this context weed has seemed liberating.  However, once the corruption is countered, society still has to replace it with something functional.  Once we're "on track", we still need morality and self-sacrifice.  And weed prevents that.
      </p>
      <p>
       More pragmatically, however, weed can cause massive emotional and mental health problems.  This is mostly among the minority who get addicted, but more people using more frequently means more addicts.  People can't emotionally function normally without cannabis if they're addicts.  And those who do succeed in quitting talk about life being a "dull routine" with "no real meaning" after quitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the real harm, I think, of marijuana - it takes away from the everyday enjoyment of life.  It dulls the sense of importance you attach to meaning and purpose, because nothing is as great as being high.  Cannabis creates a tension between life when you're not high, and life when you're high.  It mostly just papers over emotional problems, and because you can literally be high all day without ruining your body's health, people actually end up doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a minimum, if 70% of Americans end up as regular users, mental health costs, and dysfunction, will go up.  Yes, I know about opiates and so forth.  This will be on top of our existing problems.  Some opiate and alcohol use might decrease, but so far we haven't seen either problem at all disappear.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Legalization
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't support prohibition.  I do support a social taboo against weed, and a sense that it has risks.  It should only be used by people who are very deliberately choosing that lifestyle (hippies, fully grown adults, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's a conspiracy to keep weed illegal, except if you look at Nixon.  Frankly, America is a society that loves to regulate things, and has a Puritanical background.  This is why drugs are regulated, because of stuffy conservatism.  It's not some conspiracy.  Nixon went after drugs for political reasons, but there's maybe something to the story (not condoning what he did, but LBJ worked for the cabal and Nixon was a bad dude but these guys aren't all on the same team, if you know what I mean).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearst funded anti-hemp shit, but the main guy pushing the campaign was a legitimate puritan.  There was no conspiracy, they didn't want people using it for moral reasons - agree or disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it might be a "conspiracy by the man" to keep weed illegal.  But in this case it's like a low low level conspiracy of just normal conservative establishment types.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, high level means like CIA force-feeding people LSD and shit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Grass" might have been a conspiracy in the 1960s to start to ruin America
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The counter culture is cool right?  I don't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand that hippies and weed is what you hear about when you hear about the 60s.  But it's not the truth!
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1940s, during WWII there was actually an anti-war movement!!  You'd never know this since America was almost a fascist country then, and successfully suppressed public knowledge of the movement.  But these dudes - Quakers, Mennonites, Unitarians - were serious AF.  The WWII anti-war movement cut their teeth in the 40s and literally directly became: the Vietnam anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, the mental health institutions reform movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the "counter-culture" without drugs would have actually been formidable and dangerous to the establishment.  A genuine opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed didn't enlighten anyone, it just took all this righteous rebellious energy and bottled it up in couchlock and rainbow gatherings.  So fuck weed, and fuck "higher consciousness".  It's all an illusion.  Fuck Carl Sagan and his bullshit too.  He was barely functional later in life, an addict in self-denial, who probably died because of lung problems from too much smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no evidence, but I would 100% believe that the CIA was behind hippie culture and this included LSD but also basic cannabis as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       40% of Americans have tried weed once.  80% of Americans who went to college have tried weed once.  Why college?  Why there?  Because it was targeted!  Just like all its administrative and curricular aspects have been converted over to SJW marxism.  This feels very deliberate.  Well, we know the current, 2018 push is all Soros.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        TL;DR: Weed is insidious because it blinds people to its own harms and spreads itself, its harms include emotional dysfunctions and also people preferring being high to actually solving problems.  It prevented
        <em>
         real
        </em>
        change in the 1960s.  There's a big push to normalize weed use now and get many more people using it more often - by
        <em>
         George Soros
        </em>
        !!  The traditional conspiracies to keep weed illegal are just normal stuffy conservatives.  The real conspiracy is to spread drugs.

        The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.

       If the majority of our society was able to question the status quo at the level this subreddit does, how would that be a bad thing for the current state of the world? Seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And is it really so bad to use cannabis in a recreational way similar to alcohol? It certainly doesn't fucking kill as many as alochol does in the same setting. It's a very powerful herb that can be used in recreation, medical, or spiritual settings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to see the harm compared to any of the shit people do daily right now.

       Alcohol doesn't alter perception as comprehensively as THC, it's not psychoactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an herb, it's a drug.  St. John's Wart is an herb.  Opium is a drug.  Stoner talking point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis is the status quo, dawg.  Have you ever watched TV, been on the internet, been to college, or watched youtube?  People who smoke cannabis love Obama, or Bernie, or Ron Paul, or Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis makes you feel good, so it makes you feel like you were wrong to worry about X,Y,Z.  That's the only thing it causes people to "question".  It's also a recipe for being a sheep.

       By definition, marijuana is an herb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herb (noun) - A plant or plant part valued for it's savory, medicinal, or aromatic qualities. [Marriam-Webster]
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a plant that is valued for not only it's medicinal qualities, but it can and is used in cooking to achieve various other effects compared to other methods of consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to say, "Oh St John's Wart is an herb because it isn't psychoactive, but marijuana is psychoactive and therefore not an herb!" is disingenuous at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opium is also, by definition, an herb. Just because the valued chemical substance in opium today is exploited tremendously, that doesn't discredit the fact that it is a plant valued for it's medicinal properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does political preference have anything to do with this discussion? I could say people who smoke marijuana love Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln and it would be partially true because the amount of people who smoke marijuana is so large that it likely has people who also love those politicians. What is your point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis alters your state of consciousness, just as Alcohol, anti-depressants, psychedelics, and Adderal does. If used with the correct Set, Setting, and Intent, the ASC of Cannabis can and does make you see life in a different way, and often times leads people to question their current state of affairs. If that is somehow a recipe to being a sheep, yet acohol isn't, then I don't what to tell you.

       This is actually horseshit.  Marijuana masks emotional issues, and in the process deepens them.  As long as you are basically high most of the time, or a lot of the time, weed will keep emotional issues in check (not always though).  But there's a price you pay for that, and if you ever run low on weed or it starts to make you sick or whatever and you have to quit, then you're in a much worse place emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, weed makes you "believe" like you're more balanced.  It's called drugs, dawg.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the short term, weed will paper over society's issues and things will temporarily seem better, but nothing will be fixed and the chickens will come home to roost eventually.  Which is why Soros, who clearly wants to neuter America (he destabilizes countries for profit and ideology), is pushing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real harm comes from broken families and a bad economy.  But marijuana helps divert us from fixing those problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, psychological research does show that marijuana use exacerbates anxiety etc.  Again, your shitty mood - which gets worse over time, the baseline that is, if you use - improves
       <em>
        while you are high
       </em>
       .  But the idea that cannabis balances you is one of those self-delusions I'm talking about.

       Again, who gives a shit what other people do for fun, as long as it doesn't harm others. Alcohol and other recreational party drugs kill people all the time at events where the sole purpose is to let go and have fun. Cannabis is still at 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your biggest point is that it would breed widespread complacency in society. I argue the opposite. People would wake the fuck up much quicker if used in the correct setting. That doesn't mean everyone who smokes dope has to use it for mind expansion or education, they can do whatever the fuck they want with it because that's their unalienable right as human adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yea no shit consuming a psychoactive drug during teen years where the brain is still in heavy development would cause long term memory recall and mood issues. That's why it's cutoff at a legal age of 21.

       Cannabis has killed a couple of people since legalization.  Kids who ate edibles and had a heart attack.
      </p>

       Cannabis can also lead to depression, and paranoia in
       <em>
        some

       people.  How many suicides are responsible?  There's almost no data.

       Healthy adults don't OD on marijuana like they can on other drugs, but that doesn't make it healthy or natural.

       When you say 0 people have died from Cannabis you just sound like a stoner.

       Can you cite me these "couple of kids who ate edibles and had heart attacks"?
      </p>
      <p>
       What studies have been done that support that it causes depression in people? Any anecdotal or off-hand accounts to link this marijuana depression to suicides? Wouldn't it make a higher degree of sense to say that if this were the case, that the person involved likely had this predisposition before the consumption of marijuana, and that the consumption of a psychoactive substance brought out their emotional/mental issues in a more obvious way and they were ill equipped to handle it? And if that is indeed the case, then where do other psychoactive substances, particularly psychedlics, fit into that paradigm?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my experience, I have seen nothing but good come from it. Sure, people have different bodies and minds and we all react differently to different substances, and it certainly isn't for everyone. There may be an allergy risk, though I've never heard of such a thing. But to say this substance should keep it's stigma even after legalization is reaching.

       The CIA-Bezos-Soros Washington Post has been pushing weed normalization since 2014.  They are not unbiased on this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kid overdosed on THC, whose effects on the amygdala and blood pressure induced a heart attack.  Pre-existing condition or not, marijuana was the direct, immediate cause of the circumstances which led to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       This equivocation is a great example of the stoner "weed is wonderful" mentality I'm talking about.  THC is psychoactive and has effects on the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       People do overdose on THC now that there's skunk and dabs, and have psychotic episodes.  Impaired judgment, and blood pressure changes can lead to harmful circumstances.  Just like with other drugs, and alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with marijuana is two-fold: it's overall usage is less than alcohol, and the "weed is wonderful" myth.  Impair judgment over a large population over time and you'll see harmful effects.  Weed hasn't caught up to alcohol yet.  However, THC addicts (because of the way THC affects emotional and mood centers of the brain) desperately defend it against any criticism (like an abused girlfriend).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alcohol and tobacco addicts don't pretend that their habit doesn't cause harm,
       <em>
        but THC users do
       </em>
       .  Even people who are hard addicted to THC and can't quit, and are psychotic because of it usually add the caveat "but this is just me and by no means do I condemn cannabis or most people who use it normally".
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that weird?  That users just
       <em>
        can't seem to criticize it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, I'll reiterate my hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed is somewhere between less harmful than alcohol to more harmful than alcohol (emotionally, motivationally, spiritually) depending on person and circumstance.  As more people cannabis more regularly, the level of total harm - societally and personally - will only increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, there's going to be the biggest, craziest national denial about the harms (with people nitpicking every little study, blaming every little thing other than cannabis itself).
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine these two and I see a recipe for big problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see because hard drugs and even alcohol can self-correct.  I don't think cannabis can as easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if scientists and public policy drafters are getting stoned then they too will possess the "weed is wonderful" bias and have trouble addressing the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see this a little with alcohol.  Many people drink it way too much, and simply because they sort of kind of need it for their mood they are in total denial about it.  I don't think, however, that they worship alcohol as such, unable to criticize its general harms.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, alcohol doesn't rewire the part of your brain that manages emotional relationships.  That's the problem with weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way, "don't knock it til you try it".  Non-users are able to see the changes in others that they themselves cannot see.  It's pod people tier.

       If Cannabis contributes to these social problems by shifting people's focus and enhancing self-medication, self-delusion, and so forth, it's going to be hard to notice until the effects really pile up over time.

       Nah, coz we've been smoking weed for way longer than it's legal. It's the best drug out there.

       The worrysome part is Monsanto's involvement, looking to patent strains and such. If they're allowed to grow and sell weed in any way shape or form, it's all bad.

       If that's his plan it won't work.  Most people I hang out with don't care for its effects.  They would rather drink.  Myself included.

      <p>
       This actually lines up with real research done on the subject that I have read.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen alcohol and illegal opiods cause far more damage personally.  I have never witness weed destroying someone's life or kill a parent or child like I have with illegal opiods.

       The only thing that I don't like about Cannabis legality is people putting it in candy and children getting it.  But prohibition is far more harmful to people.

       No one has ever died from Cannabis but innocent people are robbed, killed, and harassed by criminals and police due to its prohibition.

       Yeah prohibitionism represents one of the dark factions of American society, but Soros is on the other end.
Cannabis, though in rare cases, does case violent aggression, anxiety, psychosis, and so forth.  The problem is it's more habit forming than is being admitted, and while you can stay high forever and theoretically function and not die, when you are a heavy user and run out of weed you can sometimes go mental.

       I've seen better arguments made about the dangers of video games.  I know it's not harmless.  It may cause problems for some.  But nothing compared to the harms of prohibition.  You mention more people going to the ER.  They are not in danger.  Just anxious.  If anything this is proof that for some people being stoned is not fun at all.  Notice that people who OD on opiods go straight to the morgue.  Opiods are still the opiod of the masses.  That and sports.

       Not denying that it can be addictive but the same type personality would also get addicted to gambling or sex so is it the feeling or physically the substance like heroin? I dont think so. When used properly weed can be an exit door to opiates and that benefit alone makes those that abuse it unfortunate but a safer alternative to some of the treatments that quickly become years and sometimes lifelong habits themselves!

       Exit door is not established yet.  Gateway drug might not be true for most users, but weed is a gateway to society normalization of recreational mind-altering substances.  Some people only smoke weed, but lots combine with booze, and also other drugs.  It's not either/or.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "only people who are already assholes will become assholes with weed" is such a bad argument.  Weed is habit forming, and it has more to do with how frequently one uses than whether one has "an addictive personality".

       I know as far as substances making me lose time friends jobs sanity I can honestly say that weed has never been on that list. On the list of spending money and subsequent law enforcement records (and slight insanity that follows THAT ORDEAL) weed is certainly on the list so I suppose I am approaching it on the angle of myself only. That isnt speaking for the world I know but I can also attest to weed being the only thing that I can still 'pick up and put down' without agony and assistance. I hope that it can serve others in this way and hope that it will one day soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assholes with weed theory isnt a great one but I was speaking on terms of PHYSICAL ADDICTION. Try getting into a rehab for weed addiction without some cushy insurance policy and see how far you get...I would be willing to go as far as to say that IF they took you they marked your chart as DUAL DIAGNOSIS. I am not trying to minimize emotional addictions I am saying people arent ODing on things that arent physically addictive and dying (except FOOD and is that a physical addiction? I digress) The pain of withdrawl is what usually brings folks back to the dope and before you know it they are a full blown junky again. Weed CERTAINLY curbs that pain of withdrawl and that makes it a winner in my book. Should laws kowtow to people that are potentially "addicted to weed" I dont know but there are plenty that dont kowtow to alcoholics addiction and there is no good coming from that other than MONEY. It isnt helping anyone...weed HAS! We must recognize that and stop trying to play half measure babysitter when it comes to the law and weed...the time is now to let go of some of the control and DEFINATELY THE SCHEDULE1 RECOGNITION!! Anyway I dont have all the answers but have a great one!! PEACE!!

       Emergency room?  Better than the morgue which is where they would be if they OD on alcohol, benzos, or opiods.  Note the weed overdoser will fully recover and not die.  More proof it just isn't an enjoyable experience for many.

       Natural Opium is still the best painkiller out there. There are much more risk with the stuff big pharma pushes these days. The side effects of big pharma will kill you faster than what ails you.

       Ask any real stoner and they'll tell you that weed can become a major problem.
I'm forced to take a break atm.but since 2013 I used it all day everyday, let's just say I was kind of psychotic for five straight years.
Of course the establishment would want the world hooked on pot, it pacifies you and leaves you content with whatever state you're in, which jn their case is allowing your life to be take care of and dictated by the program.
It's disgusting when I walked into this one dispensary in San Diego they had a magazine eith transgender people right on the front cover, pushing the whole post-gender narrative on the stoners (gender has absolutely nothing to do with getting high) the whole magazine was nothing but social engineering and propaganda vomit.
Don't support the "legal marijuana" industry at all, either grow it or learn to enjoy life sober.

       My hope is that the "harm" from marijuana will be felt
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       after normalization carries on.  I'd say we're only into normalization starting in 2016, and even in 2018 it's just starting to become "okay" for "normal" people to get high.
      </p>
      <p>
       If weed "hurts" people really up front, we'll wise up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fine if people get high, but there's
       <em>
        a ton
       </em>
       of delusion right now about weed being safe.  People can even use cocaine, even sometimes opiates, if they go into it as fully brain-developed adults who understand the risks and how to manage them.

       Also I just want to are that for the first couple of years I was doing weed I kept asking myself "is this actually pleasant or am I fooling myself" the whole time I would be battling to control my thoughts and the anxiety ... No it's really not all that it's cracked up to be.
It's just "better" than alcohol because it won't make you extremely ill the next day and you can use it 24/7 ...
I thought about it honestly the other day and I much more prefer alcohol, which isn't to say that alcohol isn't a potentially harmful (it is) I just started being more honest with myself.
Vaping though is much more pleasant and I would do it again but I'm happy to be t-breaking again (I'm in an illegal state atm).

       Alcohol is actually very harmful, but compared to weed: 1) Its harms are much more obvious 2) It destroys body and mind in obvious ways, and is habit forming, and is similar like cannabis to any drug, but unlike cannabis it doesn't hack your "self-delusion" or "relationship" centers as deliberately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about alcohol is that despite drunkeness in traditionally impoverished societies, people in functional first-world work ethic cultures
       <em>
        don't drink that often
       </em>
       .  Weed, IMO, is much more insidious and the only reason its use is moderated has been social stigma.

       That's bullshit.
Marijuana makes you think you're fine and dandy but all it's doing is masking the problems not actually curing them.

       Yea this whole post is bullshit. If anything, cannabis expands the mind and enables you to question the situation you find yourself in. So whole notion of it being harmful on a societal level is bonkers.

       This is actually horseshit.  Marijuana masks emotional issues, and in the process deepens them.  As long as you are basically high most of the time, or a lot of the time, weed will keep emotional issues in check (not always though).  But there's a price you pay for that, and if you ever run low on weed or it starts to make you sick or whatever and you have to quit, then you're in a much worse place emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, weed makes you "believe" like you're more balanced.  It's called drugs, dawg.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the short term, weed will paper over society's issues and things will temporarily seem better, but nothing will be fixed and the chickens will come home to roost eventually.  Which is why Soros, who clearly wants to neuter America (he destabilizes countries for profit and ideology), is pushing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real harm comes from broken families and a bad economy.  But marijuana helps divert us from fixing those problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, psychological research does show that marijuana use exacerbates anxiety etc.  Again, your shitty mood - which gets worse over time, the baseline that is, if you use - improves
       <em>
        while you are high
       </em>
       .  But the idea that cannabis balances you is one of those self-delusions I'm talking about.

       Again, who gives a shit what other people do for fun, as long as it doesn't harm others. Alcohol and other recreational party drugs kill people all the time at events where the sole purpose is to let go and have fun. Cannabis is still at 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your biggest point is that it would breed widespread complacency in society. I argue the opposite. People would wake the fuck up much quicker if used in the correct setting. That doesn't mean everyone who smokes dope has to use it for mind expansion or education, they can do whatever the fuck they want with it because that's their unalienable right as human adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yea no shit consuming a psychoactive drug during teen years where the brain is still in heavy development would cause long term memory recall and mood issues. That's why it's cutoff at a legal age of 21.
