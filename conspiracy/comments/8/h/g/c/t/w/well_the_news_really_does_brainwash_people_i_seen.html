    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Right.. why not mention Asian along with blacks and Hispanics? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Asian demographic is nonsense. It includes Japan, The Philippines, India, Pakistan and China along with every other Asian ethnicity. These countries have few similarities and shouldn&#39;t be grouped together in the first place. Even places like China and Japan alone are way too different as Japan is hard right and China is far left.</p>

<p>This is why no one bothers to appeal to them and this is why they are virtually unrepresented on the national stage. It&#39;s borderline impossible and a waste of time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That graphic only tells me one thing and that’s that white are the only people that seem to support Trump nationwide. I wonder why that is...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blacks have been voting left for 50 years and according to most of them, the country has done nothing for them and is designed to destroy them. Seems like voting right wouldn&#39;t hurt at this point. Also, Dem ruled cities are not only the most expensive but also tend to be the most violent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope, but since you brought it up, here&#39;s a webpage that I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t read on various ways illegals can vote: <a href="https://fairus.org/issue/societal-impact/noncitizens-voting-violations-and-us-elections">https://fairus.org/issue/societal-impact/noncitizens-voting-violations-and-us-elections</a></p>

<p>Either way, hispanic birthrates are much higher than non-hispanic vote rates in the US. The more you import in, the more votes you are going to get. And we do know even up to the 2nd generation, Hispanics vote 70% left: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/t2jAuqr">https://imgur.com/a/t2jAuqr</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That “crime map” you posted isn’t actually a crime map you realize that right? It’s an election results map.. as seen <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Emejn/election/2012/">here</a>. So that point is invalid. </p>

<p>And of course it shouldn’t surprise me that you can’t link me to actual voter fraud happening on the level you’re accusing. Because there wasn’t any. </p>

<p>Here’s the thing. Perhaps Hispanic and African Americans tend to lean left because the left doesn’t have a figurehead calling Hispanic immigrants rapists. And there isn’t a figurehead on the left that will defend a symbol of racism and slavery like the right does. It’s not that hard, want the minorities to vote for you? Don’t treat them like minorities and as if they are beneath you. </p>

<p>How would we know? They aren&#39;t supposed to be here nor voting anyway and if we are tracking them, they shouldn&#39;t be here.</p>

<p>I mean it’s not like Trump himself established his own voter fraud committee. Oh wait he did. I wonder how that turned out seeing as it is a republican backed commission surely they’ll find something! Oh they found zero evidence. Huh. It’s almost like...there wasn’t any voter fraud that occurred?? But how else are we gonna explain how minorities don’t like Trump! </p>

<p>Right. Here’s the thing. 41 states refused to hand over  names, IDs, addresses, and the end of social security numbers. Last I checked, the majority of this sub would be vehemently against giving so much personal data to the government. I mean I assume you were against The NSA collections your data right? Also, 41 States, many of which are firm red states had issues with it. If a number of states that you initially posted about in your original post had issues with the commission than obviously there was something fucking wrong with the commission. Like perhaps they purposely made it to fail so people like you can have talking points about non-existent issues.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you call crashing iirc 4 planes, and getting himself captured serving his country well?  Then there was the Keating 5 scandal, right?  Did you know that McCain actually stood in the way of POWs coming home?  He and Kerry in fact didn&#39;t even bother to attend meetings with other former POWs back in the 1980s.  The man is scum, and these are only a few tiny examples of how horrible he is.  His FATHER covered up the murders of the men on the USS LIBERTY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many who hold the viewpoint that <a href="http://archive.is/TSmpY">his actions on the deck of the USS Forrestal, doing &#39;wet starts&#39;</a> caused the firing of a Zuni missile from the jet positioned directly behind him.  This missile then hit other aircraft and ruptured fuel tanks, causing fires which then exploded at least two bombs on the carrier&#39;s deck.</p>

<p>Several web sites have labeled this account as an incorrect description of this catastrophe which caused the deaths of 134 and non-lethal injuries to 161.  No official investigations placed any blame on McCain, but no official investigations placed any blame on Israel for the attack on the USS Liberty, either.  McCain&#39;s father played a key role in the Navy&#39;s own investigation of the USS Liberty.  None of the investigations offered any explanation as to why the Zuni missile was caused to be fired.</p>

<p>I personally believe that the most plausible explanation is found in the information published by Wayne Madsen, the official investigations notwithstanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>McCain has propose some of the worst ideas that would if enacted severely hurt veteran and disabled veteran populations across this country.  </p>

<p>He has been in tge pocket of big defense since Moses was a baby.  </p>

<p>He should have resigned from the Senate THE VERY DAY he was diagnosed with brain cancer. He is a grandiose attention whore who would have been worse than Trump as President.  </p>

<p>I dont mean to discount his military service nor cast bad mojo regarding his brain cancer but the guy needs to be out of government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is especially true in Australia.
Were kept in the dark and fed bullshit like a bunch of mushrooms. Its all feel good news and scear tactics to keep everyone inline and waving the &quot;white Australia flag&quot; 
No mention of the rohingya massacre or the massive crack in the ice killing emperor penguins or yemen or growing homlessness due to a broken system of unfairness and no one seams to care that China is only a step away from invading us and killing us all.
We are a bunch of mushrooms kept in the dark and fed bullshit.</p>
