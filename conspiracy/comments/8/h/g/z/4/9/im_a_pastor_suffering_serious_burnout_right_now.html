       So my church experience today did the opposite of the intention of this trip. Instead of rejuvenating me, I just wanted to quit the ministry more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The church was pretty sweet. They had the children's ministry make a craft to honor the nurses in the audience. I loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They focus on a missionary a month and showed a video of this month's missionary. Loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worship leader was humble and not one of the arrogant rockstars. Loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the sermon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The preacher did a good job, but he never delivered a challenging application at all. It was a solid expository message from the story of the early apostles refusing to obey the state in Acts 4. Yet it never challenged their idols. And if this is what people want to hear, then I am destined for failure. I'm too challenging. He preached from anti-government texts, throwing in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego too, without ever making the application or asking what in our government needs to be resisted. He never even mentioned anything about America in it. He just kept it historical and full of spiritualese. And he is the pastor of a bigger church.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so disillusioned right now. If this is what people want, I'm so ill equipped to deliver. And I don't want to deliver or be part of that.

       I understand your thoughts on this. I have not been to a church in over a year because the church no longer resembles what it was supposed to. Instead of helping people strengthen their beliefs and relationship with christ the pastors push their agendas on to their congregation. The congregation is using church as a place to show off their new clothes and cars and jewelry. I strengthen my spirituality on my own. When you mention quiting the ministry are thinking about abandoning your faith or just finding a new calling?

       I draw serious issue with this. You should be a guiding hand presenting what the Bible preaches. The pastor did right. However, it is not your job to tell the masses how to act. Let them use the ethics given and draw thier own conclusions, rather than be simple minded sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, you are attempting to tie politics to religion. Why? There are many other avenues that could be addressed. Why is politics in religion so important to you?

       Totally offtopic, but I'm just tired of all the warmongering and fighting. First Islam with it's rebels and fighting. If your telling me Christianity is going the rebel route you guys will have to deal with people like me. Like hell will I let the US become like the Middle East.

       I think it is more of being against the warmongering and fighting too. I think that is one area we oppose our government on. And when I think of Christian rebelling, it should always be nonviolent. Think of Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.

       What you’re missing is that it’s not about the religion, ts about your relationship with God. It’s easy to get lost in being extremely bored because you think God doesn’t want you to do things you like to do. As long as you’re not hurting anyone, you should live your best life full of love. That’s what God truly wants.

       Us feeling like that will probably subliminally make it happen but all we can do is live our lives with love and without fear and pray that God / Fate protects us... at the end of the day there is NOTHING we can do about the system. This plan has been in motion for thousands of years and they won’t get derailed ever.. remember OCCUPY Wall Street.. they infiltrated that REAL quick

       I think there is a massive demand for what you seem to want to provide. I see Jesus as someone who rebelled against the Satanic powers that be, and was crucified for it. This is the sort of message that I think people are hungry for. Perhaps you can find a way to deliver it, even if it means you go independent.

       I'm no man of the Bible, though i'm pretty sure God said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It might be shit, it might look pointless, keep your chin up. Fuckers will fool suckers, always will always have. Keep preaching that real good shit. When things get bad just remember; there's somebody out there in a shittier situation than you and they may one day look to you for help. If your sacrifice can save but one life, then it was worth it."

       Although in the old testament it read:
      </p>

       "I killed/will kill (delete as appropriate) my own son motherfucker, so quit your bitching and chin up"

       It's been my experience that when "man" fails to deliver what I desire regarding spiritual knowledge/recharging, it's usually Gods way of telling me he wants to have a talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Important plot point (I'm pretty sure you'll understand this) regarding the talk, God does all the talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you express your spiritual burnout and needed to "spiritually rejuvenate" but didn't find what you were seeking says alot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend using your internal desire to spiritually rejuvenate as the link to enter the conversation with him. Tap into that feeling and go with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       Pretty sure you are asking the wrong sub, lol, but as an agnostic religion-averse person who nonetheless sees the potential value in religion, it seems to me that you can either choose to be the change you want to see within that community, or bail.
       <br/>
       Maybe make a pros/cons list, and then ignore that and meditate for a long time, then maybe go back to the pros/cons list with a fresh eye if you're still not sure what to do.
I don't understand how one anecdote like this is the breaking point for you; is this guy's myopic sermon the rule or just one mode in competition with a more honest/radical sort of ministry that you could find?

       Yeah. That's what I'm thinking too. Because I wouldn't want to go to this church, I should just stay in the ministry working to bring about the church I feel called to be part of.
      </p>

       But this one situation isn't the breaking point. It's a total frustration that I'm trying to get out of.

       I think it may be the rule, but as a pastor, I am usually in the church I pastor at.

       Mmm.  This reminds me of various friends of mine in the teaching profession who've either burned out or came close to it.  I'd like to believe that they should just keep fighting the good fight, but I also can't blame people for quitting the whole scene in disgust if that's what it comes to.  Either way, good luck to you!

       Thank you for your service.  I believe it is about what God wants, not about what people want.  People are corrupted by evil while God is not.  That said, it is important to consider the way to best reach people about what God wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the word of God contains answers to your questions.  As always, you can ask God too!  The tough part sometimes is opening yourself up to receive His message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, what is the root source of your disillusionment?  There, I usually find the evil one.

       I think the pastor can't say anything specific due to laws in America- the separation of church and state. Just like pastors can't say vote for X or support Y politics. Maybe I'm missing something but yes often the people in church don't want much, they just want to feel safe with a little holier than thou attitude to their community that they show off or just hide. People don't want to actually be radical they try to fit their church stuff in on Sunday morning and maybe a couple hours here and there for a bake sale or carwash.

       Let me ask you two questions:
- Are you saved?
- How do you know that you are saved?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, if you want to operate as a good pastor, you should stick to the bible only.. and only teach from the bible. You should know better than me, even in the Bible it states that you should study it. 
I am working my ass off to make a living and in the end of the day, someone should guide me and help with understanding the different texts.
I’m sticking with Robert Breaker (can be found on YouTube)..

       As someone who has served in ministry in the past, good on you for recognizing that you're burnt out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did you go into ministry? Were you called by God? Are you certain and how do you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should worry less about what people want to hear and more about faithfully preaching God's Word. Theologically I would challenge your assertions that Christ intended His Church to be anti-religion. Remember the give to ceasar parts as well as Paul's teaching on respect for the state. Keep in mind their context was way more adverse to Christians than ours is in America. Nowhere in the Bible are you going to find prescriptive verses to back up the idea of being anti-government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm misunderstanding you. Would love to chat further.

       I definitely felt a call by God. And then I left the ministry years ago because of a personal family crisis that put me in a place of not trusting God. I was healed of that spiritual issue and, honestly, had a very strange calling back. A middle of the night, waking from my sleep, need to contact a complete stranger who was fasting to have people called to the ministry. So I went back in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry. I didn't meant to say that the church should always be anti-government. It's just the texts the pastor used yesterday were that way. They were stories about opposing the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am totally in agreement with you on taxation. We are to be a blessing to those around us. The nations we reside in should be better from our presence. Although, at certain times on certain issues, we do need to not go along. In a way, that is still making our nation better.

       The first time was twenty-two years ago, so my recollection is fuzzy. I became a Christian in college. And this one wasn't miraculous or anything. I just felt an overwhelming urge to pursue ministry. I had to turn down a pretty significant opportunity to pursue the ministry. It was confirmed by others in my life. I changed gears and pursued that path.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second one was much stranger. This was around 11 years after that first one. I left the ministry around two years before. We had lost twins in a stillbirth. :( Anyway, I really lost my trust in God through that experience. I left the ministry as I was in no point to minister. Maybe a healthier church could have helped me through it. I don't honestly know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I woke up one night and heard what almost seemed like an audible voice. Contact.........[a name]. I didn't even know this guy. He spoke once at my college a decade before this. I thought it was crazy and didn't obey. And then it happened again. So I got up in the middle of the night, did some googling and found this guy's email, and sent him a strange message saying that I felt God wanted me to contact him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony of that whole situation was that this man and a group of others had felt led to start fasting and praying for people to feel called to the ministry. We had a conversation about it, and I changed directions to head back into the ministry. Not too long after that point, I was asked to minister at the church that I am currently at. Although, I did leave for another church for a period of time. They, in something I rarely hear of, hired me back. I've been here, except for that nine months away, for nearly nine years. I have a sabbatical next year. I think I could use it this year though.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may seem all really strange. It may be. Anyway, that clear calling has carried me through at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through talking with a closer friend yesterday, who himself left the ministry a few years back, he gave me this good advice. I am more prophetic in my calling (not in the future predicting way but in the calling out injustice sort of way) and not as pastoral. Because of this, a pastoral message rubbed me wrongly. I need to be more gracious toward people with other callings and gracious toward myself. Although the church I am pastoring is growing in every way, I do seem to run people off. And that hurts me tremendously. Every time. I have other friends in the ministry who can just brush it off. I don't have the confidence to do that and also have a lot of empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I was listening to that sermon yesteday, I was like, "Now's the time to hit the home run" and the pastor would just move on. He wasn't there to nail the point home. And that may be because his calling is different. I guess I may just have to learn to be comfortable with my calling. My friend described it as the "thorn in my side." I struggle with erroneously viewing the world like Elijah did when he thought there were no followers of God. And a call to just live in grace more and more. That's way more than I wanted to share, but there it is.

       Just a couple of thoughts here.. I felt burn out about church services at times especially Catholic services (although I'm not in ministry). I found that in order to fully understand the Lord's messages I had to go and find them myself. There is soooo much they just don't focus on in most sermons' I have attended. So I stopped going and focus on my relationship with the kingdom of my own volition, not cause its Sunday. If you do continue to preach, please inform people how many times Jesus warned that by following his precepts you will be bombarded by the darkness. I feel like they only preach "The Good News" which is cool.. I like good news just as much as the next person.. But there is a lot more less-than-good news about the difficulties that will arise by following him. I feel like its more of a game of can you handle it? The persecution. Those really trying to do their best for the kingdom know what I'm talkin about. I think people need a different message you know? Like one not involving politics at all. Ephesians 6:12. People will need a real pastor to turn to when shit gets real. Lord knows we outnumbered down here. Just another sinner wishing you the best on your path.

       You should switch religions bub. Fusing theology with populist revolution is so much easier in a certain Religion of Peace which already has the promotion of anarchy and genocide built into it and not in an ambiguous way forcing you to stretch Biblical parables out of context and string together random verses to pick and choose the version of Christianity that suits you.

       I bet you're a liberal.

       Keep your politics out of the pulpit. Because even if you do find a hate preacher who dings all your bells for overthrowing the US govt, that preacher is just going to end up being watched by FBI informers and have his every word recorded in his dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying any congregation should just bend over and obey the govt without question, but the church is the wrong place to do it.

       Totally offtopic, but I'm just tired of all the warmongering and fighting. First Islam with it's rebels and fighting. If your telling me Christianity is going the rebel route you guys will have to deal with people like me. Like hell will I let the US become like the Middle East.
