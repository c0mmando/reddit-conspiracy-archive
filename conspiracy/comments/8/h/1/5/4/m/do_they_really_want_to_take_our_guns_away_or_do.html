       I was thinking today because I was bored at work and was listening to a podcast heavily centered around guns and gun violence (for anyone who's interested it was Joe Rogans episode with Colion Noir) now one of the biggest and most popular conspiracies that I see on the internet and on this sub in particular, is that the government ultimately wants to disarm its citizens and this is the reason for false flag gun violence, left leaning media regarding a gun agenda, etc. Etc. But it got me thinking a little deeper. A very high percentage of gun violence is linked to psychiatric medication (especially antidepressants) right? This is a correlation that is pretty heavily documented. In fact the pharmaceutical companies in this country make RIDICULOUS money on antidepressants and it keeps rising. The % of people on antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs went up from 7-11% in the last decade. I think if we, as a country, delved deep into the real reason for these shootings (mental issues) we would start making a more widespread and mass realization that the drugs our kids are being fed are not good. Imagine millions of Americans protesting against antidepressants how much that would hurt pharmaceutical companies. Big pharma is so insanely corrupt and money driven, I really think they want us talking about guns. The government knows that we will be in a constant loop of an argument about gun issues and I think they're happy we arent talking about the pharmaceutical issues.

       I think taking away the 300 million guns we got is a fool's errand. But there are fools that want to try.

       I agree the gun debate is being pushed on us with some agenda in mind, but I'm on the fence about the cause. So many topics are about dividing us and keeping us from focusing on deeper issues, so it may be as simple as that. But after reading about how Australia was disarmed and suspicious information about the Port Arthur massacre, I do wonder whether a larger agenda to disarm and control Americans is afoot.

       I'm sure there are some groups trying. We got a huge gun population here though...this is going to sound like a right wing talking point :(
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we disarm normal people it just gives criminals wayyy more power. And after they do that, it will make normal people criminals, the ones trying to protect themselves and their familie.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can talk ad nauseam about the decisions that led up to this problem. But we have to deal with reality. Criminalizing guns makes criminals out of us all.

       Isn't it frustrating that one cannot speak in favor of gun rights without being pegged as a right-wing extremist? Just goes to show how effective their divide-and-conquer tactics really are.

      <p>
       Wish we could be more like Switzerland where citizens are required to own funds for national protection. They don't have regular mass shootings either. Is that because they have better mental health care? Because they have a history and culture of responsible gun ownership? Or because they don't have an FBI deliberately encouraging radicalization, providing access to weapons, and setting the stage for false flag crisis events?

       One option to address this problem after a blanket ban would be to impose significantly stricter sentences for selling or possessing a firearm. Right now, unlawful possession in most states gets you 0-5 years in prison and/or a ~$1000 fine. Bump that up to 20 or 30 years (maybe life?) and fines closer to $100k and you are certain to see the number of guns on the street drop over a decade. And any time someone is apprehended with a gun (or one is found), it can be permanently destroyed.

       There are already stiff penalties on the books, many of them Federal felonies, for illegal gun possession.  It's not that they need to make the penalties stiffer, it's that there's not enough prosecution of them and unless they're egregious, the Feds don't want to prosecute every local thug caught with a cheap handgun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you could penalize gun ownership enough to make a blanket ban reduce the number of guns but it would still take decades.  Most would gamble that they'd never get caught or that it would be worth the risk and would not turn in their guns, leaving a large supply of weapons to leak into the illegal market for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd also wind up creating vast organized gun trafficking cartels which would surely create awful corruption just like it has with drugs or with alcohol prohibition.  I never hear this mentioned, which is surprising.  There may be problems with widespread civilian ownership of firearms, but what you minimize through legal sales and regulation is the black market for guns.  There's a black market now, but its much smaller than it would be if guns were blanket banned.

       It's never going to happen, the legislation will be a mess. They're just going to put a bullshit regulation in place every time a mass shooting occurs, bc the NRA kind of owns one of the two major political parties....

       One step below Pharma pushing a gun ban to protect their grift is the divide between gun owners and gun banners. It is definitely a
       <strong>
        divide and conquer

       issue, a polarizer. Furthermore, it is an emotional issue which, as we know, reduces critical thinking and causes us to excrete adrenalin and corticosteroids.

       Take a look at the other major divisive issues, pretty much a checklist of the Soros Network,

       racism, immigration, gun control, minimum wage. Essentially he, the neocon zionists, and the bankers all have an agenda, one balkanized world, culled, mixed race, one currency, one government, totalitarian and nanny state in one. To do that they have to make us stupid and talking
       <em>

       Its an interesting dichotomy that many people ignore. The deep state simutainstly wants to disarm america but keep america at perpetual war. Wouldnt it make more sense that they want to overwhelmingly arm america because they are in bed with the military industrial complex. Your AR15 aint gonna do jack shit against a tomahawk missile launched from 200 miles away. But what things like mass shootings will do is make the NRA say "liberals are coming for your guns. buy buy buy." thus the same people in the deep state profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the "deep state wants to disarm you" is a literal disinfo campaign. Let's remember that people like hitler didnt disarm anyone. They disarmed "unwanteds".

       Hitler literally disarmed entire countries. Day one of the Netherlands invasion a new law was created. You have 48 hours to hand in your gun or the punishment to anyone who had a gun was excecution.

      <p>
       This seems like the disinfo. The last free standing continent is NA and it's extremely well armed. Of course they want to take the guns away. But it's not a 2 day process, they are happy to take 2-3 generations to achieve the goal.

       They really do want to take our guns away so they can take away our most important and unwritten right - self defense.  These people literally want everything managed, defined, and enforced by the state (except for those of the state, who are exempt from the rules ... there's a name for that!).  This is already basically in effect in places in Europe where it's more of an offense to harm a criminal in the act than it is to commit the act of the criminal.

       The threat of gun control is great for gun producers. A soon as the weekly spree killing happens gun control is threatened and gun sales rise. Of course the guns don't really get banned or taken away but someone usually makes a lot of money out of it.

       its the little whiteys that shoot up schools. at least the gang members only kill themselves (for the most part). i am far more scared of an unhappy teenage whitey than a gang member of the same age. you just dont see blacks or women shoot up groups of people like you do white males in their adolescence. With the recent exception of Mr. Paddock in vegas, who was also... wait for it.... here it comes.... WHITE. L.O.L.

       I think what they are saying is that guns are not protecting our rights. The government can come after you one way or another, guns or no guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the post, guns are a classic wedge issue, no different than abortion. It is a particularly good issue for Republicans (or at least it has been until now) because the gun rights issue divides those who are more liberal in the following way:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is liberal to allow individual citizens to own or do what they want to, and to maximize Constitutional rights. Gun ownership is an example. The most liberal among us would prefer to allow relatively unfettered gun ownership and work on the deeper factors causing all the deaths. Of course, this would be very expensive and complicated, but in the long run, it would be a win-win.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Others with fairly liberal views want to restrict gun proliferation to save lives immediately for the protection of innocent individuals in society.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Could it be they are stalling until they have an AI robot army to properly disarm the public. Lot of funding going to that recently. I have a hard time beleiving the military would help them disarm the very people they fight for, but a robot doesn't care. Purely speculation though.

       The real question is who are "they"? Because the reality is, no one is taking your guns away. But for some reason your are convinced they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of actors have a vested interest FOR and AGAINST gun control and is almost always based in fear mongering.
&amp;nbsp;
Fear mongering rallies votes. (politicians)
&amp;nbsp;
Fear mongering promotes gun sales $$$. (lobbyist/corporations)
&amp;nbsp;
Fear mongering pushes legislation used to oppress and control the poor/minorities. (government/1%)
&amp;nbsp;
Fear mongering creates civil unrest and division, this can be used as a form of psychological warfare domestically or internationally. (government/foreign aggression)

       You are right about the fear aspect, and the many correlations that have derived.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are against self defense and pro-police - you've played right into their hands. Every man and woman should have the right to defend themselves and their property (if that's even a real thing anymore due to property tax) - might as well be indentured servants.

       As someone who has been on antidepressants and other mood medicines, I have to throw in my 2 cents here. Antidepressants do good. The 7-11% increase you talked about could be something else. Think about it, autism diagnosis has skyrocketed in the past few years to bring around 1/100 kids. It's not because we've introduced something into the system. It's because we have gotten better  at identifying it and being able to treat it. The same may be for depression. And fun fact, a lot of antidepressants also work as anxiolytics. They serve a dual purpose. Would you rather have people have these disorders and not be treated or have a treatment that may have some side effects, which by the way are only in around 5-10% of the population taking them if that, or have people medicated and able to live seemingly normal lives?

       If they can get rid of the guns, they will do so. It will make the society less lethal, and therefore, more acceptable. It will also be more controllable, obviously.

       Tech needs material to function. Planes don't fly if you can burn or take control of the fuel they need before it gets to them. Hell the main air superiority fighters can barely even deal with FOD, and trashing runways isn't technically too hard either if they're within reach. The reason why it's lopsided when on the other side of the world, is those fighting in opposition can't reach the supply lines or bases of operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it turns topsy-turvy on the home turf, that is no longer the case. Anyone with a competent military strategy will act to shut down what's needed for the high-tech stuff to work in fairly short order. Then it's back to the old school of who can put the most boots on the ground and/or win the most people over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason it hasn't happened, is that shutting off resources means limiting availability for
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       . There will be a rush to secure the more important resources, and what the civilian populace is allowed will mostly be rationed. Things currently aren't near bad enough to warrant going that far, as there would be obvious backlash to those that tried. If dissent reaches a high enough level where people would understand, then it'd be another story.

       My bet is they will try what they can to continue to chip away at our gun rights, but they won't make the big move until SHTF in some way or another. Maybe with China's help? Who knows.

       Every time there's a nationally prominent shooting, there's an argument about guns, and a run on guns and ammo.  Those gun manufacturers donate to politicians, so it's in their interest to not ever do anything meaningful about the gun problem, which isn't a gun problem, but a symptom of a societal attitude (not morality) problem.  We love guns and war and violence and tribalism.

       It's not the government that wants everyone to keep arguing about guns, it's the NRA, which is specifically being funded by the Russians in order to sow propaganda and keep the American populace divided. Also, you are entirely wrong about mental health issues leading to gun violence, that's a popular myth. Not to mention your idea of distracting the populace with the gun debate is simply ludicrous. Political conversations are not mutually exclusive, the American public can deal with pharmaceutical issues at the same time as gun control issues. In reality the U.S. has a huge issue with gun violence compared to the rest of the developed world, but the NRA and gun lobby makes too much money from current gun laws and don't want any common sense gun control laws passed. Please get your head out of your ass, thanks.

       Governments are banning high capacity magazines, creating age restrictions, banning fully automatic firearms, banning all aftermarket items that can make your firearm shoot "faster", they have and are banning accessories that can make a firearm more reliable, easier to use, and more comfortable to use (flash/sound suppressors).

       We have background checks that can deny someone a weapon based solely on something from their past, and many states want to
       <em>
        expand
       </em>
       that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think they actually want to get rid of guns.

       Wait in your mind are LEO's part of the deep state that want to disarm the population for nefarious purposes or are you just saying they get nervous and paranoid and want to be the only ones with the guns? I can see the latter being true but not the former.

       Being with myself on the wrong side of the mental health thingy, meant I was able to disconnect, that REM’s body will deal with this. I’m just kicking back on autopilot.  I don’t think anyone should be worried at guns being taken away. Americans in my limited opinion should starve their system through pure love.  The system rewards shot term “forgetting room no.s” 
But why be annoyed? So what? 
What if we are in the middle of the funniest shoulder shrugg so face to only construction a little ripple that I cans smirk to and think of Dr Grant.
