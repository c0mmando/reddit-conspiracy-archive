        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hate Facts (also referred to as truth bombs) are uncomfortable truths that make people angry. The taboo nature of such facts trigger deep emotions in those who have been culturally conditioned to believe that the facts themselves, and those espousing them, are morally inferior. This self perception of moral superiority is enough to dismiss any and all factual claims through pejorative accusations while never actually addressing the facts themselves.</p>

<p>Hate facts are not to be confused with Hate Speech, although it is often labeled as such by those who wish to ignore the facts presented to them. Whereas hate facts are nothing more than factual information presented as an argument, hate speech is derogatory language used pejoratively with no intention of educating an individual or group. This creates a dangerous scenario since mainstream culture, which drives political discourse, is often in conflict with systematic realities. The suppression of dissidents attempting to spread factual truths to their fellow citizens are then suppressed through false accusations of hate, rendering society less flexible to correct its flaws early enough to avoid widespread harm. This is often easy to do, since many have been enculturated early on to believe that individuals who fit a political label are immoral and should be shunned.</p>

<p>There are several psychological reasons why individuals may act adversely to someone presenting factual claims. The first is that of conditioning, a psychological phenomenon discovered by Ivan Pavlov in his famous study of dogs. Pavlov discovered that the dogs in his laboratory would salivate when hearing a bell that rang. This bell was rung when the dogs were fed, and they began to associate the external stimuli (the bell) with food. This involuntary response is called a conditioned reflex.</p>

<p>Like dogs, humans are also susceptible to conditioned reflexes. From the time we are children, our schools, churches, media and other institutions bombard us with values and belief systems. Such repetition over long periods of time causes crystallization to occur in one&#39;s identity and perception of reality. While there is still much to learn about these mechanisms, recent research has discovered that when these views are challenged, increased activity in the default mode networkâ€”a set of interconnected structures in the brain, occurs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these values and beliefs often conflict with empirical realities. By the time an individual comes into contact with facts that place their worldview in opposition with reality, they are incapable of critical analysis and experience dissonance. Left with no argument to defend one&#39;s previously established worldview, accusations of &quot;hate&quot; are far simpler and less cognitively demanding.</p>

<p>After reanalyzing the same dataset used by Putnam, Abascal and Baldassari asserted that when it comes to distrust and diversity, most of the distrust is expressed by Whites who feel uncomfortable living amongst racial minorities. In other words, greater distrust may stem from prejudice rather than from diversity per se.</p>

<p>Just to make sure we are discusing the same word: Definition of prejudice: preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.</p>

<p>If you are white- have you ever been in predominately black or Latino neighborhoods? They can be pretty hostile especially after dusk.

<p>From a purely linguistic sense, it doesn&#39;t follow the same construction as hate speech or hate crime, in which the person carrying out the speech or action is motivated to do so out of hatred (or so the theory goes). In the case of hate facts, are you saying you believe them to be facts because of your hatred for someone? I&#39;m just not sure why you need the word hate here at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a play on words. The &quot;alt right&quot; uses the term hate facts because of how &quot;liberals&quot; react to them. They can&#39;t even address them because they trigger cognitive dissonance that if addressed would shatter their delicate world view. This is when the person using &quot;hate fscts&quot; is labeled a bigot or anti Semitic for just laying out an observable trend or a uncomfortable fact. It&#39;s a way to dispel the power of words like &quot;hate speech&quot;. </p>

<p>I see &quot;hate facts&quot; as a very powerful memetic term that if used properly can change the frame of a discussion.</p>

<p>It shows that some people won&#39;t look at empirical evidence because their world view won&#39;t allow it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get that, I just find it rhetorically ineffective. </p>

<p>The utility of &quot;hate speech&quot; as a concept is that a culture or subculture can effectively censor certain types of speech by deeming them &quot;hateful,&quot; and creating a conditioned response to accusations thereof. It conditions people within the culture to censor others&#39; speech for being &quot;hateful,&quot; as well as a self-censorship of the same. And it&#39;s quite effective. </p>

<p>&quot;Hate facts&quot; as a concept seems to be a satire of &quot;hate speech&quot; turned on itself, but fails IMO because 1) the analogy is not accurate, and 2) it does nothing to point out the actual flaw in the idea of hate speech. It&#39;s the rhetorical equivalent &quot;nuh uh, you too!&quot; It might rally one&#39;s own side, but will persuade almost no one from the other side and few onlookers either. </p>

<p>A much more effective rhetorical strategy would be to call these &quot;proscribed facts&quot; or &quot;blacklisted facts.&quot; This gets to the heart of why the concept of hate speech is so dangerous to free speech, because it censors ideas not based on their truth, but because of their alleged implications. It also gets someone who agrees that hate speech should be proscribed to consider their own cognitive dissonance over why something should be proscribed if its true, or could be true. </p>

<p>To be hate fact you would have to cite some science or at least a study supporting your assertion.

    <div class="md"><p>Well he said in the first paragraph what it is.....</p>

<p>Here are some examples I can think of off the top of my head:</p>

<p>1.) Contradictions or passages from religious texts/teachings that clearly go against today&#39;s moral code.  For example, here is a fact:  The ten commandments is sexist.  One of the commandments is &quot;Thou shalt not covet they neighbors wife&quot;.  That is sexist, the wife does not belong to the man.  And where is the commandment <em>for</em> the wife?  She is not an object.</p>

<p>Here is another:  there is a regular claim that Islam is a &quot;religion of peace&quot;.  And, yet, there are numerous verses that call for the murdering of non-believers(often brutally).</p>

<p>Another topic that many people seem to struggle with facts is gender.  As a generality, Males and females are physically different, and have different strengths.  Given equal chances, there are many areas where men will tend to tend to dominate women, regardless of effort or desire.</p>

<p>Another fact:  you are not your culture and it doesn&#39;t belong to you, and this also holds true for everyone you know.</p>

<p>Here is another one:  overwhelmingly, physiologically speaking, the primary factory in weight gain or loss is calorie intake (how much you eat).  If you eat less food you will lose weight, and if you don&#39;t lose weight you are eating too much food.</p>

<p>ok that is some</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let&#39;s say I agree that that is a fact, or at least have the backing of evidence. What is the benefit of calling these hate facts? </p>

<p>From a purely linguistic sense, it doesn&#39;t follow the same construction as hate speech or hate crime, in which the person carrying out the speech or action is motivated to do so out of hatred (or so the theory goes). In the case of hate facts, are you saying you believe them to be facts because of your hatred for someone? I&#39;m just not sure why you need the word hate here at all.</p>
