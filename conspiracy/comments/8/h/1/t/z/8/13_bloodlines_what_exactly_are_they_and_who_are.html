       I don’t know much about It, nor is it discussed on here  as much as I would think. I’ve found a document again on it but still nothing definitive. I know the American presidents and the British royals are related. Where would the rothchilds and such be involved? Who are the Astor’s?

       A lot of those listed families are related to the Rothschilds by blood, the British royals included, however It's an exaggeration to say they are the ones running everything since there a lot of other groups and families that are more powerful than the Roths.

       The Astors, the Kennedys, the british royals, the rockefellers and the Duponts come to mind. The rockefellers are the ones behind Monsanto and the Duponts are the ones behind, well... Dupont. So the Roths are the ones running those companies. However, the people in the black nobility are still significantly more powerful than the Roths.

       It's the old Roman nobility.  They turned into Italian nobility.  Now the Italians call their nobility the Black Nobility... I assume due to their cold, dark, hearts and charcoal-blackened souls.

       The "Red Dragon bloodline" search term will yield some useful videos on YT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fairy mythos also tells the story of this/these bloodlines, it's way more esoteric but super interesting.

       Like, Oberon prince of fairies and Titania princess/queen of fairies.  Oberon is of the Dragon line, which is the Bloodlines name for their male line (or the bloodline descended from Jesus Christ) and Titania is of the Fairy line, which is the Bloodlines name for their female line (or the bloodline descended from Mary Magdalene).

       The Li family clan name from China is one of the 13.  The Li's introduced paper money to China.  Li is like Smith, but there is a "main" Li clan, or "the" Li clan, however one words it.  The current premier in China is a Li, iirc, and they often are Li clan members.

       There are old wealth bloodlines (Royal/Papal-Black Nobility), and new wealth bloodlines (Rothschild, Rockefeller, Kennedy, Astor, Bundy, DuPont, etc etc - the 13 bloodlines that is widely passed around on the internet).
      </p>
      <p>
       The new wealth are the one's that front for the old wealth, in various industries (ie. Banking, Oil, Pharma, etc etc). If their names are plastered everywhere, that's probably a good indication of their actual status (or lack thereof), imo.

       Many different sources, whether historical or modern. For instance, researching  International Law will open many doors in regards to this topic. Learning about where International Law comes from, who administrates it, the difference between Sovereign and subjects, difference between Civil Law/Code and Common Law, Contracts, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem completely unrelated, at first, but it truly relates to it all, and how these Bloodlines get away with what they do and how they still exist parallel (or above) the Government(s) till this day.

       There's a small few people who actually talk about these Bloodlines, to my knowledge. Jordan Maxwell is one of them. As far as I know, there is no comprehensive trace, due to many factors. I've been trying to document for sometime now. It always seems to stop at Rome. Going further back than that, has proven to be quite the challenge.

       This is what I've seen as a major issue in a lot of conspiracy theory research in general: we don't really have good tools and practices to gather, store, analyze, and present information effectively, and the internet might have made this worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you get deep enough down enough rabbit holes, and it doesn't take all that much time, you realize that it's not so much individual people or events or even corporations and governments, but the connections between them and the patterns that persist and mutate over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, if you look at
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       conspiracy theory information is presented, it's either presented linearly — looking at one person, group, or event at a time in relative isolation — or it's reductive — e.g. "it's the zionists" or "it's the black nobility."  (Not that I'm saying it's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the zionists or the black nobility or whoever, just that that reductiveness is not ultimately helpful.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And I say it's not helpful because whoever "they" are, they clearly understand and employ systems thinking. Finding examples of conspiratorial behavior and even taking down key figures in their operation is futile if the systems that facilitate the conspiracies remain in place.
      </p>

       Have you ever messed around with or used graph databases professionally? I've been getting into Neo4j recently, and it seems like it could be quite useful in mapping the connections and relationships between all these people, families, groups, and events, and also with analyzing and presenting them.

       He needs sources to be provided. As u/CelineHagbard stated, if this could be viably documented and proven correct, we wouldn't be so "lost in the maze of rabbit holes." Also, we'd be capped quick by the Black Nobility. Just sayin.

       Yeah, that's my take on AhuwahZeus's material. Is it accurate? Maybe, but it's all just text that presumably one guy wrote, with little if any sourcing.
