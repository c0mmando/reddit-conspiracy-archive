       Those efits were of the same person, not two people, and he was described as mid-30s, which is far too young for either Podesta in 2007.

       That is often the case because witness descriptions vary. The Golden State Killer, who was caught a few weeks ago, had many different descriptions of his face given by witnesses. It was just 1 guy.

       IMO? Debts must be paid, one way or another. Sadly/tragically. I think her parent(s) may have been in deep, somehow. Add in "I'm your father now" (allegedly Podesta) tape, and yea...

       When Podesta had his emails hacked, the only ones he had deleted where the ones from when he was on vacation in Portugal at the same time/location as when/where she went missing.  Her parents were friends with her friends.  Apparently when she first went missing the mother said “they’ve got her” as if there had already been a request made.  Witnesses have drawn sketchs of the men thought to have kidnapped the girl, they look identical to the Podesta brothers.

       Can you prove it then? Because right off the bat I can tell you that it's a lie that there were two men. There were two different pictures of one man, who witnesses said would have been decades younger than either of them.
      </p>

       So...can you prove the other parts of it, that they were on vacation in Portugal at the time?

       No, they are two witnesses who saw the same person (one person) at the same time. There is no second person. It's one person.

       At first I thought the idea of linking Podesta to McCann was absurd. It just seemed incredibly unlikely that they would happen to be linked to one of the most high profile child abduction cases ever. But then I thought; why was the McCann case so high profile? Why did it receive so much more press than the numerous other child abduction cases that happen every year? Perhaps there were certain people in the press who knew what really happened, and were purposely pushing the story to try and expose the Podestas.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all just conjecture, but this possibility makes the idea of linking the Podestas to McCann less absurd, if the Podestas were the reason the McCann case was so heavily reported.

       Parents were pimping her out for mi5/6 someone got carried away and killed her maybe a snuff film situation. Think the podesta link was probably pushed by the Brits at CA to fuck with that hillary cunt.   The British government know who did it and covered it up.

       Richard D Hall did an in depth YouTube study, including having the parents speech patterns analysed, and the upshot appears to be this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parents are lying, Madeline died in the apartment, probably accidentally falling off the couch, her body was hidden in a bedroom cupboard for a few days before being disposed of by the parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       UK cadaver dogs found blood spots by the couch and alerted to cadaver odour in bedroom and back of parents hired car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Parents realised they screwed up, probably having their child die due to being drugged so they could go out alone. Panicking they decide to cover up and say an intruder took the child. I am sure they regret not coming clean in the first place.

       That is what I think happened, pretty much. Depressingly mundane and horrible.

        This is an interesting article
       </a>
       about a pair of witnesses who believe that they witnessed Gerry McCann carrying a dead/dying/unconscious Madeleine away from the resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the timeline in the above post, I'd suggest that this sighting occurred during the hasty switcheroo from the cupboard to the back of the hire car.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot more detail, including some bizarre evidence manipulation by the BBC, which I can't get my head round at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a topic I like to think about much. It's really just too horrible.

        This story
       </a>
       has appeared in today's press.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about a different sighting of a man carrying an apparently-sleeping little girl across the holiday resort where the McCanns were staying.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sighting is far better-known than the one in my previous post. And the police carried on investigating it for years, despite the man who was carrying the child coming forward to be eliminated from inquiries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why has one sighting received so little attention, while the other has received so much? I don't have an answer to that question.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suspect that many people, when reading of the Smiths' experience (previous post) will just assume it's the same sighting made by the Tanners (this post). The two encounters have been sort of smudged into one incident.

       What is interesting is not whether this is true, but that it has been said/acknowledged by official State mouthpieces.

       What makes no sense, that the police had an artist do renderings based on descriptions of a man seen near the resort by two different witnesses?  Yeah cos that's impossible.

       There is a lot of questions around the parents.

      <p>
       Why did the Cadaver dogs alert in their rental car boot that they hired two weeks after she went missing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they have the pajamas that Madeline was apparently wearing when she was abducted?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they wash “cuddle cat”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Kate put in her own book that she was having terrible thoughts about her daughters “torn genitals”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they dispose of a fridge from the rental villa?

       Why did the cadaver dogs alert in their bedroom wardrobe?

       Where is Gerry’s tennis bag?

       This case has bothered me for so long. I hope one day it really is solved unfortunately I think that the people involved are too important and high up and the truth will never come out.

        48 police questions Madeleine’s mother refused to answer (and the one she did).

       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          On May 3 2007, around 22:00, when you entered the apartment, what did you see? What did you do? Where did you look? What did you touch?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Did you search inside the bedroom wardrobe? (she replied that she wouldn’t answer)

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          (shown 2 photographs of her bedroom wardrobe) Can you describe its contents?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Why had the curtain behind the sofa in front of the side window (whose photo was shown to her) been tampered with? Did somebody go behind that sofa?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          How long did your search of the apartment take after you detected your daughter Madeleine’s disappearance?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Why did you say from the start that Madeleine had been abducted?

          Assuming Madeleine had been abducted, why did you leave the twins home alone to go to the ‘Tapas’ and raise the alarm? Because the supposed abductor could still be in the apartment.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Why didn’t you ask the twins, at that moment, what had happened to their sister or why didn’t you ask them later on?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          When you raised the alarm at the ‘Tapas’ what exactly did you say and what were your exact words?

        <li>
         <p>
          What happened after you raised the alarm in the ‘Tapas’?
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Why did you go and warn your friends instead of shouting from the verandah?

         <p>

        <li>
         <p>
          Did anyone outside of the group learn of 
Madeleine’s disappearance in those following minutes?

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Why did the twins not wake up during that search or when they were taken upstairs?

        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
         <p>
          Did you know the danger of calling the media, because it could influence the abductor?

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          What was your behaviour that night?

          Are the twins difficult to get to sleep? Are they restless and does that cause you uneasiness?

        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Is it true that sometimes you despaired with your children’s behaviour and that left you feeling very uneasy?

          In the case files you were SHOWN CANINE forensic testing films, where you can see them marking due to detection of the scent of human corpse and blood traces, also human, and only human, as well as all the comments of the technician in charge of them. After watching and after the marking of the scent of corpse in your bedroom beside the wardrobe and behind the sofa, pushed up against the sofa wall, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?

          When confronted with the results of Maddie’s DNA, whose analysis was carried out in a British laboratory, collected from behind the sofa and the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I asked Gerry apprehensively if he'd had any really horrible thoughts or visions of Madeleine. He nodded. Haltingly, I told him about the awful pictures that scrolled through my head of her body, her perfect little genitals torn apart."

       That is often the case because witness descriptions vary. The Golden State Killer, who was caught a few weeks ago, had many different descriptions of his face given by witnesses. It was just 1 guy.
