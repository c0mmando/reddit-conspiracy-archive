    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out the hilariousness that is the complete and unflinching unanimity expressed in the comments, with the completely opposite-land vote count of your post. It&#39;s like JIDF and ADL shill farms have a sign up in their offices that says &quot;truth isn&#39;t truth if you attack it&quot;. Like, nah Jew-bros, that&#39;s not how things work. They&#39;ve all gotten away with it for years and years now, but the cumulative weight of all of their lies, when exposed in finality, is going to sting really, really, really badly. Imagine Israel without US gibs lol Like they&#39;d fight their own battles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that fractional reserve banking should be abolished, all fiat currency replaced with non-funny money, dual citizenship should barr a person from serving in politics, and Jewish nepotism in workplaces should be met with very severe punishment. That would solve like 90% of the world&#39;s problems. But, yeah, if the masses all learns of what they&#39;ve done to us, all at once, I don&#39;t discount the possibility that there would be a lot of death for a lot of Jews. I think that people are able to do the right thing when presented with truth, though. It would certainly be quite the shakeup. Imagine if all the stolen wealth of all the nations with Jewish-owned central banks was returned to the people... Man, all the war and strife would end instantaneously. </p>

<p>Estimates range between 80-90% of all congressmen and senators having dual citizenship with Israel. It&#39;s harder to find info as the years go by, so this list of just the appointees during the Obama administration - from before the great censoring debacle we live under today - is an interesting window into the bias we abide in the highest offices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right...And I can &quot;tell&quot; you that the same list of people are the US politicians who also happen to be Reptilians. As far as your logic goes, that tidbit can be accepted as &quot;fact&quot; until you take the time to disprove it? Do you see how illogical this is?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at name #1. Jack Lew. I can find no evidence that he has Israeli citizenship. Can YOU find evidence that he is not a Reptilian?</p>

<p>Is it perhaps more likely that the OP is simply repeating an anti-Jewish meme conflating a &quot;right of return&quot; policy with dual citizenship? No, that would make too much sense.</p>

If I was under the impression that I should trust History books just because, I might agree with you but history is written by the winners and I&#39;m not naïve. You say it&#39;s just the population of Russia but they still told you 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust and we know that is not true today. Now they say &quot;well the numbers may have gotten a little fudge but it was still 3 million and that&#39;s a lot&quot; Why should I believe you now after you were caught lying about 6 million?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. They have continuously painted this picture of 6 million Jews being persecuted since the late 1800s. Then 50 years later we are told 6 million Jews were killed in the holocaust. Lol. That&#39;s how propaganda works. Research it. It doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;re familiar with what propaganda is. They&#39;ve been trying to gain access to Palestine with this propaganda. They tried for 50 years. It didn&#39;t pay out until ww2. Propaganda doesn&#39;t have a time limit. You can push it for years and if you don&#39;t get the outcome you want, keep pushing it until you do. It&#39;s a know tactic. There is a reason the word propaganda exists. </p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t matter if it was 6 million or 6 people to the people that died. Jews, gays, gypsies or any other person undesirable to the nazi state. The matter in which they died is also not the point. Starvation, bullets, gas.. It does not matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><h1>Question 1: How many Jews were alive before the holocaust?</h1>

<p>From the 1940-1941, <em>American Jewish Year Book</em>, page 592:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the basis of the latest available authoritative sources, the total number of Jews in the world is here estimated at 15,757,000. Of that number, 7,428,000 reside in a group of countries bordering upon one another, located on the continent of Europe, which may be designated as the region of Central Europe. This region includes Poland, Danzig, Lithuania, Latvia; Czechoslovakia, Hungary; Roumania, Russia (Crimea, Ukraine, and White Russia). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The chapter &quot;Statistics of Jews&quot; is available in PDF <a href="http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1940_1941_8_Statistics.pdf">here</a>. You can find other years (and other chapters) <a href="http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php?GroupingId=40">here</a>.</p>

<p>I uploaded a picture of the table on Jews of Europe from that chapter <a href="https://imgur.com/C1SwxIQ">here</a>. Note that most of the figures for central Europe come from government censuses.</p>

<h1>Question 2: Why is there 200 allegations from 1900-1945 of 6 million Jews being persecuted and threatened with genocide?</h1>

<p>Why? Because somebody typed &quot;6,000,000 Jews&quot; into a newspaper archive search engine and found articles with that phrase.</p>

<p>Mostly you find a cluster of articles about Jews in Russia around the time of World War I, because that was  the estimate of Jews in Russia at that time. Note that &quot;Russia&quot; before World War I included <a href="https://imgur.com/EM69zp4">much more of central and eastern Europe</a> than after World War I or today.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I searched on the ProQuest Historical Newspapers database for <em>N million Jews and (danger OR famine OR dying OR massacre OR starving)</em> in the same date range 1915 to 1938. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/wKIqw">Here are the results of that search:</a></p>

<p>Also notice on the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3BVsFQg.png">&quot;6 million Jews&quot; search</a>, on the right hand side, there&#39;s a little bar chart of how many article per year.

    <div class="md"><p>6,000,000 was the number of Jewish people living in the Russian Empire in the early 20th century. Pick any round number of millions and you can find an equal frequency of mentions during this time period based on happenstance correspondence with other regional population figures. There&#39;s nothing there to get excited about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point. Hitler was accused of killing 6 million Jews. That&#39;s what I was taught in school. Long before hitler was furer, articles as far back as 1900 claim that 6 million Jews are being persecuted in Russia. Do you think Jews would be killing Palestinians right now if they didn&#39;t convince the world that 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust? Would Israel exist right now if they didn&#39;t convince the world that 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust? Have you ever heard of the story&quot; The boy who cried Wolf?&quot; Are you gullible enough to not understand what a child could?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What u/twsmith posted is just propaganda. That&#39;s what the problem is. You can&#39;t just say every country has 6 million Jews in it and then say it&#39;s true because history books say so. Who came up with those numbers? Ohhh Jews did. Then why the hell would I believe them? There are countries where it is illegal to question the holocaust. Doesn&#39;t it seem strange that&#39;s a law? If you think it&#39;s to protect the Jews from another holocaust, how do we even know the first one happened if it illegal to question. I&#39;m no idiot. I know when one is forbidden to question something it&#39;s because someone doesn&#39;t want the answer out there. So they make it illegal to question or call you an anti-Semite. Pretty obvious to me what&#39;s going on. Is it a law anywhere to question slavery? How about the US genocide of Native Americans? No? But I shouldn&#39;t question the holocaust? </p>
