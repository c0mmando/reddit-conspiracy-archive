       I hope this is suitable for this sub, it's more of a light hearted wondering mind type of submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just thinking; say a blood cell in your body was intelligent and wanted to know "what else was out there" and could only see a relatively small fraction of what is around it. It would see the same things over and over. Even if the example was changed and cell could travel throughout the entire body with ease to explore it, it would repeatedly see the same things (on it's small scale) it would be impossible for the cell to realize the greater picture because it's too small to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if this is our situation here on Earth? Maybe we could travel into space end to end and we would still keep seeing stars and planets like the ones in our solar system. What if the answer to some important questions lies in the scale of things and not how far out we go. We could absolutely never invent something big enough to help us look at space from a larger beings perspective. I wonder if space is something entirely different than anything we could ever imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've thought of this in the past and I'm sure a lot of you (if not all) have also thought of it. It just blew my mind when I gave it a little more thought.

       It isn't that simple but using physics it is possible to get approximate weights of various objects given details of their orbits and other factors.

       You're entitled to your beliefs and that's okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I gotta say I feel incredibly sorry that you don't get to experience that wonderful feeling of mysticism and wonder that one gets looking into the night sky. The profound feeling of our insignificance is one of the most humbling and beautiful things I've ever experienced. It's the only feeling that I can say as an adult that makes me feel child-like again.

       I get it. I've been there and I use to think and say that same exact things. But I've seen things in the sky that defy the logic of this world presented to us and my own long journey trying to find answers is what brought me to my beliefs today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell you what though, once you see it, and you realize our ancient ancestors were closer to reality in their beliefs than we are now. Makes things much more interesting. Forget that lonely, insignificant, surrounded by nothing, space lie, because the other side is pretty damn amazing.

       Like how early settlers thought that there was no way to circumvent the globe, or that you would fall off the face of the earth, or that we didn't know there's exoplanets. We're just a tiny speck in a vast universe that seems impossible to fathom.

       Uhh, I mean yes other planets are in space but that’s not what I said. I said that the satellites and such that we use are not outside of the earths atmosphere. If they were not in the earths atmosphere they would not have a way to stay “contained” and only circle our planet. 
As for the voyager, I don’t have any input for them. I don’t know much and I’m not going to speak on something I don’t know

       The only reason they stay 'Contained' and 'Circle our planet' is because they're NOT in the earths atmosphere. If they were they'd burn up and fall to the earth. Satellites are in a constant state of falling towards the earth but just missing it every time, this is only possible outside of the atmosphere my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also say 'As for the voyager, I don’t have any input for them. I don’t know much and I’m not going to speak on something I don’t know'

       So you don't know about voyager but you want to talk about space like you have some sort of understanding over others? Hehehe

       You can’t see them. They never transit the moon. I look at the moon every night that it’s possible and have never seen a satellite. There are no images of orbiting satellites. “You” cannot bounce radio signals off of them.

       It's not that that one picture screams "fraud." It's that it looks like all the other fake imagery we've already seen. If I were going to bring up an issue I have with that one photo, it would be that the thermosphere is supposed to range from 600 degrees F to like 3,600 degrees F.
      </p>
      <p>
       But mainly it's just that there's already a pattern of faking space photos. There's pictures of earth with copy/pasted cloud formations that were clearly created with Photoshop, the word "sex" hidden in the cloud formations, etc. and all these anomalies that really made the FE crowd gain any steam in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these things are in orbit they're supposed to be moving at like 17,000 mph.

       Think about your sentence "It's that it looks like all the other fake imagery we've already seen. "
I think you can stop asking for pictures as proof, because they will most likely all look fake. For the sake of the argument,let's assume this pic is real, therefore all other pics will look kind of similar,
There is literally no way that one of those pics would proof anything for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the your points about the temperature and speed, I am sure, someone already explained this,but apparently you think it's more likely that NASA (or whoever) has nothing better to do, during this massive conspiracy, than editing sex into their fake pictures. Anyway,I don't judge,so whatever...

       Anyway, I asked for a photo of a satellite and you submitted a photo of space shuttle Endeavor, so this is all moot and you aren't prepared for the discussion anyway.

       Ok, English is not my first language,but it wasn't that bad. You asked who took the picture ( of that satellite), I said it was taken by the endeavour. I don't know where you see a space shuttle on that picture.

       Because my question is related to this conversation.
Do you actually think what you see on the pic I linked is the space shuttle endeavour ( after I told you the pic was taken by said space shuttle) ? If so,why did you not mention it in your first reply?

       Fair enough - but that Project Loon was done by Google. Surely it doesn't get more official than that? Google lie to us all the time. Why would you believe Google over anything else? I can claim that Project Loon is a lie too see?

       I no longer believe that the belts exist in the way we are told. Too many inconsistencies and it seems more like a contrived pseudo-justification for why it’s “hard” to go to space.

       Well in the business world simulations are used to see how processes work, such as an assembly line for instance. The great thing about simulations is that it can take into account of multiple variables and be run many times sped up from normal speed. If we were able to simulate the universe efficiently, we could see other "civilizations" progress way farther than where we currently are. With this we can learn new technology and thus benefit greatly off of it. This all begs the question though, if we are able to simulate the universe then it's rather probable that we are in a simulation ourselves.

       I wonder how spirits see us from their perspective. Would they be able to see everything, past and present if they're in a point beyond time &amp; space? Human perspective definitely is limited.. as our brain takes in the info from our senses and forms a picture of a physical universe. What if it isn't entirely physical?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are those that believe when you look up, you are seeing heaven.. and that each star has a soul.  Meanwhile we get taught outer space is physical... stars being burning gas balls along with planets that we could travel to. Those two perspectives sure do clash.

       I do. I believe we have spirits that will exist after our bodies die, and I imagine God goes by our karma when letting us reincarnate. I've heard that humans aren't high on the food chain and that higher beings, having ascended, go to the upper level/heaven as stars.. which are our ancestors. In a place we can't get to as humans.

       Oh, you went there...so our solar system is just one strand of DNA in a cell of a much larger organism. What if our planet was just a single atom and the moon was our sole electron orbiting away.

      <p>
       That would make us what, quarks?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if there is some 'solar system' in the DNA in each cell in our body? And the above was true for that 'solar system'? You see where I'm going with this? When would it ever end, this getting smaller and smaller but seeming endless to the observer at the new smaller level?

       Maybe not! A break through could happen any day of our lives. Quantum Physics already has a lot of really strange things in it that hint at the connection between the conscious and the universe. Wouldn't it be cool to find out something that connects our inner mind to the rest of our reality?

       I used to think that the universe was "God" experiencing itself. That after coming to understand everything that 'is', it realised it couldn't know itself without perceiving itself through the eyes of others. That the struggles we see are just internal dissonances shifting to harmony.

       I also think that different organisms can have drastically different experiences of their environment. Consider us, a bird and a tree, what if the bird is interacting with the same molecular compounds and vibrations of forces but experiencing this in such an abstractly different way than us, that we can't meaningfully compare our experiences? But synchronistically our worlds collide and interact.

       Like, definitely. "What is it like to be a bat?" by Thomas Nagel touches on this. I'm basically going to rehash what you said to show I agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be of the mind that we develop our "conscious" (loaded word) experience through our engagement with the world. I think (and I'd like to open a discussion about it, so feel free to argue back) that we experience our engagement through our nervous system. That is, all information we receive through our senses is transferred to us though our nervous system. Our nervous system is powered by neurons. *I think* that most of our neurons are located in our brains. I also *think* that most of the neurons belonging to an octopus are located throughout their eight arms. So consider, how do they experience their engagement with the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your ears were located at your hips, where do you think you'd "hear" the sound? Seeing as the vibration would be felt at your ears (which are located on either side of your hips), I'd assume you'd "hear" at your hips. Now what if you tried to recall a song you heard earlier? Would you be recalling that in your hips or in your head? Where do you think you'd hear the song? I contest still in your hips, as recalling it is accessing the memory of it, and to access the memory you'd have to realise the experience as it was, recalling the tiny vibrations as your ears received them, ears that are on either side of your hips.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the octopus, I think it's something like 3/5 of it's neurons are spread about their arms. Do these arms each possess a mind of their own? When they clasp an object with the arms, what are they experiencing or feeling that we'll never pick up on? What could memory recall for an octopus be like? I don't even think we could imagine to be honest. We'd only be victim to the flaws of our own reasoning, which has been developed for years by humans, through our particular experience of engaging with the world, with our particular tools.

       I don't believe in flat earth whatsoever but I like to say we are probably being deceived on a scale as large as that.

       There is so much we don't know or is just incorrect.  I wonder if we are being lied to about gravity or the way electromagnetism works and the universe is vastly different than we imagine.

       The fact that so much of what we are told are based on others' theories has allowed me to create my own theories. Like what if the Earth is flat. What if it's domed. What if there is a hell beneath us. What if one day the sun explodes without warning? What if there's a planet 9,000,0000 times the size of hours headed towards us? I don't we have the technology or mental capability to understand a lot of the information we've been fed.

       The only reason they stay 'Contained' and 'Circle our planet' is because they're NOT in the earths atmosphere. If they were they'd burn up and fall to the earth. Satellites are in a constant state of falling towards the earth but just missing it every time, this is only possible outside of the atmosphere my friend.
      </p>

       You also say 'As for the voyager, I don’t have any input for them. I don’t know much and I’m not going to speak on something I don’t know'
      </p>

       So you don't know about voyager but you want to talk about space like you have some sort of understanding over others? Hehehe

       I do. I believe we have spirits that will exist after our bodies die, and I imagine God goes by our karma when letting us reincarnate. I've heard that humans aren't high on the food chain and that higher beings, having ascended, go to the upper level/heaven as stars.. which are our ancestors. In a place we can't get to as humans.

       Having heard flat earth theory out and explained properly, things make more sense... but it's hard for us to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it's flat. Theoretically reality could bend either way. Both are valid theories and ball earth has its interpretation of things, but when our proof turns out to be repeatedly
