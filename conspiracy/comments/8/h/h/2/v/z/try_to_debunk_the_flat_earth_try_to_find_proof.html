       Anybody can fly to Antarctica. It's not controlled by the government, the government is just the only people stupid enough to regularly travel there. Go charter a plane, or better yet, charter spacecraft to orbit earth and see.

       It seems you recognize the game. Next time just downvote the fuck out of him. Your video was more than sufficient. He’s banking on others not clicking of the conversation becoming so convoluted that no one will care. That’s why you go to remain genuine in your curiosity and don’t be shy with those downvotes.

       This is all so stupid. They don't fake the pictures. Fuck. It's just the way digital imaging works. The light is collected in layers and then digitally processed together just like the way your cell phone camera works. Here's the thing though, the earliest satellites used real film photography, and NASA has captured full globe shots on real film more recently specifically to deal with this kind of nonsense. It's just a big pain in the ass to retrieve the film when we can transmit digital images that are nearly as good.

       I honestly believe this entire comment section is being vote manipulated to make this subreddit look stupid. Humans have known the Earth is round for THOUSANDS of years. It wasn't until the Catholic Church took over that they were able to brainwash people into accepting a magical flat Earth model. It's amazing to see real people falling for this again in the new age of brainwashing.

       Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm just deceived like everyone else. Save it. I don't want to waste another second of my life on this nonsense. I've seen the Sun rise and set at many different longitudes and it always goes behind the Earth no matter where I am on the globe. It's a spinning ball just like every other planet I can go observe for myself with my own telescope. Giant LCD screen. Holy shit this is getting old.

       Ehh have you been to the north or south were the sun doesnt set? It nearly sets, getting smaller... (flat earth proven) and when it rises it gets bigger, wow the sun is 93 million miles away ,. Nat
Go look up timelapse sun sets from high mountains or over a western ocean on a calm day
Im literally doing this to help you get a better picture of how life really is, just make sure you know there's always a chance your being lied to and if you catch someone faking something- theres always a reason - just look up nasa augmented virtual reality fail - for the flat earth proof - THERE IS NONE! But theres no definitive proof for the globe, the same as gravity - its all just THEORY! So please prove me wrong and give some real proof

       Eric just because your a midget doesnt mean you have to act like a child. the man is asking a very real FE skeptic question. Now if you are a flat earther you could either A) help him learn about your beliefs and make him believe, or B) be a jerk for the sake of it and perpetuate the idea that flat earthers cant handle basic criticism of their theorys

       I don't understand why the government and scientists would lie about the shape of Earth. What would they gain by it? To me, all conspiracy theories must involve somebody gaining something that they wouldn't if everybody was aware of the truth. This one makes no sense to me.

       Have you considered the implications of the earth being the centre (and maybe the only part) of the universe? Would people not conclude that earth and the life upon it are special and did not come about by blind chance?  Everything they told us is a lie. That is what they are hiding.

       If you watch The Principle they get into the Axis of Evil. We are almost certainly the certain of the universe. Some attribute it to a multiverse, others a fine tuner. Regardless it does appear that with our current mapping of the observable universe that we are the center of it all.

       This is a misunderstanding. Every point in the Universe is the center of its own observable Universe. This is a basic mathematical symmetry of General Relativity. The entire Universe may very well be infinite with no center, and this in no way contradicts what I said above. That doesn't mean the Earth is flat. Why would that even be related to being the center of the Universe? Also, you know, people mapping out the observable Universe are well aware that the Earth is a globe since it's a basic part of astronomy that they need to account for to know where to point their telescopes.

       How do they map it , with telescopes? Or data from nasa?
If telescopes the dome could be a cgi lcd screen simulating the sky like GTA 5 ,
Or a past civilisation created multiple flat domed earths, set them a float somewhere in space, hoping life goes on incase they get black holed. Simulation theory is 100%correct, the only thing we dont know is if we are in vr game, AI have us trapped looping on the simulation, like terminator, all our brains are in glass jars..
Or past civilisations created computer simulations &amp; we are the outcome, google'conways game of life'

       I've been down these rabbit holes and then I learned (like really deeply understood) enough about mathematics, physics, and engineering to understand that some of these questions/concerns can be legitimately answered/dismissed. Here are a few points of consideration:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The NASA controversy. They may have lied about the first moon landing because they weren't ready in time to meet JFK's original goal, but they really landed there multiple times after that. They have been honest about mostly everything they have claimed with the possible exception of the one big lie in 1969 fueled by national fervor/pride/security. There is a shitload of bad information floating around about NASA making everything up, but this is mostly based on misunderstandings.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It is not possible that the sky is a giant LCD screen because the laws of optics leave a very clear and detectible signature when light has travelled over very large distances. Also, you should really pay attention to your gut instinct here and see if that idea really clicks. It does not for me.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Simulation theory is probably not correct in the way that you are naively thinking about it. Quantum computers exist in a natural abstract state relating various geometric and mathematical structures, so it may be true that we are some kind of simulation, technically speaking, but that does not imply that there is a higher level intelligence in some outside world running the simulation. In fact, insights from physics suggest that the Universe may just as well be an abstract mathematical object (like a circle or a sphere but a bit more intricate) si that physical reality is not much more than an illusion of our perception.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If last civilizations created us as a simulation, where did they come from in the first place?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don't have to Google Conway's game of life since it is perhaps the most famous concrete example of cellular automata in action. You are new to this line of thinking and that's okay. Just keep an open mind as you continue this pursuit of truth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Earth is a globe. Sorry, but you're wrong, and I'm completely certain. As a starting point, I can explain to you how to prove the heliocentric model conclusively. If you have some cash to burn, I can show you how to charter a flight to or over the South Pole. I know what it feels like to believe something that other people consider impossible, but you're barking up the wrong tree here

       I don't believe life and earth, nor the universe came about by chance. I believe we were created. But I don't believe the earth is flat. Are we at the center of it all? Possibly. But we are too small to prove it. Anything else is theory and speculation.

       On the other hand, the last time people were brainwashed into believing the Earth was flat was when the Catholic Church basically controlled everything. They wanted people brainwashed and stupid living in their magical fairy tale world.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA psyop is one of the most realistic theories for how Flat Earth belief got restarted in the modern age. There's a very obvious motive for this. It would serve as an experiment to watch their bullshit seeds grow into the public conversation, giving valuable data for future disinformation campaigns. Furthermore, knowing the CIA has done a lot of shady shit and probably many more theories are actually true, it would be in their interest to discredit conspiracy theorists and waste their time explaining simple concepts to people who have swallowed their Flat Earth brainwashing.

       Okay possible as well. What if they went to do that, and realised the bible literally says its flat, enclosed, domed with a firmament
If they went to teach us the wrong on purpose for stupidity reasons, its the globe earth - we are supposed to believe its a ball- if its flat- its supposed to ressemble another planet, if u were to make one u would make it seem its a ball when its flat as well

       Careful about what you're calling "clear copy paste jobs".  Any time you have something saved as a jpeg, you add in those squares.  Unfortunately, to explain why goes into an unfortunate amount of math, but just look at old meme pictures with text that have been saved hundreds of times over.  You can see the image degrade, especially around sharp edges (like where text ends).

       The fact that you haven't gone out to try to find the original brings your other claims into question.  It looks like you just found something that agreed with what you already thought, and just passed it along without thinking about it.  The fact that you didn't seem to know about jpeg artifacting and what it looks like makes me wonder what else you've missed in your arguments.

       Let's look at your last four links then.  Since you seem the think those are meaningful evidence, I can tell you're not seriously near sighted (congratulations).  Since you don't live with it every day, you may not be aware of what things look like when they're out of focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every one of those examples you're calling "real stars" or "real mars" is a text book case of a poorly focused camera taking a picture.  Here's a fun test: get some Christmas lights, or a long stretch of city lights, and take several pictures wildly our of focus.  All the lights in the picture will look startlingly like the pictures you're showing!  In fact, to save you some trouble, you can just look up bokeh photography.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two effects in play with those images you've posted.  Yours are showing a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_confusion">
        circle of confusion
       </a>
       , which is why out of focus things look out of focus.  However, if you get distant enough objects, and small enough cameras, you also can get
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airy_disk">
        Airy Disks
       </a>
       , which why your something like your cell phone camera can only zoom in so far before it looses the ability to resolve anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you simply saw something that agreed with you and posted it without thinking.  You didn't bother to try to look up the other side of the argument, you just assumed there wasn't one.  The reason people fight back on flat earth is because EVERY argument is riddled with these really bad points, and it reeks of a complete lack of both research and critical thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to convince people that the earth is flat, instead of just writing a cathartic rant, you'll need to prove you actually understand what the arguments of the other side are.  If you have resources, I'd strongly recommend some kind of introductory physics and math courses.  Heck, even some
       <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">
        Khan Academy
       </a>
       to equip yourself with the basic mathematical skills you need to even hold these conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, all I see is a person who doesn't understand the standard model of the world, and arrogantly thinks that they're inability to understand is proof against it.

       So, rather than address the problems I'm seeing with your proposal, you're just going to move on to other points.  Does this mean that you're acknowledging that those points were wrong?  Are you admitting that these are serious flaws with the flat earth idea?

       All the proof there is - nasa lies- there is a dome, domed sky, glass dome whatever, earth is flat (any amature footage with a non fisheye lense shows a flat horizon when there should be hundreds of feet of curvature missing! So fuck you its flat &amp; faked to pretend we are on a globe, or by chance its just a big flat rock with a domed atmospheric sky floating in space with the sun 5000miles high orbiting it like the moon does

       So, since you're not trying to refute anything I've said, that you accept that you're agreeing that the last four of your links are totally wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is my issue with flat earth. You are just making claims with zero evidence. Occasionally, there will be a massive youtube dump, and maybe one or two of the videos will touch on something kind of related to a debate, but of course there's no time stamps or any kind of direction included. I never seem to meet a person who can actually explain which part of my counter arguments are wrong, they all simply parrot that I'm "brain washed" or "part of the conspiracy".  No one I've met as ever been able to use rational logic to explain things to me, or tell me how I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most annoying part is it's obvious that you really haven't done much research in ideas. I'm sure that you have watched countless hours of youtube videos and read tens of thousands of words about flat earth ideas, but you clearly haven't learned much about the opposing side. You don't know what you're trying to argue against, you just take the straw man arguments presented by flat earthers as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know curvature isn't measured in feet? That is doesn't have any units at all
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I implore you to learn more math, particularly trigonometry, to better understand what you're trying to argue, and to better articulate what you're trying to say. You can't refute something you don't understand. Until you gain a better grasp of math and physics, how can you hope to see where it's wrong?

       Think about it we lived on a planet so big and that’s why we can’t tell if there’s curvature. We are just a tiny part of the whole thing. So back in the day we just pissed of the gods/aliens/angels so they put a big ass done over us to contain us and waiting for the human race to figure its shit out.

       Try to debunk the Flat Earth? Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the night while in the northern hemisphere (or central ring whatever you want to call it) find Polaris and then select a star on the celestial equator. Measure the difference in viewing angle between the two stars and you'll find that it's 90 degrees. Have multiple people at different latitudes make the same observation. They will all be 90. This causes a huge discrepancy as to the position of these stars if we were on a flat earth. For multiple people at multiple latitudes to maintain that 90 degree angle, the two stars must exist at multiple latitudes (including ground level) at the same time. This is obviously impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This observation however, is perfectly consistent with a globe earth.

       If the dome is an lcd screen its easy to make it look like theres a south pole, even though theres a dome surrounding, 
If you get me a video of someone directly under the southern star i may believe you
 i can make a 3d model of our earth on the computer, its possible

       Gonna stop you right there. LCD screen? Really? Whatever. If the Earth was flat and the sky/stars acted as if they were displayed on a... LCD screen then it doesn't explain the discrepancies in the viewing angles of stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will ALWAYS be a 90 degree difference between Polaris/Sigma Octantis and any star on the celestial equator. There will always be a 180 degree separation between the two celestial poles. These two facts are impossible to explain on a flat earth. LCD screen or otherwise. It's an issue with geometry.

       So your saying its impossible to get 90degree angles using a 3d model of a flat earth usin a dome shaped sky?
If we are under an lcd screen, it was created to save us and to trick us, we want to be tricked or we are trapped who know we could be on vacation in a high tech spaceship, on a flat earth inside

       No I'm saying the viewing angles of the stars are not consistent with a flat earth, regardless of whether the sky of this flat earth was a plane or a dome. It
       <strong>
        doesn't
       </strong>
       work. Saying "the sky is actually a LCD screen" does not fix the issue.
