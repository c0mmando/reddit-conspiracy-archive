       I think we've moved past the information age and are now witnessing the birth of the censorship age, though, it will not be called that while we live through it, of course. So much has changed, so much has grown to be so underhanded, so dishonest, so, frankly, evil. I'm talking of course about shills, about disinformation, about vote manipulation, about censorship, about the rabid attacks you are bound to receive if you dare to question, and God forbid you actively
       <em>
        theorize
       </em>
       based on existing patterns without having 2 dozen scholarly papers which will invariably be dismissed by those same attackers for pedantic reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to share, and postulate, and come up with ideas that led to, at times, real truths, but now, we're all so caught up in fighting for sides of dichotomies or engaging with the pettiest "proof parrots" who do not ask for further evidence to learn from, but to attack. It has created assholes out of who were once titans of free thinking, simply because after enduring countless underhanded tactics and attacks on your character, you tend to get angry, you tend to expect it, and from that comes expressed hatred, sometimes merited, sometimes not. If that rings true for you; if you're one of the people who has lost a great many accounts, including their originals which had the greatest amount of your honest and truthful goodness pumped into them, and you now feel adrift and unanchored in a tempestuous sea which never seems to allow you to even find your footing much less navigate effectively-- if you're one of those people, I love you, and I have shed tears for your plight, truly. I am so very sorry to see what has become of all bastions of free thought, of all the thinkers and the theorizers and the postulaters within them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, mods, please don't take this as an attack on you all. It's not. While most users here have seen things which lead us to believe that some on your team are compromised, there are still good guys among you just trying your best to play a game whose rules are kept hidden from us all. It's shitty, and it's ugly, and it's frustrating, to see this place die a little more each day, but I know there are good dudes among you, and that this is just a symptom of all of the internet in this the new age of censorship which we all are forced to live under.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're one of those who is paid to infiltrate and to attack us, I wish that I could help you, too. I hate you, make no mistake, but I feel for you as well. To have so little value placed in truth, to have so much trained hatred within you, I can still feel real pity, genuine sadness, and, honestly, a bit of love for you. I do hope you come to one day see what it is you do, and who it is you serve, but I can understand why you do it, too, even if I think it is wholly evil in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just want to say, to all the bros here, male and female, I miss you guys, and I miss what we had, but above all else, remember the love we all shared, that is still there in each of us underneath the heightened emotions that come with trying to spread truths today. Stay strong. Even if you leave this place - and I have done the same - know that the bond we all share is beyond a single congregation, or a single place that houses our thoughts and ideas. Just always remember the love that arose when we were allowed to freely discuss, and know that it is still there.

       SS: I really said it all in the main body of the post, so, I'm just going to summarize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I miss what we had in the age of relatively free exchange of information, and deeply mourn the loss of it in this new age of censorship. I just want to tell you guys - the real people left here - that I love you all, and even if you've become embittered by all of the stone throwing, the shit slinging, and the constant harassment at the hands of paid agitators and detractors, we're still all thinking freely on our own, and the bond that is the placing of truth above all else will always unite us, no matter how divisive the current climate may become.

       Fairly sure that you're well intended, but the language used in your post, mainly the past tenses and bygone things, lowers morale by making it seem like we've already lost and that there's nothing to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is, of course, no good, even though I prefer text posts with original writing from users.

       I feel you, man. My own morale is admittedly low. I've fought, so very hard. You've probably even seen some of my past work, not to brag, but just to say that I understand what you mean when you say that there is much to be done. I guess I just wish we were able to make more headway than we are, now. I do see progress, though, with for instance the crimes of Israel and zionists in general being asked spoken of more and more, whereas even a year ago that would be impossible. With every step forward, though, also comes a doubling down on censorship, an increase in the hatred of those who seek to stifle certain truths. You're right, though. We should be focusing more - I should be focusing more - on the progress and not the resistance to it.

       Well, to deny that it has at least in part gone to shit would be to deny a truth. There are forum agitators/spies/shills etc. But just dwelling on that is effectively doom porn.
       <br/>
       I think accepting that truth is just the first step, and then the next step can be providing education on how to not let them manipulate your mind, so that we may continue to use these forums just as we have for years. For instance, there's a link in the sidebar to "the gentleman's guide to forum spies" which highlights all majorly known forum manipulation techniques. If someone reads that then they can then notice the techniques when in action and be able to either just bypass it, or point it out for others. Thus enabling better communication.
       <br/>
       We gotta talk solutions. Which I believe are education and love :)

       I'm not denying that the shilling here is heavy along with alt accounts working together to bash on someone. But I'm also acknowledging the progress the subreddit has made at becoming more aware of it. But it is a continual process and people must learn to weed out the bullshit.

       Though it is easier now than in the past. Take the beginning of WW2 for example. The "assault" on the radio station in Gleiwitz was a false flag operation with a fake transmission of it being held by polish forces to serve as a pretext for Nazi Germany's invasion. The whole transmission lasted for 4 minutes and as the range of it wasn't that big only few people even noticed it. Of course it was blown up later in the press but today it would go around the world within minutes. Misinforming people takes even less energy now than in the past.
The internet is indeed a sword with two edges.

       I think you're getting at misanthropy being intrinsic hatred for another species on a subconscious level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy it, it's projection of one's own insecurities.  Every misanthrope I've met acts like theyre morally superior while deep down they're miserable bastards. More importantly, I think it would be used to justify racial supremacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think there may have been separate species of humans not from earth. I was just trying to get you to come out and say what you were getting at.

       This really seems to me like you're making it out to be as if all the real people left and everyone is at each other's throats when in reality, people for the most part are really civil. I feel like this is another shit-slinging thread that appears at least twice a week here. But, instead of the same old same old, you changed it to make it seem like you give a damn...

       I'd just like to say that we're all undergoing a journey of discovery...think back to when you had that aha moment and started to see that things are not necessarily what the school textbooks say, or what TV tells you, or what CNN is reporting. And think about who you were before that. Perhaps you were once also that person who attacked others who held views that were different from the socially accepted narrative. That's just the way it is...every person is at a different stage of their journey. Perhaps the detractors are just one stones throw away from becoming one of "the real people", or perhaps the "real people" are a stones throw away from realizing that they weren't as real as they thought they were. Just keep going and don't get stuck in the past or brought down by an unknown future.

       Great post, and you are right. The censorship and subversion is only going to get worse, as we traverse further into the Cosmic Hurricane, that is the Great Awakening/Unveiling (a new Age). Dark times ahead, but, if you make it through, true enlightenment will follow.

       My greatest fear is that the disinfo agents were working to train AI manipulators through machine learning, whether they knew it or not. Every upvote, every downvote, every snarky bullshit comment and dismissal tracked and watched by neural networks linked to GPU superprocessors. We don't need hard AI to emulate the scripts, and I fear the day that automated manipulation becomes a legitimate technology. After spending some time reading the drivel in

       Obviously AI is being used, but can you confirm it's being used for automated social manipulation? It's clearly possible, but you would need an army of shills working for many months to train the AI. Could this have been the true purpose of CTR/ShareBlue?

       I very much believe it was. Or at the very least, it gave them the framework and data they needed to create those. Thing about AI is it's all about data. Thing about discussion forums like reddit is you get unlimited amount of conversations to mine your data from. It's extremely difficult to do good AI in many fields (lots of snake oil products) but the ''chat bot'' part of AI is well understood and already in use for simple things like live chat sales agents and such. NLU/NLP is quite good right now and it's much harder to understand voice than text. There are even news websites that create entire stories completely automated. Most people don't even realize it's a bot. It's not perfect, but one thing about the internet is you have people from all over the world so often when you see weird writing you expect it's someone who is not a native English speaker for example and don't think more about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also keep in mind ''AI'' means many things. I'm not talking of a computer that can have long conversations and completely fool you, turing style, it's more automated bots that have self learning process and are constantly fed new data that expand the ability of the bot. For example, you have a bank of 1000 inflammatory comments (based on data gathered with shareblue for example) and you link these to specific keywords and discussions. The sentence was not itself created by the bot, but the bot decides when to use it by context. You can have hybrid systems with AI detecting sensitive discussions which pulls real people (ie traitors) into these discussions. As for proof, I don't have proof this is used by agencies to fuck us over, but the tech is available and with shit like alexa and google equivalent, and these companies deep ties to the CIA, it would be stupid for them not to use this. It's just the normal evolution of what they're already doing.

       You’re alright, OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attacks and downvotes don’t work, though. Not in dissuading anyone from “waking up”, anyway. When shills pile on innocent wrong-think with double-digit downvotes it doesn’t make everyone fall in line. People don’t like bullies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the semites and sodomites in subs like tmor have the shekels behind them in this infowar doesn’t give them an advantage so far as the truth is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more they clamp down on “Holocaust denial” the more people question it. They’re getting angrier at all alternative ideas and it is activating the almonds of normies who would have continued to revel in time wasting talmudic filth. Instead, the thought-police clue us all in to what is worth investigating.

       Media driven hysteria coupled with the desire of criminals to hide their crimes results in an undesirable position for us I'd say. Easier to follow the narrative, eh?

       Go look at my last two posts. They called me part of the GOP because I don’t think the democrats will do anything against voter fraud if caught rn bc they can hide behind everyone’s hate for the GOP.

       We are the Travelers, that's our job. We are dots in a crowd, specs on a canvas. We are your cashiers, bus drivers, doctors, waitresses, police officers, artists and poets. We act in sunlight where our enemy creeps in the shadows. Our enemies policy is to lie, ours is the truth. We express love, they endorse hate. We know we're never alone, we operate in synchronization within the body of our Lord, and him in us. When you see eachother on the street, a smile and a nod is appropriate, though redundant. We already know eachother and we already know what we're here to do.

       Yeah, the good old days of the web are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to love going online to AboveTopSecret and even when I first found r/conspiracy a few years ago, things were good. There were good posts coming in through Reddit a few years ago, and ATS was always a great spot to find cool stuff around 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were two great moments that changed how things work in the US (at least, maybe it affected all countries, who knows).
1. 9/11 - The country literally changed. From mostly happy, just living our lives, trying to get by to dread and terrorism, hardcore fearmongering by the government and a perpetual war in the middle east. It's ridiculous how things literally did a 180 and the country went from decent to awful in just a matter of hours. Worst part? Most US citizens
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       war and were instantly afraid of radical Islam. Kind of like clockwork, I guess.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        2016 Elections - I've never seen such a blatant war on our psyches. Leading up to the election wasn't as bad. Sure, people took sides, there were controversies, things were already kind of messed up...but my gosh. The last couple months leading up to election day, and the moment Trump won, everybody just lost their minds. Democrats, republicans, everyone just went full-blown bonkers. Dems hating and ridiculing Trump and other republicans. Republicans still hating on Clinton and everything that the democrats really stand for. It's not just debates or anything either, it's full on hatred towards one another.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       "Oh, you voted for Trump? Get out of my life and kill yourself you racist pig." And it goes both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the two major turning points that have helped mold society into this awful state. Media outlets on nearly all platforms pump anger into our brains, and
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       is in on the action. Actors, sports stars, every average joe, they've taken to social media to bash everyone that doesn't agree with them. In an effort to control our minds, votes, and ultimately wallets, it only took a couple major events to throw the US people into a spiraling frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt it'll get better any time soon, and it'll probably take more than votes get it done. We are in dark times, but there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.

       How is this a bad thing?

       Basically because of what OP said:
      </p>
      <p>
       Paid shills, bots, people behind the scenes controlling information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, it's easy to communicate, but that goes both ways. Our ability to surf the web freely is being threatened as we speak. Beyond that, it's so easy to share information. False information is still information.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone suggests something that goes against a certain narrative, it can so easily be censored or shoved aside by bots and paid shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because mostly everyone has a direct line of communication between one another doesn't mean everything's great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, the technology is wonderful. We're living in truly fascinating times.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is not dark in the slightest. What's dark is the corruption, manipulation, and censorship of these platforms.

       I mean, ignorance is bliss. Sure. And at the end of the day, none of this really hurts anyone, but it can be used to manipulate how people think, which in the long run can absolutely hurt people.

      <p>
       That doesn't raise any red flags to you?

      <p>
       Is it wrong for me to want to live in a world where things aren't so manipulative around every corner?
      </p>
      <p>
       The way things are, there's no respect for what's right. There's only desire to prove one's self right, and that's wrong, if the person is wrong. With these shills, it's easy to make the correct person look wrong, when, in actuality, they're exactly right. I'd wager that might hurt somebody eventually too.

       If people want fan-fiction and fun, this subreddit can be exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part about this subreddit is actual facts being traded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that it's gone downhill, but maybe not for your reasons?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a "conspiracy" is dumb and just "fun", we should shoot it down. If a conspiracy actually exists, and has non-LARP facts behind it, we should embrace it.

       This is a recent comment you left:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        our people cost $750,000 per person in welfare. As white men are the only demographic to contribute to the bottom line with their taxes totalling $200,000, whereas all others cost, this means that it takes the life work of 4 white men to pay for a single black person. Hispanic people, though a much larger demographic, cost $250,000 per person per lifetime. This is a large part of why we run a deficit each year, and were it not for welfare minority (not even counting the cost of things like prisons, damages done due to extreme rates of violent crime, etc), the average wage would increase by $24,000 per year. If our country is to survive we cannot keep this up. There is another problem compounding that, though: Black people commit 1/2 of all murders, most rapes, and that is even with white men paying for everything they need to live. Imagine what would happen if we one day said "this is unacceptable and unsustainable, so, we're cutting welfare by 90%". I think that the 1/2 of all murders would rise exponentially.
       </p>
       <p>
        How do you propose we solve that? I ask myself that every day. Would you be willing to accept a state of your own; your own independent black nation in, say, Louisiana? An entire state. No? I didn't think so. How do you propose we solve the hugely, massively problematic welfare problem without increasing the hugely disproportionate rate at which your people kill? You won't take a state of your own, you won't willingly put down the welfare, and we cannot continue to give it to you. So, to my mind, the options are:
       </p>
       <p>
        1.) Race war. Nobody wants that. It would be terrible and costly and despite all of the posturing, I think you know how it would go down.
       </p>
       <p>
        2.) Mass deportation. Is it pretty? No. Is it the best solution given the complexity of the problems we must solve? Yes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because I know that you will say "I'm not violent and I pay taxes", I will remind you that exceptions do not disprove rules, and when trying to solve a systemic problem, anecdotes are inadmissible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seriously, how do we solve the murder/rape/welfare problems?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think you understand what institutionalized racism is and how it affected black people in America. I also don't think you want 'love everyone'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the percentage of welfare recipients based on race.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        • White – 38.8%
• Black – 39.8%
• Hispanic – 15.7%
• Asian – 2.4%
• Other – 3.3%

       That's a lot of white people on welfare. Especially since they're 2/3 of the country.

       Again, if you are capable of overcoming your hatred, I would be more than willing to discuss anything from the social ramifications of moving away from a homogenous society, to Hitler, to black crime, to Jewish nepotism. Nothing is too controversial to discuss, so long as you are capable of civility.

       We should stand by the things we have said and either assert it with evidence and conviction or adjust our views as we learn. I'm not sure you should say it's an attack on your character or shameful of others to point out things that you have said. If it's out of context or untrue, you should be able to easily refute it.

       Would like to point out that the above comment chain was completely opposite in terms of vote counts until about an hour ago, when I then shot to the negatives and angry bros shot to the positives. This is exactly why you guys won't win this fight. You have to cheat just to give the illusion that you're winning. Imagine what will happen when you have to stand on your own in an unbiased, non-manipulable stage.

       I’m not in whatever fight you might think you’re in, nor am I cheating to achieve anything. I merely read your thread and called it as I saw it. The fact that you’re lumping people into your presumptive categories and making assumptions galore speaks more to your own issues. I’m glad the others called you out because it sure looks like you’re showing your true colors by how you’re responding.

       Again, I am willing to discuss, but not willing to engage with hateful and dishonest people. I believe you're not "one of them", because I had you sitting at +2 on RES and that generally doesn't happen unless you're reasonable. I am a bit shocked that you have not seen through their methods, yet, and, to be frank, a bit disappointed. Since you take issue with some as-of-yet-unnamed things I have talked about, and you're a reasonable person who hasn't devolved entirely into hatred, let's discuss.

       That does not change the fact that the vote counts were opposite of where they are now, nor does it change the fact that you are in line with the points that those who would manipulate votes wish to further, but if you can refrain from hatred, again, I am more than willing to discuss absolutely anything from Hitler to black crime to Jewish nepotism: Nothing is too controversial so long as you are capable of civility.

       Friend, I went and checked, and you have a profile exactly matching those which are bought for shilling purposes. 3 years old, next to no activity for a great while, immediate engagement in

        /r/conspiracy

       after nearly a year of non-activity with no posts in

       Simple, because you are dishonest and disingenuous and it needs to be known. I have not attacked your character. You continue to deflect questions that are fair. You refuse to acknowledge that you have been dishonest in saying that I was name-calling you, that I was being hateful, and that you are accusing me of being a shill with no grounds. You even went back and deleted that baseless accusatory comment. Have you no self-respect to abide by what you have said? Do you not see how hypocritical you are?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are the one that needs to stop being hateful, dishonest, and name-calling. And also stop continuing to send me these private messages. Be a man and just post it in your thread, it is who you are after all.

      <p>
       That's really civil and non-hateful of you. Of course not name-calling in your delusional mind.

       u/penjanene is not a shill. Why are you allowed to continue to accuse people of being a shill? That's pretty messed up imo, that you can make a thread about the sub going to shit and directly contribute to it going to shit by accusing people not based on what they've done, but because you don't like what they say.

       Man, I took pains to say that I'm not sure, that no one could say but him. For real, I'll change my understanding of the rule to that we aren't allowed to talk about suspicious profile activity in addition to the literal wording of R10, if that's how it it, but I sincerely thought I was abiding by - if skirting close to breaking - the rule.. No offense intended; would genuinely like clarification on this..

       The fact that whites have had it easier in this country and still manage to represent 38.8% of the welfare population is not exactly supporting white supremacy over blacks. Blacks have had to deal with very real institutionalized racism hence their poverty and higher crime rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying that for their population size they have a higher crime rate, but it's important to see that they are people and that whites contribute to violent crime and welfare/public assistance as well. Asian people, hardly take ANY public assistance. What does that say about them? Are they better than whites according to the op's logic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Haiti? lol what does that have to do with institutionalized racism? That was a slave colony and after Haitian Revolution ended in 1804, gained its independence.

       Frankly, it sounds like you're trying to convince yourself more than you're working to persuade me.   That's typical of those who look down on black people as though they require special concessions and protections.  It's very paternalistic and demeaning, imo.

       Right, two centuries free of white oppression.  What do they have to show for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, after the revolution Jean-Jacques Dessalines (black) had himself declared emperor for life,
       <strong>
        slaughtered the entire white minority on the island
       </strong>
       , and implemented a program of militant agrarianism in which all blacks were conscripted into the military or forced to labor in the fields.  Totally 'not' slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, today, the Haitian Anthem, La Dessalinienne, is named for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, 200 years free of the white oppressor, but what do they have to show for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, like now, black people's problem wasn't white people.  Haiti has everything to do with that.

       White people were given preference for jobs, were allowed to vote unimpeded, were given better schools, easier immigration rules, and were not subjected to a government actively attempting to maintain them in the prison system, among other things.

       And I stand by my statement that Haiti has nothing to do with institutionalized racism because they didn't experience a government in their country actively attempting to oppress them that was ran by another race.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is institutional racism?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Institutional racism is a pattern of social institutions — such as governmental organizations, schools, banks, and courts of law — giving negative treatment to a group of people based on their race.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, regarding Haiti's poor economic state, you have to look at the FACT THAT IT WAS A SLAVE COLONY that revolted and fought for years to gain their independence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read Laurent Dubois, Haiti: the Aftershocks of History.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people over the centuries have stated Haiti is poor because they're lazy and may even use it as part of a point to suggest black people can't rule over themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, Haitians in order to gain independence had to accept leaders that were not concerned with building an economy, but maintaining the country's independence. It got worse as time went on with the environment of the country producing deforestation and so forth. But that really has nothing to do with the plight of black Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might as well as use Liberia if you want to use illogical examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you used my other parts of the comment, but failed to address the idea that Asians, who weren't given an easy route to immigrate to this country, barely depend on public assistance, do well in school are not considered superior to whites? Because according to the faulty logic, Asians really are smart and strong segment of the population, far superior than anyone else...

       What’s your point? Not only does this have nothing to do with the post, but he’s right. The statistic show that nonwhites are responsible for significantly more crime, never mind the fact that the statistics are manipulated by including Hispanic with the white statistics. You’ve been manipulated and you don’t even know it.

       I think the point is that crime is a socio-economic problem, not race. A majority of black people are poor so it is easy to just say, black people are prone to commit criminal acts, when in reality, it is poor people who are prone to criminal acts.

       But that isn't true. Even when you account for socio-economic factors, Blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, commit significantly more crime. What you believe is nothing more than a politically correct fiction, which is worthless.

       As you were scouring my profile to look for ways to attack me, if you would have done so honestly, you would see that I obviously do not think that caucasians are superior to any other race in an overarching way. It's like I always say: Races are like classes in a video game: Every class/race starts off with attributes set to certain levels which help them do their thing. We live in a world that heavily favors, say, wizards, to the detriment of warriors. That doesn't mean that warriors are any less than wizards. Come on, man. If you're sincerely an organic user, you need to be better than this stuff. Attack the idea, if you feel the need to attack.

       Nope, I'm confused. I don't know what small behavior you're talking about. I haven't directly insulted you. You have insulted me. All I did was correct you on seemingly faulty logic concerning race. And you accuse me of being a shill or bot, tying to 'bait' you. So I don't understand the 'small behavior' you're talking about. Maybe you're projecting?

       Yes, 95% of posters and commenters are probably shills or bots. Real working people don't have time to astroturf or develop social media AI botnets to shill for the latest NWO agenda items. Thankfully, though, God compels the satanists to always provide enough breadcrumbs so that the real truth seekers will arrive at the ultimate truth of Jesus Christ, his only begotten son.

       I'm a mod here, and I lean toward the opinion that this sub is not actively compromised at the mod level at this point, but I couldn't tell you for sure. I don't really think there are any stories or arguments that are actively removed here. A specific article or post for breaking various rules, but no topic that is completely scrubbed unless it breaks site-wide rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if the mod team is completely above board today, if at any point "they" need to pull the plug, this sub will get yanked in a millisecond. The revolution will not be on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that means this sub is dead or dying, yet its days are not ultimately determine by our users and mods, but by forces outside our control. We should still use this sub to spread whatever truth and critical thinking skills we have found, yet we have to realize this sub is not safe. Not really.
