    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I just think it makes more sense to say &quot;it looks edited to me because X&quot; rather than a firm statement &quot;it&#39;s edited&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>But you can&#39;t point out that something might be doctored with additional graphics and then put out a video that has been doctored with additional graphics.

    <div class="md"><p>wait that reflection is like almost a triangle and or trapezoid  i though flat earthers said we were in some kind of diviot as in a circular diviot.</p>

<p>the best way to see the ball.. is to look at the moon footage  of the spires through a consumer grade telescope and as it is on the horizon of the moon you can see the surface change perspective as they zoom in.  that is all anyone needs to see.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im going to explain this very carefully.</p>

<p>Flat-earth is a CIA psy-op.</p>

<p>Same with &#39;feman-virus&#39;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s to make people associated with conspiracy-themes seem retarded.</p>

<p>next, CONSPIRACY = crime.</p>

<p>flat-earth is not a crime. If it&#39;s a wool over the eyes phenomena, then it&#39;s barely a crime. A crime can be a relation between people who can be found guilty. EVERYONE in the world, except those who seem to no t know anything about it, believe in space and shit. There is a reason, the consensus on experience is pretty massive, and the technology accurate enough to understand what is being seen. Likewise, the simple math exists, and inter-continental flights, dude. . . seriously. 34,000 feet needed to mathematically see the curvature of the earth. </p>

<p>So, why help perpetuate it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like ancient aliens. </p>

<p>I know the most intellectually barren people who have found a religion off of a history channel show, that is a feed-back loop to one author - yet, they never did the necessary research, as they WANTED some grand conspiracy, rather than being felt dumb for having no understanding of the universe. </p>

<p>Dumb people find solace in the fact the think they were &#39;tricked&#39;, and they are more than their worthless lot. I&#39;m 1/56 cheroke and 1/100,000,000 Beta-reticulin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>understood, and sorry for the confusion on my part, if there was any. </p>

<p>&quot;feman-virus&quot;.</p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>What seems to be occurring in my observations is a new scale-increase in &#39;how crazy can we get&#39;, BEFORE the critical-faculty of people&#39;s better knowing kicks-in. </p>

<p>The &#39;conspiracy&#39; is that feminism is actually a viral pathogen, infecting people to become more feminine. They load pictures full of pseudo-scientific shit taken from text books, remove the print, and interpret the overlaid pictures of HIV attacking cells to be labeled &#39;the femen-virus&#39;.</p>

<p>Like Flat-earth, it seems to originate on image boards. This meme originating on /Pol/, while the flat-earth seems to have originated on /x/ after a website for the &#39;flatearth socioty&#39; was res-erected in 2004 - with the solar eclipses of 2017 hyping the discourse on popular social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I see where you&#39;re interpreting what I mean to imply you think &#39;FL&#39; is true.</p>

<p>This is false.</p>

<p>The intent was to show you need to know, THIS IS NOT ORGANIC stupidity. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the point. It&#39;s funded. </p>

<p>It&#39;s scare-crow scientists and fake-beliefs pushing the most gullible in evangelical pre-existing nonsense - who also believe in an apocalypses - to &#39;mix&#39; within the conspiracy channels to make EVERYONE seem crazy.</p>

<p>So, the intent was not that you believe FL, it&#39;s that you might not understand it&#39;s a scam/ Psy-Op.</p>

<p>Also, I dont get how anyone could consider a philosophical movement - of many &#39;movements&#39; in reference of change - to associate with a viral pathogen.  The point is to &#39;expand&#39; upon the MEME idea, into thinking it&#39;s materialized; as someone will believe anything up and including &#39;bat boy&#39;, in the grocery store papers.</p>

<p>Yet, this is the pattern of &#39;attack&#39; for this Psy-Op. take something feared or not at all udnerstood - as that takes investment- and twist the fundamental wanton belifes to accommodate the false-new information.</p>
