       I'm not an expert but it looks like it skips some frames or gets darker or lighter and then somehow an image appears in the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find the original unedited video so we can have a gander at that. I don't think it needs to get cut, zoomed in and paused.

       I'm not seeing what you're saying. I'm no expert either but I've downloaded the video and I see the brightness not change until he zooms in a repeat of the same footage and even then the brightness change is just the fact he's using a camera to record a screen so exposure is going to fluctuate a bit but not at the point we first see the reflection.
I didn't see a frame skip but I did see the switch to black thing, which I admit I don't understand why he did that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not 100% sure that this is not doctored, but if it is, it's a damn good one. I currently think it's legit because I don't see anything that discredits it at the moment.

       Fair enough, I just think it makes more sense to say "it looks edited to me because X" rather than a firm statement "it's edited".
I mean it is, because it's a video with cuts, but whether it's doctored with additional graphics is uncertain.

       But you can't point out that something might be doctored with additional graphics and then put out a video that has been doctored with additional graphics. The original video should be enough because its not like it zoomed in that much and
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       there is some weird face in the window then we should be able to see it without the pointless zoom in.

       Yeah I know. If it was doctored then it would obviously be deceptive. I wasn't arguing otherwise....We don't know if it's doctored yet. Doesn't look it IMO though. Not all of the reflection is zoomed in, a repeat piece of footage was zoomed in but other segments are not zoomed in.

       Yeah big if true indeed. If it turns out to be fake, it was not my intention to deceive, I just randomly stumbled upon it searching Antarctica stuff if I recall correctly.

      <p>
       Finding the original may take some work, these livestreams are long as hell and I wonder if there's untouched archives somewhere. Perhaps the date would help narrow it down.

       wait that reflection is like almost a triangle and or trapezoid  i though flat earthers said we were in some kind of diviot as in a circular diviot.
      </p>
      <p>
       the best way to see the ball.. is to look at the moon footage  of the spires through a consumer grade telescope and as it is on the horizon of the moon you can see the surface change perspective as they zoom in.  that is all anyone needs to see.

       then again if you have a flat surface reflecting a massive 2600k ball and you are only 400 miles away  that is most likely all you are going to see..   you are not even close enough to gain respective.  any 3d modeling program and show you such a perspective..   but that will only lead to what the hell are they showing us?

       Im going to explain this very carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat-earth is a CIA psy-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with 'feman-virus'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's to make people associated with conspiracy-themes seem retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       next, CONSPIRACY = crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       flat-earth is not a crime. If it's a wool over the eyes phenomena, then it's barely a crime. A crime can be a relation between people who can be found guilty. EVERYONE in the world, except those who seem to no t know anything about it, believe in space and shit. There is a reason, the consensus on experience is pretty massive, and the technology accurate enough to understand what is being seen. Likewise, the simple math exists, and inter-continental flights, dude. . . seriously. 34,000 feet needed to mathematically see the curvature of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why help perpetuate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like ancient aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the most intellectually barren people who have found a religion off of a history channel show, that is a feed-back loop to one author - yet, they never did the necessary research, as they WANTED some grand conspiracy, rather than being felt dumb for having no understanding of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dumb people find solace in the fact the think they were 'tricked', and they are more than their worthless lot. I'm 1/56 cheroke and 1/100,000,000 Beta-reticulin.

       "feman-virus".
      </p>
      <p>
       Good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems to be occurring in my observations is a new scale-increase in 'how crazy can we get', BEFORE the critical-faculty of people's better knowing kicks-in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'conspiracy' is that feminism is actually a viral pathogen, infecting people to become more feminine. They load pictures full of pseudo-scientific shit taken from text books, remove the print, and interpret the overlaid pictures of HIV attacking cells to be labeled 'the femen-virus'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Flat-earth, it seems to originate on image boards. This meme originating on /Pol/, while the flat-earth seems to have originated on /x/ after a website for the 'flatearth socioty' was res-erected in 2004 - with the solar eclipses of 2017 hyping the discourse on popular social media.

       I don't get how anyone would label feminism as feminine. Third wave feminism in particular is not remotely feminine or lady like.

       I don't understand why you assumed I was an FE-er when my post
specifically made clear it was not the topic.
Also, did you read my post? What do you think?

       Oh, I see where you're interpreting what I mean to imply you think 'FL' is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent was to show you need to know, THIS IS NOT ORGANIC stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the point. It's funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's scare-crow scientists and fake-beliefs pushing the most gullible in evangelical pre-existing nonsense - who also believe in an apocalypses - to 'mix' within the conspiracy channels to make EVERYONE seem crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the intent was not that you believe FL, it's that you might not understand it's a scam/ Psy-Op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I dont get how anyone could consider a philosophical movement - of many 'movements' in reference of change - to associate with a viral pathogen.  The point is to 'expand' upon the MEME idea, into thinking it's materialized; as someone will believe anything up and including 'bat boy', in the grocery store papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, this is the pattern of 'attack' for this Psy-Op. take something feared or not at all udnerstood - as that takes investment- and twist the fundamental wanton belifes to accommodate the false-new information.

       I'm not seeing what you're saying. I'm no expert either but I've downloaded the video and I see the brightness not change until he zooms in a repeat of the same footage and even then the brightness change is just the fact he's using a camera to record a screen so exposure is going to fluctuate a bit but not at the point we first see the reflection.
I didn't see a frame skip but I did see the switch to black thing, which I admit I don't understand why he did that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not 100% sure that this is not doctored, but if it is, it's a damn good one. I currently think it's legit because I don't see anything that discredits it at the moment.
