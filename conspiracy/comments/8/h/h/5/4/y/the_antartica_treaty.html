       if the antartica treaty was signed by all nations, as it is supposedly stated to be a restricted airspace as well as being restricted to all civilians, what is the actual purpose of antartica, and why do people assume that antartica is the wall of ice that surrounds us while other conspiracies have claimed that there is more undiscovered land beyond antartica? what exacty is the whole story behind this entire treaty?    as a side note i am a conspiracy theorist and have looked well into many theories.

       i am aware of the psychological operation of flat earth, myself on the other hand am more than aware that we live on a globe, but why would a psychological operation like flat earth be in the same context with the antartica treaty?

       what about this video do i need to watch.? i am well aware of the flat earth/ antartica treaty. but you do not go any more into it than a video that does not bring up and major key factors, as per why antartica is off limits, or why there hasnt been any further discovery of anything that could be past antartica. i know plenty about this, but if someone could elaborate more is what would be more beneficial.

       thats a contradiction. if it was actually " off limits" then everything related to it would be removed from any kind of publication.

       No kidding. It was the last thing several independent explorers did before they died. Or assumed dead,

       flat earth has no relevance to the antarctic treaty. obviously they will not let anyone explore. it has to be done is complete secrecy. since i will explore it, i will understand more.

       It's a perfect conspiracy:

      <p>
       1) unknown/mysterious location only visited by top officials

       2) plebs keep out.

      <p>
       I honestly think Antarctica is kept off-limits because of how much damage it would do to the Earth, well, mainly the human bit. If we go down there and start dicking about in the snow, it will melt. Then the sea level will rise, then shit gets fucked up real quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in global warming (the science money grabbing version), but I do believe that a block of ice that size, melting, isn't good for man nor beast.

       the location is not unknown nor mysterious, its antartica.
 it has been sanctioned as a restricted zone, not just " please keep out".

       what " fuzzy science logic" is used? what danger is there about antartica?
 there is no such thing a global warning that was just another idea invented by the government to keep more people in line.

       1) It's mysterious and unknown. It has a lot of mysteries and unknowns about it. How did the ice get there, why are there maps from the 1700's where it was jungle and fertile land. Why is this land mass so massive and at the bottom of the globe, how did it get there etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Fuzzy science logic to say global warming is man made. It isn't, it's a naturally occurring event that fucks us up every 100,000 years or so.

      <p>
       3) Let's not find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Ice is denser than water. If the ice melts the water rises. Eureka!! We shout as the water spills over the edge of the tub and drowns most of our land. The Earth is already 2/3rds water. Let's keep it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Raise the sea level 100M and most of the major cities in the world go underwater. Not to mention the knock-on effect to industry, trade, crops, power generation, homelessness, relocation, civil unrest...

       the ice was formed due to the ice age. other than that, its about who the original civilization was, and what is supposedly underneath the ice.
      </p>
      <p>
       global warning is a hoax, global warming is a way to subliminally mess with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       it got to where is was from when the original land mass was pangea.

      <p>
       whats not to find out, if people do find out then they are more susceptible to understanding the truth. a big fat why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       so its been a theory that if antartica where to actually melt that we would be underwater, what is you hypothesis on this, do you have any links that support your own claim.?
      </p>
      <p>
       if the water were to raise 100m, then those who would be smart and logical, would move to higher ground, othewise it would be another way that the government would want to slowly kill off half the population in order to meet their Georgia guidestone "requirements" to cull off half the population and bring us down to about 500k.

       I have no evidence of how much melting ice = how much sea rise. I do understand physics though and more water = filling the vessel more. By how much I do not know, it is worth the risk?

      <p>
       The native Americans, Incas and I'm sure a few more civilisations were wiped out due to diseases (European diseases) that they had never encountered before. The crew that opened king tut's tomb fell to a similar fate, that of disturbing bacteria that has been wiped out for millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It only takes one disease, one virus or mutagen hidden away and locked under the ice and we are, as a race, fucked.

       allow me to propose a simple test for you to try out to show how Antarctica melting would cause sea levels to rise. get several ice cubes and fill a glass with water right to the brim. the brim of the glass represents the current sea level. leave the ice to melt and return. notice that the glass has overflowed and is now sitting ina puddle. Picture instead of the water puddling at the bottom it instead travelling further up a beach and engulfing land.
      </p>
      <p>
       my question to you is if you really doubt that this is a thing that happens where do you propose the additional water would go?

       whirlpools dont just suck water into nothing. and sure to a point there is underwater caverns, however there's not that many. not enough for  the sheer volume of water were talking.  if we take googles 14million km squared to be the actual size, and were really really REALLY nice about it and said there was 10 litres of water of snow and ice per KM thats still 140,000,000 on top of the supposed 1,260,000,000,000,000,000,000 litres of water in the ocean. And lets be real, there is going to be so much more than 10 litres per km.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically unless you're a hollow earther, or are suggesting there are caverns that will fill up with the ENTIRE additional water from melted Antarctica then there is just simply no way for ALL that water to be displaced.

       That's not the correct comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have ice melt in a glass you're not adding water to your glass, therefore levels won't be rising.
      </p>
      <p>
       The melting ice raises sea levels because it's ice melting that currently not in the sea, thus adding more water into the equation.

       During the Great Flood, about 4300 years ago, some of the floodwaters froze in place around the edges of our flat, stationary earth, and formed an ice wall interspersed with some land, which we now call "Antarctica". Other places in the world were not as cold and the temperatures rose above freezing in the summers, which left only frozen mud, which we now call permafrost. In the temperate and warmer places, vast inland lakes were left, which then drained off into the newly created oceans over the next few centuries - causing sea level rise of several hundred feet as evidenced by the underwater forests just offshore from Alabama, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

       first off, how do you know that we live on a flat earth, have you not realized when are in a computer simulated matrix. other than "the great flood" making antartica, what does this have to do with the treaty?

       do you have a link for this diary? if so, i can only imagine how much of it was either rewritten, or a lot of information was left out.

       whirlpools dont just suck water into nothing. and sure to a point there is underwater caverns, however there's not that many. not enough for  the sheer volume of water were talking.  if we take googles 14million km squared to be the actual size, and were really really REALLY nice about it and said there was 10 litres of water of snow and ice per KM thats still 140,000,000 on top of the supposed 1,260,000,000,000,000,000,000 litres of water in the ocean. And lets be real, there is going to be so much more than 10 litres per km.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically unless you're a hollow earther, or are suggesting there are caverns that will fill up with the ENTIRE additional water from melted Antarctica then there is just simply no way for ALL that water to be displaced.
