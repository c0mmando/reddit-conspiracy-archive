       I love a good conspiracy, but this sub is nothing more than a place to rant about how you all hate Jews and Israel. There’s some bad Jews, we get it, but the general hate and bigotry is astounding. Should rename the sub Neo-Nazis.

       True.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because it’s like a video game. You’re #1 in military in the world. What do you do with it? Your economy flourishes from war, your populace directs anger outwards, you take resources.

       Removing emotions from the equation it’s oblivious. Any country would be doing the same given the circumstances. It’s an unfortunate attribute of humanity.

       One thing is for sure, the amount of "Jewish" concern trolls is getting out of hand.. Nobody hates the Jews.. People hate that Israel gets to act like 1940s Germany, and no one is allowed to discuss the ramifications of the Palestinian genocide without being labelled an antisemite child fucker..

       Their borders.. Right, because they've always been there.. They aren't a country built on taking land that isn't there's, they aren't murdering innocents daily, and they don't view themselves as the chosen people..

       I literally just finished a convo with a user who said that he's anti-Jewish. And he's not even close to a lone individual. Several moderators even expressed their negative opinions about Jews. Yes. People hate the Jews. Pretending that it's only "anti-Israel" is just a thin piece of paper to hide bigotry behind.

       One of the more fascinating trends in society lately is how anything anti Jew, ant Israel, or anti left gets slapped with the broad Nazi or neo-nazi label. Just more continuation of the black and white, right and wrong, good and evil fallacy. One thinks this therefore they must be that. Can there not be rational people in the middle who sees what's happening on both sides? (Assuming they're foolish enough to think there's only 2 sides.)

       Jews were the main focus of the Nazi regime, that’s why. I don’t think all Jews are saints, but the hate they get and the acts that are attributed to them with no proof is ridiculous.

       The Victor writes the histories. That pertains to continuing narratives. Nazis definitely were bad, but it's almost like a where there's smoke there's fire kind of thing. Is it centuries of jealousy that turns people against Jews? They look like any other ordinary white person at this point for the most part. What is it that makes them a constant target of hate? You certainly can't deny the actions of Israel against Palestinian children and reporters. Though I guess you could if you only watched American MSM.

       It’s also not unreasonable to believe that a lot of the really anti-Jewish posts are put here specifically so that other users can come make posts like yours about how this place is just full of anti-semitism and therefore everyone here must be a neo-Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought. Most posts I see raise legitimate points. Only occasionally do I see blatant anti-semitism, and when I do I downvote it just like 99% of the rest of this subs users.

       Miss us with that neo-Nazi shit.

       Several moderators are openly anti-Semitic (by anti-Semitic, I mean how Webster's defines it. Which I have to mention because for some reason people in this sub like to pretend the word doesn't mean what it actually means). About two years ago the sidebar was a picture of Hitler with a link to a Neo-Nazi YouTube channel all about how Hitler was "misunderstood" and "The Jew" was really at fault. Heck, one of the front page posts right now is about Holocaust denial with various users sarcastically chiming in about how much they hate Jews. I'm not sure why so many users are so dead set on this mentality that the anti-Semitism on this sub is all trolling. It's very much endemic and it's been here as long as I can remember.

       Pattern recognition is anti Semitic. Maybe if Israel wasn't a far right ethnostate and maybe if the diaspora didn't advocate for open borders we wouldn't have a problem.

       Ah yes, the tried and true "Conspiracy theorists are anti semites" stereotype. Whole subs devoted to it. Perhaps you can join one of them and rant away. You happen to be in luck too because we have a president who wants to be the most pro Israel president of all time! Surely you could help him in this regard.
