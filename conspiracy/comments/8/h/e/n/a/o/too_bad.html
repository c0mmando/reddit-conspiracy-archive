<p>Why? Because it’s like a video game. You’re #1 in military in the world. What do you do with it? Your economy flourishes from war, your populace directs anger outwards, you take resources. </p>

<p>One thing is for sure, the amount of &quot;Jewish&quot; concern trolls is getting out of hand.. Nobody hates the Jews.. People hate that Israel gets to act like 1940s Germany, and no one is allowed to discuss the ramifications of the Palestinian genocide without being labelled an antisemite child fucker.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the more fascinating trends in society lately is how anything anti Jew, ant Israel, or anti left gets slapped with the broad Nazi or neo-nazi label. Just more continuation of the black and white, right and wrong, good and evil fallacy. One thinks this therefore they must be that. Can there not be rational people in the middle who sees what&#39;s happening on both sides? (Assuming they&#39;re foolish enough to think there&#39;s only 2 sides.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Victor writes the histories. That pertains to continuing narratives. Nazis definitely were bad, but it&#39;s almost like a where there&#39;s smoke there&#39;s fire kind of thing. Is it centuries of jealousy that turns people against Jews? They look like any other ordinary white person at this point for the most part. What is it that makes them a constant target of hate? You certainly can&#39;t deny the actions of Israel against Palestinian children and reporters. Though I guess you could if you only watched American MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several moderators are openly anti-Semitic (by anti-Semitic, I mean how Webster&#39;s defines it. Which I have to mention because for some reason people in this sub like to pretend the word doesn&#39;t mean what it actually means). About two years ago the sidebar was a picture of Hitler with a link to a Neo-Nazi YouTube channel all about how Hitler was &quot;misunderstood&quot; and &quot;The Jew&quot; was really at fault. Heck, one of the front page posts right now is about Holocaust denial with various users sarcastically chiming in about how much they hate Jews. I&#39;m not sure why so many users are so dead set on this mentality that the anti-Semitism on this sub is all trolling. It&#39;s very much endemic and it&#39;s been here as long as I can remember. </p>
