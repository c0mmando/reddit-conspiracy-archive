        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On the front page of reddit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TIL that when Auschwitz camp commander Rudolf Höss was accused of murdering three and a half million people during a trial, Höss replied, &quot;No. Only two and one half million—the rest died from disease and starvation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>r/todayilearned/comments/8hcd4k/til_that_when_auschwitz_camp_commander_rudolf/</p>

<p>And yet according to the fakers today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is estimated that the SS and police deported at least 1.3 million people to the Auschwitz complex between 1940 and 1945. Of these, the camp authorities murdered approximately 1.1 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005189">https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005189</a></p>

<p>Yet the death books released by the Russians show:</p>

<pre><code>Total Jews in Auschwitz, 1941–1944: 173,000

Total number of inmates in Auschwitz, 1940–1944: 334,785

Total deaths by typhus in Auschwitz, 1941–1944: 103,429

Total Jewish deaths by typhus in Auschwitz, 1942–1944: 58,240
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://thegreateststorynevertold.tv/official-german-record-prisoners-auschwitz-concentration-camp-may-1940-december-1944/">https://thegreateststorynevertold.tv/official-german-record-prisoners-auschwitz-concentration-camp-may-1940-december-1944/</a></p>

<p>So basically reddit is circle jerking over a BS confession made by a tortured nazi without bothering to check the facts. Thousands of Jews died at Auschwitz, not millions.</p>

<p>However as I pointed out there, Höss doesn&#39;t have to be correct, early estimations rarely are. Further why does the fact that methodology changes and reflects a more accurate number disprove anything</p>

<p>Also the 4 million stat came from the soviets who wanted to make it seem like different groups were murdered in similar numbers at auschwitz</p>

<p>I demand physical evidence. For example, in the alleged Syrian gas attack, I didn&#39;t believe it just because the White helmets said so. Guess what? It was revealed to be a total fake psyop, just like the holocaust.</p>

<p>And we kind do have the exact number of bodies from the death books. Why do you think they say thousands died instead of millions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence for the holocaust is as overwhelming as it is easily accessible. It <em>IS</em> a bit silly to ask for evidence when it can be googled in like 5 seconds. </p>

<p>Since evidence from reliable sources is so overwhelming and accepted by quite literally all reputable sources, holocaust denialism is the extraordinary claim in this case. The burden of proof is on the ones saying it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>If you really, actually wanted the evidence, you could have had it already with a simple google search. Generally speaking, people only ask for evidence of this because they&#39;ve already made up their mind and they&#39;re not going to read it anyway. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tip: Go to the wikipedia page for Holocaust denial - and scroll down all the way to the bottom, and look at <em>their</em> references. </p>

<p>There are hundreds of primary sources - there is literally no better form of historical evidence. You can even get the entire official records and transcripts of the Nuremburg trials, part of which I&#39;ll provide for example: </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071104150152/http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Nazi_Vol-IV.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20071104150152/http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Nazi_Vol-IV.pdf</a></p>

<p>Part of the reason why the holocaust is considered such a tremendously evil event - is that while other terrible genocides may have killed <em>more</em> people, none of them were carried out with the level of industrial precision as the holocaust. The Nazis <em>mechanised</em> genocide, and then made considerable efforts to <em>fine tune the machine</em>. It was coldly systematic, which heightens the &quot;wrongness&quot; of it. </p>

<p>They were explicitly trying to industrialize genocide - this has never been done before or since. They built an entire <em>infrastructure</em> of genocide, and then they set about making it as efficient as possible. In order to do this, they needed DATA. So part of the reason why there is so much evidence for the holocaust is exactly what makes it so horrifying, that the meticulous engineering with which it was conducted required more record-keeping than genocides usually get. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean their data is perfect - there are gaps, mistakes, some was destroyed, some was erroneous, etc. So when we have numbers like &quot;4 million died in Auschwitz&quot;, which gets later revised to &quot;2 million&quot;, or whatever, that&#39;s not because those people <em>didn&#39;t die in the holocaust</em> - it&#39;s because the last known record of that person was them <em>entering Auschwitz</em>, and then after the war, they were <em>gone</em>. It is common for it to be discovered later that they were sent to a different camp before they died, and we didn&#39;t have that record, or whatever. </p>

<p>In any case, the nazis admitted to killing millions of jews, it&#39;s <em>extraordinarily well-documented</em>,  and if it turns out that 4 million <em>didn&#39;t die</em> at Auschwitz, that it was only 2 million, it&#39;s not because those missing 2 million people <em>didn&#39;t die</em> - it&#39;s because they died in a different camp and the record is incomplete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can be, but calling something a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; implies a paucity of evidence of some kind. Once enough evidence is provided, it simply becomes a &quot;fact&quot;. In this case, the evidence is absolutely overpowering in every conceivable way. </p>

<p>The document I linked is over 1000 pages long, containing hundreds of letters written by German officers during the war, detailing the activities in the concentration camp they were overseeing - and that&#39;s  <em>just the 4th volume of the Nuremburg documents</em> - only a fraction of what was immediately available after the war, and the available evidence has only increased since then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I&#39;m not sure I can explain it any simpler than I already did, but I will try. </p>

<p>Here are all of your possible scenarios:</p>

<p>A) In the documents, there are two distinct categories: </p>

<p>&quot;Concentration Camps&quot; -Millions of Jewish civilians are taken at gunpoint, and forced to work until they die of starvation and disease. Data is gathered and recorded, and can be read in the above documents.</p>

<p>&quot;Death Camps&quot; - Millions of Jewish civilians are taken at gunpoint and mass-executed in gas chambers. Data is gathered and recorded, and can be read above documents.</p>

<p>B) There is no official distinction made between &quot;Concentration Camps&quot; and &quot;Death Camps&quot; - the terms are used arbitrarily and interchangibly. Both refer to millions of Jewish civilians being taken at gun-point and either worked/starved to death or mass-executed in gas chambers. Data is gathered and recorded, and can be read in the above documents.</p>

<p>All of the above scenarios amount to nothing more than a difference in <em>naming conventions</em>. It doesn&#39;t matter if they call it &quot;concentration camp&quot; or &quot;death camp&quot;, or &quot;summer camp&quot;, or fucking &quot;space camp&quot; - the end result is exactly the same. </p>

<p>Many of them were, but IIRC not all of them. </p>

<p>In any case, the Jews and other &quot;undesireables&quot; they brought to these camps were captured from conquered territory. It wasn&#39;t just German Jews, it was jews from all over Europe. </p>

<p>Before the &quot;final solution&quot; was enacted, the captured civilians were the slave labor which drove the war machine, building tanks and bombs, etc. </p>

<p>They were a disposable work force building supplies for the soldiers on the front. It would not have made any logistical sense to ship all the victims all the way back to germany, make them build stuff using the homelands resources, then ship all the stuff back to the front. </p>

<p>Also, slave labor or not, thats just bad planning. You use the resources of the conquered territory as much as possible. Having a captive, slave work force means that if that &quot;factory&quot; gets bombed, you mostly lose the people you were already exterminating.</p>

<p>Also the 4 million stat came from the soviets who wanted to make it seem like different groups were murdered in similar numbers at auschwitz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the Soviets had a vested interested in hiding their own atrocities committed during WW2, and demonising the Nazis in the Nuremberg show trials was an effective tactic to take the heat off them.</p>

<p>However, the Auschwitz total of (an utterly absurd) 4,000,000 million was specifically shoehorned in to Hösss&#39; trial at Nuremberg to appease the Zionists, because they needed the total number of Jewish deaths to come to 6,000,000. </p>

<p>This is the figure that would satisfy the requirement in the Torah (Leviticus 25:10) for the return of the Jewish people to the Israel - interpreted as <a href="http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Jews/Jews-History&amp;amp;ScripturalOriginOfThe6MillionNumber.html">&quot;You shall return, minus 6 million&quot;</a>. These 6 miillion victims were a necessary ritual sacrifice, and they had to be burned whole (the literal meaning of the word &quot;holocaust&quot;) and thus the gas chamber + cremation combo was an expedient lie to satisfy that element of the &quot;requirement to return&quot;.</p>

<p>Höss was tortured before his trial at Nuremberg, like many Nazis war criminals, and it is thought he agreed to admit to being responsible for deaths of an implausible 4,000,000 at Auschwitz, if his torturers promised to leave his family alone. Höss knew he was going to be executed, whatever happened, so his admission at Nuremberg was purely to save his own family.</p>

<p>He would also have known that this absurd lie would be uncovered before too long, and it would demonstrate that the Nuremberg Trials were a travestly of justice - show trials, that were designed to push Soviet and other Allied atrocities at the end of WW2 into the background.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently revisited David Irving&#39;s work as well as watched the trailer of Denial a few times. I can&#39;t bring myself to watch the entire film because I can tell from the trailer alone what a white wash of the truth it is, it really looks so biased. It paints Irving as a monster and doesn&#39;t seem to indicate the film addresses the fact that a number of very concrete pieces of evidence and sound arguments by Irving for why the stories of people being gassed at Auschwitz have to be fabricated and that the ruling against him was a flagrant injustice of court corruption by an essential ethnostate and genocidal apartheid regime that is Israel. It&#39;s not even ethnostate, just a fiefdom of Rothschild Zionists...many of whom were behind what happened in the Holocaust which, as various modern historians - Jew and gentile alike - have shown. The film shows Irving as &#39;denying&#39; the Holocaust when critical examination of his work and claims proves he does not. He simply denies certain parts which, if true, reveals a wider conspiracy behind Adolf Hitler. Irving claims Hitler gave no order which would have created the Holocaust let alone did he even know about it. He provides documents in Hitler&#39;s War showing that in instances where Hitler found out about tragedy and hostility befalling Jews he would immediately send help to rectify the situation. He wrote major deals with Zionist leadership on the management of the Jewry out of Europe and into Palestine, the Havaara Agreement of 1933. Irving makes the claim that the many Jews killed outright by SS, Nazis were killed by rogue factions not taking orders from the very top, in fact, it&#39;s even likely a number of Hitler&#39;s next in command knew little of what did go on. But certain claims maintained about Auschwitz, certainly, seem highly fabricated based on solid evidence still available for analysis, and the sheer number of debunked by true, unafraid, primary source based historical scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joseph Goebbels in his diary makes reference to Hungary. Looks like Goebbels the insider and one of Hitler&#39;s closest confidant&#39;s thinks something completely different is going on. According to the official narrative the deportation of the Hungarian Jews began on April 29, 1944 when a train load of Jews were sent to Birkenau. In ten short weeks 400,000 were alleged gassed there. Did Goebbels not get the memo? Curious indeed.</p>

<p>Apr 18, 1944 (II.12.44)</p>

<p>The Führer then explained to the Gauleiters the background of his campaign in Hungary, and how it was designed. He gave an amusing description of his talk with Horthy. He had to use strong-arm tactics because the old man was not comfortable with the necessary measures. The Führer left him in no doubt, that either it would be a fight to the death or that he had to submit. The Führer had so many forces to apply to this campaign that Horthy offered no serious resistance. In particular, the Führer expected contributions from Hungary of food, oil, manganese, and people. In particular, he wants the 700,000 Jews in Hungary involved in beneficial activities for our war effort.</p>

<p>Apr 27, 1944 (II.12.199)300,000 Hungarian Jews have been detained and imprisoned in the concentration camps. They should come, in large part, to Germany as a workforce. Himmler will take care of this; above all, they are to be used for our difficult war production programs.</p>

<p>May 4, 1944 (II.12.232)</p>

<p>Our plenipotentiary in Hungary, Veesenmayer, gives an excellent speech on the decisive Hungarian factors. …In particular, it’s to his credit that the Hungarian potential is now in large part requisitioned for our war efforts. Also, the Jewish Question is now being handled more energetically. I insist that the measures taken against the Jews in Hungary have a factual basis. It’s not enough that one only announces in the press what happens, but one must also explain it. In Budapest the Jews are starting to be gathered into ghettos. The ghettos are built in the vicinity of the armament factories, because air attacks are likely there. It is hoped thereby to avoid British-American attacks on Budapest, if at all possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How substantial, if at all, is the moral difference between:</p>

<p>1- Rounding up the civilians of a particular ethnic group, at gunpoint, and starving/working them to death in prison camps, in filthy, cramped conditions prone to disease, such that roughly two million of them die.</p>

<p>2 - Rounding up the civilians of a particular ethnic group, at gunpoint, and sending them to gas chambers, such that roughly two million of them die.</p>

<p>A rational person MIGHT be able to argue that one of those is slightly preferable to the other. (Personally, given the choice, I&#39;d probably rather be gassed)</p>

<p>Even if we grant that distinction, though, both of them are murder, unequivocally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first, it&#39;s worth examining whether it actually is illegal. Even in the European countries where &quot;holocaust denial&quot; is illegal, laws are pretty much never written in such vague language. It could very well be the case that even in those places, it might <em>still</em> be perfectly legal to question the existence of gas chambers, specifically. Or it might not be - I don&#39;t know - but in order to really know, you have to look up the language of the law directly. </p>

<p>Secondly, we in the US tend to be more &quot;absolutist&quot; when it comes to free speech than most, but even we have some restrictions on speech - the old stereotypical example is that in most jurisdictions, it&#39;s illegal to yell &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a crowded theater (so long as there isn&#39;t actually a fire, that is).</p>

<p>In order to really understand the rationale, though, you have to consider where most of these holocaust denial narratives originate: far-right, ethno-nationalist/neo-Nazi groups.</p>

<p>The unbelievable irony of this, which IMHO encapsulates their malignancy perfectly - is that the groups who most loudly deny that the holocaust ever happened <em>are also outspoken anti-semites who openly advocate genocide.</em></p>

<p>They literally claim the holocaust was all a setup by the jews to gain sympathy - which they then use as a launchpad to get to the position that the jews need to be exterminated. Even if it weren&#39;t for the mountains upon mountains of evidence for the most well-documented genocide in human history - documented by the Nazis themselves - the fact that they hold these views simultaneously demonstrates their naked disregard for the truth.</p>

<p>Holocaust denial has no basis in reality, and the people who push these narratives <em>know this</em>. We can tell that they know this because <em>they advocate for the same genocide</em>.</p>

<p>TL;DR: It&#39;s illegal (maybe) in parts of Europe because:
1- The populations tend to be less free-speech absolutists
2- The main purpose of holocaust denial is not simply &quot;innocent questioning&quot; -it is mostly used as a recruitment tool for violent extremist groups, and despite it&#39;s flagrant dishonesty, can be remarkably effective at radicalizing certain vulnerable people.
3- There is no legitimate academic/intellectual/political discussion around the veracity of those events. The evidence is overwhelming and readily available.</p>

<p>While both of these statements are true, those old grannies and muslim school children are not where these narratives <em>originate</em>. The Islamic side of the anti-semitism is rooted in a similar totalitarianism which openly seeks genocide, and holocaust denial is a means of getting a &quot;foot in the door&quot;. These narratives absolutely <em>do</em> originate with extremists. Old grannies and school kids are the <em>target</em>, not the <em>source</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the holocaust have any basis in reality? Show us the physical evidence, not themeparks and movies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Here&#39;s volumes 3 and 4 of the record from the Nuremberg trials. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071104150152/http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Nazi_Vol-IV.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20071104150152/http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Nazi_Vol-IV.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-III.pdf">https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-III.pdf</a></p>

<p>As I explained to another commenter, both of these documents consist not only of official court records, but also of the evidence presented. Each volume is over 1000 pages, and these represent just a <em>fraction</em> of the evidence presented at Nuremberg - which, in and of itself, is <em>only a fraction</em> of the evidence that has emerged in the years after. Volume IV in particular consists almost entirely of communications between German officers <em>during the war</em> - not under duress or forced confession or anything like that. They describe, in their own words, and in no uncertain terms, what happened in those camps - including gas chambers, mass executions by firing squad, even the grisly human experiments of Joseph Mengele and other Nazi scientists.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of corroborating primary sources, which include the the testimonies of many Nazi officers who participated, many more who deserted, the eyewitness accounts of American and other Allied soldiers involved in liberating the camps, as well as the photographs that many of them took. I hope you understand if I consider my 2000 pages worth of reading material a decent contribution for my part. The rest you can find by googling. </p>

<p>A good way to find excellent primary sources is to go to wiki, but scroll all the way down to the bottom and peruse their references. These often lead to some exceptionally good sources, first-hand accounts, etc.</p>

<p>Honestly, read my answer again, because I already addressed all of this. The whole thing falls apart because you did not completely read what I wrote. </p>

<p>Go and look at the documents I provided. Go look at them. Especially volume 4. Look at page 135 in particular, that one is extremely damning. The evidence that is contained in the links that I sent you is NOT from captured germans. It is from <em>letters, telegrams, and cables that they sent back and forth from German high command over the course of *years</em>.</p>

<p>Not under torture. Not under duress. Not even a confession. Just officers giving status updates to their commanders on how the genocide is coming. </p>

<p>The accounts from Nazi officers - of which there are <em>thousands</em> - are NOT from torture. They are not from after the war. They are not from after they are captured. Even if there <em>was</em> torture - that is NOT where this body of evidence comes from. </p>

<p>What makes this genocide so insidious, despite not having the <em>highest death toll ever</em>, is the fact that they built an entire infrastructure dedicated to genocide, and then directed an entire apparatus of their society towards making this genocide more efficient. The cold, calculating nature of it is partly what makes it so evil.</p>

<p>But in order to make this genocide efficient, the Nazis collected vast amounts of data and research. Some of it was destroyed - there was a war on, after all - but much of it survived. That is what those documents contain. Go look at it. It&#39;s the data that the nazis themselves collected about their own genocide, for the purposes of making it more efficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet it is unacceptable to dispute the claims of Jews?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the mountain of evidence, of which over 2000 pages of damning evidence has already been provided for you, from primary sources. I&#39;m sorry if this is frustrating, I genuinely am, but this is not a matter of debate. It is a matter of fact versus fiction. </p>

<p>The reason why it is unacceptable to dispute the claims of Jews is, for one, because the claim is indisputable. There is a mountain of indisputable evidence, a small fraction of which I have provided, but you have clearly not looked at. And two, because it is not <em>just</em> the claim of the Jews. It is the claim of thousands upon thousands of US, UK, Russian, Canadian, and even Germans who were eyewitnesses. It is what is undeniably evident with massive amounts of raw data, 2000 pages of which have already been provided for you.</p>

<p>It is also census records, bones and mass graves, extermination rooms at Auschwitz where the fingernail marks are still visible on the walls from when people tried to escape the gas chambers - which are still standing. You can literally go there and see them.</p>

<p>The enigma encoded records show the Holocaust is fake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For historians, said Irving, the intercepted &quot;Enigma&quot; messages are a historical source of &quot;bedrock value.&quot;</p>

<p>The British intercepts, Irving said, throw light on the number of victims of the infamous Allied firebombing of Dresden of February 13-15, 1945. He cited an intercepted March 1945 dispatch by the Dresden police chief, who reported a death toll of 135,000, with some 80,000 to 100,000 &quot;missing.&quot; This is consistent with figures given by Irving over the years, and discredits the much lower estimates of recent years by some historians.</p>

<p>The intercepted German messages, said Irving, confirm mass killings of Jews in Poland and the occupied Soviet territories. These messages, he said, sometimes refer to shootings of Jews as &quot;special actions&quot; (&quot;Sonderaktionen&quot;). He cited, for example, mass shootings of Jews near Riga in late November and early December 1941, which was witnessed by German General Walter Bruns.</p>

<p>Mass killings of Jews, Irving said, were carried out by SS chief Heinrich Himmler on his own initiative, and without Hitler&#39;s authorization or order. This view of &quot;the Holocaust&quot; is essentially the same one he laid out more than thirty years ago in the first edition of his book Hitler&#39;s War.</p>

<p>Because their testimony is overwhelmingly backed by primary source material, raw data from German files and communications, as well as eyewitness accounts from thousands of soldiers. All of which I have already included for your perusal, but of which you have read exactly zero.</p>

<p>Also, I did misunderstand your claim before, but your correction isn&#39;t any more correct. Your article, as far as I can tell, does not appear to make any claim at all about the death toll of the holocaust. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s what you&#39;ve posted so far: A couple of messages interpreted by known crackpot David Irving from known crackpot David Irving&#39;s crackpot website, which supposedly say that the Holocaust was a hoax - because of a discrepancy over the <em>total death toll</em>, which those messages make <em>no claim to be, whatsoever</em>. You&#39;re willfully misrepresenting someone else&#39;s willful misrepresentation of some other people&#39;s willful misrepresentation.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve posted so far: 2000 pages of primary source evidence which is broadly accepted by literally every historian <em>except</em> known crackpot David Irving, verified by Nazis themselves, and corroborated by thousands of eyewitness accounts.</p>

<p>You cannot accept the truth because you are blinded by your ideology. You are willfully ignoring what is objectively the best evidence presented. You&#39;re wrong. I know it, you know it, and everyone who reads this will know it. You have presented nothing which even comes close to the body of evidence against you. Now I&#39;ve got to go to bed, I have work in the morning. I&#39;m happy to help if you have questions, but you should really consider taking a deep breath and comparing our sources.</p>

<p>If you look at your own sources with the same kind of skepticism you view everything else, you&#39;ll find that yours fall apart much more readily. But you have to be honest with yourself and stop taking it so personally. </p>

<p>It is not &quot;Jews&quot; telling this story. It is the entire world. It was every liberating army who advanced into German occupied territory and found concentration camps. This is what Eisenhower wired back to the joint chiefs after entering one of these liberated camps with General Patton:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... the most interesting—although horrible—sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to &#39;propaganda.&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is Patton&#39;s account of the same camp, in his words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a shed ... was a pile of about 40 completely naked human bodies in the last stages of emaciation. These bodies were lightly sprinkled with lime, not for the purposes of destroying them, but for the purpose of removing the stench. When the shed was full—I presume its capacity to be about 200, the bodies were taken to a pit a mile from the camp where they were buried. The inmates claimed that 3,000 men, who had been either shot in the head or who had died of starvation, had been so buried since the 1st of January. When we began to approach with our troops, the Germans thought it expedient to remove the evidence of their crime. Therefore, they had some of the slaves exhume the bodies and place them on a mammoth griddle composed of 60-centimeter railway tracks laid on brick foundations. They poured pitch on the bodies and then built a fire of pinewood and coal under them.

<p>I&#39;m not the guy you were originally arguing with in this thread, but I did just read this and I&#39;m not sure why you think this is some &quot;damning evidence&quot;?  It&#39;s just the testimony of Dr Rascher about the body-temperature experiments.  </p>

<p>Sure it&#39;s bad.  But it doesn&#39;t really touch on the &quot;bigger picture&quot; of what went on.  </p>

<p>Here is a question for you .. you know Höss testified that 3.5 million people died at Auschwitz, right?  But we now estimate that only 1.1 million died.   So for some reason, when Höss was tried by the Soviets, he swore to killing between 200 - 300&amp;#37; &gt;more&amp;lt; people at Auschwitz than was actually the case, right?  </p>

<p>What do you think could possibly be the reason for Höss to exaggerate the truth of Auschwitz at the Soviet trial?</p>

<p>Frankly, 1 discrepancy at a single camp is meaningless. The Nazis were still scum whether they ethnically cleansed 20 million, 5 million, or 1 million.

<p>About the gas chamber having been &quot;changed back&quot;?  I have to admit it bugs m that even someone who obviously is informed, like you, doesn&#39;t know this fact.  Don&#39;t you find it odd that it is not common knowledge that the gas chamber they show at Auschwitz is a &quot;historical re-creation&quot;?</p>

<p>Anyways .. online primary sources are a bit tough to find.  <a href="https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab10-gas-chamber-fake/">But this site that tries to combat Holocaust denial acknowledges it.</a></p>

<p>From the page ..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The facts are: The crema/gas chamber in the Main Camp (Auschwitz I) <strong>has been accurately restored to its historic role as a gas chamber</strong>. It is meant to be a memorial and symbolic representation of all the cremas/gas chambers in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp complex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever you believe you can understand why people dont want to shout this out loud.  But it isn&#39;t a secret, or &quot;conspiracy talk&quot;.  All academics know Crema 1, the gas chamber they show to tourists, is a re-construction.  The only &quot;debate&quot; is whether it is a reconstruction of what was once there, or a total fake.  However, there are tons of people who go to Auschwitz and see that chamber, and come back convinced that they have seen the &quot;authentic gas chamber&quot;, and will then go on to say &quot;I have seen the gas chamber with my own eyes!&quot;</p>

<p>So you can process for yourself how this ties in to the whole thing.  Why aren&#39;t they more up-front about the &quot;re-built&quot; chamber at Auschwitz? How is it that people can swear to have seen a real gas chamber when that is not true?  Why were the scratches on the wall not painted over when the chamber was used as an air-raid shelter?</p>

<p><a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b57c2041e138435ff37c7bb8d0ff069d-c">Are these really what you expect hand scratches to look like?</a>  Look at how evenly spaced all the fingers are. Look how similar the finger spacing is on all of them.  All straight lines too.  No curvy scratches. I dont know about you, but if someone told me these had been done by some kind of <a href="https://www.belmontdepot.com/media/catalog/category/Hand-Garden-Tools.jpg">garden tool</a> I would believe them. Maybe part of the &quot;historic reconstruction&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Right. And so all of those remains are still out there.  Just like we have dinosaur bones and the bones of Richard III and old Viking burial grounds.  Unless someone could make them magically disappear somehow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second of all, it&#39;s ludicrous to say that because one officer&#39;s estimate was wrong, or perhaps taken out of context, or perhaps even made up, that suddenly the whole thing is suspicious. Maybe his testimony was a wild-ass guess?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. And maybe he was saying what he had been told to say, back at the time that the Soviets were trying to claim higher death tolls <em>everywhere</em>.  That is always a funny thing for me.  Almost all camp death tolls ended up being revised <em>down</em> after WW2. At Sachsenhausen outside of Berlin the Soviets in 1948 had said 200000 people died there. Then that was changed to 100000.  Now the camp embarrassingly doesnt even like to be so specific, instead saying &quot;tens of thousands&quot; when historians believe it to be around 15000 to 20000.  </p>

<p>It just seems odd that all of these death totals keep getting reduced from there original postwar &quot;inflammatory&quot; estimates.  But there is one number that has never been touched.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And besides, The Nazis were still scum whether they ethnically cleansed 20 million, 5 million, or 1 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well this is where it starts getting interesting. Because the Nazis have gone down in history as &quot;the worst ever&quot;. Were the Belgians scum for killing 8 million Africans in the Belgian congo?</p>

<p>I guess numbers are important because the Holocaust is/was a big part of the cornerstone identity of Israel.  I mean .. its certainly why the USA gives Israel total support and was part of the very reason for the creation of Israel after WW2.  Because &quot;never again&quot;.  Even though the Russians lost 27 million people to the Nazis, there isn&#39;t any kind of support for them &quot;because of how much they suffered&quot;, right?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact remains that they made systematic genocide an integral part of their culture and they killed millions in doing so. Scum of the Earth, end of story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would really dispute that &quot;genocide was an integral part of Nazi culture&quot;.  Radical racism, sure.  But they two are not the same thing as we see from the black situation in the USA in the 20s and 30s.  There you had &quot;radical racism&quot; as an integral part of culture, but you wouldnt say &quot;genocide&quot; went along with it, even though there were surely some Americans who would have had no trouble &quot;gassing all them n*ggers&quot;.</p>

<p>Well I do find it odd that people arent TOLD this at the camp museum, dont you?  If you went to see a skeleton of bigfoot, would it be important to you if it was a real skeleton or a &quot;re-creation of what his skeleton looked like&quot;?  </p>

<p>&gt;Considering there were thousands of witnesses,  </p>

<p>I am an atheist.  So I start off with the acceptance that there are billions of people out there who swear God has spoken to them and they have seen Jesus or Allah or whatever.  They will swear, on their lives, that they have physically felt his presence.  Are they liars?  Stupid?  &quot;Wishful thinkers&quot;?  Probably a bit of all of that.  So that&#39;s where I start.  &quot;People do that.&quot;</p>

<p>&gt;as well as letters, as well as intercepted messages, as well as survivors, soldiers who went in and liberated the camps. The number of primary sources is staggering.  </p>

<p>Well it depends on what you are trying to prove with that stuff.  Personally I acknowledge a lot of the shitty stuff while disputing the scale of it.  So you can show me a picture and a testimony of a mass shooting and I will say &quot;Of course&quot;.  But that doesnt prove six million, right?  </p>

<p>&gt;But then again, denialists aren&#39;t really interested in the truth. They are either interested in generating Nazi sympathy, or they have been suckered into believing Nazi sympathy. Which one are you?  </p>

<p>I think this is a pretty broad and uninformed statement on your part. There are plenty of people who dispute aspects of the Holocaust without being neo-nazis or stupid.  Obviously the fact that denying the Holocaust will ruin your life is going to affect how much these people publicize their opinions, right?  </p>

<p>If it makes any difference to you, I didn&#39;t start questioning any aspects of the Holocaust until I moved to Germany and started working as a guide at concentration camps (Sachsenhausen and Dachau).  It was *then* that I started to question some of it.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re overthinking the historical meaning of this omission, while underestimating the responsibility of those who decided to omit this. Ultimately, I might not even agree with how it was done, but it&#39;s not at all difficult to understand why it was done that way. </p>

<p>Making the appropriate decision as to how those camps should be displayed is not as simple as it might seem. Those camps are undeniably a <em>tourist attraction</em> - people come from all over the world to see them - but it&#39;s very important that they not turn into an <em>amusement park</em>. </p>

<p>Having a tasteful re-creation of the gas chambers is one way to ensure that the people who visit have a much more visceral reminder of the horror that happened there, which is, ultimately, what they came to see, morbid as it may be.</p>

<p>But people shouldn&#39;t be going there to let their kids run around eating cotton candy and shit, and that&#39;s a hell of a lot easier to maintain when you&#39;re standing in &quot;the room&quot;, rather than standing in the place where the room used to be. But... how much of that gravity is maintained if you just come out and tell people that it&#39;s fake? </p>

<p>Just to illustrate the point: If you worked there, I&#39;m sure you saw plenty of people being shitheads. How much more difficult would it be to tell them to &quot;have some fucking respect&quot; if there were signs everywhere saying &quot;this is all a re-creation&quot;? How much more difficult would it be if there was no re-creation at all?</p>

<p>That decision has to walk a fine line between absolute historical honesty and maintaining the appropriate tone. I&#39;m not sure that I would do it exactly the same way, but it&#39;s easy to see why they would. And, if that information is as available as you claim, then are they really lying about it? Or are they just choosing to omit information which they believe undermines the appropriate solemnity of the experience?</p>

<p>Besides, even if it were &quot;suspicious&quot; in the way that you&#39;re claiming, the history and veracity of the holocaust is based on FAR more than whatever currently sits on the land where Dachau once existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am an atheist. So I start off with the acceptance that there are billions of people out there who swear God has spoken to them and they have seen Jesus or Allah or whatever. They will swear, on their lives, that they have physically felt his presence. Are they liars? Naive? Stupid? &quot;Wishful thinkers&quot;? So that&#39;s where I start. &quot;People do that.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am too. And I mean you no offense, but you&#39;re not doing the whole &quot;atheist&quot; thing very well if you can&#39;t see the difference between these claims. </p>

<p>One is a series of recent historical events which left behind mountains of physical evidence, including mass graves, stolen property, physical marks (tattoos, arm bands, etc), and a mountain of <em>contemporary, primary source material</em>, among many other things.</p>

<p>The resurrection has no physical evidence. The number of <em>contemporary</em> primary corroborating sources are precisely ZERO, they were all written decades after the fact at minimum. Perhaps most significantly, the claims of a resurrection as well as those of an omnipotent celestial super-being directly controvert the most basic principles of biology, physics, and logic - therefore the standard of proof they would require is <em>much</em> greater than that of an event which is merely astonishing, but perfectly within the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Despite carrying the greater burden of proof, the claims of religion present far less evidence. They are not comparable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well it depends on what you are trying to prove with that stuff. Personally I acknowledge a lot of the shitty stuff while disputing the scale of it. So you can show me a picture and a testimony of a mass shooting and I will say &quot;Of course&quot;. But that doesnt prove six million, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6 million is an estimate. It was calculated by compiling numerous reports and investigations by universities, government institutions, and independent investigators - each of which acknowledges the difficulty in compiling the correct number. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that it&#39;s complicated - but this complication is <em>not unacknowledged</em> by those who give the estimate, and it doesn&#39;t render their claims unbelievable. What is unbelievable is the claim that single discrepancies are enough to undermine the entire multi-national collective effort to document the history that took place. It is intellectually lazy on the part of denialists to dismiss it out of hand without accounting for the myriad of legitimate reasons for discrepancies to exist.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Frankly, it should - just as much as it should undermine MY credibility if I were to start running around saying that Elvis Presley was alive and living inside my appendix.</p>

<p>AT BEST, it highlights an ignorance of history, and a willingness to believe in absurdities, and while I cannot say for certain that every denialist is an anti-semite, the belief itself is absolutely empowered and sustained by anti-semitic attitudes. In short - the historical and logical basis for it is so incredibly flimsy that it is not illogical to assume that people who believe in it do so because they are pre-disposed to an anti-semitic narrative. </p>

<p>Furthermore, this belief system is often propagated by neo-nazi groups who are outspokenly anti-semitic, and I&#39;m always a bit surprised that the conflict of interest is not more obvious to people.</p>

<p>The neo-nazis themselves KNOW that the holocaust happened, and this much is obvious by the fact that they <em>openly seek for it to happen again</em>. The fact that they universally advocate for genocide reveals this genocide to be inherent to their ideology - it makes absolutely zero sense to believe them when they say that it never happened in the first place. The only reason they propagate such beliefs is to engender sympathy to their cause. It is patently dishonest on it&#39;s face.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure.  But it <em>does</em> factor into a debate where someone says &quot;How can you doubt anything!?!?!? I have been to Auschwitz and seen the real gas chamber with my own eyes!  What .. you think they would build a &quot;fake gas chamber&quot;, you fucking idiot!?!?!?&quot;</p>

<p>When someone talks about &quot;mountains of proof&quot;, they will commonly cite, (sometimes among other things, sometimes not) the piles of hair at Auschwitz and the gas chamber that you can go and see.  Problem is .. every prisoner was shaved when they were sent to a camp.  There would be piles of hair at the camps even if not a single person died.  And .. the gas chamber is &quot;not authentic&quot;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to nail any specific points.  Only trying to illustrate that what the &quot;layman&quot; will perceive as &quot;undeniable evidence&quot;, often is not.  And there are a lot of things like that in the whole story.  I can make another quick example of &quot;perception vs reality&quot; for you here ...</p>

<p>This picture comes up a lot.  <a href="https://www.sunnyskyz.com/blog/2104/This-Powerful-Photo-Shows-German-Soldiers-Reacting-To-Footage-Of-Concentration-Camps">It is a picture of German soldiers being forced to watch footage of the camps after the war.</a>  Look at how ashamed and shaken they are with what they are seeing, right?  Maybe you have seen it?</p>

<p>Ok.  Now what if I told you those guys are actually covering their faces because they don&#39;t want to appear in some propaganda photo that is going to be used for who-knows-what purpose being taken by an enemy photographer?   Notice how it is only the guys directly in front of the photographer who are covering their faces with their hands and hats?  Notice how everyone else in the room actually seems pretty darned normal?  </p>

I imagine if they didn&#39;t all have folders they would look as &quot;sad&quot; as that guy second from the front, right?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to cherry-pick specific points. Only trying to demonstrate a very interesting phenomenon that I have experienced having worked with this material, and having witnessed the process of how people interpret this material.  Literally - People will believe what they want to believe, and see what they want to see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That decision has to walk a fine line between absolute historical honesty and maintaining the appropriate tone. I&#39;m not sure that I would do it exactly the same way, but it&#39;s easy to see why they would. And, if that information is as available as you claim, then are they really lying about it? Or are they just choosing to omit information which they believe undermines the appropriate solemnity of the experience?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I of course understand the issue there.  It&#39;s just that EVERY GAS CHAMBER IS PROBLEMATIC.  Every one.  It was either destroyed at the end of the war, or &quot;re-built&quot;, or they say that there wasn&#39;t anyone actually gassed there like they originally thought (like Dachau, which once had a sign in the gas chamber that said it had &quot;never been used&quot;, but that sign has since been removed, even though the camp still officially maintains that there is no proof that the gas chamber they show was ever in operation), or there are some really weird and irreconcilable facts about it. Like isn&#39;t it weird to have a gas chamber with doors that open to the inside?  Wouldn&#39;t it be hard to open that door if there were dead people in front of it?  Or why have a big glass window in a gas chamber?  &gt;Every one&lt; has some &quot;weirdness&quot; or other.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a single one that is just &quot;obvious and airtight&quot;.  And the one that people always say IS  ... is Auschwitz.</p>

<p>If you and I wanted to get into a transporter booth right now and go and look at an &quot;obviously real authentic gas chamber with no odd questions surrounding it&quot; .. it is not possible.</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually not true. There are some we could visit. Sonnenstein near Dresden.  Hartheim near Linz, Austria.  These were Euthanasia centres that were part of the T-4 project to kill mentally and physically handicapped people.  There are gas chamber at those locations.  And .. strangely .. they are fully documented. All of the arrivals, and gassings. There is evidence of the remains. The numbers gassed, and the &quot;rates of gassing&quot; at those places is much more modest and &quot;workable&quot; .. 30 - 40 people at a time gassed with carbon monoxide. Totals in the thousands.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it interesting that those more modest examples of gassing somehow still have lots of solid proof to document them?  <em>That&#39;s</em> what a Nazi gassing operation looks like.  Why wasn&#39;t that evidence destroyed?  Actually .. why do we not have any actual testimonials of people who said they destroyed evidence of gas chambers?  We don&#39;t.  The argument is ... &quot;We didn&#39;t find any evidence, so that must mean it was destroyed&quot;.</p>

<p>But we do have, for example, a testimony by a German officer named Gerhardt Schirmer who along with 8 other people signed sworn affidavits that they were forced by the Soviets to build a gas chamber in Sachsenhausen immediately after WW2.  <a href="http://abundanthope.net/pages/Political_Information_43/Documents-on-Real-History-Col-retd-Gerhart-Schirmer_printer.shtml">Here is an English translation.</a>. I know the site looks a little shifty but it&#39;s the only place I can find an English translation right now. I could show you more authoritative sources, but they only have the original German text. Incidentally the book he wrote about his experiences as a Soviet prisoner after the war are banned in Germany as Holocaust denial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am too. And I mean you no offense, but you&#39;re not doing the whole &quot;atheist&quot; thing very well if you can&#39;t see the difference between these claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commonality is &quot;people who want to believe something, will believe it pretty easily&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One is a series of recent historical events which left behind mountains of physical evidence, including mass graves, stolen property, physical marks (tattoos, arm bands, etc), and a mountain of contemporary, primary source material, among many other things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, you are demonstrating a part of the problem.  3 of those things that you just cite as &quot;physical evidence&quot;, aren&#39;t evidence of what I think you are saying they are evidence of.  Yes there were mass killings (of all kinds of people, like in many other wars, and even more predominantly of Jews), yes the Nazis did loot and plunder and seize Jewish assets among the assets that they looted (I don&#39;t at all say they were &quot;good guys&quot; they were definitely anti-semitic!), and yes they had a tattoo system at Auschwitz.  But what do you say this is all &quot;evidence of&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the claims of a resurrection as well as those of an omnipotent celestial super-being directly controvert the most basic principles of biology, physics, and logic - therefore the standard of proof they would require is much greater than that of an event which is merely astonishing, but perfectly within the laws of nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok I agree, but there are also claims around the gas chambers and death tolls that defy the laws of nature. Claims around how quickly a gas chamber could be filled, operated, drained of fumes, emptied of bodies, and scrubbed clean of puke and shit to get ready for the next group. Claims around the rate bodies can be incinerated by ovens.  These are also &quot;wonky&quot;.</p>

<p>And you can actually draw a good parallel with religion. Directly after the war there were all kinds of claims made. The &quot;Jews into soap&quot; thing. The &quot;lampshades&quot; thing.  They claimed people were executed by mass electrocution. They claimed there were mass gassings in camps inside Germany.  They claimed exaggerated death tolls.</p>

<p>But bit by bit, as research advanced and evidence was unearthed, those stories fell away one by one. Until we are left with a thing that, like &quot;God&quot;, has no physical evidence for it.  The victims were unrecorded.  The evidence of the chambers was destroyed.  The victims bodies were cremated, then buried.  And the evidence of that? Well the ashes were all apparently dug up at the end of the war and dumped into rivers and used as fertilizer, so we can&#39;t see that.  So .. &quot;you just have to have faith, man.  But ask this guy and he&#39;ll tell you he has <em>definitely</em> seen God&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS IS PART 2. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is intellectually lazy on the part of denialists to dismiss it out of hand without accounting for the myriad of legitimate reasons for discrepancies to exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that some Denialists are idiots and purely driven by hate.  I don&#39;t get along with a whole bunch of them, and they have their own bullshit they spew (like the &quot;Prophecy of the 6 millon&quot;.  But there are other, reasonable people who don&#39;t think like that that also present legitimate issues.  Isn&#39;t it intellectually lazy to refuse to even consider those, simply because it is &quot;blasphemy&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In short - the historical and logical basis for it is so incredibly flimsy that it is not illogical to assume that people who believe in it do so because they are pre-disposed to an anti-semitic narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think is flimsy for the argument that something &quot;very hard to believe&quot; &gt;didn&#39;t&lt; happen the way it is presented?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, this belief system is often propagated by neo-nazi groups who are outspokenly anti-semitic, and I&#39;m always a bit surprised that the conflict of interest is not more obvious to people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that this doesn&#39;t help the issue at all.  But there are plenty of other normal rational people who deny aspects of the Holocaust as well.  You just don&#39;t know them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The neo-nazis themselves KNOW that the holocaust happened, and this much is obvious by the fact that they seek for it to happen again. The fact that they universally advocate for genocide reveals this genocide to be inherent to their ideology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t true.  It just isn&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to get sidetracked here, but that is just a gross mis-representation of reality.  Even if it <em>is</em> true in some cases, &quot;what some nut jobs think&quot; really has no bearing on the actual facts of the debate.  </p>

<p>This is getting long, and thank you if you have made it this far. But I will just leave you with a Denier scenario that doesn&#39;t involve anti-semitism.</p>

<p>THEORY - After the war, the Soviets wanted to be able to show &quot;How evil the racist imperialists had been&quot; and so they took rumours and perhaps isolated incidents of atrocities and build mockups in many camps so they could take people to show them the &quot;horrors of facism&quot;, like a chamber of horrors.  This is not unbelievable right?  After all, we know the Soviets had no problem with a little bit of &quot;fake propaganda&quot; right?  It IS Stalin we are talking about, right?  So they started building gas chambers and &quot;neck shot devices&quot; (don&#39;t even get me started on the ridiculous &quot;neck shot devices&quot; that you can still go and laugh at at many camps).</p>

<p>Then the Americans got in on the game and installed a few at places like Dachau.  Why?  Well what difference did it make if there was a little fibbing here or there right?  After all .. everyone knows the Nazis were baddies!  Interestingly, at that point, the gas chambers weren&#39;t really a &quot;jewish&quot; thing.  Everybody was just saying that <em>everyone</em> was dying in the gas chambers.</p>

<p>And ... &gt;&gt;SIGNIFICANTLY&lt;&lt; .. if it wasn&#39;t for gas chambers then the number one award for &quot;most civilians killed in one place&quot; would go to the Americans for the bombings of Dresden and Hamburg.  But .. with gas chambers .. &quot;at least we weren&#39;t THAT bad!&quot;</p>

<p>Then immediately after the war, Israel was created.  It was contentious, and a lot of people weren&#39;t cool with this new Jewish homeland being created in the Middle East.  But .. from a US/UK perspective, Israel was <em>very</em> valuable.  It was the only &quot;100% western ally&quot; in the Mid East.  A very valuable geo-political &quot;square on the game board&quot;.  definitely something that the Western powers would want to keep safe.</p>

<p>But still ... for a long time .. there wasn&#39;t really a narrative of the &quot;Jewish Holocaust&quot;.  The camps and the gas chambers were &quot;for everyone&quot;.  Lots of people had died. The Jews were among them.</p>

<p>Dachau had been the &quot;big bad concentration camp&quot; at the end of WW2.  It was the most famous.  They said there had been gassings there.  They had witnesses too!  But then by the 1960s that had changed to &quot;there might not have been a single gassing at Dachau&quot;.</p>

<p>As the years passed &gt;all&lt; of the gas chambers that ended up in West Germany were &quot;downgraded&quot; bit by bit until we end up with some historians even making definitive claims that there had been &quot;no gassings on German soil&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;But&quot; (.. as the story was mutating ..) &quot;the gas chambers were really all over there in the Eastern Bloc!&quot;  Of course .. nobody could really go and research those because of the Iron Curtain and all the records were in the hands of the Soviets, who were still claiming things like &quot;4 million people died at Auschwitz&quot;.</p>

<p>But even guys like Elie Wiesel, who is one of the major Holocaust writers, wrote his first book about his experiences in Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1958 (&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_(book">Night</a>)&quot;) And even though he mentions that he talked to all kinds of people at Auschwitz, including men from the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; working the crematoriums .. <em>he does not make a single mention of gas chambers</em>.  He <em>does</em> talk about mass killings, but he said Jews were thrown alive onto burning pits. This was another one of the &quot;stories&quot; that had circulated after the war, along with the &quot;mass electrocutions&quot; stories.  He goes on to write many more books, but it will be ten more years before he mentions gas chambers.</p>

<p>Then in the late 1960s and 1970s you had a lot of international resistance against Israel.  That was the time of the PLO.  Israel fought FOUR wars during the 1970s.  </p>

<p>And coincidentally, THAT was the time that the real Holocaust narrative started to come out.  That&#39;s when the &quot;Holocaust / Auschwitz&quot; story really established.</p>

<p>&quot;The U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was passed in 1948, yet it would take decades for the popular and academic recognition of the Holocaust as a major event to be memorialized, studied, and taught.&quot;<a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/culture-news/260677/history-future-holocaust-research">source</a></p>

<p>That was the time that things went from &quot;a lot of Jews died&quot; to &quot;Jew suffered more than ANYBODY!&quot;  Even more than the 27 million people that Russia lost, I guess.  How was the Jewish 6 million worse than the Russian 27 million?  Because of HOW they died. In the most terrible way imaginable. Into the gas chambers of Auschwitz.</p>

<p>So it certainly made sense at that point for everybody to pursue this narrative of &quot;The Jews suffered worse than anybody, so GIVE ISRAEL A BREAK! How can you be critical of Israel? Remember Auschwitz!&quot;</p>

<p>But then the Iron Curtain fell, and all of the sudden researchers had access to the camps in the East.  And legitimate questions started to get raised.  So that&#39;s when the Holocaust denial laws started to be introduced in the 1980s.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s my angle, and the angle of the &quot;moderate Deniers&quot;.  No anti-semitism.  No Jewish World Conspiracy.  Just a fib that was told after the war to &quot;make the enemy look worse than myself&quot; than ended up being capitalized on to protect Western geo-political interests in Israel and the Mid East and eventually the story was told and told and Tod until it became &quot;common knowledge&quot;.  Like the story about Napoleon being short. (He wasn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>And why would so many people go along with it and say they were witnesses?  Well .. I just bought a great book on the concentration camps called &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/KL-History-Nazi-Concentration-Camps/dp/0374535922">KL</a>&quot; (that&#39;s the German abbreviation for concentration camp -&gt; <em>K</em>onzentraions<em>L</em>ager.  It is a very &quot;pro-Holocaust&quot; book.</p>

<p>Here is something interesting that comes up in the prologue ..</p>

<p>&quot;To give one example of the malleability of memory: As the Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele gained in notoriety after the war, his face found his way into more an more recollections of prisoners who had never encountered him&quot;.  So .. that happens.  Probably not just with Mengele, right?</p>

<p>Anyways. Blah blah blah.  I hope some of that stuff was interesting for you.</p>

<p>With today&#39;s technology it takes 1-3 hours to cremate a single body. Millions of hours right there.</p>

<p>Yes they had mass grave sites, but the highest official number I can find is &quot;no less then 20,000&quot;</p>

So that&#39;s where I start.  &quot;People do that.&quot;</p>

<p>&gt;as well as letters, as well as intercepted messages, as well as survivors, soldiers who went in and liberated the camps. The number of primary sources is staggering.  </p>

<p>Well it depends on what you are trying to prove with that stuff.  Personally I acknowledge a lot of the shitty stuff while disputing the scale of it.  So you can show me a picture and a testimony of a mass shooting and I will say &quot;Of course&quot;.  But that doesnt prove six million, right?  </p>

<p>&gt;But then again, denialists aren&#39;t really interested in the truth. They are either interested in generating Nazi sympathy, or they have been suckered into believing Nazi sympathy. Which one are you?  </p>

<p>I think this is a pretty broad and uninformed statement on your part. There are plenty of people who dispute aspects of the Holocaust without being neo-nazis or stupid.  Obviously the fact that denying the Holocaust will ruin your life is going to affect how much these people publicize their opinions, right?  </p>

<p>If it makes any difference to you, I didn&#39;t start questioning any aspects of the Holocaust until I moved to Germany and started working as a guide at concentration camps (Sachsenhausen and Dachau).  It was *then* that I started to question some of it.</p>
