       Well there's your answer friendo.. Sarcasm isn't really a good look for you, you ask for respect, then act like a 10 year old.. No one will ever take you serious.. You can actually see the curve from in a plane, so what's the question again?

       The fact that you take everything that another entity says as fact without question reminds me that majority of the population is feeble-minded.

      <p>
       The Earth was once considered flat, just as Pluto was once considered a planet. Also, red meat was once considered extremely unhealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like these once factual statements, things can be debunked as we learn new information about this million year old planet that we’ve only been recording history on for about 5000 years.

       I didn't watch a few YouTube videos and become a flat earth specialist..
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not taking anyone's word for it, I know the earth is round.. I've seen the curvature, I've seen objects disappear beyond the horizon, I've watched the sun rise and set, I tracked the movements of stars and the celestial bodies..
      </p>
      <p>
       I own a very high powered telescope, I've seen the planets, I know they are out there.. I haven't seen a flat one yet, but if I do, you'll be the first to know..
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part is how you are saying that globe earthers are the feeble minded ones.. Answer me one little question please, how do you know the earth is flat? I still haven't seen a single one of your people prove it's flat..

       My point is that we don’t know.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be globular or domed or a flat plane. You don’t know with 100% certainty, as you have not been to space. Nor have you circumnavigated the entire Earth. Nor have you been to those planets you’ve seen in your telescope and circumnavigated them. You only know what you’ve been told to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what makes you think the government would disclose every single detail about everything. Especially if stating that the Earth is flat would cause many other facts to become untrue.

       New ideas frighten the majority, so they stick to the reality they’ve always known.

       My 5 year old asked me this once.
Newton's third law, says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
At only 19 miles away from the earths surface, referred to as altitude, the air is 100 times thinner than at sea level, it just so happens that aircraft need air to propel them and lift them, rockets don't.

       Aircraft don't automatically try to fly in a straight line.  There are constant very small corrections needed to stay on a given course at a given altitude, and on a spherical Earth a fixed altitude is a spherical shell around the Earth, so trimming an aircraft to maintain altitude results in a path that curves to follow the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on a hypothetical flat-plane Earth, you could not take an airplane up, let go of the controls, and have it fly level at a constant altitude.  Winds and temperature changes mean the aircraft is always going to try to slightly climb or slightly descend (and in some cases on some aircraft, the issue gets divergently worse the longer you are not making control adjustments.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, if you were to set up an experiment where you shined a high powered laser tangent to the Earth (let's say off the side of a mountain with a level.) and made a plane which tried to follow the beam straight, on a spherical Earth it would gain altitude until it hit its flight ceiling from gaining altitude and stall and fall down to lower altitude.

       earth is flat, gotta look at things that aren't...cell phone camera not on a football helmet(too close to game exposing choreography?) ... look at map apps on smart phones...should be a real time app that measures distance accurately down to a foot between two people..so person "A" is at sea level and exactly 297Miles 18YARDS 3 Feet away - and they can demonstrate this by moving back and forth with changing numbers every few feet..same app with two people at same elevation at base of tall skyscraper..measure real time distance at base and then do the same at higher elevation..the base distance measurements should be less than the summit distance measurement..this app does not exist..why does no the hydrogen engine get production..most say petro greed but if you had a water powered engine then so many boats would live at sea and be out of control... you can argue many points..NOAA sells navigation charts..buy a whole bunch and do some charting..time and experience here before the world of the internet..I've learned to be happy cause figuring out the mechanisms of control will always leave you with harder questions so before anyone thinks "i'm the best, cause they're wrong"..i say "The circumference of your understanding is limited to the diameter of your perspective/perceptions"..one translation..can appreciate your monopoly square until you have lived (not just visited) around the board..different pacing in cultures across the US show gains/losses in perspective...its like looking at time period based cultures..."well the 60s were hippies, the 70s were disco and rock, the 80's were synths and big hair, 90s was rap/hip hop, and then there is country western"...so kids today will use decades of peoples lives to sum up a personality but architect says we were mostly country before the industrialization and light invention(and then planned obsolescence instituted)..these artificial constructs that current gen use to sum up a decade in a RAM knowledge generation..(Non retained knowledge..will explain later)..are learned through a cell phone screen today .. a while ago i went to a rich friend of my fiancee's engagement party..fall season 2017..i see many archetype groups where stereo types are playing out...ate something hot and went outside to cool off and the blonde flamingos staring at there phones were on the patio passing the vape around...anyway one i engaged in conversation and she told me she worked for D.A.R.E. - I was like cool and for 10 minutes she droned on in that 'up swing' per spoken sentence voice when they are believe they are being informative.  So as the steam coming off me starts to dwindle and i'm hoping the vape passes my way I ask so what does D.A.R.E. stand for..i remembered it was drug awareness something but i didn't remember the rest...keep in mind a few other 'flamingos' joined in with upswingery sentences because they were trying to "be like super positive and letting me know about the good cause and stuff"..but the reason why i dub this archetype the flamingos plays true..none of them knew what D.A.R.E. and in unison looked at each other like flamingos do and then reached for their phones in orchestrated unison..they then got short with me and proceeded to smoke and purposefully pass the vape counterclockwise like a reverse in UNO kept happening...point is forget fame but use good narrative movies as emotional metrics of measurement...patience is become an expensive commodity as free time costs money...watch "Branded", "What Just Happened", "The Informers" and "The Counselor"..(but after you watch the counselor go on youtube and watch the ending with deleted scenes when he talks about the philosophers stone, and shows misplaced audacity to grammatically correct the person that has power over you)..there are 10 million other things, but analysis paralysis is a real thing and peace of mind should be paramount..but as per flat earth stuff...traversed the earth by sea twice in the late 90's...saw many perspective from many elevation..the "curve" i have yet to observe..and thought it funny that gps in the southern hemi still don't work..nav charts compared to globe=remember every few days there were course corrections...i have typed alot ..if you read this far you got fortitude...

       Unfortunately most won’t want to read all of that; however, I’ve deduce that our learned “knowledge” could possibly have loopholes that can negate a lot of the facts we’ve been taught to believe. And that our minds are encaged in the knowledge that’s been taught to us with little room to expand, because of the fear of life not being the same.

       good assessment..but some have extra brain space and ability to think non-linearly..this can be learned if you've lived in hollywood as a transplant and cut video and see creative ability...the only "job" you can hope to have is one where you create something that didn't exist but can last long after you are gone..told this to locals that were editing and its like I created fire for them....hard to explain but here goes...people born and raised in vegas do not gamble..they have been trained on gaming so know what drives their economy..but to visitors its a vice playing out..so if LA makes movies and people born there are that close to that..the ability to feel feelings now becomes the game..add "The Neon Demon" to that movie list..may never figure things out..i use the car at night perspective..play some tunes and worry about what the headlights can see..this derived from old 80s flick better off dead...when you have ANY problem the answer is

       Just curious.  Why is it so important for flat earthers to push their beliefs?  Flat or round, it doesn’t really matter.  On the other hand, something like a global conspiracy to enslave the world, or chemtrails (for whatever reason) seems is a lot more important to go on about.

       The point of this thread is that these “theories” are simply based on other theories that are based on other theories that were created from absolutely no knowledge at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       My goal isn’t to debunk the earth being spherical, but to present the idea that it possibly could be another shape based on what we have learned and can assess with our own senses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like when you took a math course and knew for sure you had answered an equation correctly, unbeknownst that you were wrong. Imagine if you never found out that you were incorrect and continued to do the equation the same way. In turn, you create other solutions to problems based on what you think you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is subjective. We simply have deemed things fact because of others’ testing and not our own firsthand experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most of the people who simply answer to everything without questioning its plausibility follow a two-thousand year old religion created on a million year old planet.

       Except the scientific method is supposed to weed out the bullshit, that is the whole purpose of it. We used to believe the earth was flat, but advancement in how we measure and analyzed the earth proved that it is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your analogy of people who are sure they answer a question right but are actually doing it wrong is representing the flat earthers. I've watched people try and prove the flat earth a whole bunch of different moronic ways that aren't founded in logical thinking.

       It pretty much always starts from ignorance, and going to a basic physics course would probably aleviate most questions. Except of course the people who just throw out all developed understanding of physics simply because they like to act smarter than hundreds of years of work lol

       This planet Is millions of years old and there still isn’t even a sound theory about how our race even came to be. That should be the starting point to logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without firm reasoning of our origin, we can not say what is factual and what is not. We could all be mindlessly babbling about two theories that are both completely inaccurate and do not know because of our realm of perspective.

      <p>
       We can not say that everything scientifically theorized is a fact. The purpose of science is to learn more and more.

       But, it makes no sense that the Earth is spinning on an axis around our sun that is moving around the galaxy which is moving throughout the universe, yet we see the same exact constellations without change.

       Over a couple hundred thousand or even millions of years then yes the constellations are  going to change. a couple thousand  years is nothing on a cosmic scale

       You goons can't help yourself, can you? I mean, you utterly contradicted yourself in less than one paragraph.

      <p>
       The fact remains - you have proved yourself to be utterly ignorant of the topics you raised. For example, claiming that people can't go to Antarctica and that you can only find vague information on how to do it. I proved beyond doubt that claim is false. Not only did I prove it, I did it by simply typing "Antarctica tour" into Google.
      </p>

       That's how little research you did into a "fact" you read on some Flat Earth bullshit website.

       The fact that you posted this question to reddit without knowing that jet engines stall out at a certain altitude leads me to believe that your perspective on reality is probably heavily blurred in a fog of ignorance. Not trying to be rude or anything but seriously.

       I’ve known planes to stall at a certain altitude, but have never had the opportunity to experience it, nor is it a common occurrence. Which means, in my opinion, that it could simply be one of the many excuses to plug up holes on the theories they’ve presented to us for years.

       I've been at higher altitudes and have experienced getting winded much easier, first hand evidence that at high altitudes there is less oxygen in the air. I've also covered a candle with a clear glass and whatched it burn out. Both these experiences provide pretty strong first hand evidence that a jet engine would stall at high enough altitudes. My point being you don't have to directly experience something to know it would occur.

       Nope. The persistence of scientific theories bears little resemblance in practice to the propagation of ancient myths. One is rooted in dogma, the other in evidence. False equivalence.

       Which brings me back to the point — Why is it such a task to get there? You have to take a plane and a boat, and if I’m not mistaken, you need some type of official clearance (government or educational).

       I'm sorry the Earth is not laid at for your convenience, but that's the way it is. It is a "task" to get there because it is one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth and there is very little chance of rescue if anything goes wrong, so trips there must be carefully planned.

       Actually, you can take a plane
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       a boat. There are airstrips on Antarctica. You can even fly to the South Pole, but that means first landing on Antarctica and transferring to a smaller plane capable of landing at the Pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also take one of many cruise ships that will take you to Antarctica in comfort and style, but you won't get near the Pole that way.

       Quantas airlines runs a sightseeing tour over some of the more scenic portions of Antarctica. They also run a commercial flight from South America to Australia which takes advantage of the high velocity winds which encircle the continent. Numerous sightseeing cruises travel around the Antarctic coast. It's the most inhospitable climate on Earth, so it's not surprising that people don't go there lightly. However, if you have a lot of money to blow, you can charter a private flight right over the South Pole.

       Did you know you cannot just get on your yacht or plane and go off into the antarctic Regions? They will not allow you to go. You need insurance, and a permit thanks to that Treaty you mentioned. Even those who try to get a permit are denied.

his crew would risk jail and the voyage by not filling in few forms? or they were denied to so many times. They had no option

       Bullshit. The reason for requiring permits is so that idiots don;t get people killed by heading off into an extremely dangerous environment unprepared... like the moron you mentioned:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        His voyage last year to the Antarctic also got three of his crew killed when his yacht Berserk II sank.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's why governments require permits. But you will note no one actually stopped him from killing three of his crew mates. Even his latest journey was not stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       He went to Antarctica and no one stopped him. You linked to proof that it can be done.

       When there are waves on the ocean, a ship simply floats up and down on the waves, moving vertically without any input from the helm. It works the same way for aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       A wing generates lift through a combination of factors - motion through the air, angle of attack, and density of the air around it. If any of those variables change, the amount of lift the wings generate also changes. When the lift and the pull from gravity are balanced, the aircraft stays at the same altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if an aircraft ascends to 30,000 feet, then levels out and maintains airspeed, it will stay at 30,000 feet because gravity is balanced by the lift generated by the wings at that altitude, angle of attack and airspeed. It's like the aircraft is floating on the surface of a ball of air.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the aircraft was somehow moved vertically upwards without changing its angle of attack or airspeed, the amount of lift the wings would generate in the now thinner air would decrease and no longer balance out the gravitational pull. The aircraft would drop until the air became thick enough to once again generate enough lift to balance gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the boat on the crest of a wave falling into the trough behind the wave until the water stops its downward motion. An aircraft 'floats' on the surface of a ball of air that is dense enough to provide the required lift at that altitude and angle of attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the surface of the ocean, this ball of air can have waves in it. If you have ever been on an aircraft in "turbulence" you have felt the effect of riding on those waves of denser/thinner air.

       Here's my eli5 answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you're in a plane. As it flies, its wings generate lift, which pushes it up.  At the same time, gravity pushes it down.  If it were to go any higher, without changing anything else, the air would get thinner, and it would generate less lift, causing it to drop back down.  If it were to go lower, the air would get thicker, causing it to generate more lift, and pushing it back up.  The plane doesn't have to adjust for the curve, because physics will do that automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, in the real world, the pilot is constantly making minor adjustments to account for buffeting winds and uneven pockets of air or moisture, just like a driver on the road has to account for imperfections on an uneven road.

       I didn't watch a few YouTube videos and become a flat earth specialist..
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not taking anyone's word for it, I know the earth is round.. I've seen the curvature, I've seen objects disappear beyond the horizon, I've watched the sun rise and set, I tracked the movements of stars and the celestial bodies..
      </p>
      <p>
       I own a very high powered telescope, I've seen the planets, I know they are out there.. I haven't seen a flat one yet, but if I do, you'll be the first to know..
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part is how you are saying that globe earthers are the feeble minded ones.. Answer me one little question please, how do you know the earth is flat? I still haven't seen a single one of your people prove it's flat..

       good assessment..but some have extra brain space and ability to think non-linearly..this can be learned if you've lived in hollywood as a transplant and cut video and see creative ability...the only "job" you can hope to have is one where you create something that didn't exist but can last long after you are gone..told this to locals that were editing and its like I created fire for them....hard to explain but here goes...people born and raised in vegas do not gamble..they have been trained on gaming so know what drives their economy..but to visitors its a vice playing out..so if LA makes movies and people born there are that close to that..the ability to feel feelings now becomes the game..add "The Neon Demon" to that movie list..may never figure things out..i use the car at night perspective..play some tunes and worry about what the headlights can see..this derived from old 80s flick better off dead...when you have ANY problem the answer is

       Except the scientific method is supposed to weed out the bullshit, that is the whole purpose of it. We used to believe the earth was flat, but advancement in how we measure and analyzed the earth proved that it is not the case.

       Your analogy of people who are sure they answer a question right but are actually doing it wrong is representing the flat earthers. I've watched people try and prove the flat earth a whole bunch of different moronic ways that aren't founded in logical thinking.

       It pretty much always starts from ignorance, and going to a basic physics course would probably aleviate most questions. Except of course the people who just throw out all developed understanding of physics simply because they like to act smarter than hundreds of years of work lol

       But, that debunks the Bible and many other religions. How is that possible that majority of the world follows a teaching that can not coexist with the idea of evolution?

       No. You believe everything in a textbook is true. So, basically I am having a conversation with the messenger. You’re only repeating what you’ve been told to believe.

        Why is it such a task to get there?

      <p>
       I'm sorry the Earth is not laid at for your convenience, but that's the way it is. It is a "task" to get there because it is one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth and there is very little chance of rescue if anything goes wrong, so trips there must be carefully planned.
      </p>

        You have to take a plane and a boat

      <p>
       Actually, you can take a plane
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       a boat. There are airstrips on Antarctica. You can even fly to the South Pole, but that means first landing on Antarctica and transferring to a smaller plane capable of landing at the Pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also take one of many cruise ships that will take you to Antarctica in comfort and style, but you won't get near the Pole that way.

       You
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       mistaken. What you are doing is repeating the same lies Flat Earthers keep telling each other while refusing to actually research their "facts".

       Show me your proof. Preferably pictures that you took with your own camera. I’ll wait as you proceed to flood the thread with other people’s “research” and pictures from NASA.
