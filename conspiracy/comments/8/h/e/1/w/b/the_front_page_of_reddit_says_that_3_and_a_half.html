       On the front page of reddit:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        TIL that when Auschwitz camp commander Rudolf Höss was accused of murdering three and a half million people during a trial, Höss replied, "No. Only two and one half million—the rest died from disease and starvation."
       </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       And yet according to the fakers today:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is estimated that the SS and police deported at least 1.3 million people to the Auschwitz complex between 1940 and 1945. Of these, the camp authorities murdered approximately 1.1 million.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the death books released by the Russians show:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Total Jews in Auschwitz, 1941–1944: 173,000
       </p>
       <p>
        Total number of inmates in Auschwitz, 1940–1944: 334,785
       </p>
       <p>
        Total deaths by typhus in Auschwitz, 1941–1944: 103,429
       </p>
       <p>
        Total Jewish deaths by typhus in Auschwitz, 1942–1944: 58,240
       </p>

       So basically reddit is circle jerking over a BS confession made by a tortured nazi without bothering to check the facts.

       It is easy for people at the time to wildly get the numbers wrong. Just look at the numbers of soldiers in battles in the classical era.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further they're merely relating what Höss said. Not that he is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to Auschwitz they don't give the number as 2 or 3 million, more like 1.2 ish million in total

       So Hoss didn't know how many people were killed in his camp?

       We have the fucking death books. Did you even read the link? It show exactly how many died, thousands, not millions.

       Again. You clearly haven't been and don't actually know anything besides holocaust denial ideas which prey on ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gas chamber in Auschwitz 1 wasn't destroyed because it was used as a bomb shelter, correct. However in Auschwitz Birkenau you can see the remains of the chambers the SS tried to destroy as they left the camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a model in one of the barracks of auschwitz 1 of what the chambers would have looked like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again all of this is very obvious if you had been or even knew the topic

       No you're not listening to what I'm saying. There were never any gas chambers. What is shown at Auschwitz is a bomb shelter that the allies got creative and modified to look like a gas chamber (without being technically correct, for example, not airtight).

       This is what the staff admit.

        “eyewitness” Yankel Wiernik claimed: 1200 people fit into a 7 X 7 m gas chamber

        Wiernik also claimed he saw a naked Jewish girl leap over a three-meter (9 ft.) high barbed wire fence, wrench the rifle out of the hands of a pursuing guard, shoot two other guards before she was overpowered.

        in court, 3/46, Charles Bendel said groups of 1000 Jews where killed with Zyklon-B in a room measuring 10 meters long by 4 meters wide by 1.6 meters high. When asked, how 1000 people can possibly fit in to a room of 64 square meters, he answered, with ‘the German method’

        Former inmate, Moshe Peer, recalled a miraculous escape from death as an eleven-year-old in the camp. In a 1993 interview with a Canadian newspaper, the French-born Peer claimed that he

       They were gas chambers from testimony. I know you find it hard to believe but you won't get thousands of people lying for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice yeah people lie. Does that mean that every event that some lie about didnt happen? Of course not. And if you go to auschwitz they say that noone ever survived the gas chamber, though some did survive the exposure they were killed when found under other corpses.
      </p>

       The holocaust is not defined by being gassed. People survived the camps because not all were gassed. If yoi really were serious with that point I think you are either an idiot or just trying to trick me

       There was a deal with Zionists to flood Israel with Jews. He had to create a certain amount of antisemitism to facilitate that. However, it does not prove gas chambers.

        Hitler's Jewish Soldiers: The Untold Story of Nazi Racial Laws and Men of Jewish Descent in the German Military
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to conventional views, Rigg reveals that a startlingly large number of German military men were classified by the Nazis as Jews or "partial-Jews" (Mischlinge), in the wake of racial laws first enacted in the mid-1930s. Rigg demonstrates that the actual number was much higher than previously thought-perhaps as many as 150,000 men, including decorated veterans and high-ranking officers, even generals and admirals.

       You've got to remember that when the operation was in full flow and the tide of war turned against the Nazis, they just starter executing them straight off the train.
      </p>
      <p>
       No records kept of those people who were killed within the hour of coming off the train. Many records were destroyed too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of the eye witness records come from the Poles who lived around the camp and would see what happened inside. Other witnesses are the Nazis themselves who were caught

       We have the camps, we have mass graves from nazi massacres, we have testimony backing this up. I really doubt you understand archaeology or even the nature of evidence

       There were 3 Jews who saw Jesus rise from the grave. Thousands of Jews saw him walk on water. Should it be illegal to question whether these events happened?

       It's not the quality but whether they have been doctored. These "photos" clearly were doctored:
