The most plausible explanations are that they finished doing whatever it was they wanted to do, mission accomplished.  Or someone stopped them.

Being of a laconic predilection, he waited, satisfied with quick meals from deceased pepper&#39;s larders and discovers AI robots without direction plead to be lead by him. Slowly he integrates these lonely bots into a support structure, his life approaches a version of luxury, needs met, power.

    <div class="md"><p>Cloud seeding with metal allows for weather manipulation by heating up the clouds with beams of energy and forcing rain or strong winds. My take on this is that when you see trails forming it is likely because tptb are &quot;herding&quot; clouds to become part of a storm system somewhere. Depending on their purposes and intent at the time, you will see the intensity and frequency of trails vary quite a bit. When you don&#39;t see chemtrails, it&#39;s likely because the elite don&#39;t need stormwinds etc. from your part of the world at the moment to strengthen the hurricane they are building or whatever.  </p>

<p>The health effects of chemtrails could be tertiary and simply a &#39;bonus&#39; for them. I believe the primary reason for the trails is for weather, even though they can make people ill over time. Manufacturing viruses is probably way more effective than slowly poisoning people with heavy metals. So anyway, you&#39;ll probably see the trails pick up again when they need winds from your area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Europe here, it&#39;s been probably over a decade since we had two months of no chemtrails and it&#39;s very possible that you have clouds that you don&#39;t identify as chemtrail residue. However, we do have sometimes a day or two with barely any spraying (they always still spray during sunset) and usually those are dry days with low air moisture. I&#39;m currently researching a potential link between air moisture and quantity/visibility of chemtrails.</p>

<p>I always wondered why they don&#39;t have &#39;invisible&#39; chemtrails, so maybe they theoretically do it might just be moist air that makes them visible. Would be an explanation why they&#39;re trying to heat up the world and make it all a dry wasteland. No one can deny that air moisture already got lower during summer the last maybe three to five years, while at the same time the sun feels so much hotter and like there are some protective layers missing along the way. And it&#39;s not just my human perception, I have to protect my plants way more from direct sunlight aswell and soil dries out more quickly too.<br/>
If we look at what&#39;s going on with the natural climate, it&#39;s obviously cooling down a little bit. If they counteract it with their manmade heat generation it creates clashes between climates, which could be one of many reasons why weather has gotten way more extreme. They just do the opposite of God and nature at all times, the construction of the tower of babel never stopped. And you see it in all areas of life, just everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, i would agree, but funny thing is, where I am there are no clouds period almost half the week at this point. It&#39;s just like a blue sky. </p>

<p>And I agree with all that. It definitely feels like it&#39;s moving towards a barren waste. We go so long without rain and its very hot day after day. April maybe had less than a week of rain lol. No may flowers! </p>

<p>Babylon is still in full swing! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chemtrails have not declined. I still see them daily, but the aerosols are being dispersed more discretely, usually leaving thinner trails until clouds begin forming and then spraying directly into the clouds. If you think it has stopped, I suggest a good pair of polarized sunglasses and spending a day outside watching the sky for a few hours. Tell tale sign is white glow in the sky that looks like wax paper at sunset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correlation doesnt equal causation</p>

<p>Because the government sprays somewhere doesn&#39;t mean contrails are chemicals. </p>

<p>Basic understamding of science is all thats required. Dont believe me. Believe basic science. You cant mess with jet fuel chemical composition. It makes it not work. Theres no place in a passenger jet for random tanka of random chemicals to spray. Thats easy to see by looking at blueprints or talking to literally any mechanic. </p>

<p>You are exactly why people dont believe in chemtrails. You juat ignore basic science to arrive at your conclusion. And people that believe in flat earth and chemtrails are the people that make people not question anything because they lump the crazies in with people that for instance say 911 was a lie or las vegas is a lie. </p>
