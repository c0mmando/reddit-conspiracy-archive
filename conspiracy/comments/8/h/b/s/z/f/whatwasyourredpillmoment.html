    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was mine. </p>

<p>I actually stood in front of my TV in early 2002 and wewring my camo and armed with my M1 Garand, stood there and said that I wouldnlike to exact revenge on people in A-stan, as if they were the culprits.  Since then the blame has been passed onto many different groups for propaganda purposes so you get the idea.  I was manipulated.  I was the sucker.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember what spurred on my want to confirm details but the pentagon and its related topics kept me hooked.  Eventually leading me to wtc7 and then things grew from there.</p>

<p>Never looked back and never felt more confident in my humanity that I was standing for the right thing.  I knew that even if I was in power this was not I would choose to advance my agenda.  Even if I could be in such a place, the more time went by the more I knew I wouldn&#39;t have an agenda in the first place.  </p>

<p>I knew this process was thr most anti human idea I had ever conceived and that set me on the right course.  Never again would I be swayed in such a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh.  Thanks for letting me know.</p>

<p>As mentioned, mine was watching the Iran Deal unfold.  At first, I couldn&#39;t figure out why we would be funnelling money to a country who motto seemed to be &#39;death to America&#39;?  It was baffling.   That set me searching over what was really going on in the muslim world, what was really going on with these Middle East &#39;deals&#39;.  And that the Iranians weren&#39;t the bad guys in this, as they had been made out to be, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My story may seem silly to some, but being born in the early 90&#39;s, I was simply too young to question 911 when it happened. Instead i grew up a good kid, I did everything I was told, and let right/wrong be programmed into me. Growing up the biggest negative influence is drugs, and they teach you from a young age that theyre bad. Considering my parents drank and smoked cigarettes it was hard for me to understand how terrible those substances were, if the government allowed them to be sold. Then I went to my first outdoors concert at 15. Marijuana. It was everywhere, and I&#39;d never imagined people would use an illegal substance so openly, so freely together. One more year and I gave it a try. I was heartbroken that something so beautiful, so harmless and incredibly helpful was surrounded by a massive lie yet tobacco and alchohol are abused freely, my soul ached. That was when I knew I could no longer trust the words of others, and that in order to find the truth I&#39;d have to make my own observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believed 9/11 was a real attacked and I carried on believing for years and years up until about 2015. I never fully believed the story I was told though because these things didn&#39;t make sense to me :</p>

<p>1) Why do I have to give money to the worlds largest economy after a disaster? This landed me in detention.</p>

<p>2) Why was Osama bin laden making films in a cave? How did they not know where he was? How did he make tapes and deliver them to America or wherever (Think about the tech needed)</p>

<p>3) If he was so poor to live in a cave, how did he fund this attack? (The answer was always: enemies of America funded him. Who were these rich enemies and why weren&#39;t we attacking them?)</p>

<p>4) Why did the towers fall down like Fred Dibnah had done it from beyond the grave?</p>

<p>5) (This thought was the final straw and I closed my mind off to 9/11 after this) When I was in Afghanistan I saw nothing but sand and camels. Yet some of the most advanced technology (Some of which used to mis-identified as UFO&#39;s in the late 90&#39;s) was deployed to blast the shit out of mountains and some pissed off nationalists. Why? Why was NASA there?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, learning about 9/11 ruined my love of UFO&#39;s as I found out that nearly all UFO sightings are advanced military tech. I know this from peaking behind the green curtain...naughty me. </p>

<p>You could say 9/11 was the itch that I could never scratch, not until I saw Zeitgeist, then holy shit did my world blow open.</p>

<p>My original red pill was the pyramids of mars discovery back in the 90&#39;s. Followed by mass coverage of the obviously bullshit &#39;face of mars&#39;. I knew the face was a shadow on a rock, but the media would not stop going on about something so obviously bullshit but only mention the pyramids of mars once or twice. I tried looking for information on this a few years later but found nothing. It was like the internet was scrubbed of data from the pyramids of mars, back in the early 00&#39;s!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this long, rambly message, OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was praying.  It went something like this, &quot;God, I&#39;m not happy about my choices for president...again.  And I want to vote according to Your Will and I <em>think</em> I know how You feel about these candidates based on what I know about Your teachings but I&#39;ve never actually asked You personally.  So, what do YOU think of these candidates?&quot;</p>

<p>I think I expected confirmation of what I already knew but He showed me almost immediately (I think it was later that same day) something which made me think He was showing me that HRC actually worships Satan. I was in disbelief. I never imagined it was that bad. I actually would have thought it was a temptation to think so.  Then Wikileaks broke and those suspicions appear to be substantiated.</p>

<p>Now I just keep on asking Him things and if it&#39;s good for me know, He answers me. I hope my prayers are helping. They must be helping in some way, shape or form because I&#39;m sure God doesn&#39;t waste any prayers:)</p>

<p>God bless!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow!</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this!  I too reached the same conclusion, but it was not confirmed in prayer, as your information was.   That is cool that God showed you in prayer first and then confirmed in evidence later.</p>

<p>A word to keep trusting and praying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!  Just to clarify what you are saying, are you saying that you do NOT feel God has confirmed your beliefs in prayer?  Or perhaps you are saying you hadn&#39;t brought them to prayer?  I&#39;m not sure. Sorry.  </p>

<p>It was neat to read your story as well as others. Thanks for the awesome question!</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice to see someone on more than one subreddit, too.  I&#39;d not experienced that.  Neat:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.   I&#39;m saying God *has* confirmed my beliefs in prayer at various times.   Specifically with the president, I found evidence which alarmed me about HRC and evidence which moved me to vote for Trump.   </p>

<p>It sounds like you were moved by the Holy Spirit in prayer about these things first, and only later came to the evidence.   Hope this makes sense.   Yes, it is nice to see folks on more than one subreddit!  God bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  I&#39;m mining for friendly conversation and interest in what causes people to have paradigm shifts.</p>

<p>Also...because this hashtag could be a great way (on twitter, for example) to start a larger conversation which causes people to question their assumptions.</p>
