<p>The Justice System (if you even want to call it that - a joke more like it), is corrupt as shit. You cannot work within that System. It&#39;s set up to always work against you, <em>never for you</em>. </p>

<p>If shit is really as bad and systemic as many of us think/say, then, how else would you go about &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. I propose, you do it by letting it self implode. Traitor, by Traitor. </p>

<p>In what way does that make the slightest bit of sense? In addition to it just being terrible optics for the administration, there is also the damage done by the swamp creatures&#39; self-serving agendas when they are in the administration. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but your theory of Trump hiring people to publicize their criminality because the &quot;justice system is rigged&quot; doesn&#39;t hold water.</p>
