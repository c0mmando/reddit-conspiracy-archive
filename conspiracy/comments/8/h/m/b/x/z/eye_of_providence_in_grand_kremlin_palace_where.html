<p>He gave his thirty three word Presidential Oath below the Illuminated Eye of Providence. I assume the official line is it represents God and the Holy Trinity? Any of you guys have an alternate take on it?</p>

<p>When was originally? Parts of the Moscow Kremlin have been there for 500 or 600 years and other parts have been added through the centuries.</p>

<p>Well, Russia is a predominately Christian eastern Orthodox country so that wouldn&#39;t be entirely out of line.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point?</p>

<p>thats a very very overly simplified way to describe it. Let me help you. 
You need miners to time stamp transactions, otherwise you can do a double-spend. Send me a bitcoin, then send bob a bitcoin. in the regular world, Banks keep track of the record. This way you can&#39;t double spend. How do you get rid of the middle man? They way to do it, is we&#39;ll have a lottery.  What miners do, is they batch up roughly 10 minutes worth of transactions in a &quot;block&quot; or like a page in a ledger system, and they are looking for a particular number that fits this puzzle.  Technically they are looking for a SHA256 hash of that block that starts with like 32 zeros. The only way to do that is to alter the block with a thing called a nounce, so you get new hash values. You do that billions of time a second. The winner gets to write that block and for his work he is rewarded new coins. Coins drop in half every 4 years. and when they are all mined, they will rely on transaction fees. But the control is no longer at the IMF.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>not true. Impossible to tell. With advent of BIP39, aka HD wallet, each person has hundres or even thousands of addresses each with small amount of bitcoin. Depending on how much transactions you do. Also, exchanges have hot and cold wallets that are worth a lot of bitcoin, but it&#39;s not theirs. it&#39;s the clients. so, there is NO WAY to tell how bitcoins are distributed. there is no difference between a coin who is owned by a guy who is holding on to it, and the one which the keys are lost. thats just a stupid tactic to get noobs not to invest because they think they are getting the short end of the stick. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but that is incorrect. Satoshi has already thought of that, thats why your bitcoin public <strong>address</strong> is a double hash  (SHA256 and RIPEMD160) of your public <strong>KEY</strong></p>

<p>check out this song some crypto guy made with Andreas explaining exactly just that.

    <div class="md"><p>Only if they could! lol </p>

<p>If they tried to buy every unit out there, the price of each bitcoin would hit hundreds of thousand or even millions.  I hope they do it. I beg them lol</p>

<p>The only way for them to buy my bitcoin, is if i sell it to them. Why do you think bitcoiners HODL? Or HOLD on to their coins. Because we know that very well. WallStreet can come take these coins from my cold dead hands. This is like the motto of bitcoiners.</p>

<p>Even if they tried, its not even possible. There are more millionaires in the US, that there are units of bitcoin. So, if every millionaire in the US alone, wanted one bitcoin, it would not be possible. </p>

<p>Now, lets say I&#39;m completely wrong! even if I&#39;m wrong, even if they are going to somehow take over bitcoin and make it the NWO currency, well, Id rather have some than to not have some! don&#39;t you? So, it&#39;s a win win for me no matter what. </p>
