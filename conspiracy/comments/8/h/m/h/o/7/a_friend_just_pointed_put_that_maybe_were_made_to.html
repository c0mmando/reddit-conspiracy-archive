       All those PSAs about how if you left your light on when you went to work youre the primary contributor to climate change.  When theres a supermarket megastore 3 doors down from you leaving an entire warehouse buildings worth of lights on 24/7.

       Being told at school that wasting 3 sheets of paper is murdering trees and you personally are causing the amazon to be demolished for more paper, when big companies print thousands of millions of sheets of invoices that only get shreaded at the end of the month, turned to pulp, then sold back to the consumer at a mark up for being 'recycled and eviro friendly!'
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they're just pinning the blame on us? Don't get me wrong, there's added benefits to the above, most of which involve saving money and generally not being a dick.

       Couldn't agree more. The users at the end of the supply chain are being blamed for the trash and waste that was implemented by the corporations at the top of the supply chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like excessive packaging and most worstly, plastic water bottles. As an end user I
       <em>
        don't want
       </em>
       that stuff but I get stuck with it anyway. Some of it is useful for long distance shipping, some of it is cheap containerization for the manufacturer, some of it is for retail display, some of it is retail theft prevention packaging, some of it is just bulked-up packaging to make the product more attractive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the end consumer gets charged for disposal and blamed for excessive consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some of my bills, and including IRS tax printouts, there is an extra paper page which states just one sentence 'This statement meets the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements'.

       Sad the video game manufacturers (eg. EA and activision?[COD makers], most every major manu. if not ALL) see the impact they were making and switched game manuals to digital online only. They only put the usual health warnings, etc in the booklets now.

       The worst part is the waste also becomes the problem of municipalities, so We The People will pay for this shit more than once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if every public landfill said, "No, we're not taking Doritos bags (etc., etc.) anymore" and forced manufacturers to collect and dispose of the trash from their product.  It would certainly incentivize low-waste packaging (and ideally totally recyclable packaging if they want to save money) if they had to deal with their own mess.

       As if manufacturers would actually take responsibility in that situation. You know that they would fight tooth and nail to avoid that burden. And most likely, we the people would have to pay a private waste disposal service to throw away our Dorito bags or whatever.

       It wouldn't be hard to get some manufacturers on board with this - bulk sales save the producer the cost of making a package, for a product they can sell for the same price as before. There are tons of workarounds with the end goal of keeping matter out of the landfill. For instance, consumers can provide their own packaging, like jars or bottles, or manufacturers can use the deposit system to make sure their customers return their items' packaging.

       Yeah, those are good points. The trend is shifting towards sustainability bit by bit right now, and I'm sure that more big companies will eventually get on board too. I just think they would resist a strong-arm approach right now, because having to quickly implement significant changes to their infrastructure could hurt short-term profits.

       Guess what -- when disposable containers and packaging first burst on the scene, and we started seeing soda cans littering the ground, the litter and waste was 100% seen as the manufacturer's responsibility. It took an extremely concentrated lobbying effort by these manufacturers to make littering and waste be seen and treated as people's personal responsibilities, and municipal responsibilities.

       "Vote" with your pocketbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is a priority in your life to make corporations act better, then don't buy their shit.  It takes effort, but in many cases is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       People forget the first 2 parts of the plan: Reduce and Re-use.  What crap are you buying that you never use?  What are you buying new new that could be gotten at a 2nd hand store?  How long do you keep using what you have?  Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avoiding buying crap we don't need, or buying 2nd hand when we can, is a great way to avoid supporting the corporations.

       So true. It's easy to blame corporations, and they should have blame. But We, the consumer need to take a hard look in the mirror as well. Did I need to buy that mango that was flown/shipped all over the world or would the more local apple do just ok as well?

       You're putting the blame back on the consumer, when the focus of the post is corporate responsibility, and putting the onus of environmental safety on them. You've, you and the post you're agreeing with, brought it back around to saying it's the consumer's responsibility.

       Well in that case yes, some of the things is the consumers responsibility. Not buying more then you need is on you, reusing things is on you. That way you will force the company to comply. It is the companies responsibility to abide by laws, use fair practises and to follow the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the law isn't forcing corporations to do something it should it's still up to us to make sure those laws are made.

       All that extra packaging on a $5 item for the sake of "security" to prevent it from being stolen. All you have to do is pull the "loss prevention" card to justify waste.  We have to charge more, spend more time, etc "just in case."  Let's spend dollars to save pennies.

       Consumers generate a ton of pollution and greenhouse gases. Less than industry, but it's still an extremely significant amount. Things like higher mileage standards for consumer autos has a huge impact. So do energy efficient appliances. We have data for all this, it's not a conspiracy and the answer is not to be cynical. We will definitely get more value out of pressing industry to adopt cleaner standards, but that doesn't mean consumers efforts are pointless.

       What baffles me is that the emissions of a commercial airliner are considered the onus of the passengers instead of the maker, as if there's some sort of reasonable eco friendly alternative to long distance travel available that we're all actively choosing to avoid.

       It's far easier (and beneficial) to lay the blame on weaker, private consumers (who don't have the "money in politics" perk playing for them) than it is to force large companies to make structural changes. During our worst water shortages here, we were constantly getting ads on TV about personal responsibility, spending no more than X minutes in the shower etc. Keep in mind that residential consumption was (officially) 18% of the total water consumption at the time. All the while, municipal lawns would turn on their sprinklers wastefully, at noon, during the 40
       <sup>
        0c
       </sup>
       summer....people would have been heftily fined for doing the same at home.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, overconsumption and waste of products/food is a driving force in our current global predicament. And that can certainly be pinned down on personal choices. The industry generally acts the way it does to keep up with the constant demand for more, cheaper, and immediately-available products. Of course, this consumer culture was nurtured by the same companies over decades (centuries?) to maximise their market size, but it's kind of our job to ween ourselves from materialism (they certainly won't do it for us...).
      </p>
      <p>
       So in my opinion everyone's at fault here (yay!), and ultimately we all stand to lose just as much (though obviously poor people and poor countries will take the brunt of the growing impact, as is often the case)

       Finish your plate, there are starving African children! Meanwhile anyone who has ever worked in food already  knows they give employees free food and the rest is thrown away. Literal tons per year per restaurant. Add in a cow was slaughtered for food but eventually didn’t get eaten and that’s a disastrous chain of events that quickly adds up.

       We need artificial meat like right now though the side effect will absolutely destroy farming. It’ll be much worse than GM ruining streetcars though the environmental impact will be opposite.

       I remember sitting and thinking about how I didn't pack this, I didn't ask for this, and my dad will probably finish what I left on my way home anyway. Yet I had to miss a full hours break and be punished for being full already.

       Agreed, what is 3 sheets of paper, one split pill, one gas guzzling truck. If only one person existed on Planet Earth then the conversation wouldn't be happening. The fact is there are over 7 billion people on Planet Earth, most of which who can't see beyond their own existence and lack the expansive comprehension to understand that it's the collective cause and effect and thus the individual, that is so detrimental to climate change. On top of that, Corporations are equally as responsible.

       Hate to be that guy, but isn’t this just bad math? (And even then, if we net more, it could theoretically be worth it.) Not that there isn’t definitely heaps of broken window fallacy all over a lot of wars including these, but I just wanted to point out to avoid any confusion that the situation your example describes is not really broken window. Broken window is thinking a tornado is a good thing because it creates business, but ignores the fact that these are all extra costs that wouldn’t have to be incurred otherwise and the resources could have been used to improve things beyond the original state (like building a new school instead of rebuilding an old one).

       Broken window is thinking war is a good thing because it creates business for the military contractors, but ignores the fact that these are all extra costs that wouldn't have to be incurred otherwise and the resources could have been used to improve things beyond the original state (like developing wind/solar/effective power storage instead of trying to sustain the fossil fuel market).

       What was the premise of the doctoral thesis of the current, democratically elected Prime Minister of the 'Palestinians'?  Are you aware of his recent comments as to how the Jews are to blame for the holocaust (which until recently he denied even happened at all, ascribing it to a conspiracy hatched by zionists and colonialists?)
Give me a break, you're an apologist for modern day Nazis.

       Yes. But your original example alluded to a different kind of fallacy/illogical activity.

       Someone unfamiliar might infer from it that broken window is something like burning too many of the resources you’re trying to get in the process, something like upside down diminishing returns, maybe?

       The US is also the biggest producer of garbage - and they readily export it to poorer Asian countries. I forgot the exact numbers but the amount of power a single household in the US consumes can provide electricity to several households in poorer countries.

       Well, looking on the internet it says the average house in u.s. spends like 900kwh per month. Here in South America -I've lived in Brazil, Argentina and currently Uruguay- I can say the average consumption is between 100 and 200 (120 in my house normally, and I don't take many measures to save energy).

       Probably why they are also so intent on keep control of fossil fuels and are willing to spend military resources getting it. Cause the US military needs it in order to run. Granted they also use lots of other fuels too like nuclear.

       Change? The green economy will bring real change when we design, test, and implement new products which are green and mor cost effective into the economy. What we have now is “green washing” selling us products at a up-sale like priuses and solar powered homes which create more of carbon footprint than buying something second hand. Leonardo Decaprio and yourself can frankly suck my dick, if you think you can guilt low level consumers into buying products which have no tangible affect on the environment. I will continue to support real scientists and engineers working on these problems however.

       Just a fact that I still remember from a highschool report I did about 10 years ago is that a normal plane during take off burns as much oxygen as a small forest produces in a year. Imagine how many planes take off every day and how much they spend in the air etc. Anyhow, I highly doubt that this rate of producing CO2 is sustainable, no amount of personal spending will ratify that

       Why wouldn’t it be sustainable? The atmosphere used to have much more CO2 in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       O2 is corrosive and unstable, we don’t need that much in the air for respiration. 
CO2 is stable and fertilizes plant growth. The earth has gotten 30% greener since 1970 due to CO2 fertilization.

       I don't think humans would work that well in high CO2 atmosphere. Plus unsustainable means that we shift the balance of O2 and CO2. I'm not qualified enough to say that it's gonna be a good or a bad change, but the change is happening. We'll see how it goes.

       I'm with you there.  My only point is that I find it amusing when my idiot Prius driving neighbor is walking by with his Labradoodle dumbass dog and he stops to tell me how if I traded in my V-8 powered car for a hybrid I'd be helping the environment. He used to make a point of strolling by me when I was washing my car to tell me how commercial car washes use so much less water, then his wife insisted they install in ground sprinklers for their lawn so he doesn't bring that up any more.

       Hypocrisy, it's so infuriating, and the worst part is that if you make their hypocrisy aware to them, they get offended. You're stuck in a hard place with people like that. Don't get me wrong, I think the Prius is a very neat car, I like it, but I'm not stupid enough to think it's environmentally friendly.

       My idiot neighbor runs his in ground sprinklers every single day - and I don't even bother pointing out his hypocrisy in passively aggressively critiquing my car washing, because I don't want to dissuade him from continuing to over water his lawn, since he doesn't seem to be making the connection between running his sprinklers daily and having to mow his lawn twice a week.
I absolutely love driving a V8 - I drive every day, and every time I have to pull away at a light or out of toll lanes on the highway and get away from some annoying driver, it is so nice to just blaze away. Underpowered cars are dangerous.

       Gonna go out in a limb and say, that while definitely not carbon neutral, I think most in-service aircraft carriers are powered by a nuclear reactor. One of the cleaner options for non-renewable power. ON THAT NOTE, let’s all hope LM’s “portable” fusion reactor is the real deal. I’d love to see a 95-100% green American Military.

       Why can't us civilians have nuclear rectors? Imagine the power at your disposal! You could get huge batteries, and the only limit is your imagination. All that power, you could build anything you want, do anything you want, go anywhere you want.

       Maybe we're not advanced enough as a species to have that amount of power, we'd probably just kill each other. Especially the people with false sense of entitlement.

       You don't even need to go that high up to see this kind of shit. I spent a lot of my life trying to conserve water - turn off the water brushing my teeth, take fast showers, follow drought watering rules etc. until I found out that eating a single cheeseburger uses more water than a month of my showers. We are told about the small ways we can contribute, but the majority of the public is left in the dark about the real issues. Government use, manufacturing, fossil fuels, and animal agriculture are the biggest polluters around.

       Here in Florida we have commercials running nonstop about water consumption. They tout that each person uses 179 gallons per day.  Every time I see it I wonder how much of that # is the 3000 golf courses, the various mining operations, or even municipal consumption to keep all their trees and shrubs alive. Super disingenuous.

       I work in sustainability and the newest way to track sustainability of a product is a lifecycle analysis (LCA)--so rather than just saying a recyclable product is better, you track all the energy associated with making, using, and disposing of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a presentation recently where Lockheed Martin was going on about their LCA and I just kept thinking "who cares about your sustainability efforts when you're building MISSILES??" Does carnage and death factor into your LCA???

       This is how it all works. This is the essence of politics. False idols blaming us. They are parades around as our saviors to the problems that they’ve created. If they want war, they aren’t going to bomb their own homes, they’ll bomb our homes. And after the bombing a new false idol will present themselves and promise to rebuild us. It’s a complete joke that a 1st grader can see through. Unfortunately many adults have been indoctrinated into thinking they need these puppets, these false idols. I mean really sit and think about the joke that politics and our government is. Criminal organizations that present to us crime fighters who reach into our pockets and unlock our doors for themselves. But yeah, it’s our fault and we need them. Unreal. Can we stop paying taxes yet?

       any plastic 6 pack rings manufactured in or imported into the US have been Photo-degradable since 1989.

       but if they're not exposed to sunlight, they don't degrade well, and are still a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       E6PR has an edible 6 pack ring made from recycled materials that is safe to digest. but not many manufacturers use it yet. i have not seen one company using it yet and i service machinery in a fair amount of canning/bottling companies all over the south east US.

       No, they're not. They are photodegradable. Photodegradable and Biodegradable are different categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photodegradable plastic is usually made of oil-based polymers, just like ordinary plastic. These plastics tend to break down into small particles of plastic rather than decomposing completely.The idea is that these small pieces will then biodegrade.  Unfortunately, they are often not biodegradable and so remain in the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biodegradable plastics can be made from oil or from plant-based products. They are attacked by bacteria, fungi or other micro-organisms which use them as food.

       Still, if they're breaking up into small pieces within a month it shouldn't be harming the animals. The plastic that's getting caught on wildlife is likely stuff that was dumped from the generation or two above us.

       Lots of free trade and travel hurt the environment, yet for some reason, the left leaning support it, and it's the right that doesn't, while at the same time having inverted ideologies on the environment.  So matter who wins, there is always an equal and opposite reason to move back towards center, while simultaneously fighting for exactly what you claim to be opposed too.

       What I believe you are intending to present is the law of large numbers. It’s a phenomenon which researchers have described in public opinion polling that states that, in the aggregate, public opinion is reasonable and stable. Diverging opinions are voided in a large enough sample. Irrational perspectives are stamped out and what remains is a fairly centric, yet stable perspective. It was a popular view 30 years ago that few political scientists take seriously now. I’d suggest you share fewer of your claims if you wish to obscure your stupidity

       Whether it's on purpose or not it's true. The amount of emissions one of those ships that transport goods between Asia and North America puts out is incredibly large. You could never drive a car again and you wouldn't even make a tiny dent in it.

       I mean, sure, public support and understanding plays a huge role, but any big change is usually kicked off by the ideas of an individual who became lucky enough to develop them. Tesla, Newton, Leibnitz, Christ (if you wanna go there), Ghandi, MLK, ...

       That's what gave Elon Musk his messianic status (deservedly or not). A modern savior of our collective guilt, at least in theory. There are no-doubt many individuals out there with ideas and solutions worthy of public support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who is convinced that they're not one of those inventive individuals should strive to identify them in their surroundings and support their ambitions as best they can. Teachers especially.

       I kind of agree - I sort of suspect that guilt is part of what we’re being sold. I sort of think people got it backwards. I really don’t think we buy all this bullshit cause we want it. We should just stop advertising entirely. It’s just manipulation, we’re all convinced we had some say in the industrial revolution or choosing whether or not half the useless things in the world the exist. I don’t think it’s collective groups that change anything for the better. All collective thinking does is damage.

       Collective thinking is a reality we cannot wish away. It occurs whether we like it or not, and you and I and all of us take part in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collective thinking is a powerful force, too, but whether it's a force for good or evil is dependant on the values which the individuals hold. Honesty and courage seem to make for a good start.

       that's being referenced. The statistic mentioned is only true for sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides. In terms of greenhouse gasses or fossil fuel consumption, naval transport is
       <strong>
        MUCH
       </strong>
       more efficient than any other form of transport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are bad, but on the other hand, unlike greenhouse gasses, once they're dispersed you don't have to worry about them nearly as much; which is why the 230 mile buffer zone on the coast where these ships will be forced to switch to low-sulfur fuels is probably going to be good enough to deal with this issue for now.

       Why does everyone have to be pushing an agenda? Why can't they just be uninformed? He stated a position, cited a source, and a potential expert provided a counter-argument in a reply instead of just crying "shills".

       Lol, no. Just no. You have zero understanding of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Bad is an understatement, I'd rather breathe soot than NOx. By the way I study combustion, it's my job.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOx are formed by high combustion temperatures over 2,800k, as such they're plasmodic and highly ionized. Not only does this pose a more serious health hazard, but it also creates more free radicals in the air, and is the primary cause of acid rain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large amounts of research is being conducted to reduce combustion temperature of the current lean burn systems in use precisely for these reasons.

       I like to think that helps, but where I live there's a frankly absurd trend of corporations charging hefty markups for things that are better for the planet even when they patently cost the corporation less to create (like overpackaged goods costing less than underpackaged ones, for example).  So, even the sensible idea that you have gets manipulated in a way that maximizes profits, that is nothing short of conspiratorial.

       It is like saying the US is the number one producer too.
Ya, well the US refines so much of the worlds petroleum, then the rest of the world uses those plastics, polymers, and solvents but often the pollution from them is attributed to the US.

       Shit, technology should mirror cars. Car manufacturers don't just make money on the car they sell, they also make money on servicing the car. Even if the person services the car himself, he still buys the parts from the car manufacturer(those that don't and skimp on critical parts end up paying more).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is these phones aren't designed to be modified like cars are. It's a sterile appliance that does it's job(entertainingly rob your soul). The only factors you can employ to distinguish your phone is to put some stick on jewels or a phone case, but it's function is largely the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some novel cases that come with extra battery life, but that's few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people want is to tinker, I can't believe it's 2018 and Apple still doesn't have room for extra storage on their $1,000 phone.

       I think a lot of it comes down to perception. People are willing to pay a lot for a car because they last a long time and are seen as very valuable.

       People want a new cell phone every year and are happy to toss the old one in the trash. If they made a cellphone that lasted 5 years but was $3,000 people probably wouldn't buy it.

       It can cost $3,000 in repairs and upgrades. Swapping processors, or a new battery, or be able to swap screens. Allowing the phone to keep up with the times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as we're pretty much at a processor speed and size bottle neck, the only advancement is in better SoC architecture, and parallel processing. PCBs can only get smaller and eventually they'll be small enough to be modular.

       I was talking to someone about this recently and we came to the realization that a product made to last a long time ends up putting the company of of work. If the demand decreases once the product is in everyones home, then the company life is over. No profit or growth means losses and downsizing which can mean last stop, doors closing. It's a flaw in capitalism I guess...

       My town on the Alaska highway was founded in 1912 because it was going to be a major hub on the Paris - New York train route. We had the technology to tunnel the Bering Strait a century ago. Then came WWI, then came the interwar civil wars and revolutions, then WWII, then the Cold War, then came "Russia is our eternal enemy" because we said so.

       80% of the oil, gas, raw materials, and consumer goods floating on the ocean today could probably be transported by pipeline or rail for cheaper and at less threat to the environment.

       No. This isn’t as much about “us as a society”, more of the fact that we’ve given power to governments to make it cheaper to manufacture something across the world and ship it here than manufacture it in country. This is the biggest problem with emissions and pollution in the world. Companies don’t care if it’s more environmentally friendly to make something here or on the Moon, they will do what is more cost efficient, and often times it isn’t even feasible to make something here.

       It's because we're born into a consumerist loop and indoctrinated to want things in excess. Life in excess is good, buy more. Spend more. You. Need. More. is the mindset that we are taught from a very, very young age.

       The same thing happens with veterans too. The citizens are conned into these charities that take care of our veterans when in reality the government who put them through war should be paying for their issues when they return home.

       I think we should collectively not support bad business practices such as what you mention, as well as try to generally not be a dick as you put it. It's hard though, as your average consumer won't know what goes in the background, which is why we should have laws in place to force companies to do things proper, or risk facing legal consequences. Easier said than done obviously.

       I posted about about how relatively simple it would be to clean up the Mississippi river starting with water testing at Itaska and working down, finding when there is a pollution spike and go searching for the source and shutting them down. The Minnesota legislature would have to pass a law and the Governor would have to sign it.
      </p>

       So this one guy responds and suggests I volunteer with a group to pick up garbage along the banks of the Mississippi in Minneapolis.

       If you've ever driven across country, or flew in a plane, you'll realize how much unused land and resources there really is. Scarcity is a scam and so is this"green"agenda. A regular household is no match for the colossal harm that big corporations are doing that's true. I'm all about certain things like energy conservation and recycling but that's because I see a monetary value for me to do these things.

       I have been to all 50 states, 19 states of Mexico, and 8 provinces of Canada, and spend most of my time perusing maps and studying geography. There are very few areas left in the world which haven't been altered by agriculture. The only places left unaltered in the world are marginal, extreme environments that are difficult to use.

       Just look at waste that fashion industrial factories leave in the eastern countries. We’re often misguided about how “dirty” the people in India are, because of dipping in the highly contaminated Ganges, when in reality, if you check how the river was before this accelerated and consumerism- centered world, you’ll realise that there’s something wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, (and with proof) major companies (like Monsanto and Fast Fashion companies) cause an incredible waste and contaminantion, while from the media and school we learn that we’re the guilty ones. Of course, meanwhile this we’re also being subconsciously manipulated to buy their products and to consume more which would support their activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open up your eyes, and dive deep into the real causes. Only this way (and together) can we do anything to stop this.

       Totally agree. That's what pisses me off about the whole "90% of the ocean's plastic pollution is carried by rivers in Asia and Africa" blame-laying argument. When you outsource the global textile/chemical polluting industries, who enjoy little to no supervision or backlash there, this is what you get. You cannot divorce their atrocious impact from the consumer culture that made their practices so successful.

       Your friend nailed it. It's all about personal guilt. CO2 is the main focus of the mainstream because it's something we all create. Why don't they mention Methane? It's far far worse of a greenhouse gas but it's primarily produced by industrial processes like fracking. But the lying news media has declared that fracking is good for global warming because it produces less CO2. The narrative has been compromised.

       Dude you mention methane and fracking but fail to mention animal agriculture? That's the real conspiracy, no one is seeing the biggest environment destroyer because they are so addicted to the taste of meat and have been brainwashed to think they need it. But it will be way too late before enough people realize so you might as well just say fuck it and eat the meat at this point. Animal agriculture will only be expanded because of consumers.

       you all talk in this Thread like evil business exist for the sake of being evil. that coal plants powers your house and the fabric that makes your smartphone, the diesel tanker ships it to you and the rocket transports a new satellite to make sure it works. Sure your contribution as one of 7 Billion is basically negligible, but that should not be a Reason to simply give up.

       They definitely make you feel guilty when you are young, but didn't that subconsciously shape us into being a little more environmentally-friendly growing up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go out of my way at the end of a class to make sure I put the leftover papers from peers into the appropriate bin, or heck, I would never gun on the gas pedal when a traffic light turned green and slowly accelerate up  to the correct speed so I didn't waste any gas (I don't do this now, as I got places to go).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though minor things, I still try to put the Earth first. Maybe if I ever run Boeing or some military contractor I can change their policies to reflect on a more green perspective.

       I kind of agree with you that it very well could be a cycle and if it is thats great, no need to do anything. But wait, what if we are wrong? Then what? I feel that this thought is a bit unreasonable because if we are wrong then doing nothing is only harming us and our future. If we are right and it is a cycle then less waste and pollution is still good. Do you understand what Im saying?

       I do understand but I think it’s a false premise.  Because we know for a fact the global warming hypothesis doesn’t explain it very well.  CO2 does not cause warming, the earth has had much higher % CO2 in the atmosphere and been much colder than it is today, and vice verse with lower CO2 and higher temps.

       You know you might be right. After a bit of reflecting Ive always trusted what other people said about this but I never really went out on my own to look for the studies and understand why it is bad. I will look into this a bit more thank you for bringing it to my attention. I have another question though. What do you think the goal of bringing global warming to the  attention of the people is? I like the effect of people caring about the environment more but I dont know what other effects negative or positive that it has

       Let me provide a contradictory view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work at a company, in a city, whose major client is an even larger company.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't use paper, at all. I have a small pad, I've used about 5 pages in the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The computers are all laptops that sip power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lights are all LEDs with motion activation. They're off by 5:15 most days, and don't turn back on until someone walks in the door at 6 or 7am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Burning rubber is bad, not because of the smoke but because fire has a nasty habit of getting out of control -- my local zoning doesn't differentiate between burning trash or logs in a firepit. If it's in the open, you need a permit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even a house or car isn't much more than 20 pages. Maybe the house is 30 if you include all of the crap your realtor gives you...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're right about things like chemical pollutants, but for most people in the suburbs, automobile tailpipe emissions getting into the water/ground and electric car usage are a bigger concern than using an extra sheet of paper.

        when big companies print thousands of millions of sheets of invoices that only get shredded at the end of the month

       So much this. In corporate america, you'll see the accounting department print entire reams of paper for invoices, copies of copies, etc stacked several boxes high. Months later, the paperwork is then scanned back onto the file servers.  There were always rumors or fear mongering from the legal department "never to delete anything" or even recycle the physical documents that have already been scanned.  And the legal department refused to ever buy into esignatures, so much so that supposedly the total cost to "Fedex overnight legal docs internally (one branch office to another) surpassed $1million."  I mean they have access to the same servers across the network. Let's pay premium shipping costs for a physical signature.

       They need to just rid plastic bags altogether. It sounds radical, but that's what they did in Hawaii, and guess what.. it worked. People bought reusable bags and actually use them. I lived in Hawaii for a few months and was put off at first, but you get used to it, and the beaches there are clean.

       The Indian Tear advertisement that originally pointed public eco-consciousness at private persons was funded by a packaging product consortium called Keep America Beautiful
      </p>
      <p>
       In the time leading up to the first Earth Day in 1970, environmental demonstrations across the United States focused on the issue of throwaway containers. All these protests held industry—not consumers—responsible for the proliferation of disposable items that depleted natural resources and created a solid waste crisis. Enter the Crying Indian, a new public relations effort that incorporated ecological values but deflected attention from beverage and packaging industry practices.

       I don't think this is a conspiracy, this is very widely accepted and discussed in environmental circles. But it's absolutely correct. It's also not to say that it's not still good to do all of the little things, but if every single person makes those changes without significant changes to larger scale sources it won't be enough.

       I was thinking about this yesterday when i was shaving with a disposable razor, they use so much plastic for the handle and everything and make it so i can maybe use it twice, when they could design them to last longer. Yet ill be blamed for destroying the environment

       If i may give my opinion, because we are uneducated about how bad we are, we are oblivious as to how bad the things we do are. For example if you only knew stealing was wrong but never really received the consequences of it your oblivious as to how bad it really is. That's essentially where we are at with almost everything
      </p>
      <p>
       Except we see the consequences of the environment but they never let us think about it they constantly bombard us with dum shit, like keep us occupied with things like snapchat and instagram. Essentially they keep us busy by making us keep ourselves busy. Because each of us has a different weakness so all they have to do is make a bunch of stuff that is bound to grab our attention

       I've been saying for years to people that the people who control the means of production and companies who make profits from consumer products are responsible for recycling them because they profit from their sale. The consumer isn't responsible for making the product that's marketed at them and they pay for it - yet the producer ceases to have any responsibility at the point of sale and the consumer is saddled with the environmental cost. People react like this attitude is ducking personal responsibility for saving the world.

       I did a massive project on the overall benefits of recycling. I found very little research, and a lot of uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, what I did find, is a lot of people saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Me're not sure if there is a net benefit to recycling when it comes to non-metal, non-glass products
      </p>
      <p>
       2) One of the main goals of recycling programs is to make people feel like they "did their part"
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Recycling can help corporations obtain cheaper, if not free materials (think cell phone recycling programs)
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked in a recycling plant for a summer. I was told that all the plastic bottles are driven in a truck from NC to NYC and then across the country to CA. From there they are put on a ship to China. They're processed and sent back to the US. There's a lot to dig in here, but I'm not convinced plastic should be recycled. Metal and glass definitely should, though.

       It's absolutely true and it is something that has always bothered me, even if I live to be green it is canceled out by corporate pollution. Or all the water I save is canceled out by golf courses, it goes on forever. Do people really think buying different 'green' paper towels is actually helping the environment, while still coming wrapped in plastic.

       Actually not consuming meat and dairy is the best thing an individual can do for the environment. A plant based diet uses 1/3 of the water of the standard American diet. The meat and dairy industry runs on supply and demand, so if we stop buying meat products, overall it will help reduce all the negative impacts that animal ag is putting on our planet.

       Truth. They are personal choices, but they certainly have an effect on everything else. So by continuing to buy meat/dairy/marine life to consume, people are effectively financing global warming. The runoff from

       Yeah, the transportation sector is a big one, but its hard because people don't buy new cars and houses every week, or even every year. These choices are longterm commitments. So even if people educate themselves and want to change, its not something that can be done immediately and inexpensively. Cutting meat and dairy out of your life is a choice we can all make every day, and it could actually save people money every time they go grocery shopping. My groceries cost about 1/3 less since going veg, and I'm healthier than I've ever been in my adult life.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most frustrating aspects of educating people about the harmful effects of animal ag is the complacency, the 'meatless mondays' which make people feel like they're doing their part, so they're off the hook. The 'I'll just start recycling' or 'My car has a little green leaf on it, I make good life choices'. People are afraid to truly face themselves, their habits, and really look at how their diet is affecting things. Its tragic, because its really the best way to combat climate change. Every dollar you spend on meat and dairy is a vote for more of that product, which is coincidentally a vote for the leading cause of deforestation, unnecessary clean water usage, and unnecessary antibiotic use. There are tons of scholarly articles about this, I highly encourage you to research this further, or head over to
       <a href="/r/vegan">
        /r/vegan
       </a>
       to see what the movement is about. Going vegan/vegetarian isn't as hard or weird as you'd think, and it can make such a big difference. In the last 3 years, the amount of vegans in the US rose 600%. This isn't a fad. Its a movement.

       I've always said that, the world isn't getting warmer ( I have my doubts about that as well ) because X person drives a truck that gets 12 MPG.  I somewhat believe that the weather is being controlled through something like CERN ( it wouldn't surprise me to be honest )

       I have always felt this way, but also believe that the petty laws are there mostly because the legislators are powerless against their donors.  They are being asked to "save the environment", so they will ban straws in California on the same day that a study revealed 95% of the plastic in the ocean comes from 9 main rivers, mostly in Asia and Africa.  Most of politics is theater since the really big problems are snowballing out of the ability to stop them.

       I always wondered why folks in California don't call b.s. on the low flow toilets and shower heads that just plain suck, when everybody knows agriculture / industry account for something like 99% of water use (and waste)? If they just banned almond growing on industrial scales that would probably be enough to let people take normal showers and not have to plunger their toilets constantly from lack of flushing power.

       Environmentalists nowadays are Communist subverters, that is what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am an environmentalist, a true one, that is why I don't support a welfare state that incentivizes consumerism and destruction of the planet. I favor austerity for people who can't support themselves, and low taxes for people who are productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Communist wealth redistribution ends, then we can save the environment and leave a smaller footprint.

       This hedonism and nihilism that the left produces is very harmful to the environment.
      </p>

       The Communists don't care abut the environment, they just misuse that label.

       Absolutely. That's how we ended up with the buzz word brand of "climate change" instead of "massive localized pollution"

       I said it years ago. Pollution is something that everyone can agree is bad. We all want clean air, water and soil.

       But climate change is this big, nebulous, debate driven concept designed to lock people into argument and ensuring only the largest organizations get any play.

       It's really about who benefits. Carbon taxes (and trading) are a similar larceny.
      </p>
      <p>
       By keeping it fairly vague climate change makes sure everyone is arguing rather than focusing on tangible changes.
      </p>

       Chemical run off into water, plastic pollution into water, emissions into air, long term leeching into the ground and also water, fracking, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In polluted cities what is the average reduction in life span for example?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pollution inhalation is medically the same as smoking cigarettes, it's just a matter of frequency and the specific mix of chemicals. But one of the most important yet invisible issues is an enlarged heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say, in LA, if you ride your bike more than 15 miles a week you're better off taking side streets instead of major ones to avoid vehicle emissions.

       Diet and lack of exercise aside, cardiovascular disease is the #1 killer in the US.

       I agree, if it was actual impact for example, animal products make up more carbon footprint than all transportation, and far more deforestation.

       On the flip side, think about boycotts. Corporations are terrified of individuals banding together to do one thing (not purchase your widget or service). If people decided to stop eating meat imagine how much less methane will be emitted, fuel needed, etc.

       With how we're structured there's really no mechanism to make corporations accountable. At worst they just pay fines and go their merry way. Now the EPA is headed by someone who sued them previously.

       Residential water use accounts for 2% of California's total. If every single denizen of California completely stopped showering, watering plants, washing dishes, washing cars and drinking water, our state's use would go down to 98%.

       I've had this thought for ages. It just makes sense. If they can make you feel like you're part of the problem, you won't push for progress. And you can bet your ass that even if enough people do, the first restrictions put in place will only affect the common man at the bottom of the totem pole.

       I think you are onto something. I think this has been an objective for a long time. The concept of looking at the consumer pool and then trying to affect change through that pool makes sense. The problem is there is a disproportionate amount of effort into consumer awareness, and almost none into industry awareness. Sure companies do things at an industrial level to affect change, but usually for Goodwill only, and if it was not a PR issue, they would do nothing. They do not want to open cans of worms on issues like water resource. It would open up conversations about who really uses all of the water, and what they and the Government who regulate it are doing.

       I've had a theory going for a while that Environmental groups are funded by big money to keep organic activism from taking root.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the left, you have guys like Soros who fund pro environmental stuff. On the right, you have guys like the Koch Bros who fund energy lobbies. Where I live, we have a lot of oil. On both sides, you have people fighting over who controls the resource but mostly the oil companies get whatever they want.

       The activists mostly just wind up as useful idiots.

       Exactly. If your into saving the environment, you should actually care what you buy and what you eat. Recycling is miniscule to what becoming vegan does, but nobody cares because PSAs often don't address big ways to change your lifestyle.

       They don't tell you that veganism is the single most effective and immediate way to reduce damage. Everyone is addicted to eating their animal products and could never give them up. That's the real conspiracy, that no one will ever mention animal agriculture as the number one form of damage to the environment. Oh you don't believe me? Look it up. It's easy to verify.

       Unless you live near a coast line, your reusable bags don't do shit. Well, they encourage you to buy more things, including the bags themselves, and they are very handy for thieves that wish to make an huge environmental impact by pushing full carts out doors.  But yes, you are paying for green washing. FYI, if a company wants to sell you something to help the environment, be skeptical.

       This is what "reduce, reuse, recycle" has sadly become. It's all just marketing to make people think they're making a bigger difference than they are. You should still recycle things, but don't for one second begin to believe what you're doing is single-handedly saving the planet. The bottom fell out of the recycling industry in the US years ago, so it's even more of an empty-gesture now. Even if you aggressively sort your garbage, it's likely all getting thrown onto the same conveyor belt eventually. Remember when you used to be able to take your glass bottles and cans to a bottle exchange at the supermarket? Most of those are closed now. Incidentally that's how a lot of homeless people made a little money. You used to see homeless people lugging around huge bags full of cans, because they'd get like $20 that way. Now that opportunity isn't there so much anymore. Kicking them while they're down.

       This is why I am anti-liberal. I hold extremely liberal beliefs but our current brand of mainstream liberalsm puts all the weight of responsibility for change on the individual, not the collective or elite. In essence enabling the latter to exploit the ultra-concerned citizens.

       The single biggest thing we as individuals can do to combat climate change is to stop eating meat. Between global deforestation, water usage, energy to harvest and transport animal feed, waste management of all the animal feces and blood, resources for slaughter, preservatives, packaging, refrigeration, and shipment of meat, not to mention the antibiotics and hormone supplements that go into animal feed, it's totally unsustainable and fundamentally insane. But the great part is, the meat/dairy industry runs on supply and demand, so the more people choose to stop eating meat, the better it will be for the environment. In the last 3 years, people who identify as 'vegan' in the US rose 600%. Its not just a fad. People are finally starting to wake up and make informed decisions with their diet.

       What about the wars going on in so many countries overseas? I was thinking of he c-130 crash the other day and all that black smoke. Now take that and have similar bombings or attacks that level cities and communities, filling them with smells of death, smoke, and who knows what else from chemicals if they are using them. I'm sure those things have to have an effect too.

       Also do your fucking part. vote with your wallet. get off of gasoline any way you can. I ride an electric motorcycle and I personally have reduced 12,517lbs of Co2 vs gas on my 2nd bike alone. What have you done other than pass your guilt for being complicit in the end of the world back onto the corporations that sell you the poison we spew into the air to make these little boxes drive people around. Gasoline is the enemy of the planet, it's time to wage war.

       This is actually the concept behind the term "litterbug". Corporations started it as a way to pass blame for any expenses/responsibilities over the garbage created when you use their product.

       don't waste water!! when there is a golf course a mile away watering grass or a farm wasting millions of gallons to wash away the chemicals they spray all over it in to rivers...

       keeping the public feeling responsible, prevents them from being as angry about it as they should be because they dont want to be angry at themselves.

       There's a Finnish writer who advocates some kind of super fascist regime to take over the world and run it in an ego friendly way. This problem is beyond the capabilities of humanity working as independent nation states. I'm not advocating the NWO,  but honestly I don't have an answer here,  either.

       i forget how the actual numbers work exactly, but its kinda like the airlines save money on fuel when they use over a certain amount, so they just simply falsify their usage by dumping some.  also apparently it makes landings easier and safer .

       Shit, that makes sense and obviously in the case of an emergency landing when you haven't burned up enough fuel to meet the maximum landing weight, it's understandable. But to just dump it because this bullshit economy makes it financially viable is environmentally criminal. Thanks for the link.

       You're made to feel "guilt" about trivial environmental issues in order to make you more amenable to their "solutions". The fact is that anthropomorphic global warming is not a fact, it's a hypothesis and it's far from proven.

       Back in the 80s, the city of Toronto was having frequent air quality advisories when the air downtown was a green haze and they were telling people not to drive their cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one of those days, my friends and I took the ferry out to Toronto island park, just offshore on Lake Ontario. Looking at the city, we saw the smoke rising from the coal fired generator plant on the East side. It hit some kind of layer in the air, went straight west, and then dropped down right over the downtown core.
      </p>
      <p>
       It had nothing to do with traffic.

       Excactly. Carbon dioxide is essential to life on this planet, it is the source of every carbon atom in your body via the food chain, and you are made to feel personally guilty for it while our rivers and oceans are filled with toxins, our ecosystems are devestated for harvesting and agriculture, our air is blighted by the furnaces of shipping and industry, and we ignore it all. Green parties are more interested in people and socialism, money and greed, than the environment. Climate scientists are all frauds, as the climategate emails exposed but they were swept under the rug. Stop being decieved about climate change and start caring about the oceans, the rivers, the wilderness and the real pollutants in our air.

       Keep in mind, those factories are producing goods that will be purchased by consumers. It is important to keep supply &amp; demand in consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transportation, Energy and Animal Agriculture (especially livestock) are the leading contributers to greenhouse gas emissions.Keep in mind with transportation it is more CO2 whereas with livestock it is methane (aka cow farts). Methane is a more powerful climate warmer and also clears out of the atmosphere quicker than CO2.

       Eating a more plant based diet, especially less red meat is necessary to reall address climate change.

       While I agree this is a problem we ourself is making. We are buying the things that these companies produce, without us they wouldn't do what they do. Very few things are truly necessary but we still buy things so they produce things, and I don't want to pay for it so it's produced cheap with material that is cheap.

       The UK government is on a massive spree of taxing things they deem wasteful on the principle of "If we charge them 5p for this, they'll bring their own!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Charging 5p for a coffee cup when someone doesn't carry a flask on them isn't going to change anything, it will just make them pay 5p extra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you charge the companies that package fruit in plastic or toy companies which are literally putting plastic in MORE plastic, 5p per kg of plastic they use. Then see if the rate goes down.

       This, totally.
      </p>
      <p>
       when I was a kid we didn't have bottled water.  The tap water was pretty good.  The idea of paying $1 or more for a little plastic bottle of water would have seemed funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, my tap water is cloudy, tastes funny and is pretty much undrinkable.  I don't even like the idea that I shower and brush my teeth with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And certain companies are producing billions of plastic bottles of drinkable water.  Plastic that can't be good for the environment.  Water that I consume every day because I haven't got a lot of other options.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an age of ever increasing technology in nearly every field, I wonder why no advances in safe clean municipal drinking water have come along and the quality of it has actually decreased over the last 2 or 3 decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure someone will disagree.  I'll just have you over for a glass of tap water if you do.

      <p>
       I believe that is because infrastructure is usually funded by municipal bonds or higher taxes, and it's unpopular to borrow money or raise taxes. Bonds are also driven by the prevailing interest rate which has been historically low for nearly all of my lifetime, at least since the 1980's. Nobody wants to park money in bonds that return next to nothing when you can get a better return elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, without the funds, there's no way to take on what would amount to huge public works projects.

       Most of the pressure I've seen in this regard has been peer pressure. In other words it's usually your wife or friend or daughter telling you to save the trees or save water or whatever. Where I live, water literally falls from the sky for free, in massive amounts, the majority of the days in the year, and I'm still made to feel bad for taking a long shower. I get that it takes energy to make the water clean for use yada yada, but I still think there is a lack of perspective there. The amount of energy it takes to process the water I use probably is minuscule in comparison to the cost to air condition an office building on the weekend when nobody is using it.

       I mean, sure, public support and understanding plays a huge role, but any big change is usually kicked off by the ideas of an individual who became lucky enough to develop them. Tesla, Newton, Leibnitz, Christ (if you wanna go there), Ghandi, MLK, ...

       That's what gave Elon Musk his messianic status (deservedly or not). A modern savior of our collective guilt, at least in theory. There are no-doubt many individuals out there with ideas and solutions worthy of public support.

      <p>
       Anyone who is convinced that they're not one of those inventive individuals should strive to identify them in their surroundings and support their ambitions as best they can. Teachers especially.

       Broken window is thinking war is a good thing because it creates business for the military contractors, but ignores the fact that these are all extra costs that wouldn't have to be incurred otherwise and the resources could have been used to improve things beyond the original state (like developing wind/solar/effective power storage instead of trying to sustain the fossil fuel market).

       "In an age of ever increasing technology in nearly every field, I wonder why no advances in safe clean municipal drinking water have come along and the quality of it has actually decreased over the last 2 or 3 decades."
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that is because infrastructure is usually funded by municipal bonds or higher taxes, and it's unpopular to borrow money or raise taxes. Bonds are also driven by the prevailing interest rate which has been historically low for nearly all of my lifetime, at least since the 1980's. Nobody wants to park money in bonds that return next to nothing when you can get a better return elsewhere.

       But anyway, without the funds, there's no way to take on what would amount to huge public works projects.

       My idiot neighbor runs his in ground sprinklers every single day - and I don't even bother pointing out his hypocrisy in passively aggressively critiquing my car washing, because I don't want to dissuade him from continuing to over water his lawn, since he doesn't seem to be making the connection between running his sprinklers daily and having to mow his lawn twice a week.
I absolutely love driving a V8 - I drive every day, and every time I have to pull away at a light or out of toll lanes on the highway and get away from some annoying driver, it is so nice to just blaze away. Underpowered cars are dangerous.
