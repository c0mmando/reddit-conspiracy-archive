    <div class="md"><p>Seriously?!?! You believe injecting aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, MSG, human and animal DNA strands, bovine serum, etc. directly into the bloodstream bypassing the body&#39;s natural defenses is safe and a good idea? </p>

<p>Also, Wakefield was not discredited and his misconduct ruling was overturned. </p>

<p>&quot;...at least both The Lancet and Dr. Andrew Wakefield agree that he was exonerated of the disciplinary findings against him now that they have been completely overturned.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.autisminvestigated.com/the-lancet-dr-andrew-wakefield/">http://www.autisminvestigated.com/the-lancet-dr-andrew-wakefield/</a></p>

<p>On top of tgat, Wakefield&#39;s co-author on the paper, Dr. John Walker-Smith, won his appeal to have his medical license returned. Only a matter of time before they have to reinstate Wakefield as well as they were both done in under the same false charges.</p>

<p>&quot;The GMC proceeding was a multi-year, multi-million dollar prosecution against Drs. Wakefield, Walker-Smith, and Murch. It related to a controversial 1998 study published in The Lancet suggesting a possible link between autism, the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and bowel disease. Based on the GMC prosecution, both Drs. Walker-Smith and Wakefield lost their licenses to practice and the Lancet article was officially retracted. The GMC alleged that the physician-authors had failed to obtain necessary ethical clearances and that they had subjected the twelve children in the study to unnecessary medical procedures. </p>

<p>Justice Mitting, reviewing Dr. Walker-Smith’s appeal in the High Court of Justice, Queen’s Bench Division, Administrative Court, found that the GMC’s conclusions were “based on inadequate and superficial reasoning” and that “the finding of serious professional misconduct and the sanction of erasure are both quashed.” See full text of the decision.</p>

<p>Dr. Walker-Smith’s professional insurance coverage paid for his appeal; Dr. Wakefield’s insurance carrier would not.</p>

<p>Dr. Wakefield has recently filed a defamation lawsuit in Texas against the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, Editor-in-Chief, and journalist Brian Deer, who instigated the GMC prosecution. His lawsuit alleges that the defendants knowingly or recklessly engaged in fraudulent misrepresentations about 1998 Lancet study. While far from decisive, the Mitting ruling bodes well for Dr. Wakefield’s defamation action.</p>

<p>Justice Mitting’s impartial judicial decision marks a turning point in a long campaign to discredit 1998 Lancet article and Dr. Andrew Wakefield in particular. To date, international media have failed to probe the GMC’s ruling or to explore the many connections between Brian Deer, the Rupert Murdoch media empire, Glaxo Smith Kline, the British Medical Journal and numerous other medical bodies.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no longer any mercury in vaccines. Thiomersal was used as a preservative in small amounts and was deemed safe. Regardless, it is no longer used in vaccines following controversy over its use. I actually agree that aluminium should probably not be used in vaccines, along the same lines as mercury. I have seen some recent studies that support adverse affects of high concentrations of aluminium in the body in later life, so minimising the use of it would be ideal. However, the small amounts used have been deemed safe (i.e. not a large dose and a small enough amount that it will be readily excreted) by people far more knowledgeable on the subject than me, so while I do not think it is ideal, I also do not think it is particularly unsafe.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is used in the production of vaccines and removed before it is administered to patients, although it is impossible to guarantee that absolutely all of it is removed. Formaldehyde is also produced by the human metabolism - it&#39;s already in your body in far greater amounts than you&#39;d receive from any vaccine. As with everything, the dose makes the poison - you&#39;ve always got a bit of formaldehyde in you and the amount in a vaccine dose isn&#39;t going to hurt you, but drinking a gallon jug of it will.</p>

<p>&quot;Human and animal DNA strands&quot; aren&#39;t present in vaccines, although some animal-derived proteins and antibodies are used, though. Please note that as a human, you always contain &quot;human DNA strands&quot;, and by eating food you contain animal and plant &quot;DNA strands&quot;. This is not a problem. The animal-derived products are used because you need something to make your vaccine and animal products like gelatin and serum are readily available. They&#39;re not fundamentally dangerous.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also fundamentally mistaken about the administration of vaccines and the &quot;natural defenses&quot; of the body. Firstly, vaccines are not injected into the bloodstream, they are injected into muscle tissue. Secondly, the body&#39;s &quot;natural defenses&quot; against infection from pathogens is the <strong>immune system</strong>. Vaccines literally work by triggering an immune response (i.e. activating the body&#39;s &quot;natural defenses&quot;) with a weakened version of a pathogen, so that the immune system can register it and formulate a response against it which it then has ready to deploy if you are infected by the actual pathogen. They literally work with the body&#39;s built in defense against infection. You mention that I should do some research, but you seem to misunderstand the absolute basics of vaccination.</p>

<p>In general, I recommend you read up on the ingredients of vaccines from a <a href="http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients">reliable source</a>.</p>

<p>On the topic of Andrew Wakefield, <a href="http://www.ecbt.org/images/articles/Andrew_Wakefield_Has_Never_Been_Exonerated_Final.pdf">you could not be more wrong</a>. He has not been exonerated and he has has not had anything against him overturned. Walker-Smith&#39;s removal from the medical register was overturned following his appeal as the judge ruled that the General Medical Council made an erroneous judgement based on Walker-Smith&#39;s actions from a clinical perspective rather than a research perspective. The judge makes absolutely no mention of Wakefield being correct, and even states that &quot;there is now no respectable body of opinion which supports his hypothesis, that MMR vaccine and autism/enterocolitis are causally linked&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Walker-Smith and a number of coauthors of the original paper retracted their conclusions that there was a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism as there was insufficient evidence. <strong>They admitted that they were wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>To quote the end sentence of that paper: &quot;<strong>Andrew Wakefield himself was not, and given the overwhelming evidence against him, NEVER
WILL BE EXONERATED.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><strong>There is absolutely no evidence that supports a link between any vaccine and autism. None at all.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their original paper never claimed the MMR vaccine caused autism, only more research was needed. People seem to think his study said there was a link and that is absolutely untrue. I mean it was a study done on 10 kids, how could it possibly prove anything. This more research was the 2004 paper done by the CDC, only one of the key authors admitted they cooked the data, to hide a statically significant link. For those that don&#39;t know what statistically significant means with regards to papers, it means there is a link. And they fudged the data to make it go away. This 2004 paper was also supposed to end the debate once and for all. And as a result of it, the CDC recommended no more be done at all in this area! Disgrace. As for no mercury in vaccines, you are dangerously uninformed. Routine shots kids get, tetanus, flu etc, still contain 25 micrograms. Other vaccines are allowed to say preservative free, and still contain up to 1 microgram, because the thiomersal is actually used in the manufacturing of the shot.</p>

<p>&quot;The most frequent systemic reactions after any dose for children 2 months 
to 16 months of age were fussiness/irritability (75%), inconsolable crying 
(58%) and decreased activity/lethargy (51%).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish we could just have a rational discussion about this for once. I mean it’s ludicrous to assume that vaccines don’t work. They obviously do. What the more temperate skeptics are trying to argue is that the frequency and production methods of vaccines may be causing harm in some cases. People are injured by the misapplication of good medicine <em>all the time</em>. I think it’s  reasonable to consider that vaccines work but can <em>also</em> be dangerous. And the CDC nonsense is just weird. Their behavior, specifically their communication, certainly has me scratching my head. </p>

<p>If you knew 100% that vaccines caused autism in 1% of cases, but prevented 100,000 deaths per year, how would you feel? </p>

<p>The polarization of every damn subject is making it impossible to ask a reasonable question. Complicated questions have a wide spectrum of possible answers beyond “YES!” And “NO!” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines, like anything else, certainly can be dangerous for some people. Nobody thinks that literally everyone should be vaccinated, because there are lots of people that actually can&#39;t be vaccinated, for numerous possible reasons, but those people can still have a reduced risk of infection from a disease if everyone around them is vaccinated.</p>

<p>There <strong>are</strong> side effects to some vaccines, but severe issues are very rare. There are even cases of deaths after vaccine administration, but multiple studies show that the overall risk is very, very low. There are thousands of very good, well researched studies out there on the efficacy of vaccines and the side effects associated with them. There are multiple studies specifically investigating the link between vaccination and autism in children.</p>

<p>However, nobody cares about any of the side effects that actually exist. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of anyone posting that we should all reject vaccination because some tiny fraction of the population experiences a mild fever after being vaccinated. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone rejecting vaccination because some tiny number of people die after they are administered a vaccine. No, the anti-vaccination movement specifically rejects vaccination because it &quot;causes autism&quot;.</p>

<p>As I said above, there are many studies into the effects of vaccines, including autism in particular. Many studies show verifiable correlation between administration of vaccines and adverse allergic reactions, or fever, or even death. All studies show that vaccination significantly reduces the risk of the pathogens they are targeted at. No studies show any correlation between administration of vaccines and autism. <strong>Literally zero</strong>. The only ones that do have faulty methodologies, biased researchers, and falsified data.</p>

<p>To that end, I think the points you’ve brought up are fair. I don’t really believe the link to autism is all that credible. I am deeply distrustful of the way science is done and reported today, however. There is more
than enough institutionalized negligence and malice to warrant an often watchful and skeptical public.  I just wish there was more of a culture of informed, yet vigilant debate and it seems we have lost that. </p>

It is a system.  It’s reliable, to an extent, but can be just as fallible without constant, hearnest, scrutiny. And we are far from that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These studies are independently done without influence from the pharmaceutical companies and the CDC and are done on vaccinated vs unvaccinated? </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence linking vaccines to autism and many other dangerous side effects/complications. Virus shedding alone makes those who are vaccinated not only susceptible to the disease they are vaccinated against but also carriers infecting others for sometimes up to months after vaccination. Vaccines are hardly innocent and looking at the amount of damages paid out by the vaccine courts as well as the alarming rise in autism in the last few decades, they are definitely not as safe or effective as they are made out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they&#39;re carried out by the people who make them, government-run agencies like the CDC/WHO/FDA, university researchers, etc. There is not &quot;plenty&quot; of evidence linking vaccines to autism. <strong>There is absolutely no evidence</strong>. There <strong>is</strong> evidence for other side effects as I mentioned, though, although they&#39;re all deemed low risk. Understandably though, they do happen, and people seek compensation for that. </p>

<p>There is only a single case seeking compensation for &quot;autism&quot; that was accepted by the court - all others have been dismissed. The girl in this case exhibited autism-like symptoms after receiving multiple vaccinations and received compensation, but it was later discovered that <em>she did not suffer from autism</em>. She suffered from a mitochondrial disorder. So, the single case where a claimant was compensated for developing autism from a vaccine was actually misdiagnosed and did not have any form of autism.</p>

<p>To your point about virus shedding, it&#39;s happens when a virus successfully infects a cell and reproduces in it. The point of vaccines is that the viral/bacterial payload is weakened or deactivated so that this does not happen. It is possible, but very rare, for a live, weakened, vaccine payload to successfully infect a patient but is very rare. Most vaccines do not even contain live pathogens, weakened or not, and so there is absolutely zero risk of infection.</p>

<p>If vaccines are not effective, could you please tell me what happened to smallpox and polio?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just leave this collection here in case anyone is looking for more information on the current situation with vaccine.</p>

<p>The main problem we have is that the necessary studies are not being performed, the industry doesn&#39;t want to find the harm their products cause as it can mean loss of confidence, sales and also huge compensation payouts. So what they do is whitewash their products, data is played with, statistics are used to lie.</p>

<p>For example the honest experts are so sick of Big Pharma for not funding any proper studies into the safety of injecting Aluminum, that now they are crowdfunding for over $600,000 to perform the trials.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>Follow the money!! (see below)</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I have recently delved into the Andy Wakefield controversy, and I am having a hard time finding the &quot;smoking gun&quot; Freedom of Information Act request that Brian Deer used as proof of Wakefield&#39;s conflict of interest and the sums he was being paid.

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines, like anything else, certainly can be dangerous for some people. Nobody thinks that literally everyone should be vaccinated, because there are lots of people that actually can&#39;t be vaccinated, for numerous possible reasons, but those people can still have a reduced risk of infection from a disease if everyone around them is vaccinated.</p>

<p>There <strong>are</strong> side effects to some vaccines, but severe issues are very rare. There are even cases of deaths after vaccine administration, but multiple studies show that the overall risk is very, very low. There are thousands of very good, well researched studies out there on the efficacy of vaccines and the side effects associated with them. There are multiple studies specifically investigating the link between vaccination and autism in children.</p>

<p>However, nobody cares about any of the side effects that actually exist. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of anyone posting that we should all reject vaccination because some tiny fraction of the population experiences a mild fever after being vaccinated. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone rejecting vaccination because some tiny number of people die after they are administered a vaccine. No, the anti-vaccination movement specifically rejects vaccination because it &quot;causes autism&quot;.</p>

<p>As I said above, there are many studies into the effects of vaccines, including autism in particular. Many studies show verifiable correlation between administration of vaccines and adverse allergic reactions, or fever, or even death. All studies show that vaccination significantly reduces the risk of the pathogens they are targeted at. No studies show any correlation between administration of vaccines and autism. <strong>Literally zero</strong>. The only ones that do have faulty methodologies, biased researchers, and falsified data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually is not any conclusive proof that they work.  There is only circumstantial proof and there is actually far more circumstantial proof that they DO NOT work.

<p>And the fact that only 10% of the world&#39;s population was actually vaccinated with the small pox vaccine.  </p>
