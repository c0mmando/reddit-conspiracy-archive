       Me too. Probably because Ive always been on the outside with crazy ideas and getting attacked.  In 2003 it was about probiotics.  I was crazy but it fixed my IBS most of the way. Avoiding Corn Syrup did the rest.

       Nah, I've made it work here. That's the point. I can work around obstacles here that I would not be able to work around in other more corrupt countries, which I also need to do business in, but it's at a much higher cost.

       You're right, you can survive in this system.  The point is, the system can be a lot of things.  It can be arranged many different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to be a top down pyramid scheme.  Sure, its been arranged so that you can function if you participate but the ability for you to potentially flourish in your life is minimized.  It is stymied.
      </p>
      <p>
       A general way to put things is, the super rich don't want to stand in line at the grocery story with you and I, if were were all the same lord Rothchild wouldn't be so lordly.  People would scoff at a title like that.  It's for a reason.  It allows for control over you and I and many millions and billions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a solution so don't need to come back at me with that but, understanding that the universe doesn't care that we all work, eat, sleep this way helps people understand that it is a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the system was arranged to be about
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       people, things would be different.  Instead its of our creation, an artificial Darwinism that we are stuck in because of the nature of the system itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had an answer and wanted to share it with the world, I can't because I don't have the money.  Technology would only get me so far and other barriers to spreading a message can pile up real fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder corporations are a successful entity/creation.  It takes a slew of people to make great things happen, not one individual.  Though, the corporation is control, and all those people are under the direction of one or maybe a few people who don't necessarily want those working for them to be on the same playing field as them.  If it were so, then the individual at the top and their motives no longer matter as much.  Having a million people with the same capacity for making their lives work just like the head of that corporation means head honcho has competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       BlackHawkBolly is kind of right.  No amount of pulling one's bootstraps will land every one single person in a better place.  We can't all be rock stars in this system.  Artificial scarcity is a real thing and this system allows only a certain amount of people to flourish at a time.  It can change all the time and it is constantly evolving and hard to define.  People are born into it and have very little change to think past this system.

       Really good comment. Thanks for the response. I can palpably feel the same frustration you do with the reality of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the premise you start out with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You're right, you can survive in this system. The point is, the system can be a lot of things. It can be arranged many different ways.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That might be my point though. We can imagine a different world and we can take steps that we think will lead us there, but we're not going to anything that hasn't already been done in some place in some way. These things cycle, always have, always will and humans will always find a way to screw things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       More directly addressing your point, or perhaps empathizing with it, we always come back to "what could possibly be done to fix this" and we really don't have any solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The knee jerk is that someone says we just round them up put them in jail and take their stuff and redistribute to the rest of the world. That doesn't work for a few reasons, starting with the moral and philosophical but ultimately it still leads to an economic reality; there might be twice as much money, but inflation would rise to match and it won't take too long for people that know how to move money around to figure out how to move it into their pockets. We all have different skills, if any, and some are going to be consistent with accumulating wealth while others are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think we end up in basically the same place.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I agree. I bolded your 'every' as the qualifier. No amount of anything will make people equal, they just aren't. The measurements of equality aren't even equal, or even logical across all people. But take 'every' out and we have a different concept. There is an amount of bootstrap pulling that is done every day by many people and it does put them in a better place. That's my point, and my personal experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be better? Absolutely! Should it be better? Absolutely! What's the path to a better place? Well, that's the rub isn't it :)

       As a middle-aged white guy, I've been listening to Kanye since Graduation and appreciated his cultural shifts just as much as I did Madonna's as a child of the 80s. He didn't like Bush when it wasn't cool to not like Bush, lest you be branded a dirty "conspiracy theorist" and he gave up some flesh for that.
      </p>

       The man doesn't compromise. It doesn't mean that he agrees with any ideology, MAGA+Kanye=WTF we haven't seen it yet.

       But we all know they are making this about being a filthy republican, instead of a cultural awakening. The left knows that if this intended message reaches even a third of the people they will lose that voter base altogether. So they will make this about MAGA and nothing else.

       I actually completely agree with the points he’s been making, and I respect him for having the strength to put an unpopular view out there in the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment wasn’t to downplay anything he’s been saying, but rather a bit of satire directed at the way Trump supporters will flip flop on who they love and hate on a frequent basis, depending on whether that person recently said something good or bad about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mueller is a good example, as is McCain, and I’m sure many others. Tillerson too maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any time someone seems to agree with Trump supporters, they are woke, until they say something disagreeable at which point they become a traitor/pedophile/otherwise degenerate.

       See, I have a completely different outlook than you do. I see the two-party system as a joke. The vast majority of black people are partisan Dem voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       By woke, I mean that they are no longer partisan Dem voters. That doesn't mean that they should become partisan Republican voters, either. They should just recognize that the two-party system is BS, and that their role in the charade is to vote for Dems because of free shit and because Republicans are all racist. Your comment makes it clear that you are part of that charade as well.

       But I can understand how black people could have been offended and enraged over that comment. How can you talk about something you weren't a part of? Everyone feels to entitled to sit behind their computer screens and type shit with their fingers. That's like saying 'we aren't slaves in this system of Elites' because we have a choice not to be. So, are you a slave in their system or not?

       No one said we shouldn't move forward. But we should also respect history and what has happened. Say your grandfather fought in a war and gave his life so YOU could have your freedom. Would you accept someone completely discrediting his life and his fight? How would you feel if they said he was an idiot for doing that? Common sense, people.

       I actually completely agree. I just, in the past handful of days, was watching some youtube videos on him. Even just to watch what he says and wonder what he means when he says certain things and just analyze him as "what is he -trying- to tell us without losing his life or breaking 'the deal' he made?" Because im sure whatever 'deals' are made with these huge Hollywood celebs, breaking it poses something worse than your soul you sold. (If it's not clear in my statement, i whole heartedly believe there to be some kind of connections between illuminati/dark forces/soul selling/binding deals in trade for fame &amp; fortune in this life/MKUltra. I don't know WHAT the connections exactly are but im pretty positive there ARE very strong connections and Kanye is just a victim of a lot of it and trying his best to warn the people and speak out against it since he didn't know what he was getting into when he made that deal and now he can't back out but he can warn others)

       I'd also like to raise the question as to why this is maintaining 0 up votes. I just up voted it, wrote my comment, and after submitting my comment came back to see it back down at 0. With 70 comments... there MUST be more than 2 people up voting this idea.

       The DNC shilling and vote brigading here is ridiculous, they clearly blame Conspiracy theorists (as Clinton has said on TV many times) for her loss and we are being hijacked.

       You know, I'm VERY much a self proclaimed "conspiracy theorist" but every time I saw someone complaining that their post was being down voted because it was rigged and the topic wasn't something 'they' wanted at the for front of anything I always thought it was like that youtube shooter lady who was just like 'they're purposely defending my content because they don't like what I'm saying' when in reality their content was just crap and that's why it wasn't getting up votes or likes or whatever... but this is actually disgustingly obvious.

       There's no way that there's THAT many views, THAT many comments and someone is just sitting there hovering over this post to down vote it because of Kanye fucking West. Like you even said in your post. It's almost a joke. Never thought it'd be real- never thought I'd seriously be like 'no, guys, seriously... Kanye has seen some real shit, been part of some real shit and now he's trying to TELL us some.real.shit.'

       Also.. I don't think he truly intends his message to be meant only for the black community. I think he leans on that so that those dark powers above him let him drone on in his words without worrying. They don't care if you sit and preach about anti slavery, equal rights and all that but when you start talking about things that effect the money and exposing things about the NWO plans and the dark fraternity that is pulling the strings, then that's when they start killing you off and ruining your life..

       no, you didn't say the same thing. Broken said something, and you just recited a slogan.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anyone who doesnt want to Make America Great Again should probably just leave.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean anything, and who exactly is advocating to
       <em>
        Not
       </em>
       Make America Great Again?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what exactly does Make America Great Again mean to
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       ? And what would you identify as not wanting to Make America Great Again?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're applying allegiance to the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       a positive affirmation. Elaborate
