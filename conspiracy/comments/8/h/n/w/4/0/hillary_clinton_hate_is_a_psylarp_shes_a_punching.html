<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Bush Family Gets Away with Crimes That Would Land Anyone Else in Jail
For decades, the Bush family has operated above the law, using powerful connections to brush aside evidence that would put lesser Americans in the slammer.</strong></p>

<p>In the history of the American Republic, perhaps no political family has been more protected from scandal than the Bushes.</p>

<p>When the Bushes are involved in dirty deals or even criminal activity, standards of evidence change. Instead of proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that would lock up an average citizen, the evidence must be perfect.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any doubt at all, the Bushes must be presumed innocent. Even when their guilt is obvious to anyone with an ounce of common sense, it&#39;s their accusers and those who dare investigate who get the worst of it. Their motives are challenged and their own shortcomings are cast in the harshest possible light.</p>

<p>For decades -- arguably going back generations -- the Bushes have been protected by their unique position straddling two centers of national power, the family&#39;s blueblood Eastern Establishment ties and the Texas oil crowd with strong links to the Republican Right. [For details on this family phenomenon, see Robert Parry&#39;s Secrecy &amp; Privilege.]</p>

<p>This reality was underscored again by how major news outlets and the right-wing press reacted to a new piece of evidence implicating George W. Bush in a criminal cover-up in the &quot;Plame-gate&quot; scandal.</p>

<p>Though the evidence is now overwhelming that President Bush was part of a White House cabal that leaked Valerie Plame Wilson&#39;s identity as a covert CIA officer and then covered up the facts, major newspapers, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, continue to pooh-pooh this extraordinary scandal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>they even made protesting them a crime</p>

<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/17/when-protesting-bushs-wars-was-a-crime/">https://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/17/when-protesting-bushs-wars-was-a-crime/</a></p>

<p>and let&#39;s not forget they worked with bankers and the MIC to engineer the controlled demolitions of the twin towers to propel the USA into a righteous military gold rush in the middle east</p>

<p><a href="http://911speakout.org/david-chandler/">http://911speakout.org/david-chandler/</a></p>

<p>among many other crimes...but <strong>more people like to talk about the wife of a former president who really wasn&#39;t good for anything other than being a punching bag meant to give America amnesia from the crimes of both former and the current sitting president.</strong> </p>

<p><em>Hillary Clinton hate is a PSYLARP</em></p>

<p>I welcome any person at conspiracy to provide proof that Hillary Clinton has done anything of the magnitude of the Bush cartel. Thank you for your time and consideration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything I&#39;ll say you&#39;ll/somebody else will say is hearsay, anything I show you&#39;ll state it&#39;s part of a vast right wing conspiracy.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t show those who purposely aren&#39;t willing to look behind the curtain and into the Clinton&#39;s financial triumphs, especially in Arkansas. Hell, the people behind the Boys on the Track are still in power, one of them is a current drug czar at the moment.</p>

<p>People who are in power there and in power directly because of the actions and favors of the Clinton&#39;s.</p>

<p>You could bring up all of the people who are connected to the Clinton&#39;s that seemed to have died, plane crashes, two bullets to the back of the dome, cut and left dying on train tracks. It doesn&#39;t matter what you bring up because the Clinton&#39;s always have an out.</p>

<p>Talk about Clinton = &quot;why are you talking about that old windbag, you&#39;re obviously distracting from [topic of the day]&quot;</p>

<p>Talk about telecommunications act which lead to corporate overlords and an inability to punish them, point fingers at Clinton and Holder. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mena and the drug running, they lampooned that shit with a Tom Cruise movie.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a buddy who was fired from a nice hotel in LR in the 90&#39;s because he removed the brick that held the door open so Clinton used to bring in girls.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what the Clinton&#39;s actually do, they&#39;ll get away with it. It&#39;s not even worth talking about the Clinton&#39;s on a conspiracy sub because their name just is a buzzing heat signal for a bunch of petulant flies to a post. The past two years proved to me that the internet is not interested in the Clinton&#39;s past, only the emotions surrounding the campaign.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll probably never get enough evidence for your own judgement, just saying. You&#39;ll actually have to go to Arkansas and dig, speak with the people that were directly punished/effected by their whiteknuckled negotiations. Billy Jack Haynes is currently attempting to whistleblow the fact that he used to work for them, and Bill once mistook him for another hitman before, even though Haynes states he helped deliver cocaine from Arkansas to Seattle in wrestling rings. He mentions that Roger Clinton was on location the night the Boys of the Track were murdered.</p>

<p>However, everything involving the Clinton&#39;s stems from lack of/shaky witnesses. Take Billy Jack, he is a pro wrestler who has brain damage, who would believe him. Jane Does? They are just harlots, shouldn&#39;t believe them. Linda Ives, what does this simple Mena woman know?</p>

<p>If you knew how easy it was to manipulate Arkansas law enforcement in those days, it would open up a lot of users eyes to how blatant disregard for the law became common place for Arkansas politician, but there is only one family who took it an ran with it, made powerful allys so strong that we still cannot convince a country that a couple with just as numerous rumors and perceived body count as the Bushes aren&#39;t even viewed in the same light. You can&#39;t even get people to open up and think about it...which is why I don&#39;t talk about the Clintons anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I did was ask for the proof of some criminality.  Do you understand that that means a link to prosecution or hell, even an indictment?</p>

<p>Over 25 years of investigations totaling somewhere north of 200 million dollars and we get an email server.  That&#39;s just staggeringly silly with the amount of accusations folks in subs like this pass around.</p>

<p>Loathe or like Hillary,  you have to admit that there is so much bullshit throw at her that that makes for a better conspiracy than anything she&#39;s supposedly done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re connecting the email issue with all the other scandals and problems with the Clintons over the years. You can&#39;t talk about Clinton issues without the emails being the instant connection, thanks to the 2016 election.</p>

<p>I agree, there are better conspiracies for the Clintons, ideologues don&#39;t want to talk about them because it doesn&#39;t help their &#39;culture war&#39;.</p>

<p>They slipped out of all prosecution, so in your technical terms they are clean as a whistle. I just believe our criminal justice system was manipulated by very adept lawyers. So, like I originally said, nothing I can provide you will give you what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Again, 25 years of investigations, over 200 million spent, millions upon millions of man hours and somehow she has escaped conviction.  The lady you folks said was to weak to run for POTUS in 2016 somehow escapes indictments and convictions even when staunch right wingers are investigating.</p>

<p>The DOJ reopened the investigation after getting stonewalled by the Obama administration. Legitimate investigations don’t leak, and take time. This opens a can of worms that will include everyone from Obama to the Bushes. </p>

<p>What&#39;s not to agree or disagree with.  In year 26 of the investigations yet another Republican held DOJ or Congress is launching another investigation over the same stuff again.  Not a conviction not an indictment but a long string of investigations that so far have led nowhere...yet.</p>

<p>But maybe this time the Republican/right wing led investigation will lead somewhere?  Huh?  Maybe the 26th time is the charm?  Maybe the 300th million is the charm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem really sure that Trump is a republican, ignoring the fact he was a democrat for most of his life. </p>

<p>Shockingly, a corrupt DOJ and FBI found no crimes committed. Trump was elected to drain the swamp. It’s impossible to do so with a comprised judicial system and FBI. The recent firings and resignations are good indicators that this is happening. The fact they have discretely reopened the investigations is also a good sign that the corruption of the last few decades is not continuing. </p>

<p>Looking forward to Horowitz’s report. Are you going to call that a partisan attack as well? </p>

<p>Why not both?</p>

<p>In my mind they are wearing the same sweater. It just looks like the fray from the Clinton angle might be within reach and if it can be pulled then the Bush family will be left naked too. Specifically, if this could lead to putting anyone under pressure that was in power under 9/11 then we have frays in the Bush sweater to pull at. This goes back further than we realize. About midpoint in that story we find there&#39;s probably a very good reason the CIA building is named after senior and it gets even uglier from there. </p>

<p>Ok, first see <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/magnora7/comments/5odisy/we_are_witnessing_the_birth_of_seconddegree/">this</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5v7fwp/the_conspiracy_of_trust_or_why_didnt_they_simply/">this</a>. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7pcmfs/trump_administration_waives_punishment_for/dsgmnbu/">Also this</a>.</p>

<p>To illustrate the reverse psychology they used to get Trump elected:</p>

<p>The institutional propaganda&#39;s criticism of Trump is (and has always been) absolutely and utterly invalid, and it is done on purpose. It is something I noticed from the very start of the electoral campaign. Him &quot;imitating&quot; a handicapped man, pussy grabbing, &quot;offensive&quot; words ... they even went as far as claiming he was antisemitic ... I mean, come on! None of his <em>actual</em> flaws were ever cited (starting with his morbid statism and Zionism).</p>

<p>This could (and did) have one major effect: increase his popularity. Especially in a time when people are craving substance. </p>

<p>About this last example (&quot;Trump the antisemite&quot;), realize that in guise of this fake talking point, the American public was bombarded with <a href="https://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FHttpHandlers%2FShowImage.ashx%3Fid%3D345966&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpost.com%2FUS-Elections%2FJewish-World-Anti-immigrant-and-white-supremacist-maybe-But-is-the-alt-right-anti-Semitic-466675&amp;amp;docid=0b3TH_0a5iQYnM&amp;amp;tbnid=ii3dXzqk5W6JuM%3A&amp;amp;vet=1&amp;amp;w=758&amp;amp;h=530&amp;amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim">this poster</a>. This happened on the <em>same holiday week-end</em> as Comey saying, in substance, &quot;Clinton is guilty but she&#39;s above the law&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - Clinton is a war criminal and suspected child trafficker. But she was never supposed to become president. She was the scarecrow - for every super-hero needs a super-villain. </p>

<p>Do you see the reverse psychology and subliminal manipulation this particular example involves? </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ll grant to the people doing this. They are master story-tellers. But that&#39;s pretty much the only way they are capable of being creative. Lying and manipulating honest people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She was promised the position during the selection and she had everything rigged to steal the election.  Something went wrong and she and her fellow demons were kicked to the curb.  This is why a big part of why they are now so desperate.  Because, they thought they could whitewash all their many crimes and now there is a possibility that they will be held accountable.  So, we agree, they never talk about his actual flaws but then they wouldn&#39;t would they?  Everything they do is from opposite land and they can&#39;t break stride with this trait.  They are happy to do what the do because it serves their dark overlords.</p>
