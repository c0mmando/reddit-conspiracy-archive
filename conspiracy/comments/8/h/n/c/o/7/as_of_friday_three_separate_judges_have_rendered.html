       It's taken 3 different judges to say what many of us have been thinking for almost two years: show us the evidence! Not only that, show us even a fraction, a
       <em>
        modicum
       </em>
       of evidence to support Russian collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the talking heads repeat the tired talking points of "Well Mueller isn't done yet! Just wait and see!", allow me to give you some advice: don't fall into the same trap as the "Q patriots". Like with Q, you're being conditioned to believe that some savior (Mueller) is in control on the "inside" and is taking care of the baddies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This causes many well-meaning and intelligent individuals to shift the responsibility we all have towards making this world a better place on to some  nebulous "authority" figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        We
       </em>
       are responsible for holding TPTB accountable for their criminality, not Mueller and not Q.

       In the end, Robert Mueller will either produce the goods and the public will be privy to them or he won't, just like Kenneth Starr. We will see. Some of us actually want to see if the current people in power have done bad (illegal) things. Two years ago, I would have agreed that the "collusion" charges were unsupported, but much has come out since then. Some need to catch up.

       Some of us believe that the whole power structure ad investigative structure of the US gov has been corrupt for many years probably decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the candidate who ran on the platform of cleaning out the swamp, has been slandered since day 1, and unjustifiably accused of being treasonous every day for the past 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us are justified in being suspicious and dont think that the government has been saintly and pure before Trump, and that they are looking for anything they can to discredit and impeach a threat to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What more likely,
 Trump is a Russian spy?
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       The government has been corrupt for decades and Trump is a wild card and a threat to them?

       Running on a platform of cleaning out the swamp is very different than actually doing so. Trump has fully re-populated the swamp with new billionaires in charge of programs they don't understand (Price/Pruitt are prime examples), and then war-monger generals at the heads of all state/military departments. There is no doubt corruption in the US gov't, but it's illogical to believe that the entire US gov't (filled with republicans btw) somehow coordinated to bring Trump down. The people at the heads of the investigation into Trump (sessions and rosenstein) were appointed by Trump himself!!!

       You also lose credibility saying all this as an active T-D user who is obviously just going to defend trump...

      <p>
       Don't really agree because it is not true. MSM gave DJT unprecedented free positive coverage before the election, as the Harvard study made clear. When MSM went against DJT, it was mostly upon polarized issues where the population was already decided. This superficial treatment would benefit both polarization and DJT.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Agree to this part only. I am suspicious of the emphasis upon "Russian collusion" as deflection from other more important issues like other election tricks that were sued. I think Russian collusion is important but there are much bigger things going on. I would like to see all of it exposed. Which brings me to another reason to be suspicious:
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the investigators happen to be Republicans, the same party that appears to be playing both sides of this entire situation. I don't trust the Republican investigators to do enough. I suspect that Republicans would like to get rid of DJT no because he is going to 'drain the swap,' but more as a tactical measure to protect their party from the damage.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mostly disagree because DJT is not a threat to them in the way we at r/conspiracy would like. DJT is not out to drain any swamp or do anything for the people. Rather, DJT is a risk to the established order because he is a 'wild card' who creates outrage against the system, and particularly against the Republican Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very important to understand or at least recognize:
      </p>
      <p>
       DJT is being used implement the same old Republican policies that have been widely discredited -- deregulation, tax cuts, deconstruction. DJT may also be used at the fall guy later on. I think he will. They've done this same kind of thing with the Tea Party. It's a standard dirty trick.

       Of you think he's draining the swamp you havent been paying attention. This whole thing is meant to get buy in from the growing conspiracy theory movement that has grown exponentially over the last 5-10 years. People that challenge the narrative will buy back into the government if trump comes out on top amd axes a couple sacrificial lambs that are already set for life and got a nice retirement bonus (Comey, mueller, etc)

       You are living proof theure not wrong. A sizeable chunk of the ct base has an identical mindset about trump. Bc for some reason people think hes not a deep state stooge after recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of israel

       To say that there has not been "a modicum of evidence to support Russia collusion" is dishonest and not supported by the very well-know public info.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The Papadapalous guilty plea was literally directly related to him discussing cooperating with the Russians.

       2) The Seychelles meeting set up by Nader and attended by Erik Prince and Kirill Dmitriev. A meeting like that doesn't just accidentally happen, and we know Mueller has already questioned Nader.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Not to mention the most blatant collusion of all with the Trump tower meeting. Literally the definition of quid pro quo as well saw Trump team openly welcome and accept dirt on Hillary Clinton, while offering leniency on russian sanctions with the magnitizky act. Do you honestly believe it was just about adoption??? cmon
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Kushner back-channel communication attempt

      </p>
      <p>
       5) This list could go on for awhile....
      </p>
      <p>
       The judges here definitely took a step to assure that Mueller doesn't go beyond his scope, which seems like a good system of checks and balances that the US should have on a special counsel. To come to the conclusion that the judges statements indicated Mueller has no evidence of russian collusion is simply misleading and untrue.

       I understand the distrust of the MSM, but to say that 100&amp;#37; of what they produce is a lie and completely fabricated is simply illogical. A large number of their stories just this year have forced Trump and co to admit their lies (see the Flynn firing for one). Just because Trump screams "fake news" at anything negative against him doesn't mean you should be a sheep that eats it all up.

       Those sources have given us few reasons to trust them, but far too many reasons to admonish them.  If you are a Trump hater and just seek to confirm your bias then by all means, read that trash.  If you are seeking objective truth, you won't find it there.

      <p>
       Did the trump tower meeting not occur? Did Kushner not attempt to set up a back channel? Did Mueller not interview Nader regarding the Seychells meeting? So again, you can distrust the sources in general and the spin they use, but unless you can show me that those things didn't happen at all, then you're argument is illogical and solely based on your feelings rather than the facts at stake.

       Do you honestly think a product of the establishment like Mueller is going to challenge any of these centuries-old precedents in political skulduggery?

       This honestly reeks of theater at this point, and it's having this increasingly deleterious effect of simultaneously enraging and placating the masses, as in "OMG there's a Putin puppet as POTUS, but it's OK, Mueller will get him!"

       So we should just ignore the malfeasance at the highest office in the land because other politicians in the past have done stuff wrong? You are definitely correct that the MSM and certain political leaders have evolved this into political theatre, but that doesn't mean it is all untrue and not worth being investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, this investigation will either be able to reveal evidence of crimes or not. Political theatre only goes so far, so let's stay tuned and wait for the investigation to finish before we just brush it all off as the status quo of american politics that we simply cannot do anything about....

       The allegations against Hillary were leaps and bounds beyond those regarding Trump. Not that there should be apathy towards this investigation, I'm not saying that. I'm just establishing here that the two things you are trying to compare are undeniably incomparable.
      </p>

       With that said, the scrutiny applied to Trump's campaign should be applied to every campaign of every elected federal representative. This should be the standard instead of the exception.

       <em>
        Judge Emmet G. Sullivan
       </em>
       Mueller's team to turn over any "exculpatory evidence" to Flynn's defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt;Oddly,
       <strong>
        Flynn's legal team never made this request
       </strong>
       . Instead, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan issued the order "sua sponte," or at his discretion, invoking the "Brady Rule" -** which requires prosecutors to turn over previously unfiled evidence that might have a material impact on a defendant's cas**e. Two days before Sullivan's order, Mueller filed a motion for a protective order regarding the use of evidence in the case, including "sensitive materials," which would be provided to Flynn's lawyers by the office of the Special Counsel.

       Why do you have to label those who are distrustful of Mueller as Trump defenders?
      </p>
      <p>
       There
       <em>
        most definitely
       </em>
       are not two camps, and it's extremely disingenuous to suggest otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's perfectly reasonable, even
       <em>
        logical
       </em>
       , to be skeptical of
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       Trump and Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's perfectly possible (probable) for Trump to be corrupt without having anything to do with Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't be surprised that so many conspiracy theorists are rejecting the Trump/Russia collusion conspiracy theory...Mueller has long been implicated in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       manners of sordid affairs from the 9/11 and Anthrax days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite your attempts to create a false dichotomy, it's actually much more prudent to be skeptical of
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       Trump and Mueller, as well as all of those in authority in government/corporations.

       Because your post history suggests that you have it out for Mueller, his investigation, and the DoJ, especially these past few days. You are clearly pushing a narrative, and it's very coincidentally tin defense of Trump. We're not stupid. We can see these things because of how obvious you make it.

       In all seriousness, Russian interference pales in comparison to domestic inappropriate/illegal interference.  And by illegal I am referring to DNC laundering money for the Clinton campaign through state parties.  Some would also include excess donations as in Rosie O'Donnel, and maybe fraudulent voters, but I'm not sure of the evidence behind that last one.

       It's actually the exact opposite. Those that back the Russia collusion theory believe it without evidence with the excuse that Mueller is playing 4D chess and we can't see the evidence because it will compromise the case he's building.

       Also unverified means that it's not verified. That's it. The rest of your definition is from what you feel like it means but that's not real.

       Mueller and the FBI aren't the only ones attempting to verify the dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally every MSM news source, tv, newspapers, magazines, etc. have been working for over a year to verify the dossier ever since it was released by Buzzfeed. They have a lot more resources than you or I and they have a clear agenda to find anything to discredit Trump yet ,so far, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even linked Newsweek, a "magazine" that is clearly biased against Trump and they couldn't verify the majority of the dossier and what they did "verify" is full of words like "alleged" and it has not led to any indictments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dossier is the equivalent of a sponsored (by the DNC) magazine ad that looks like an article but is nothing more than an advertisement.

       See, the thing about words, is that they have meanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you make a claim, and use the wrong word, that claim becomes false. That's what you did. Maybe instead of doubling down you should just back up and edit your original comment to read "unproven" or "unverified" and go on living your life as an honest person once more.

       Discredit, the word, has a lot of definitions, but none of them remotely concern objective conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone makes a claim, and they can't provide evidence for that claim, even with the full weight and force of the U.S. Federal government at their disposal for just about an entire year, I consider it to be lacking in credibility. Not disproven, sure (i.e. no contradictory evidence to suggest the claim is impossible).

       You're allowed to have that opinion. But complex things take time to figure out. A year really isn't that long of a time considering the complexity of the issues at hand. Every American should want the truth no matter how long it takes.

       I wouldn't hold your breath. The people that can look at the trump tower meeting and see nothing wrong with it will simply never see that collusion exists. The emails reflected blatant cooperation between russian agents and trump fam, they all collectively tried to hide the existence of the meeting, and then they all collectively attempted to fabricate a storyline where the meeting was all about adoptions once they were caught. It wasn't even a good lie yet here we are.... i don't get it

        In April 2016, the authors writing as "Durden" on the website were reported by Bloomberg News to be Ivandjiiski, Tim Backshall (a credit derivatives strategist), and Colin Lokey. Lokey, the newest member revealed himself and the other two when he left the site.[1] Ivandjiiski confirmed that the three men "had been the only Tyler Durdens on the payroll" since Lokey joined the site in 2015.[1] Former Zero Hedge writer Colin Lokey said that he was pressured to frame issues in a way he felt was "disingenuous," summarizing its political stances as "Russia=good. Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry=dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft."[1] Zero Hedge founder Daniel Ivandjiiski, in response, said that Lokey could write "anything and everything he wanted directly without anyone writing over it."[1]
        <em>
         On leaving, Lokey said: "I can't be a 24-hour cheerleader for Hezbollah, Moscow, Tehran, Beijing, and Trump anymore. It's wrong. Period. I know it gets you views now, but it will kill your brand over the long run. This isn't a revolution. It's a joke."[1]

       Interesting. Everytime there's a Zero Hedge article posted, there's an endless effort not to talk about the information provided but to instead try to diminish the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the information can't be refuted, as it comes from an excellent source.

       Any independent mind would do the same. The only people who seem to think otherwise are hard-leftists, who demonize any source that exposes their narrative and doesn't fall in line with their agenda or perceived realities.

       I've been reading ZH for years, and I've seen countless articles and predictions of theirs come to pass months and years before they happen.

       That's pretty rich considering until last year they were an obscure alt-news market source with some political commentary and "doom porn" for all of those silly fools buying gold and silver to hedge against the Fed and the failing Petrodollar. Half of the articles are links to the blogs of Michael Snyder, Peter Schiff, and the like but now the same people advising you against the scam of our monetary and political system are also the ones manipulating it? 2 ex hedge fund managers gone rogue with no access to wall street are now... pumping and dumping wall street.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this came out of your mouth is absolutely amazing. Try reading that concept back to yourself again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you do realize you're quoting a disgruntled employee who tried to maim ZH after being fired in a terribly embarrassing fashion, right? I was there when this happened; I didn't copy and paste what someone else wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       But continue to tell me not to trust a source that gets everything right because they're secretly making their predictions come true by... making them come true.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way, they nail political and geopolitical calls more than anything, including the market. Arguing that ZHis a bad source literally means you're either extremely biased and hate that the info doesn't fit your narrative, or you've never read ZH long enough to see the obvious credibility they have.

       Either way, you lose.

       Well I think at this point they are waiting to interview Trump but him and his legal team are dragging their feet. If he has something so bad that it takes down Trump you'd have to get him on the record to answer for it first before you release anything. If Trump interviews soon it could come to an end before the midterms.

       I may have read it wrong I had just woken up but it just seems like if the only way they can get him is by getting him to slip up in an interview or admit to something, then they must not have anything too good. Trump would obviously kno what he did if he did it and he can just not do the interview. Then your stuck with nothing again

       I think everyone can agree, Russia helped trump. But trump did not personally collude with them. I guess. It seems like the investigation did unveil a lot of things we did not expect, like meetings and calls, that appear to point to collusion.

       Does anyone else find it odd that OP constantly posts literal Russian propaganda or articles about how the Russia probe is a witch hunt?

       That's literally a list of the same exact circuitous talking points...nothing mentioned then comes
       <em>
        remotely
       </em>
       close to implicating Trump or even putting his position as POTUS in jeopardy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem with this whole fiasco...the joke's on us because
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of these guys are corrupt and these little political "battles" are produced for entertainment/distraction purposes only.

       Prove it. Prove that the Dossier has been verified and all of it is true or shut it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re attempting to quibble over words. Unverified means no proof or evidence to support.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let’s see your sources proving the Dossier is true.
