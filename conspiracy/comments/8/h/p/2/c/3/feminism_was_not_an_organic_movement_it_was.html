</blockquote>

<p>Two points to make on this in the context of the thread.  Steinem was not used to undermine feminism, as steer the politics of the left away from anti-capitalism.  This is a matter of the public record.  Secondly, there are certainly trajectories of feminism that are very much anti-liberal.    So, perhaps you might want to explicate your claim. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Here I do disagree.  The answer to the crisis of Feudalism, was not a rhetoric of balancing acts. Nor was the answer to the problem of absolute Monarchy the question of balancing power... it was abolishing of the monarchy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I completely agree with your last sentence, at least until capitalism creates the means by which we can move past it to something better, but for now it&#39;s the best system we got, so it should absolutely be defended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we have a fundamental disagreement.  Not only did capitalism already create a means by which we can move past it, it created a mass of people whose existence is mediated through the labor market, it has also created enough productive power to meet everyone needs.  And more importantly it has brought us to a precipice of an environmental catastrophe from which, due to its inherent dynamic, it can&#39;t get out of.  </p>

<p>So, no... it should not be defended, and the intelligence community should certainly not be running domestic ops to undermine movements that challenge it.  </p>

You will not likely make a system other than capitalism work without strictly controlling the individuality and liberty of human beings. If you could disseminate information, education, and general intelligence to the masses without compulsion or psychological manipulation, i.e. a miraculous kind of contemporary age of enlightenment, maybe we could transition into a capitalist-mutualist system and have something someday that resembles a mutualist meritocracy, but the very nature of such a phenomena would be miraculous and improbable, if not impossible.

<p>The very form of governance is corporate.

<p>As it stands, policies have largely been created to disproportionately benefit giant corporations and the capitalist overlords which fashion them from the manipulated whims of the consumer, and the state is complicit in this crime, by operating as the violent enforcer of the totalitarian whim of these overlords.

<p>We sell our labor power for a period of time where the products of activity and the production process are not controlled by us, and don&#39;t belong to us.  We view others as competitors in the labor market, and our connections between people through our productive activity becomes obscured.   And we must match ourselves to the demands of the labor market, instead of pursuing our interests.   </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t control how long to work,  they don&#39;t control how to work,  they don&#39;t control how fast to work, in many places they don&#39;t control when to use the bathroom or when to eat. They don&#39;t have a say about who they work with.  The workers don&#39;t control the means of the productions. </p>

<p>Well this is obviously false, and trivially so.  Societies have radically changed  due to  natural disasters, for example.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is always a building up towards any long lasting, dramatic change in any society.</p>

<p>This is a little bit of a different claim. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please explain how government is corporate in nature and why that means you can&#39;t use the government to police the market. I want to hear this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all most of the government functions are done by institutions that are classified as government corporations.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government corporation model has been utilized by the federal government for over a 
century. Today’s government corporations cover the spectrum in size and function from large, 
well-known entities, such as the U.S. Postal Service and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, to small, low-visibility corporate bodies, such as the Federal Financing Bank in the 
Department of the Treasury and Federal Prison Industries in the Department of Justice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30365.pdf">https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30365.pdf</a></p>

<p>Secondly, corporations... or more accurate associations of corporations control the politicians, and write the legislation. </p>

<p>Thirdly, the gatekeepers to  government entry  are corporate and controlled by corporations. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be misunderstood,  because the state is moment of class struggle, and we can certainly have victories through it,  it just means that the battle field is disadvantageous.  It is certainly the case that one can still win a few battles...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In no way shape or form would the American people ever be faced with combating the U.S. military.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?   The legal prohibitions on utilizing military domestically have continuously been eroded.   Moreover, history if filled military dictatorships... so other than an ideological commitment to American exceptionalism, I see no reason why the military won&#39;t be used domestically. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We sell our labor power for a period of time where the products of activity and the production process are not controlled by us, and don&#39;t belong to us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people do this, but nothing about Capitalism as a system makes it compulsory. This fact is not <em>systemic</em> to capitalism. It is how people choose to use Capitalism which results in this behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We view others as competitors in the labor market, and our connections between people through our productive activity becomes obscured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this related to &quot;it is a system that alienates us from our own activity and from each other&quot;. People naturally compete with each other and stratify themselves along social hierarchies. Those hierarchies have benefits and responsibilities for leaders and followers, and this is ingrained in the human psyche instinctually as a result of the conditions of our evolution. Competition is not inherently bad, unfettered and unrestricted competition is bad. If the objective of competition is to place those best suited for their roles in those roles, then competition is an efficient tool for simultaneously allocating labor whilst providing a vehicle for one to determine their own position within society&#39;s economy. Competition as a <em>system</em> does not deprive one of determining their own position in an economy, it sets conditions for labor and demands that applicants meet them. The problem with how humans utilize competition and social stratification is in the <strong>responsibilities</strong> of leadership. From our leaders we demand increased responsibility and accountability, and proportionate compensation for their position in the hierarchy. When our leaders are not responsible, are not held accountable, and are compensated disproportionately to what they produce, we become upset, because these natural principles are being violated, i.e. there is an injustice occurring. This is a human flaw. It is not <em>endemic</em> to Capitalism as a system, it is prevalent among Capitalist societies not because it is necessary, but because people tolerate it. This is a cultural problem, and can be solved with various tools, including but not limited to government intervention, boycott, protest, strike, and education etc. nothing requires this phenomena, it happens, because that is what humans are allowing to happen at this point in time. Capitalism didn&#39;t necessitate segregation and racism in the early 20th century, that was just what humans were deciding to do for some time. To put an end to it, we had to use all the tools I mentioned above. This is no different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we must match ourselves to the demands of the labor market, instead of pursuing our interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true, and the millenial generation is proving it to not be true. Just about anything is monetizable/marketable, you just need to figure out how to monetize/market what you do, and every day more tools and services are being created to do just that, because of innovations in technology. No conformation to the labor market is required, and in fact this is becoming far less frequent, as the creative producers of today are turning towards becoming independent owners of their own small businesses, with much success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t control how long to work, they don&#39;t control how to work, they don&#39;t control how fast to work, in many places they don&#39;t control when to use the bathroom or when to eat. They don&#39;t have a say about who they work with. The workers don&#39;t control the means of the productions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s nonsense, none of this is <em>endemic</em> to Capitalism, and nothing is stopping anyone from reforming how companies operate, in particular how labor is performed and how production is controlled. Everyday, more tools and resources are being created to allow people more opportunity and freedom to produce. The state of labor is not a permanent fixture, it is subject to change within the Capitalist system. People presently aren&#39;t dramatically reforming this, but that doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t/can&#39;t. In fact we already see how changes to traditional labor models in our Capitalist system are starting to change with the advent of new technologies (see Patreon, bitcoin, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well this is obviously false, and trivially so. Societies have radically changed due to natural disasters, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yes, if the sun exploded right now, it would create a lot of change, and if we underwent nuclear war, we&#39;d see change then as well.</p>

<p>I thought we were talking about change within the context of social movements, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a little bit of a different claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you see it that way. Maybe that&#39;s my fault for not making my claim clear, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been talking about the entire time, or at least trying to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all most of the government functions are done by institutions that are classified as government corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples? Are you referring to municipal corporations and chartered/registered organization like for profit and non-profit organizations? They&#39;re not all the same. True, legally, states and local governments are incorporated, but private organizations being incorporated is a relatively modern convention, especially human rights for corporations, and the corporate legal structure is by no means the same thing as a <em>capitalist</em> or <em>market</em> structure, it is a system of delegating rights to entities which traditionally stemmed from a monarch, but today originate from (in theory) the people. In short, the corporate legal structure of is not a capitalist system, it is a legal system which predates democracy and capitalism alike. Today&#39;s modern corporate structure, as we colloquially refer to it, is a convention of how private organizations operate within a market, but that is very different from the underlying fundamental legal principles from which all organization in society are based. To use an analogy, in this case, the egg did come before the chicken, and eggs are not exclusive to chickens. You are suggesting that because eggs are chicken in nature, we can&#39;t use eggs to bring about anything but chickens, but the egg predates the chicken and is not exclusive to it, so this is logically a false presumption, i.e. it is not valid, so the premise cannot be actually true, nor sound.</p>

<p>Secondly, corporations... or more accurate associations of corporations control the politicians, and write the legislation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the gatekeepers to government entry are corporate and controlled by corporations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be misunderstood, because the state is moment of class struggle, and we can certainly have victories through it, it just means that the battle field is disadvantageous. It is certainly the case that one can still win a few battles...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand your argument here, are you saying that because the government makes use of government owned enterprises, we can&#39;t use the government to make changes to our market economy? What is the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? The legal prohibitions on utilizing military domestically have continuously been eroded. Moreover, history if filled military dictatorships...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because as soon as a military organization turns on the American people, foreign governments will support the opposing military factions (of which there would be many). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so other than an ideological commitment to American exceptionalism, I see no reason why the military won&#39;t be used domestically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well not American exceptionalism, but Western exceptionalism is a tangible thing. For example, in America, we have the ability to freely spread information, i.e. we have the infrastructure to support this. We have a massive private media infrastructure, with vast access to internet across the country. We are not a struggling 2nd-3rd world country invisible to the rest of the world. Quite the opposite, <em>all eyes are on us</em>.</p>

<p>But, it is systemic.  It is historically so, with the forcible creation through dispossession of a mass of people through force. Think the enclosure acts in england, or the colonial policy in the US against the native population, and through legislation which forced people into labor. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital</a></p>

<p>And through systemic pressure of entering the labor market, because our very existence is mediated through the laborpower-money-commodity relation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People naturally compete with each other and stratify themselves along social hierarchies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well obviously human beings do this so it a mode enabled by our &#39;nature&#39; what ever that means, but it is only one mode of social arrangement, meaning it is not entailed by necessity. Rather it is a result of social and historical development.   And that social and historical development lead to a mode of production which obscures how we actually relate to one another.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those hierarchies have benefits and responsibilities for leaders and followers, and this is ingrained in the human psyche instinctually as a result of the conditions of our evolution. Competition is not inherently bad, unfettered and unrestricted competition is bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some hierarchies do, some don&#39;t.  History of human politics has been people taking the hierarchies given to them as necessary and with strong justification, only to find that they are neither necessary, nor justified.   Your claims are a literally rationalization for absolute monarchy, or the divine rule of kings, except a presupposition is imported that they are utilitarian.  You want to justify that claim?</p>

<p>Nor is competition a result of our evolution, other than in a trivial sense, that the evolution of the human species allows for them to construct competitive and hierarchical frameworks.  This misses the point, which is what is good for human beings, and what allows human beings to flourish.  Systems where their very existence is mediated through constant competition, and where competition structures more and more of our lives is not that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with how humans utilize competition and social stratification is in the responsibilities of leadership. From our leaders we demand increased responsibility and accountability, and proportionate compensation for their position in the hierarchy.

This is a human flaw. It is not endemic to Capitalism as a system, it is prevalent among Capitalist societies not because it is necessary, but because people tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not frame it as an injustice occurring because the whole history of capitalism has been the struggle of subordinating more and more of our time to the demands of the market, and people fighting against it.   We don&#39;t have limitations on the working day, because of the responsibility of our leaders, or their accountability, we have it because regular people struggled to win these victories, against their official governing institutions. Ditto for workplace protections, etc.  The narrative that you presented has nothing to do with the history of Capital, the class nature of society, and the class interests and composition of ruling institutions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a cultural problem, and can be solved with various tools, including but not limited to government intervention, boycott, protest, strike, and education etc. nothing requires this phenomena, it happens, because that is what humans are allowing to happen at this point in time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is on the right track, but this is literally the history of capitalism since its beginning.  It consisted of creating a mass of people who only have their labor power to sell in the market, this was done through violence. People resisted it.  Through legislation forcing people into the labor market, people resisted it, and once the class dynamic was well established, it has been the history of this struggle. That is capitalism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism didn&#39;t necessitate segregation and racism in the early 20th century, that was just what humans were deciding to do for some time. To put an end to it, we had to use all the tools I mentioned above. This is no different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We did not put an end to either racism or segregation, the mechanisms evolved, first of all. Secondly capital has no problem introducing division in order to splinter the working class and drive wages down. </p>

<p>For example, this was what was being done by creating and maintaining the ethnic conflict between the Irish and the English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And most important of all! Every industrial and commercial centre in England now possesses a working class divided into two hostile camps, English proletarians and Irish proletarians. The ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who lowers his standard of life. In relation to the Irish worker he regards himself as a member of the ruling nation and consequently he becomes a tool of the English aristocrats and capitalists against Ireland, thus strengthening their domination over himself. He cherishes religious, social, and national prejudices against the Irish worker. His attitude towards him is much the same as that of the “poor whites” to the Negroes in the former slave states of the U.S.A.. The Irishman pays him back with interest in his own money. He sees in the English worker both the accomplice and the stupid tool of the English rulers in Ireland.</p>

<p>This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short, by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes. This antagonism is the secret of the impotence of the English working class, despite its organisation. It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power. And the latter is quite aware of this.</p>

<p>Other than these things occurring in societies with free markets, what does this have to do with Capitalism? People do terrible things all the time, but they don&#39;t do them at the <em>behest</em> of Capitalism just because those people live in Capitalist societies. Nothing about Capitalism compelled colonial Americans to steal/trick natives out of their land. That&#39;s just what people did, because that is what they chose to do. Am I missing something? Do the concepts of private property and free markets demand taking land from native people?

<p>You have more opportunities now, than ever before in human history, to monetize anything you want to do outside of the traditional labor markets. If you live in the west, there is no reason to work in a factory for 60+ hours a week barely getting by if you don&#39;t want to.

<p>How do we actually relate to each other? Do we relate to each other by not caring how competent we are at fulfilling certain roles in society and holding hands in a circle singing how great we are for having transcended the need to achieve our very greatest potential? I don&#39;t see the point you&#39;re making. There&#39;s nothing wrong with aspiring to be the best you can be and expecting to be compensated for how good you are. You can either see competition with others as an opportunity to improve yourself or you can see it as an opportunity to destroy others. Capitalism as a system doesn&#39;t care which action <em>you decide</em>, it just lets you decide, and we have laws and government as tools to make sure people are encouraged to better themselves instead of destroy others. I&#39;d argue we need more intervention to this effect, because human beings tend to destroy others when they are incompetent and incapable of self improvement (i.e. I can&#39;t climb up the ladder so I&#39;ll have to pull someone else down). Capitalism has nothing to do with this affair, it&#39;s in the realm of the human condition, which as I stated, we have tools for addressing. The problem of the west is its crisis of values, and the government&#39;s relinquishing responsibility for legally upholding them. We made the mistake of removing Christianity&#39;s presence from society without replacing its values. We have less bigotry, hatred, violence, and institutional prejudice now than we have ever before, but we have insane amounts of inequality, greed, gluttony etc. all because instead of abhorring these things, we&#39;ve created a society that values them. That&#39;s not <em>Capitalism&#39;s</em> fault as a system, it is man&#39;s fault.</p>

<p>Sure, easy. These hierarchies are necessary because some people work harder than others, are more productive/smarter or just all around better than others, and they should be able to achieve their greatest potential, and be incentive for doing so, instead of discouraged.</p>

<p>There is no &#39;The West&#39;. Nor are the crisis due to bad morals, or ethics or whatever.

<p>I agree that&#39;s a better way to live and Capitalism doesn&#39;t stop you from doing that, individual people that run companies in such a way that demands labor to be performed on their terms strictly is what stops that, but a lot of companies are adopting more fluid work environments, which allow people to work more &quot;on their terms&quot;. A lot of other Capitalist countries in Europe resemble this more, but that is because their cultures are more relaxed, which I would say is better, but it has zero to do with Capitalism.</p>

<p>I agree, but that is the result of the culture we create, one that is abusive, because we let people with power abuse us, because we identify as victims of a system instead of standing up to our oppressors. This is not a Capitalist problem, it is a crisis of values and of consciousness. The only thing stopping humanity from stepping out from this oppression is itself and the choices people make.

<p>I am sorry, but what values??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of helping others, of valuing restraint, being humble, having compassion, giving back to the community when you have success, glorifying what is good and doing works for the world, <em>The Gospel of Wealth</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well we created a system that produces them, that markets it to us, and that sells it to us, all because pursuit of this leads to capital expansion... which is an inherent tendency of the system, economic expansion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one sells what people won&#39;t buy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some working harder than others does not entail nor justify a hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does. What are you talking about? If you <strong>contribute more</strong> you should <strong>get more</strong>. It is absolutely justification for a hierarchy. Someone who slaves away contributing to society, spending their life in service to others, should be compensated for doing so. You should want people to contribute to society and progress humanity forward. This is what has made Western society capable of producing so much valuable stuff for people to consume. Without this mentality, you absolutely would not be able to have this conversation right now. Great accomplishments are built on the backs of hard workers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being more smart does not mean more productive. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does if you use your intelligence to produce more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor does being smart or more productive, by itself justify a hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does. A fair, just, hierarchy, which gives people the fruits of their merits, but a hierarchy nonetheless. I&#39;m not saying I think we should have billionaires. That&#39;s disgusting excess, but someone that contributes to society should get more from society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one is better than another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s objectively false. If you ever are shipwrecked at sea, and there is someone adept at fishing among you, that person will better survive. Might even save you from cannibalizing each other. People are not equal in an economic sense of what they are capable of producing. I am not saying that says anything about their inherent worth as human beings. It doesn&#39;t. Absolutely not. We are all equal in the law, both man made and natural.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, so instead all of those smart people that want and can be good teachers, that leave the profession because of shitty pay and working conditions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <strong>public</strong> education systems, that are not impacted by <em>Capitalist</em> <strong>market</strong> conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ditto for computer programmers, and ditto for doctors, and nurses,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All compensated greatly in America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, their interests, and their development is stunted by the wage-form, and the wage-form needs to be abolished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only teachers were stunted in their compensation, and that&#39;s because they&#39;re public employees.</p>

<p>However, I agree that everyone should be adequately compensated, but I don&#39;t think that Marxism is the answer.</p>

<p>The very category of &#39;profit&#39; is &#39;bad&#39;.  It entails that surplus value is being extracted... it means people are working longer than they need to in order to have social reproduction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But a look at five decades’ worth of government wage data suggests that the better question might be, why should now be any different?

<blockquote>
<p>How exactly does Capitalism obscure this? Are you not allowed to be social because you make money through working?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capitalism does this, because human relations appear as relations between things.   Instead of me fulfilling your need through my music, thereby affirming your individuality, and you mine, what appears is money being used to exchange for a commodity. </p>

<p>If you are interested in a an exposition of this, read Marx&#39;s work on estranged labour in the 1844 Philosophical and Economic Manuscripts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and size. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. The devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things. Labor produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity – and this at the same rate at which it produces commodities in general.</p>

<p>This fact expresses merely that the object which labor produces – labor’s product – confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labor is labor which has been embodied in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labor. Labor’s realization is its objectification. Under these economic conditions this realization of labor appears as loss of realization for the workers[18]; objectification as loss of the object and bondage to it; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree that&#39;s a better way to live and Capitalism doesn&#39;t stop you from doing that...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has everything to do with capitalism.  Decreases in working hours, and more autonomy are a direct result of workers struggling. They are a result of class struggle.  Capitalism is the history this struggle.   But like you, yourself admitted, working hours continue to increase.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They can and often are the same thing.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are not.  A market price you can earn is not the value of what you bring.   In fact the object is to decrease that price as much as possible, while extracting as much value as possible.  Labor is a cost to business that decreases profits. The incentive is to minimize costs... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People ... economically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only are incentives and rewards systemic, but economic systems directly shape our subjectivity.  What we are as subjects is altered.  Hence why the new subject sees itself as an entrepreneur  of the self.   This are not just &#39;natural&#39; expressions of the human condition, or whatever.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not a Capitalist problem, it is a crisis of values and of consciousness. The only thing stopping humanity from stepping out from this oppression is itself and the choices people make. We are all choosing to be complicit in this corrupt, evil, oligarchical society by not standing up to it. Marxism is not the answer, Marxism is how you sign over the last vestige of power you have to those very oligarchs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I would say we are in a broad agreement that this is not a capitalist problem, however, capitalism is just an expression of this problem that arose historically, and it is what is the problem for us. </p>

<p>Concerning Marxism, I agree that it is not an answer, but that is because Marxism is not a system to be imposed, or a state of society to be worked towards.  Marxism, is an analytic framework for capitalism, but while regular economics has as its object to understand capitalism better so that it can be managed more effectively and it&#39;s crisis mitigated, Marxism has as its object the transcendence of capitalism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you contribute more you should get more. It is absolutely justification for a hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well you should get as much as you want or at least enough to meet one&#39;s needs, but this is not a hierarchy in the sense of social power.  You should certainly not have a bigger say in decisions that effect all just because you &#39;contribute&#39; more. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone who slaves away contributing to society, spending their life in service to others, should be compensated for doing so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one should slave away, and more importantly there is no reason to slave away, at this point, other than capitalist accumulation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what has made Western society capable of producing so much valuable stuff for people to consume.</p>

<p>Really, I thought it was public investment in infrastructure, coupled with public research and development that is given to corporations. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A fair, just, hierarchy, which gives people the fruits of their merits, but a hierarchy nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, just being smart or more productive does entail a hierarchy in a sense of having more authority, or a bigger say in the decisions that effect all. </p>

<p>More importantly, people don&#39;t get the &#39;fruits of their merits&#39; in capitalism.  They get a wage, which a market price for labor power in a particular, historical and geographical market. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ever are shipwrecked at sea, and there is someone adept at fishing among you, that person will better survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings a whole set of presuppositions, and is just a convoluted way of saying those that have food, eat.  Yeah, but survival is a team effort.  While fishing is important, so is water, and those that can capture it or figure out a way to boil water, and condense it, or recycle their piss or whatever, increase the chances of survival, as  does the person that knows how to build, and provides shade while our fisherman battles the sea, and so on.  The fisherman is not better than the builder, etc, and society is not reducible to one person. Each person a product of a historical development and member of a social organism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are not equal in an economic sense of what they are capable of producing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, this is true in a trivial sense, what is not entailed is that because of this people should have more social power, own more resources, or extract surplus value from those who do not own resources, except their labor power. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying that says anything about their inherent worth as human beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is encouraging, but I claim that capitalist economic relations are making our inherent value as human beings obsolete, and replacing it with internalized market relations.  And our worth as human beings won&#39;t be expressed fully as long as the capitalist mode of productions organizes us socially.  It is making the old Kantian notions of human beings as ends in-themselves obsolete, and replaced with every human being is a means to end for another. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In public education systems...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very existence of a public education system is a result of market pressures.  It was a way that corporations get a trained and disciplined labor force, while the costs are socialized.  Nor is it true that they are not impacted by capitalist market relations now, as the historical barriers of entry into teaching have been under  corporate assault, with private schemes created to fulfill the crisis.  </p>

<p>The very category of &#39;profit&#39; is &#39;bad&#39;. It entails that surplus value is being extracted... it means people are working longer than they need to in order to have social reproduction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Profits can be used in a wide variety of ways, including improving the lives of employees through benefits (like stock options, leveraged health insurance plans), their communities, developing environmentally friendly technologies etc. profits are only as bad as companies allocate them, but some level of profit is necessary in the abstract sense, for industry to grow and evolve. You can&#39;t equally distribute revenue to your employees, customers, share holders, partners, parent companies etc. and still ensure the health and evolution of an economic organization unless all those parties agree to all invest back into the company to a certain extent, which you can&#39;t guarantee. Profit is as bad as the people that allocate them to economic activities. Again, a consequence of human condition, <em>not</em> <strong>capitalism</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, American corporations practically own whole countries. It is just that actual land ownership was not seen as profitable... even that is changing now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s certainly not the case, these withdrawals were in large part the result of a handful of important factors, none of which had anything to do with the profitability of holding onto colonies. At play were the rise of nationalism in Africa, geopolitical conflict in the competition between Communist and Capitalist ideologies, the destruction of domestic European economies during World War II, and brokered negotiations and political influence from the U.S.&#39;s foreign policy of enabling self determination among colonized nations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read what you just wrote. If workers productivity continues to increase, why do you think we need to work more? The object is to work less, no?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People <strong>are</strong> working less, and it was enabled by the Capitalist system&#39;s allocation of resources towards developing <strong>industry</strong> to create <strong>more</strong> consumer goods with <strong>less</strong> labor-goods that prior to this allocation <strong>did not exist in sufficient quantities to be distributed with even the most socialist policies you could imagine in effect</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of me fulfilling your need through my music, thereby affirming your individuality, and you mine, what appears is money being used to exchange for a commodity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s absurd, Capitalism doesn&#39;t force people to commodify music, it requires people to commodify music <strong>if</strong> those people want their economic existence to be justified by their music playing. No one is forcing you to commodify your music. Not a single soul, not a single aspect of Capitalism. What Capitalism <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> allow people to do, is live their lives as unambitiously as the human mind can conceive, and still live the same quality of life as a doctor that works 90 hours a week saving lives. You seem like a smart person, so it might be hard for you to conceive, but there are plenty of people that would do <strong>nothing</strong> to contribute to society if they were supported comfortably without having to produce economically. Honestly that&#39;s fine, but what I am not okay with is people that feel compelled to contribute not being compensated. Society should encourage productive activity, contribution to the community. It&#39;s better for society&#39;s progress and evolution. We can subsidize the eaters, I&#39;m actually okay with that. No one should be faced with the horror that is homelessness and abject poverty. That is no more just than Communism.</p>

<p>I made the claim that people are <strong>not</strong> compensated adequately for what they produce, but you&#39;re arguing that this is the fault of our Capitalist system. I am arguing that this is an endemic to the human condition, the consequence of the choices made by people, which would result in no better an outcome in any other system (far worse actually).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has everything to do with capitalism. Decreases in working hours, and more autonomy are a direct result of workers struggling. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are the result of industrialization creating economies productive enough to decrease working hours and still produce enough wealth to grow economies rapidly, as well as social movements made to ensure that people benefit from these developments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But like you, yourself admitted, working hours continue to increase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they&#39;re decreasing overall in the west. I will be the first to concede that the U.S. is behind the times in this regard, but that is because Americans are not demanding better working hours. In general our government is corrupted immensely by corporations that make policies for their benefit, because our people do not understand how to use politics to benefit themselves. Our voting population is stupid to the point of self detriment. It is absolutely possible to live in a Capitalist society and also have less working hours, but you&#39;re not going to achieve that end without political action, which is virtually absent in American society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact the object is to decrease that price as much as possible, while extracting as much value as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not. Any responsible entrepreneur will take care of their people. Look at Costco as an example. It pays its career employees upwards of $22.00/hr to do rote, mundane tasks, more than double what almost any other company will pay, and they have some of the best retail centers in the world, with exceptional service, streamlined logistics, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Labor is a cost to business that decreases profits. The incentive is to minimize costs...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The incentive is to limit costs if leaders and followers in a private corporation are both poor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not only are incentives and rewards systemic, but economic systems directly shape our subjectivity. What we are as subjects is altered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every system alters the subject, and you imply that this is a bad thing, but I&#39;d argue it is a good thing. Human beings are inherently driven by impulsive, biologically driven instincts to survive and reduce energy exertion. Values have to be learned, otherwise, survival is the only innate value. The value that Capitalism instills in its subjects is the value of self determination. You have the locus of control in your life and must determine your own fate. Other institutions in society are tasked with guiding how that value is upheld. We set restrictions on behavior and create ethical values to design humanity in a divine image of how we think the world ought to be. Humanity&#39;s modern problem is it has forgotten to ask the question of what the meaning to being is. We don&#39;t care. We&#39;ve stripped away the underlying values which were made to curate a better humanity for tomorrow, and replaced them with the victim mentality, identity politics, the complete absence of self esteem, and other damaging perspectives which only enable an infantile psychology, which these very corporations are making use of to manipulate this coming generation, through the education system (primary education is the biggest culprit, but plenty of universities in blue states are over saturated with these schools of thought) into supporting a more blatantly socialist, Marxist society. That Marxist society will be the ultimate culmination of everything humanity has achieved through over-inflated corporations, regulatory capture, and hegemonic governments. To the victors shall go the spoils, and the Marxist overlords will be synonymous with the oligarchy which commands humanity today. Everything up until that point is smoke and mirrors to deflect from the shadowy struggle of these factions vying for domination in society today. What do you think Trump is? He&#39;s just the leader of his own faction, vying for his own clan&#39;s place in the human dominion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We are our own problem. We, human beings, are inherently flawed. Before we began sedentary living, we did not know war, or starvation, or strife as we do today. There is nothing &quot;natural&quot; about what we do as a civilization. Millions of years of evolution did not culminate in the cultivating of grains and permanent settlement. The purpose of our systems, institutions, values, etc. is to reconcile <em>the human condition</em> which is immovably based on the fundamental premise of survival at its core, and the extensions of that imperative through the human psyche such as accumulation of material wealth and physical security etc. The objective of survival is not inherently bad, it&#39;s necessary, but it still has consequences for how our society manifests, whether it is Capitalist, Socialist (doesn&#39;t even make sense these two things are not mutually exclusive, all economies are mixed) or whatever system we implore. The strength of Capitalism is its reward for contribution to the human economy, which is a key mechanism for humanity&#39;s continued survival, progress, and evolution as a species. The failure of humanity to check the unchecked power of the corporation is a human failure of the masses, a series of poor choices on a large scale by the many &quot;small folk&quot; of the world. It is we, humanity, that has failed, not Capitalism. Capitalism did what it was designed to do, to progress humanity forward by incentivizing continued development of the technological and productive mechanisms of society. It is humanity and its choices that has resulted in the abusive and in many places, outright horrifying situation we find ourselves in as a civilization. The answer is quite simple, no man is an island, and no company can produce without employees. We need to demand better economic quality of life. As I stated before, power is wherever people believe it is. When people stop working, and the machine grinds to a halt, all the violence in the world will be incapable of saving the elite.</p>

<p>I agree with that, but the only thing that buys political power in this country (speaking of America) is the ability to advertise and thus manipulate people into giving their social power to corrupted politicians, but that isn&#39;t a power necessitated by Capitalism.

<p>It&#39;s not. Much of that just went to line the pockets of Capitalists for promises not kept, or to prop up high cost industries that investors were afraid of getting involved in (the internet).

<p>In terms of abstract legal theory, sure there is a difference between a corporation granted by the monarch, vs a republican state form that is representative, I don&#39;t deny this.

<p>Well I mean if the eggs are &quot;by nature chicken&#39;, then chickens will come out of them.   Historically only chickens came out them, and we can predict with good predictive power that only chickens will come out of them... it is safe to say that only chickens will come out. </p>

<p>No, you&#39;ve gotten your logic wrong, see, corporations predate private corporations.

<p>The important point is that the 17th century Virginia Company isn&#39;t the government of America. The Virginia Company <strong>was</strong> a private corporation. That&#39;s irrelevant, though, because incorporation predates private corporation, and the creation of The Republic was not that of the creation of a private corporation, but the independent declaration of a new sovereignty within which states were incorporated as they have been for hundreds if not nearly a thousand years in English law.

<p>But these state owner enterprises and state insured corporations have nothing to do with the fundamental political tools by which citizens can affect political change democratically. Those tools still exist and are unimpeded by the U.S. postal service&#39;s existence.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The state-form that was arising out of needs of a Feudal society, is not the same state-form that arises out of the needs of a capitalist society.</p>

<p>Okay sure, government changes over time in its essential functions as people change. Fundamentally the state is the same as it was on the day it was created, although we have seen some important, IMO detrimental changes, like for example the allocation of war declaration to the executive branch (seems as though it is about to officially be given to the president by congress). Overall the changes are small, though, and the basic political tools that have always existed still exist, i.e. the ability of the people to police the market hasn&#39;t changed, people just don&#39;t make use of this tool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next sentence is a claim that it is a tool. Obviously tools have a purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What purpose does the Swiss army knife have? Its purpose is to be a versatile tool to suit various needs, and is updated and modified every year to stay relevant to the needs of the people that buy it. Government is precisely that, except it has come to suit the needs of the people that <strong>literally</strong> buy it, with capital, instead of the needs of people that buy it with the capital of their suffrage. This is a consequence of effective, widespread manipulation of an unintelligent, uneducated, uninformed, ignorant, easily manipulated mass population.</p>

<p><em>Not</em> <strong>Capitalism</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not just that it is a tool used against the population. Rather it is a toolbox, that contains many tools, created for the corporate form to expand, and increase its hegemony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not created for the corporate form to expand and increase its hegemony, but that is how it was used, yes. It was created as a tool for affecting political change. Corporations took over the tool and began using it to affect political change in the form of financial change-in their favor. All the same, the tool remains as it was, and in fact has come to encompass a wider stretch of the population, yet we still don&#39;t efficaciously make use of it. The fault of stupidity and nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but this does not entail that the military does not fulfill its function and goals, as clearly it does, even with factions and all. </p>

<p>Separate goals fulfilled by separate people within the complex power network that is the American elite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it can turn against the American people, factions and all, and impose its will, factions and all</p>

<p>Incredibly unlikely. Everyone wants the biggest piece of the pie, and chaos is the best time to eat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... mind you I think this was already done. The military and industrial nexus pretty much runs the place as it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wherever people believe power comes from is where it rests. For a majority of people this is money. I&#39;d say that stands even in the upper echelons of society, so chances are the military doesn&#39;t &quot;run the place&quot; but rather, the corporations building military technology for the military, and whoever has them bought.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it did, and it also isn&#39;t necessary, it just needs to be free <em>enough</em> to communicate abuse with the rest of the world. To this extent it is free.</p>

<p>Very true, but that doesn&#39;t mean that a violent culling of an American revolution or dissident movement wouldn&#39;t be heard by the rest of the world. That would be virtually impossible, at least at this time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But, I am not using the corporate legal structure of the government, I am using the way organizations exist in the concrete and act.   The fact that what you want to do is equivocate legal fictions, with material relations is a faulty move on your part.  My claim is that organizations that are oriented towards creating profit through market mechanisms,  shaped the government, that many government organizations, are literally organizations that pursue profits through market mechanisms,  and that this leads to an imbalance where the institutions themselves are not neutral. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The important point is that the 17th century Virginia Company isn&#39;t the government of America. The Virginia Company was a private corporation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not making the claim that the US government has a legal designation of a private corporation.  I am making a claim that the organizations like the Virginia Company governed in a particular way, and that these functions, these concrete processes, are imported into the functions of the state. </p>

<p>Moreover the main point of our disagreement, seems to me that you think our problems stem from influence of the private corporation on government policy. My claim is that the problems predates the changes in legal standing from the end of the 19th century, and that the organizational form that is the problem is not only emulated by the government, but actively creates it and shapes it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Republic was not that of the creation of a private corporation,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reiterate the point, again, it is not my position that the US government has a legal standing of a private corporation, you can have that argument with sovereign citizen types, not with me. </p>

<p>but the independent declaration of a new sovereignty within which states were incorporated as they have been for hundreds if not nearly a thousand years in English law.</p>

<p>Again, the problem are organizations which generate profit through through the market.  It is those corporations that are under discussion.  And it is the needs of those entities, that shaped the actual governing institutions, to meet their own needs.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure I can concede that corporations have influence on the government. Of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is what is meant by influence that we disagree on.   My claim is that the very institutions are shaped by the needs of of corporations, and exist to further that form, and that it is this that makes them not neutral, as tools. Not that they pay politicians to vote their way or pass legislation or whatever. I mean all these things are true, I don&#39;t disagree that they do indeed do that.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But these state owner enterprises and state insured corporations have nothing to do with the fundamental political tools by which citizens can affect political change democratically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is simply false, as most of political thinking since the 1920&#39;s, and the institutions that have been created has all been about suppressing the democratic input and capability for democratically set policy.   It was through people like Lippmann that the public was cast us incapable of making sound decisions, and that it needs to be goaded or manipulated into supporting positions that an &#39;elite&#39; class makes, and that the function of the the state is to CREATE MARKETS.  These strands came from Speier  and crystallized in the network of institutions like the RAND corporation for &#39;defense&#39; (see Bessner&#39;s work on this), it was echoed in the Trilateral Commissions work, The Crisis of Democracy, which identified the problems of the 60&#39;s as an EXCESS of democracy. Finally it brings us fool circle to the beginning of this thread, which is the creation of the OSS, and after it the CIA.. The organization is rooted in the financial sector and wall-street, since its beginning, and it literally existed to suppress political movement that threatened the capitalist order, whether domestically or abroad. </p>

<p>So in fact, the history of the 20th century is the creation of institutions which protect corporate hegemony, and suppress democratic movements that challenge it - public institutions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally the state is the same as it was on the day it was created,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well look, we can find similarities between any things we compare, and we can find differences as well, so yes, in some sense state fulfills the same role.  But that role can evolve through time in such a manner that it becomes radically different from where we started, there is always a unity in difference... I suppose it is the difference of emphasis on this point between us. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>IMO detrimental changes, like for example the allocation of war declaration to the executive branch (seems as though it is about to officially be given to the president by congress).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I this is a catastrophic change, I agree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What purpose does the Swiss army knife have? Its purpose is to be a versatile tool to suit various needs, and is updated and modified every year to stay relevant to the needs of the people that buy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, it is used to cut, to open bottles, to eat with.  Each tool in the handset  has a specific function it was designed for.  You don&#39;t water a garden with a hammer.    And government is like that, it enforces property rights, creates an environment for corporations to expand, works with specific corporations to meet goals, provides for education of the labor force, until that can be handed over to market mechanism. It pursues a foreign policy in which the corporate forms expands, etc.   This is the concrete reality of  the state.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a consequence of effective, widespread manipulation of an unintelligent, uneducated, uninformed, ignorant, easily manipulated mass population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that there is widespread manipulation, but I don&#39;t think it is easily done.  I think the techniques have to be continuously improved, because people begin to reject them. Which brings to the point of that people are not unintelligent; misinformed, sure! But even through these massive campaigns, and through political institutions built to suppress their participation, regular people fought for and won victories, that really improved our society.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not Capitalism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes capitalism!  What is the history of the 20th century, other than amplification of the base, and the vulgar and creation of loops that cycle this stuff back to us, all as a result of  neoliberal commitment.  The befuddlement of regular people is by design and due to application of marketization. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was not created for the corporate form to expand and increase its hegemony</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a matter of the historical record. The modern state was created to codify a set of rules that makes the expansion of capital possible.   Instead of having a large territory be governed by one corporation, like lets say the East India Company, a framework had to be developed where multiple organizations of this type could co-exist over the same territory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fault of stupidity and nothing more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, we are going to pretend that movements that arose historically that challenged this, were not actively suppressed through the state apparatus. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Separate goals fulfilled by separate people within the complex power network that is the American elite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but there are obviously unitary principles and goals, whether that be something like pursuit of profit, or commitments towards preserving class rule. It does not follow from this that they don&#39;t turn against the American people.  Especially once the class nature of these organizations is recognized. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wherever people believe power comes from is where it rests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I don&#39;t know, obviously property relations and power to enforce them are not a matter of belief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d say that stands even in the upper echelons of society, so chances are the military doesn&#39;t &quot;run the place&quot; but rather, the corporations building military technology for the military, and whoever has them bought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have private contractors doing the fighting, private contractors providing logistics, private contractors providing intelligence and this vast force is mobilized on behalf of corporate hegemony. This is what the military is in the concrete. Moreover, military personal are on boards of directors of corporations, further doing away with meaningful distinctions. And yes, this network, of private and public institutions runs the place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t say it did, and it also isn&#39;t necessary, it just needs to be free enough to communicate abuse with the rest of the world. To this extent it is free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I agree that it is a necessary condition it is not sufficient.  Not only does one need the capability to yell out the window, one needs to capability to hear the scream, and act from it.   A system that attacks both nodes can&#39;t be characterized as free. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very true, but that doesn&#39;t mean that a violent culling of an American revolution or dissident movement wouldn&#39;t be heard by the rest of the world. That would be virtually impossible, at least at this time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not it&#39;s possible to suppress information of this scope is, I think not important. I guess I am more cynical here. Even if this information was available it would not matter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing can ever be absolutely free, but within the context of this discussion we can establish that these platforms are free enough for the purpose of this argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not advocating for things to be absolutely free.  We just disagree on whether or not technical means of sharing information that bypass methods of suppression is a sufficient condition to call means of information free. </p>

<p>So in fact, the history of the 20th century is the creation of institutions which protect corporate hegemony, and suppress democratic movements that challenge it - public institutions!</p>

<p>Same with all this. Fascinating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it is used to cut, to open bottles, to eat with. Each tool in the handset has a specific function it was designed for. You don&#39;t water a garden with a hammer. And government is like that, it enforces property rights, creates an environment for corporations to expand, works with specific corporations to meet goals, provides for education of the labor force, until that can be handed over to market mechanism. It pursues a foreign policy in which the corporate forms expands, etc. This is the concrete reality of the state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t deny that these are things the state does, but I still don&#39;t agree that this is a necessary function of the state, but rather the manner in which it is used, by corporations which make use of it for their own gain. Even if this is how government has always been used, it is still an efficacious tool for democratic movements and political change, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll learn more about the details of how that has been challenged when I read some of the material requested above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh yes capitalism! What is the history of the 20th century, other than amplification of the base, and the vulgar and creation of loops that cycle this stuff back to us, all as a result of neoliberal commitment. The befuddlement of regular people is by design and due to application of marketization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d maintain the actions of Capitalists, sure, but I&#39;d argue these are not necessary consequences of Capitalism, but rather what people have chosen to do with Capitalism historically. Without any government at all, and just Capitalism, you&#39;d have a hell hole, wild west wasteland. My argument is merely that Capitalism as a system does not necessitate these things. Fundamentally these are consequences of human actions and decisions, which have occured within a Capitalist system, merely because Capitalism allows for these behaviors, and yes, perhaps in some sense, in the absence of certain roles of the state, rewards these behaviors, but it is the human that is perceiving reward and value from the material gains permitted by Capitalism. The system itself demands nothing. Perhaps it&#39;s just a semantic difference, but I think it is an important distinction for deciding how to deal with Capitalism, as I concede it presents problems given the human condition, which need to be addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right, we are going to pretend that movements that arose historically that challenged this, were not actively suppressed through the state apparatus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I&#39;ve seen this happen even in contemporary history. Wasn&#39;t trying to deny that, but I can see how it came across that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but there are obviously unitary principles and goals, whether that be something like pursuit of profit, or commitments towards preserving class rule. It does not follow from this that they don&#39;t turn against the American people. Especially once the class nature of these organizations is recognized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose but there&#39;s always ways that even elitists can divide themselves into sub-classes and vie for dominance even among themselves. I think that mentality must be pervasive, or they wouldn&#39;t be in the positions of power they are in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I don&#39;t know, obviously property relations and <strong>power</strong> to enforce them are not a matter of belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Operative word there being power. The most fundamental power is capacity for violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have private contractors doing the fighting, private contractors providing logistics, private contractors providing intelligence and this vast force is mobilized on behalf of corporate hegemony. This is what the military is in the concrete. Moreover, military personal are on boards of directors of corporations, further doing away with meaningful distinctions. And yes, this network, of private and public institutions runs the place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an important distinction that implies something entirely other than &quot;the military&quot;. Who has controlling interest in those military contractors?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I agree that it is a necessary condition it is not sufficient. Not only does one need the capability to yell out the window, one needs to capability to hear the scream, and act from it. A system that attacks both nodes can&#39;t be characterized as free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, I guess we&#39;re really just arguing over what we think is most probable. If the American people were turned on by the government, would the people be capable of alerting the wider global audience? I think yes, and for our purposes in this discussion, I&#39;d say that makes our communication infrastructure &quot;free enough&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not it&#39;s possible to suppress information of this scope is, I think not important. I guess I am more cynical here. Even if this information was available it would not matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;re right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not advocating for things to be absolutely free. We just disagree on whether or not technical means of sharing information that bypass methods of suppression is a sufficient condition to call means of information free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re even arguing about that anymore at this point, we can both sufficiently say it isn&#39;t in the general sense.</p>

<p>Great conversation, thanks for the information, and please feel free to provide any other content you think I should look into to further understand your perspective. I&#39;ll give it a look! </p>

<p>Sure, the historical beginnings of this are with the Lippmann Colloquium that met before WWII broke out, where a new kind of liberalism, and political strategy was discussed.  For a good overview over the meeting this is the work to consult. </p>

<p>After the War these groups got together and organized the Mont Pelerin society, and begin implementing neoliberal political projects. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society</a></p>

<p>Philip Mirowski is the scholar to go to in order to get a good account of how this functions.  </p>

<p>Here you will find how regular people were transformed from rational agents in neoclassical economic theory, to irrational agents that are ultimately epistemically flawed subjects, and the market is transformed from an allocation device to an epistemic agent. </p>

<p>Well Bassner&#39;s work was already referenced, but this is a good book, that provides an overview. </p>

<p>On state repression of democratic movements, start with the first red scare.  Howard Zinn&#39;s book on history is still the best all around account of this subject. </p>

<p>To see what I am arguing, it can be done through a particular state function, like policing.  This is a good book that provides a history and function of policing, (it might surprise you) and advocates for its end. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Policing-Alex-S-Vitale/dp/1784782890">https://www.amazon.com/End-Policing-Alex-S-Vitale/dp/1784782890</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The state does not have a necessary function, other than to mitigate the problems  of class relations, and to expand the processes of capital accumulation.  I am in total agreement that it can be used and political victories won.  Obviously, for example, a limit on the working day is political victory,  and the state was used to achieve it.  But it was the underlying struggle, and militancy that translated into a state victory.  As soon as that militancy dissipated, the working day was under attack.  If the state was a neutral instrument, this would not matter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d maintain the actions of Capitalists, sure, but I&#39;d argue these are not necessary consequences of Capitalism, but rather what people have chosen to do with Capitalism historically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a consequence of pursuing most profit, and engineering a landscape where most profit is generated.  This is an internal drive to capital accumulation.   So if the object is maximum economic growth, then the object is going to be individual purchasing units, purchasing the most stuff.  This has been well documented by sociologists, and commented on by philosophers and political theorists.  It entails an apparatus that cultivates desire, instead rational contemplation, or spiritual and ethical values.   If you don&#39;t have this type of subjectivity... then people by just what they need in a very narrow since, and you end up with a crisis of overproduction.   Obviously a population entertained by commodity consumption in the form of the base. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally these are consequences of human actions and decisions, which have occured within a Capitalist system, merely because Capitalism allows for these behaviors, and yes, perhaps in some sense, in the absence of certain roles of the state, rewards these behaviors, but it is the human that is perceiving reward and value from the material gains permitted by Capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I fundamentally agree, that ultimately capitalism is just a generalized system of human relations.  It is just that those relations don&#39;t appear to us as such, they appear as things and forces outside of our control... and they are. They push us to exist in a certain manner, independent of our will.  It structures our lives, and we fill those structures. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operative word there being power. The most fundamental power is capacity for violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a way we all have a capacity for violence, but that does not bend another will to your own.  Power does that, even with absence of violence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an important distinction that implies something entirely other than &quot;the military&quot;. Who has controlling interest in those military contractors?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the military in the concrete.   I don&#39;t know what you mean by controlling interest.  If the contractor is private corporation, then it would be the board of directors, that is attempting to keep shareholders happy. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>not to argue, but I encourage you, look around. I would contend: this isn&#39;t so much a Christian thing as it is a person thing, a layman thing. </p>

<p>I mean, really, think of the common person. Does he truly investigate, does he truly substantiate anything he believes? Of course he doesn&#39;t. He just happens to believe a limited selection of well-researched things about the universe by coincidence, because those are the things that are normal and socially acceptable for him to believe. Just the same, in many cases, he also believes foolish and inaccurate things. These beliefs are not produced by well-reasoned and careful approach; they are produced by the approach that evaluates apart from the basis of evidence. It just manages to conceal itself due to our larger society having done so much of the heavy lifting already.</p>

<p>now think about when you disagree with this person, when you venture outside the boundary of what he decides is acceptable. What does he do, how does he feel? What does he say about conspiracy theorists, for example? I&#39;m sure you already know the answer: he believes it is objective reality that you are in the wrong, first of all. He believes this simply because he declares it, and because people around him will agree. Just the same, he believes you are no longer eligible for the considerations and the understanding that would excuse your differences - effectively, that you are a non-person. Granted, he doesn&#39;t come out and say this. Of course he doesn&#39;t. But we don&#39;t need him to. We can deduce, based on the indicators, whether or not it is true. And it is true.</p>

<p>I am a Christian. I believe Jesus was sent by the real God in real life, and that he rose from the dead in real life to authenticate that he truly came from God. I believe this position is fully defensible logically; in fact I believe with my whole person that all disagreement altogether comes from ignorance, and that most of it is willful. I will fight about this. But I will not fight about Christian culture. I agree: Christian culture is absolutely garbage, and you are completely in the right to have issue with it.</p>

<p>because I am a Christian, I know what Christian teaching encompasses. And I testify to this: it is not Christian teaching that produces the behavior you see practiced in Christian culture. On the contrary: the teaching of Christ calls us to extraordinary psychological aptitude. Specifically, the teaching of Christ calls us to such an aptitude that has never before been seen in the history of the world. This teaching does not call us to believe without evidence by any means. Rather, it calls us to so great an understanding as this: that we know what is true within ourselves at all times, no matter what is indicated by any evidence, whether from the world or from our own senses. I say, Jesus Christ is THE light and THE truth, higher than anything that has ever been conceived by man. It is therefore impossible that anyone who knows him would walk in ignorance or in the darkness.</p>

<p>no, it is not Christian teaching that produces this behavior you see in Christian culture. Not in the least. It is rather this: that people will act like cultural Christians no matter what their framework of belief, and that meanwhile, to those who already want to believe that they are as righteous and as justified as God, the most base and superficial elements of Christian teaching will fit them like a glove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because feminism isn&#39;t about equal rights anymore and it hasn&#39;t been since they revived it. It&#39;s about hatred, and it&#39;s hatred that abets their mission and it&#39;s hatred that undermines society.</p>

<p>So yes in a perfect world the government wouldn&#39;t fund hatred. But we don&#39;t live in that world. Perhaps not the most eloquently put, but as Milo said, feminism is cancer and we shouldn&#39;t be keeping cancer alive.</p>

<p>The only remaining legal inequality between the sexes is draft eligibility. If women want to expose themselves to slavery that&#39;s stupid, but as a man I certainly don&#39;t want any part of that decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because women dont have it yet? The statistics are pretty clear on that, women make less money for the same work and are less represented in top leadership positions in the us. Compare this to Sweden where on average about half the legislature is made up of women (there is some natural fluctuation). </p>

<p>Modern feminism is also a critical theory in the humanities interested in uncovering deeper, often unintended, meanings in literature, law, political science, etc... This is very helpful for increasing our understanding of the world at large. </p>

<p>Feminism has also increased its focus from merely &quot;equality for women&quot; to the elimination of gender based social institutions that harm people. This is why modern feminists spend so much time on fighting &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; and the common depiction of women in media. </p>

<p>These ideas are harmful to all people of all genders. They represent a warped misunderstanding of reality that affects people&#39;s actions. The typical depiction of masculinity in media is stoic, unemotional and uninterested in deep emotional connections (Han Solo is an excellent example). This is not how humans actually work.</p>

<p>For a long while I acted this way, as do many other men, and I was unhappy. I was lucky enough to be open minded and listened to some feminist &quot;propaganda&quot;, realised I was an idiot and changed his I acted towards other people. Feminism helped me, personally, to be a better person, and I&#39;m not even a woman! Outside of some extremists, the movement as a whole is still necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes. While media around the world loves to point bluto statistics gathered by the swedish government and say &quot;look, all the raep!!!!&quot; They tend to leave out a little thing called &quot;context&quot;. </p>

<p>Swedish law has several unique quirks that cause the reported uncidence.of tape to appear higher. For instance; in most countries if a woman came to the police with evidence that her husband had roamed her every night for three weeks, this would count as one instance of rape. In Sweden this is instead counted as 21 separate instances of rape.</p>

<p>Most countries also have a separation between sexual assault and rape (I guess it makes the stats look better), Sweden does not. Swedish culture is also much more egalitarian in general and ideas like toxic masculinity dont hold as much away there, so both men and women are much more likely to report a rape. </p>

<p>If you are just going to spout that &quot;Sweden is rape capital&quot; nonsense then I guess you also believe that Pakistan has no rapes at all. After all, the government there does not gather official figures at all, and you are just going off government stats without context here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, CONTEXT. Since 1965 Sweden has consistently broadened the legal definition of rape through legislation and court rulings. In 2005 the legal definition of rape was expanded to include sexual acts with an unconscious person (asleep or intoxicated). In 2008 a Swedish court ruled that &quot;digital penetration&quot; of an unconscious woman was also rape (in most of the world this would be treated as sexual assault). </p>

<p>The feminist and egalitarian culture in Sweden has also resulted in less toxic gender relations, so men and women have become increasingly more likely as time goes on to report rape. The government of Sweden has also pursued policies to reduce the number of unreported rapes. </p>

<p>The rape rate in Sweden has also remained static on average (there has been some fluctuation) since 2005, the last time legislation broadened the definition of rape. So to claim that increase since 1980 somehow means feminism causes rapes is fairly ridiculous as it completely ignores context as well as confounding factors. A correlation exists, but there is no causation.</p>

<p>I am on mobile so I can&#39;t link info here, but it&#39;s all on wikipedia anyway. If you don&#39;t like wikipedia then the website of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) is where all the tape statistics can be found. Of course, UNDOC itself discourages people from using its statistics for cross national comparisons, because being reasonable people they realize that these statistics could result in a lot of mistaken beliefs of taken out of CONTEXT. Hopefully by this point you have figured out why that&#39;s important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, actually. Both men and women are more likely to report rape when there is no victim shaming involved. And, seeing as Sweden legalized homosexuality and established legal gender neutrality in the 80s, same sex tape is definitely included. </p>

<p>Toxic conceptions of femininity and masculinity may not be as serious for homosexuals, but they still have an impact. Homosexual rape, due to the stigma surrounding homosexuality, often gets reported a lot less than heterosexual rape (though men tend not to go to the police after rape as well, so it&#39;s mostly women raped by men that seek help as this is more socially acceptable). </p>

<p>Combined with the ever broader legal definition of  rape, strong feminism, egalitarianism, faith in law enforcement and efforts to increase reporting of rapes by citizens, Sweden had one of the highest rates of reported rape in earth. But once unreported rapes are included Sweden suddenly becomes one of the least rapefull(?) Countries on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait? I thought feminism was causing all of the rape?!?!</p>

<p>While this is pretty out of left field, I&#39;ll bite. Swedish authorities have repeatedly stated that there has been no statistically significant increase in the rate of all crimes. In the case of rape, specifically, there was an increase in reported rapes in 2005 that coincided with the law broadening the legal definition of rape that I mentioned previously. The year after that the rate fell to below previous levels and has fluctuated ever since. </p>

<p>Now, I understand you may not trust the official numbers from Sweden and the EU. But if that is the case then why are you turning to those numbers to suggest that they have the highest rape rate in Europe and that it has increased since the 80s. That&#39;s quite a bit of &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; right there. </p>

<p>Besides, the guy that came on fox during the 2016 election claiming to be a former Swedish government minister and brought all this up in the first place was lying. He never worked for the swedish government and had to publically apologize for lying. Of course faux news (infotainment, not a legitimate news source according to their own website) did not report that event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is.</p>

<p>Brietbart is not a legitimate news source. It has repeatedly put out factually false stories. Not just misinformation as in the case of Fox, but plain and simple lies. I even pointed out one of these false stories, the whole &quot;they are making the frogs gay!&quot; Thing. While that is the most over the top example, it is sadly far from the only one. </p>

<p>Brietbart also used testimony from the Swedish guy that claimed to have been with the government. But where Fox at least stopped talking about Sweden once all the lies were revealed, Brietbart has clearly continued to pit forward a false narative.</p>

<p>As for the story itself, it&#39;s a literal nothingburger. A migrant was brought to court and charged with rape, and the court ruled that there was insufficient evidence. This in the &quot;rape capital&quot; of Europe, isnt it? Surely the evil feminazis would have jumped at the opportunity to throw a rapist in prison? </p>

<p>Except, as it turns out, not all feminists are evil man haters and not all Arab migrants are rapists. It turns out that the legal system in Sweden, shockingly, works. People trust the legal system and there is little to no social stigma, so rapes are reported. Once reported, if there is sufficient evidence, the perpetrator is convicted. </p>

<p>Not everything is some horrible conspiracy, not everything can be. If the world actually worked the way people like you think it does, it would already be way too late to fix anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great argument, it resonates well with observations of recent history.</p>

<p>Quoting, as comments too on-the-nose have a tendency to disappear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah but all the good was done when the franchise was expanded.</p>

<p>The movement was co-opted and subverted to create another identity oriented political movement.</p>

<p>The point of it isn&#39;t to support any group. The point is to arouse hatred.</p>

<p>People that hate will accept another step violating liberty when it&#39;s used in the context of attacking the hated group.</p>

<p>EG The left&#39;s complete abandonment of free speech. They think, and intend, that it will just be speech of the enemy that will be censored and controlled. But of course that isn&#39;t how wit will work out.</p>

<p>Note also there&#39;s a push on the right to get Facebook regulated. But of course it just won&#39;t be facebook that gets regulated.</p>

<p>Ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter which identity group &#39;prevails&#39;. It only matters that one does and it succeeds in getting some major protection of rights demolished.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which group &#39;wins&#39;, the bad guys always win.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We sell our labor power for a period of time where the products of activity and the production process are not controlled by us, and don&#39;t belong to us. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people do this, but nothing about Capitalism as a system makes it compulsory. This fact is not <em>systemic</em> to capitalism. It is how people choose to use Capitalism which results in this behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We view others as competitors in the labor market, and our connections between people through our productive activity becomes obscured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this related to &quot;it is a system that alienates us from our own activity and from each other&quot;. People naturally compete with each other and stratify themselves along social hierarchies. Those hierarchies have benefits and responsibilities for leaders and followers, and this is ingrained in the human psyche instinctually as a result of the conditions of our evolution. Competition is not inherently bad, unfettered and unrestricted competition is bad. If the objective of competition is to place those best suited for their roles in those roles, then competition is an efficient tool for simultaneously allocating labor whilst providing a vehicle for one to determine their own position within society&#39;s economy. Competition as a <em>system</em> does not deprive one of determining their own position in an economy, it sets conditions for labor and demands that applicants meet them. The problem with how humans utilize competition and social stratification is in the <strong>responsibilities</strong> of leadership. From our leaders we demand increased responsibility and accountability, and proportionate compensation for their position in the hierarchy. When our leaders are not responsible, are not held accountable, and are compensated disproportionately to what they produce, we become upset, because these natural principles are being violated, i.e. there is an injustice occurring. This is a human flaw. It is not <em>endemic</em> to Capitalism as a system, it is prevalent among Capitalist societies not because it is necessary, but because people tolerate it. This is a cultural problem, and can be solved with various tools, including but not limited to government intervention, boycott, protest, strike, and education etc. nothing requires this phenomena, it happens, because that is what humans are allowing to happen at this point in time. Capitalism didn&#39;t necessitate segregation and racism in the early 20th century, that was just what humans were deciding to do for some time. To put an end to it, we had to use all the tools I mentioned above. This is no different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we must match ourselves to the demands of the labor market, instead of pursuing our interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true, and the millenial generation is proving it to not be true. Just about anything is monetizable/marketable, you just need to figure out how to monetize/market what you do, and every day more tools and services are being created to do just that, because of innovations in technology. No conformation to the labor market is required, and in fact this is becoming far less frequent, as the creative producers of today are turning towards becoming independent owners of their own small businesses, with much success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t control how long to work, they don&#39;t control how to work, they don&#39;t control how fast to work, in many places they don&#39;t control when to use the bathroom or when to eat. They don&#39;t have a say about who they work with. The workers don&#39;t control the means of the productions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s nonsense, none of this is <em>endemic</em> to Capitalism, and nothing is stopping anyone from reforming how companies operate, in particular how labor is performed and how production is controlled. Everyday, more tools and resources are being created to allow people more opportunity and freedom to produce. The state of labor is not a permanent fixture, it is subject to change within the Capitalist system. People presently aren&#39;t dramatically reforming this, but that doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t/can&#39;t. In fact we already see how changes to traditional labor models in our Capitalist system are starting to change with the advent of new technologies (see Patreon, bitcoin, etc.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well this is obviously false, and trivially so. Societies have radically changed due to natural disasters, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yes, if the sun exploded right now, it would create a lot of change, and if we underwent nuclear war, we&#39;d see change then as well.</p>

<p>I thought we were talking about change within the context of social movements, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a little bit of a different claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you see it that way. Maybe that&#39;s my fault for not making my claim clear, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been talking about the entire time, or at least trying to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all most of the government functions are done by institutions that are classified as government corporations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples? Are you referring to municipal corporations and chartered/registered organization like for profit and non-profit organizations? They&#39;re not all the same. True, legally, states and local governments are incorporated, but private organizations being incorporated is a relatively modern convention, especially human rights for corporations, and the corporate legal structure is by no means the same thing as a <em>capitalist</em> or <em>market</em> structure, it is a system of delegating rights to entities which traditionally stemmed from a monarch, but today originate from (in theory) the people. In short, the corporate legal structure of is not a capitalist system, it is a legal system which predates democracy and capitalism alike. Today&#39;s modern corporate structure, as we colloquially refer to it, is a convention of how private organizations operate within a market, but that is very different from the underlying fundamental legal principles from which all organization in society are based. To use an analogy, in this case, the egg did come before the chicken, and eggs are not exclusive to chickens. You are suggesting that because eggs are chicken in nature, we can&#39;t use eggs to bring about anything but chickens, but the egg predates the chicken and is not exclusive to it, so this is logically a false presumption, i.e. it is not valid, so the premise cannot be actually true, nor sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30365.pdf">https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30365.pdf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondly, corporations... or more accurate associations of corporations control the politicians, and write the legislation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the gatekeepers to government entry are corporate and controlled by corporations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be misunderstood, because the state is moment of class struggle, and we can certainly have victories through it, it just means that the battle field is disadvantageous. It is certainly the case that one can still win a few battles...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand your argument here, are you saying that because the government makes use of government owned enterprises, we can&#39;t use the government to make changes to our market economy? What is the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why? The legal prohibitions on utilizing military domestically have continuously been eroded. Moreover, history if filled military dictatorships...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because as soon as a military organization turns on the American people, foreign governments will support the opposing military factions (of which there would be many). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so other than an ideological commitment to American exceptionalism, I see no reason why the military won&#39;t be used domestically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well not American exceptionalism, but Western exceptionalism is a tangible thing. For example, in America, we have the ability to freely spread information, i.e. we have the infrastructure to support this. We have a massive private media infrastructure, with vast access to internet across the country. We are not a struggling 2nd-3rd world country invisible to the rest of the world. Quite the opposite, <em>all eyes are on us</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But, it is systemic.  It is historically so, with the forcible creation through dispossession of a mass of people through force. Think the enclosure acts in england, or the colonial policy in the US against the native population, and through legislation which forced people into labor. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital</a></p>

<p>And through systemic pressure of entering the labor market, because our very existence is mediated through the laborpower-money-commodity relation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People naturally compete with each other and stratify themselves along social hierarchies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well obviously human beings do this so it a mode enabled by our &#39;nature&#39; what ever that means, but it is only one mode of social arrangement, meaning it is not entailed by necessity. Rather it is a result of social and historical development.   And that social and historical development lead to a mode of production which obscures how we actually relate to one another.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those hierarchies have benefits and responsibilities for leaders and followers, and this is ingrained in the human psyche instinctually as a result of the conditions of our evolution. Competition is not inherently bad, unfettered and unrestricted competition is bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some hierarchies do, some don&#39;t.  History of human politics has been people taking the hierarchies given to them as necessary and with strong justification, only to find that they are neither necessary, nor justified.   Your claims are a literally rationalization for absolute monarchy, or the divine rule of kings, except a presupposition is imported that they are utilitarian.  You want to justify that claim?</p>

<p>Nor is competition a result of our evolution, other than in a trivial sense, that the evolution of the human species allows for them to construct competitive and hierarchical frameworks.  This misses the point, which is what is good for human beings, and what allows human beings to flourish.  Systems where their very existence is mediated through constant competition, and where competition structures more and more of our lives is not that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with how humans utilize competition and social stratification is in the responsibilities of leadership. From our leaders we demand increased responsibility and accountability, and proportionate compensation for their position in the hierarchy. When our leaders are not responsible, are not held accountable, and are compensated disproportionately to what they produce, we become upset, because these natural principles are being violated, i.e. there is an injustice occurring. This is a human flaw. It is not endemic to Capitalism as a system, it is prevalent among Capitalist societies not because it is necessary, but because people tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not frame it as an injustice occurring because the whole history of capitalism has been the struggle of subordinating more and more of our time to the demands of the market, and people fighting against it.   We don&#39;t have limitations on the working day, because of the responsibility of our leaders, or their accountability, we have it because regular people struggled to win these victories, against their official governing institutions. Ditto for workplace protections, etc.  The narrative that you presented has nothing to do with the history of Capital, the class nature of society, and the class interests and composition of ruling institutions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a cultural problem, and can be solved with various tools, including but not limited to government intervention, boycott, protest, strike, and education etc. nothing requires this phenomena, it happens, because that is what humans are allowing to happen at this point in time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is on the right track, but this is literally the history of capitalism since its beginning.  It consisted of creating a mass of people who only have their labor power to sell in the market, this was done through violence. People resisted it.  Through legislation forcing people into the labor market, people resisted it, and once the class dynamic was well established, it has been the history of this struggle. That is capitalism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism didn&#39;t necessitate segregation and racism in the early 20th century, that was just what humans were deciding to do for some time. To put an end to it, we had to use all the tools I mentioned above. This is no different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We did not put an end to either racism or segregation, the mechanisms evolved, first of all. Secondly capital has no problem introducing division in order to splinter the working class and drive wages down. </p>

<p>For example, this was what was being done by creating and maintaining the ethnic conflict between the Irish and the English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And most important of all! Every industrial and commercial centre in England now possesses a working class divided into two hostile camps, English proletarians and Irish proletarians. The ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who lowers his standard of life. In relation to the Irish worker he regards himself as a member of the ruling nation and consequently he becomes a tool of the English aristocrats and capitalists against Ireland, thus strengthening their domination over himself. He cherishes religious, social, and national prejudices against the Irish worker. His attitude towards him is much the same as that of the “poor whites” to the Negroes in the former slave states of the U.S.A.. The Irishman pays him back with interest in his own money. He sees in the English worker both the accomplice and the stupid tool of the English rulers in Ireland.</p>

<p>This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short, by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes. This antagonism is the secret of the impotence of the English working class, despite its organisation. It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power. And the latter is quite aware of this.</p>

<p>Examples? Are you referring to municipal corporations and chartered/registered organization like for profit and non-profit organizations? They&#39;re not all the same. True, legally, states and local governments are incorporated, but private organizations being incorporated is a relatively modern convention, especially human rights for corporations, and the corporate legal structure is by no means the same thing as a capitalist or market structure, it is a system of delegating rights to entities which traditionally stemmed from a monarch, but today originate from (in theory) the people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of abstract legal theory, sure there is a difference between a corporation granted by the monarch, vs a republican state form that is representative, I don&#39;t deny this. In terms of concrete relations, of how this plays out, it does not matter.  The Virginia Company was still a form with shareholders, seeking to maximize profits.  And this corporate form was with us since the beginning of capitalism, and its evolution is also the evolution of this form. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To use an analogy, in this case, the egg did come before the chicken, and eggs are not exclusive to chickens. You are suggesting that because eggs are chicken in nature, we can&#39;t use eggs to bring about anything but chickens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I mean if the eggs are &quot;by nature chicken&#39;, then chickens will come out of them.   Historically only chickens came out them, and we can predict with good predictive power that only chickens will come out of them... it is safe to say that only chickens will come out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t understand your argument here, are you saying that because the government makes use of government owned enterprises, we can&#39;t use the government to make changes to our market economy? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am saying that the government is not a neutral entity, rather it is an organization that arises out of the needs of capitalist development, whose purpose is to make capitalism function, and in as much as our interests are anti-thetical to those goals, the state form will be used against those interests.  Partly because the very form of the state, is corporate in nature. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because as soon as a military organization turns on the American people, foreign governments will support the opposing military factions (of which there would be many). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is begging the question. Why would there be many factions?   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, in America, we have the ability to freely spread information, i.e. we have the infrastructure to support this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Information is very controlled in the US.  In fact the very mechanism of mass communications, were understood as mechanism by which the public is manipulated... not inform.  This goes without all the military censorship of information that occurs, as well as self-censorship of the press that occurs because they see themselves as the extension of the national security apparatus.   Lastly the most important structural control of information, is the very corporate structure of the media. There are incentives a) not to alienate advertisers, and b) not to undermine corporate hegemony itself.  This was thoroughly argued by Herman and Chomsky in &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;.</p>
