        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the Allies of Humanity information, which I believe is the most rigorous analysis of the alien intervention into humanity&#39;s affairs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Humanity’s destiny is to emerge into and to engage with a Greater Community of intelligent life in the Universe.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact with other forms of intelligent life represents the greatest threshold that humanity has ever faced. The results of this Contact will determine humanity’s future for generations to come. This Contact is happening now.</p></li>
<li><p>Humanity is unprepared for Contact. Researchers are still unable to clearly see who is visiting our world and why. Governments are not revealing what they know, and most people are still in denial that this phenomenon is even occurring.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of this lack of preparation, humanity’s true allies sent representatives to a location near Earth to observe the extraterrestrial presence and activities within our world. The Allies of Humanity Briefings represent their report.</p></li>
<li><p>The Briefings reveal that our world is undergoing an extraterrestrial Intervention by forces that, as demonstrated by their actions, are here to subvert human authority and to integrate into human societies for their own advantage. These forces represent non-military organizations that are here to seek human and biological resources. The Allies refer to these forces as the “Collectives.” The Collectives do not value human freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the Intervention is being carried out by small groups of intervening forces, it must rely primarily upon deception and persuasion to achieve its goals. The Allies Briefings describe in detail how this is being accomplished and what we must do to stop it.</p></li>
<li><p>This extraterrestrial Intervention is being focused in four arenas: It is influencing individuals in positions of power and authority to cooperate with the Intervention through the promise of greater wealth, power &amp; technology. It is creating hidden establishments in the world from which the Intervention can exert its influence in the Mental Environment, seeking to make people everywhere open and compliant to its will through a “Pacification Program”. It is manipulating our religious values and impulses in order to gain human allegiance to their cause. It is taking people against their will, and often without their awareness, to support an interbreeding program designed to create a hybrid race and a new leadership who would be bonded to the “visitors.”</p></li>
<li><p>Those extraterrestrial visitors who have been potentially beneficial to humanity have all retreated from the world in the face of the Intervention. Those remaining are alien races who are not here for our benefit. This leaves us in an unambiguous situation regarding the extraterrestrial presence. This enables us to clearly see what we are dealing with. Otherwise, it would be impossible for us to tell friend from foe.</p></li>
<li><p>The Allies Briefings emphasize the grave danger in our accepting and becoming reliant upon ET technology offered by the Intervention. This will only lead to our becoming dependent on the “visitors,” resulting in our loss of freedom and self-sufficiency. No true ally of humanity would offer this to us. The Allies emphasize that we have earth-based solutions to all the problems that we face. What we lack as a race is unity, will and cooperation.</p></li>
<li><p>In spite of the great challenge we now face, humanity still has a great advantage if we can respond in time. The Allies Briefings reveal both the Intervention’s strengths and its weaknesses. One of the Intervention’s weaknesses is its reliance upon human acquiescence and cooperation to achieve its goals. According to Greater Community rules of conduct within the region in which our world exists, Intervention is not allowed unless it can be demonstrated that the native people welcome and approve of it. Here, our voices can have power in the Greater Community. At this moment the Intervention has few critics. But if enough people can become aware of it and speak out against it, the Intervention will be thwarted and must withdraw. This is the first step in humanity’s preparation for dealing with the realities of life in the Universe. This step and all the steps that follow give humanity its one great chance to overcome its long-standing conflicts and to unite in its own defense for the preservation of the world. The Allies affirm that we as human beings have the spiritual and collective power to do this and that we must do this if we want to survive and advance as a free and independent race in the Greater Community.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>A nice bit of science fiction there, honestly.  I&#39;m not saying that there hasn&#39;t or isn&#39;t any past or current alien contact, but I need to see something tangible that gives these ideas credit.  If you have something, please share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect that you&#39;re still unconvinced that alien life exists, or even that it is here on Earth. I once felt the same way. I&#39;m glad, though, that you&#39;re at least open to the idea. That says a lot!</p>

<p>I recommend looking at the subject with an open-mind. Consider a broad swath of evidence, including genuine whistleblowers who have inside knowledge, astronauts, eye witnesse accounts from credible witnesses, governments caught lying about it, cases were radar signatures were detected in addition to eye witness accounts from fighter jet pilots (etc), alien abductions phenomenon being reported across cultures, etc.</p>

<p>When you look at it all together... it presents a pretty convincing case that alien life does exist and it&#39;s actually here right now.</p>

<p>Is it a UFO landing on the Whitehouse lawn? No. But is that really necessary? People have been convicted for murder on far less evidence.</p>

<p>This is information that&#39;s being suppressed by those governments and corporations that know about it. We need to dig deeper and keep an open, investigative mind.</p>

<p>As for the above, it&#39;s an analysis that&#39;s worth considering once you agree that alien life is here. The big question becomes: what the heck are they doing here?</p>

<p>The Allies of Humanity Briefings have a terrific, if frightening, answer to that question. But only for those who believe this is really happening. Otherwise, it&#39;s all hogwash.</p>

<p>Also, if you -really- have an open, investigative mind, perhaps you might want to -also- consider the possibility that there ISN&#39;T alien life on Earth--regardless of whether someone has put together &#39;compelling&#39; evidence suggesting there is. Half of this subreddit is about people claiming that &#39;compelling&#39; evidence doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but I’m out right now. I guess the Fermi paradox is a big thing for me. For years I’d tout the Drake equation without knowing the other side of things. Learning about Blue Beam was another big thing for me. Also in my teens and 20s I was a hardcore atheist. As I grow older and follow the rabbit holes I’ve found that maybe none of us have a real solid handle on the nature of our world and our place in the cosmos. The Principle was another interesting watch for me that sort of backed me away from the alien narrative as well. In short, I lean towards a fine tuner, a creator. We are it. We are special. That’s my view of it all at least </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you make about the thousands of reported alien abductions? Many of these people are very stable, rational people. Many of them don&#39;t talk about it because it may ruin their careers.</p>

<p>Interestingly, they all have similar experiences. The memories they suppress are all similar.</p>

<p>The work of Dr. Jacobs is very interesting in this regard. Check it out!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have lots of mixed thoughts on it. Ever hear Sgt Karl Wolf talk about the base on the backside of the moon? Lots of fighter pilots give a lot of interesting accounts as well. But for me, above all, I’ve come to believe that space may be nothing like we are told. I’m much more into entertaining the thought that these craft are from the inner earth (William Cooper swears he saw a craft emerge from the ocean while he was in the Navy - but who is to say it was alien in orgin?) or that these are entities from other dimensions here on earth. I got hooked on space as a kid growing up near the Adler Planetarium and took two astronomy electives at the local JUCO just because (and yes I understand the level of learning there isn’t much but the point is I have a genuine interest). My interest in space has led me to start to notice inconsistencies and observations with NASA and spaceX.  So I’ve thought long and hard about why they lie. And why when they get caught in lies there is what amounts to a marketing team that flocks to protect this agency. It’s all very bizarre and currently I see space as more of a story, a script going back near 100 years now to use space as a means to unite a one world government. NASA lies because they guzzle up the tax money and send it to black ops projects. The government is starting soft disclosure up all over again with blue beam seemingly right around the corner. I say all of this is happening and yet doubling back to the Fermi paradox - where are all the aliens??? It’s a fun topic regardless and I appreciate you challenging me in a non combative way. You seem sincere in your pursuit. Be well and good luck to us both!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As well as I currently understand it, it’s about population control. Even if you’re not into comic books (Im not) you should go see the new Avengers movie.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly another narrative to consider. Either way, we&#39;re being lied to.</p>

<p>This said, if humanity had the technology to visit other worlds, how would we behave? Not well, I think.</p>

<p>We need to consider the possibility that alien life is interfering with our affairs. We need to protect our borders to space. We need to stop fighting with each other and realize that we&#39;re one species alone in the universe of intelligent life.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t afford to make a mistake in judgment here. We only have the one planet, after all. All our eggs are in this one beautiful blue basket.</p>

<p>We are not being visited by physical beings who have traveled vast distances in physical craft that were manufactured in this 3-d space... we&#39;re talking about beings from all across time and space and reality interfacing with each other and us using the power of their consciousness and its relationship to our reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that it would be very much to their advantage for humanity to think along those lines -- that they are beings from outside time and space rather than the more mundane we-want-what-you-have physical beings.</p>

<p>It would make them seem very insurmoutable, wouldn&#39;t it? They&#39;d probably love for you to feel that way.</p>

<p>Something to consider is that their craft have been caught on radar, so we&#39;re talking metallic crafts of some type, though highly advanced.</p>

<p>To me, it makes more sense to think of it like this: what&#39;s the most likely scenario? And take it from there, until evidence proves otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I have evidence of objects and crafts and beings existing in the physical universe -- I am one of them. </p>

<p>Our mainstream scientists are steadily beginning to think that the universe is probably teeming with life, given the vastness of the cosmos, the preponderance of Earth-like planets, and the resilience of biological life.</p>

<p>It seems plausible to think that some of that intelligent life would cultivate technology and, perhaps, faster-than-light speeds to be able to reach our shores.</p>

<p>So my assumption that these are physical beings living in this universe is not that far-fetched. It&#39;s a pretty reasonable assumption.</p>

<p>As for evidence of aliens being on Earth, this is beyond the scope of this comment, though after years of research, witness testimony, government coverups, etc., I think this is a given.</p>

<p>The Allies of Humanity simply answer the WHY -- why would an alien race want to visit Earth? What would they want out of the bargain, and what are these beings doing here?</p>

<p>Given that it&#39;s far more plausible to believe that extraterrestrials are physical beings existing in the universe (same as us), the burden of proof should be on anyone arguing otherwise (such as the interdimensional theory)</p>

<p>Yup. </p>

<p>&gt; scientists are steadily beginning to think that the universe is probably teeming with life </p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>&gt; assumption </p>

<p>There&#39;s where you fall flat. You are assuming that the conclusions you have drawn (or rather, have been drawn for you) are correct, and are defending them. I am merely pointing out that your model has flaws, and should either be revised to include all the literature, or thrown out entirely as it seems to be based on a well-intentioned piece of fiction.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the Phenomenon is way more sublime and mysterious and stupefying than aliens in spaceships who want our DNA and gold. </p>

<p>&gt; evidence of aliens being on Earth </p>

<p>I certainly am in agreement that there is a mountain of evidence to suggest that human beings have been interacting with higher intelligence(s) for a very very long time.</p>

<p>&gt; The Allies of Humanity simply answer the WHY  </p>

<p>And they got that answer how, exactly? Was it channeled using [Enochian magick](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee</a>)? Learned by communion with the beings in the astral plane by means of [remote viewing/astral projection](<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/Gateway%20Voyage%20Program">https://www.monroeinstitute.org/Gateway&amp;#37;20Voyage&amp;#37;20Program</a>)? Did a [Vast Active Living Intelligence System](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VALIS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VALIS</a>) beam a pink light onto the author and download this information into his head? Was it automatic writing? Did someone from A:.A:. or OTO get [Lam](<a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol/crowley04_01_small.jpg">https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol/crowley04_01_small.jpg</a>) to come back?</p>

<p>I am not disparaging the above techniques of information gathering, but I have read enough about all of these things at this point to know that any one person&#39;s [reality tunnel](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_tunnel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_tunnel</a>) is not going to cut it, at least not for me. </p>

<p>This is literally **the** great mystery. And it&#39;s laughable to think that the solution is as simple as what alliesofhumanity suggests.</p>

<p>Again, the message is good, and I can see why this angle gets pushed so much by the hopeful. But it&#39;s lazy.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it, or alliesofhumanity, or any of those hucksters selling you the truth. You gotta go find it yourself!</p>

<p>Help me understand: why assume that they are interdimensional, or more sublime as you say? Reality has plenty of evidence regarding the existence of real, physical objects, including crafts built by technology. Interdimensional crafts, however, have yet to be proven.</p>

<p>Why assume something that&#39;s far less realistic? I can&#39;t agree these positions are equivalent.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I am assuming that no mere human has the real answer. </p>

<p>That is, The Phenomenon, when considered in its totality, represents an intelligence so far superior to our own that any concept we have of it is likely falling short. Furthermore, and this is why all the obfuscation, lies and disinformation over the years, it has shown itself to be pretty much in control of the relationship.</p>

<p>But to then ascribe simple, 21st century human motivations to it? Again, I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s looking deeply and honestly enough at the problem. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to know what it is, just what I believe it is not, and that is what the story you posted says.</p>

<p>It could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>The sys admins for the matrix</li>
<li>Physical thoughtforms created by people using advanced remote viewing mind technology and trying to manipulate us into a brighter future, or for fun</li>
<li>The above created by creatures from another planet for the same, or better tech</li>
<li>literally god</li>
<li>Beings from higher dimensions poking through into ours. </li>
<li>Beings from the far far far ultimate distant future who have turned the very fabric of reality itself into a vast consciousness interface, with they themselves existing within it as pure consciousness in an infinite universe of possibility, forwards and backwards in time, occasionally guiding the various intelligences of the universe to discover this interface?</li>
</ol>

<p>I could go on... see what I mean? It is likely so much weirder and wild than we can ever imagine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The physical world, Universe, and &quot;reality&quot; that we perceive and think we know something about, is all a product of our own human physiology... our physical senses that are severely limited and restricted in countless ways that we simply don&#39;t consider at all, nor do we appreciate just how very much remains hidden, unknown and completely beyond any reach on our part. </p>

<p>Even with whatever technology we create to try and extend and go beyond those physical limitations we cannot change the human eyes with which we view and interpret whatever additional data they seem to provide. </p>

<p>Moreover, given the general state of human existence it&#39;s very apparent that we both overestimate our own intelligence as well as abuse and misuse it to our both our own detriment as well as to the detriment of most of the other life-forms <em>we know of</em> that we happen to share our world with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info, I hadn&#39;t previously heard of Allies of Humanity. </p>

<p>A few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this group related or affilitated in any way to the Linkage Institute? I&#39;m referring to the group of individuals mentioned in papers on the Life Physics Group - California &#39;s page ( <a href="http://www.lpg-c.org/essays">http://www.lpg-c.org/essays</a> ). LPG-C apparently is defunct ( their facebook page interview links to spam / malware sites) but it strikes me as one of the possible &quot;legit&quot; sources of information in a sea of disinfo / lies so I&#39;m curious as to how it might relate to your source. Note that it is also linked to the Wingmakers story ( wingmakers.us )</p></li>
<li><p>In regards to point 8, are you saying the benevolant aliens have all retreated earth by now? How can they be sure this is true?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you think of Cobra&#39;s blog - 2012portal.blogspot.com - totally fake, legit, or deceptive (presumably by some faction of the &quot;Intervention&quot;)?</p></li>
<li><p>If you are familiar with the &quot;law of one&quot; channelings, Ra mentions that there is a confederation based on Saturn that assists in maintaining balance for upcoming &quot;third density&quot; beings like us. Aid in various form from these beings have had an impact on our history, from  aiding the transfer of Martian souls to Earth, to attempting to help alleviate negative influence from the Orion confederation. These beings can be thought of as &quot;guardians&quot; who want to see us grow up and shed the negative influence ourselves, but have instituted a quarantine since the negative presence had grown substantial over the millenia. Do you believe that A) there is such a confederation (many throughout the universe in fact) that help maintain the &quot;balance&quot; of the universe? and B) that there currently is a quarantine that limits travel into and out of Earth (for both good and bad aliens of various technological ability). </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Briefly,</p>

<p>The Allies of Humanity analysis explains why aliens are interfering in our affairs, and what humanity can and should do about it. It&#39;s a rational analysis of the predicament we are in, and and examination of both the challenges and opportunities associated with first contact -- the most important threshold any world can undergo.</p>

<p>The intent of my post was to share this analysis, which I think is sorely lacking in the UFO community. Convincing you that they are here is beyond the scope of this post.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much evidence. If you&#39;ve honestly looked into it with an open mind and haven&#39;t concluded that aliens are real and here on Earth right now, then there&#39;s nothing I can say, show you, present you, or make a case for. You have simply decided not to know.</p>

<p>The evidence is abundant for anyone with an open mind. Consider it all in a holistic way and then draw your conclusions, rather than waiting for that one perfect piece of evidence that will convince your doubting mind. Think of all the different types of evidence out there, whittle it down to only the best of each type, then put it all together like a puzzle and paint a picture of what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>The perfect evidence that can convince a mind that does not want to be convince is nonexistent. You&#39;ll never find it, or by the time you do, it&#39;ll be too late because humanity will have lost its freedom and sovereignty over this planet.</p>

<p>The onus is on you. Open your mind to the possibility, then research the hell out of this. </p>

The one common factor in UFO sightings and/or UFO contact is that there is never any hard evidence to be shown. Lights in the sky? Not proof of anything except the observer can&#39;t immediately say what is being seen. &quot;Abductions&quot;, I&#39;d say most of them are related to sleep, stress and fear of unknown things (similar to ghost sightings. The observer can not understand what is being seen, so jumps to the easiest conclusion &quot;ghost!&quot; to explain it to stop stressing the brain). etc...</p>

<p>I would love to see one phenomena, one experience, one instance of anything that proves &quot;aliens&quot;. I&#39;d be the first to jump for joy.</p>
