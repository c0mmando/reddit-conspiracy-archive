       I'd say 0% as the NRA does not manufacture or sell firearms. Why would the NRA need to trade weapons for drugs anyway?

       So the NRA will start selling drugs to black people to make non-white people go out and buy guns?

       Hmmm, it's certainly plausible. I mean really, this might be the greatest conspiracy of our times! You need a noble prize.

       Yes, they promote the culture of fear which helps their side, the gun people, with selling more guns. Still a very different thing than a government dealing in illegal arms and drugs...

        How The Gun Industry Funnels Tens Of Millions Of Dollars To The NRA
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While that is still part of the organization's core function, today less than half of the NRA's revenues come from program fees and membership dues.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bulk of the group's money now comes in the form of contributions, grants, royalty income, and advertising, much of it originating from gun industry sources.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2005, the gun industry and its corporate allies have given between $20 million and $52.6 million to it through the NRA Ring of Freedom sponsor program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NRA also made $20.9 million — about 10 percent of its revenue — from selling advertising to industry companies marketing products in its many publications in 2010, according to the IRS Form 990.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, some companies donate portions of sales directly to the NRA. Crimson Trace, which makes laser sights, donates 10 percent of each sale to the NRA. Taurus buys an NRA membership for everyone who buys one of their guns. Sturm Rugar gives $1 to the NRA for each gun sold, which amounts to millions. The NRA's revenues are intrinsically linked to the success of the gun business.

       The NRA does not sell firearms directly. But, it's in the self interest of the NRA to increase gun sales overall, so that they can receive more money from the gun industry.

       You know who profits even more? The gun manufacturers; it's easy to lump all your fears into one boogeyman, but you're misplacing and misdirecting a bunch of bullshit onto the NRA. People who don't own guns, or want to own guns, were throwing their money at them a month or two ago after the Parkland kids decided to misdirect the blame onto them. They get money from gun manufacturers because they represent their interests, they also get money from millions of American voters because they represent ours.

       These things don't happen all in a vacuum to each other. It's all related to each other and intersects. The gun manufactures want to make a profit on gun sales. The NRA profits off of the success on gun sales and memberships. It's in the best interests of both the NRA and the gun sales manufacturers to increase gun sales. So they do whatever it takes and say whatever it takes in order to drive up gun sales so they can both earn a profit.

       So I guess where we diverge in opinion is that increased gun sales are a bad thing. You understand that the vast, vast majority of gun owners, and especially gun enthusiasts who would be buying all those extra guns, don't kill people right?

       I never said that increased gun sales are a bad thing. You're attacking a strawman.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy to me, is the reasons why the NRA and the gun manufacturers want to increase guns sales, which is to fill up their own pockets. And they do this at the cost of division and polarization of our society.

       The issue is when these interests come into conflict with each other. Are your interests perfectly aligned with that of the gun manufacturer?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the moment most of the money running the NRA is not from members, individual enthusiasts are also a lot easier to lie to than gun manufacturer representatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when something comes up that would make life safer for responsible gun owners, but hurt gun sales, then you can bet on NRA to do their best to defend sales figures while telling gun owners how hard they are working to defend their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is that the NRA is no longer interested in making promoting more effective, enjoyable and safer gun usage for regular people. Instead their main focus is in defending the interests of arms manufacturers, even at the detriment to regular gun enthusiasts.

       Was it treason though? I'm not saying I agree with the Iran-Contra affair, or disagree, or know very much about it but the basics as I was a baby/unborn at the time; it just seems to me if he comitted treason his neck would be a little stretched out by now.

       I think it’s more likely that major gun manufacturers and old guard right wingers who essentially control the NRA are encouraging “guns for sail” to renegade militias or major dictatorships actively slaughtering people.

       The NRA lobby's influence on congress and gun law legislation actually undermines the strength of the 2A and the rights of individual gun owners, so this kind of bizarro shit is just barf icing on the bullshit cake.

       Lifetime member of the NRA here.  Whatever anyone might think of Oliver North, the important thing is the work the NRA does on behalf of the Second Amendment, not who its president is.  I
       <em>
        want

       politicians to be terrified of its power and influence over their political careers, not pandering to David Hogg and Baldilocks.

       In fact, it would be more like actual suicide. The question is can we dig up the bodies later and hang them again for murder by proxy due to all the unfortunately deceased democrats following Civil War II.

        Here's one that I was watching that got put into contest mode.
       </a>
       Like I said in that thread.  Putting negative Trump posts into contest mode is why you see so many "Incoming contest mode in 3...2..." replies in them.   They also routinely remove entire threads, only to re-add them later when no one cares anymore because a new thread about it gets posted.  It destroys any good discussions going which I'm sure is the point.

       He said

        every

       anti Trump thread is put into contest mode. That is a complete lie. It's probably more like a tenth of 1 percent of anti Trump threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's also not including all of the anti Trump comments. For instance, the top comment in this thread is claiming this sub is "T_D 2.0." Oh really? Then why didn't all of the Trump supporters downvote you?

There are many more posts just like the ones I cited above.

        Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.
Justice's Criminal Division chief, Robert Mueller, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.

       Because many redditors, okay, many American redditors, and most redditors are American, and I'd bet it's an even higher percentage in this particular sub, love their guns. So if you say something bad about the NRA, no matter how much sense you make, they'll fight it back.

       contributors. who cares what "many" redditors think about guns, thats exactly his point, that people in this sub who might have once thought critically and been skeptical of things like this, now just accept it and march along. Its not because of guns.

       so you dont consider it
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       opinion that what you experience on reddit is not good sense on guns? Not sure why you are the deciding factor as to whats good sense and whats not.

      <p>
       regardless, that has nothing to do with what I am talking about. The point was, that on a subreddit dedicated to consipiracies, a character like fucking Oliver North should be heavily scrutinized
       <strong>
        regardless
       </strong>
       of your stance on guns or even the NRA. He is a shady character who has been involved in multiple other conspiracies discussed on this subreddit. That was his point. How the fuck could a conpiracy sub, not take issue with Oliver North being an influential (basically government) contributor.

       I think you're getting downvoted due to your subtext, not due to the ridiculousness of North being NRA pres. People here take things very literally, and have no sense of humor when it comes to guns or the 2nd amendment.
      </p>

       If you'd simply said "The traitor Ollie North is now the NRA president". I bet this would have more than 70% upvotes.

       His post is upvoted, and his coment claiming the downvotes are coming from NRA shills is also upvoted. If those shills were here, then I don't think this thread would be in the positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       He provides no evidence that the NRA is going to sell guns to foreign countries for drugs. He provides no evidence of NRA shills, yet he comes up with a batshit insane conspiracy theory to explain why his shitpost is not going absolutely viral.

       What kind of question is that? For one, he could get a bunch of politicians in his pocket. NRA has a lot of money, foreign and domestic. They can make or break candidates with their endorsement. Someone who has committed high treason in the past and has gotten away with it probably will do it again.
