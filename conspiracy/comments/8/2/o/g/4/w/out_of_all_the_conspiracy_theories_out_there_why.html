       I’ve seen conspiracies about just about everything but never do they face the backlash of flat earth. Why is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people get so hostile when it comes to this topic? I think it’s because the indoctrination of space and planets etc is so strong and thorough. There’s books, movies, pictures and any other source of media and the idea of it all being fake just seems overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this though, since you were a child, do you not remember being taught the globe? Why such a strong effort to teach this from birth?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d love to hear your thoughts.

       How is it any different than any other conspiracy theory? It has a claim that the government is lying about something. It has a motive for them to tell the lie. And it has some evidence (which some might disagree with) to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like pretty much every other conspiracy theory. I think people are just really indoctrinated to the round earth and can’t consider anything else. NASA is pretty good at what they do lol

       Only way you'd be able to prove it is if you can fly across antartica (which is forbidden). Flying from one location to another wouldn't prove anything because your perception is completely limited and also based on assumptions.

       Would flying over the North Pole not prove the same point?  Actually, why do we have to go North/South in the first place?  I flew from the US to Europe to Asia back to US.  I don't remember seeing an edge that we flew over.

       You don't understand the flat earth theory if you think there is an "edge." The earth is seen as a circle surrounding the North Pole. Antartica is a concentric circle of ice that surrounds all oceans and continents. Beyond Antartica is more areas of Earth. There is no edge of earth that falls into space. Space is above us.

       People knew the earth was round before nasa; The curvature of the earth effects lots of physics here on earth. it’s not a conspiracy, it’s basic science and it doesn’t take a genius to look at the facts and realize that. You can literally see the curve of the earth from an airplane.

       If the earth is flat, where’s the end? why can’t we fall off it? How would the earth’s water not drained off it by now? It’s literally THE simplest thing in the world.

       You say the curvature affects physics but there are certain professions that you'd expect would have to take into account the curvature, and yet they don't. Land surveyors, pilots, ship/sub captains, engineers, etc.

       That’s where your wrong. Those professions often require physics that are effected by the shape of the earth; for example, pilots monitoring the Coriolis Effect.

       “If you took a straight-lined flight from Alaska to Florida, you would find yourself far away from your goal because of the deflected wind. If you look at flight paths that airplanes take, they all have an arch to them. This is because while in the air the Earth is still rotating and the “final destination” rotates with it. Airlines are constantly adjusting to the rotation, while also using the Jet Stream to save fuel.[7][8][9]”

       The azimuthal equidistant map is a good representation. It shows that Antarctica is a ring of ice surrounding the system with the North Pole being the center. You can't fall off the edge because, like a dart board, you're only in the first ring outside the bull's eye. You're not at the edge yet.

       What about those who have traveled across Antarctica, People who have flied across those areas? If the earth was flat, what’s past Antarctica, wouldn’t we have hit ‘the edge’? What about the other side of the disk-shaped earth, anything on it?

       Nobody in our modern day has done that except for Admiral Byrd and he was a highly decorated military person. Look up what he said about flying there.

       Byrd talked of an inner earth; the earth can’t both be flat and hollow like a sphere, can it? And the reason they don’t fly in that vicinity commercially is they aren’t supposed to go a certain distance from a landing site, in case of an emergency, and flying close to the magnetic poles are dangerous.

       I disagree. There’s a good amount of evidence to show that the round earth def can be questioned. It’s up to the viewer though if they want to explore it. I think most times people don’t.

       I didn’t say I accepted flat earth. But just senses man. Have you ever seen the curve with your own eyes? Have you ever felt the earth spin? Have you ever seen outer space with your own eyes? Have you seen Mars yourself?

       I don’t believe anything unless I can see the proof myself. I definitely don’t take NASA or mainstream science as fact or law because they definitely have motives to push the opposite.

       How could there be just "some truth to it"?  It's really a binary thing. The Earth is either flat or it's not. And I really strongly disagree that people not believing in something is not evidence that it's true.

       Sure, all of those thoughts are fun to consider and evoke a pleasant sentiment, but until I see compelling enough evidence, or any real evidence at all, I'm going to remain subscribed to the belief that we live on a globe, not due to some classical form of indoctrination, but out of an understanding of physics and the motion of celestial bodies.

       That is a selectively unrealistic mindset. There are countless aspects of physical reality that you can’t “see” and almost certainly lack the mathematical background to be able to prove for yourself.

       Because people don't understand that Scientific "Theories" such as gravity and motion of the earth can be challenged and re-investigated. It's poor understanding of science. It's not a religion to be " believed" and "protected" from inquiry and skepticism of thinkers.

       Haha very true. Like I always say, above all other conspiracies, the flat earth is the toughest to swallow because literally since birth, we’ve always believed in space and round earth. It’s pretty much a religion. It’s not like 9/11 or stuff about The government which people can question because it seems so obvious that there’s lies in it. Flat earth really requires a true open mind and I don’t think most people have that despite thinking they do.

       Taking away all the evidence that points toward a round earth, what would the motivation be for generations of scientists/governments/satellite companies/airline pilots/sailors/etc have for misleading people into believing that earth is round?

       However, Hollow Earth or Inner Earth theory ...now that one is super interesting w a lot of history &amp; theories derived from it. I'm more apt to listen to hollow earth believers tbh just because they can point to tangible (although circumstantial) things like basically every ancient culture believing in an underground realm &amp; much of Kohn Symmes work. Interesting, very interesting

       Because even if you disregard all of the obvious answers, physics will answer it for you. You might say, "Oh, but that's all just made up to trick you." But I'll put it like this: I think we can both agree that a metre is a metre. And we can both agree that a second is a second. So with basic high school physics we can calculate a velocity in m/s, and we can both agree on it being accurate. Right? Well the physics that prove what we know about the earth and space are just as concrete as the physics that calculate velocity. Just because the average person can't understand this level of physics doesn't mean it isn't concrete.

       Because you can literally disprove it on your own using the sun and a bit of math. Snipers and distance shooters have to account for curvature when shooting. In terms of physical laws it also is illogical. And you can see the planets with a telescope and photograph them on your own. And they are all circular all the time when viewed. Unless all the other planetary discs face earth for some arbitrary reason that kinda messes it up. I personally think flat earthers are overly zealous contrarians who refuse to accept

       official narrative instead of thinking critically and looking for info outside of YouTube and blogs.

       My bad, it's the rotation, rather than the curvature. Same idea though, as the effect changes based on latitude.

       The Coriolis Force doesn't exist. Otherwise Planes, Helicopters, or even YOU jumping in place would be affected by it since you are no longer "attached" to the surface of the spinning globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the equator, the speed of rotation is 1,670 km/h. That's roughly 463 meters per second. If the Coriolis Force exists, you'd have "moved" over 1 km for 3 seconds of jumping in place. Or a ball you throw in the air vertically would "move" away from you at that speed.

       Wrong. Prior to jumping or throwing the ball in the air, you are also moving at the same speed as the ground immediately below you.  When you jump, your momentum doesn’t just disappear, you continue moving the same direction at (very nearly) the same speed while you are in the air (which, absent a strong, clearly observable, wind) is also moving at the same speed in the same direction, maintaining a uniform speed and rotation to the whole system.

       Of course momentum exists. We see it happening in reality all the time. A prime example would be a Skateboarder doing a kickflip. While being physically separated, the skate and the man both move forward at the same momentum during the jump itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim the whole system is rotating WITH the Earth due to momentum, then bullets should NOT be affected by Coriolis Force because it doesn't need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       My claim is that the Earth is stationary. You don't need the mental gymnastics of a the whole atmospheric system (and every within it) rotating with the Earth due to momentum.

       Yep, this is the same reason why you should never jump when traveling by plane.

       You don't stop moving when you jump dude. Its called momentum. When the earth is rotating at 1670kph, so is the atmosphere and the air within it. So are you. So when you jump you keep moving with that momentum.

       I am aware of the Glober's explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please enlighten me then: If the atmosphere and the air is also rotating following the Earth's momentum, then the bullet fired from a gun would also be affected by it, no? If that is the case, then Coriolis Force is non-existent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Coriolis Force exists, then why does it affect the bullet but not a plane, a jet, a human, etc.?

       No, they definitely have to account for curvature as well, they just don't do it consciously.

       All else being equal, a long range shooter has to aim 8 inches lower to hit a target that is 1 mile away, than if the earth was not curved.

       It discredits credible conspiracy theories because its so stupid. It gives overly skeptic people ammunition against so called tinfoil hat people. Also we know for a fact that the term conspiracy theorist was manufactured in order to discredit people questioning things... there for FE stinks of scyop... again because its so easily disprovable.

       Most conspiracies are people looking at information in a new way. Look at the podesta emails, interpret "pizza" a certain way - new theory.  Look at tower 7 - new theory.  Look at the number of people remembering bernstein - new theory.  The problem with flat earth, is that no matter how you look at the information, the earth is sphereish - there's no different way to rationally interpret the information.

       Because they misunderstand the flat earth theory to be a flat circle that floats in space. They mix their incorrect theory with the flat earth theory. The truth is that the earth spans the entire universe as a plane of existence. Antartica is just a concentric circle that separates this portion of earth from the greater portions (as described in the Vedas). That's the reason it's so heavily protected.

       Search on YouTube for "Vedic flat earth." Some of the Vedic documentaries that exist were made without the flat earth in mind so I I saw one with the spherical earth sitting like a beach ball on top of water. Seemed pretty stupid. Search for Vedic flat earth and you'll get the correct description.

       First of all I am not a Flat Earther. I am however a very open minded person when it comes to conspiracies. The issue is the "old" version of this sub didn't care what the topic was, anything and everything was able to be discussed. I miss that old version of this sub. Not sure what happened but a ton of people on this sub now are opposite of the old culture. The new culture downvotes and hates on topics they don't agree with. I've always wondered why are you sub to this reddit page if you aren't open to conspiracies. It's really weird to me. I don't sub to things I won't talk about or have interest in so why sub here just to hate? It sucks because this can and will stop people from questioning the narratives given to us and thus more people will end up being asleep to the real world.

       True. And even with the growing consensus that FE is some kind of shareblue-backed discrediting program, its sad we have to pull the trigger on our own old-style freedom of speech - when we could talk about the craziest speculation with no fear of outside exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the direct damage: There are lots of earth-related conspiracy theories that are NON-FE that nobody is going to feel like talking about. Two of them are Hollow Earth and Expanding Earth. Both of those are much more conspiracy-worthy than FE, and should be discussed.

       My issue is that FE believers always try to have “an open discussion” about their theory but then try to put the onus on being proven wrong.  FE believers are saying that what we believe to be true, the Earth is spherical, but then offer no proof to the contrary.  FE believers should be the ones supplying proof that the Earth is flat. And most of the discussions with flat earthers become devolved into some sort of blind eye being turned to basic science that proves the Earth is a globe as we’ve all been taught.  The discussions are always brought up and then the same people who start the conversation will close off any actual open discussions with simple “nope. I don’t believe that. You’re wrong.”  without ever backing up claims.  There is more than enough proof to show that the Earth is a sphere. Where is the evidence that it is flat? YouTube videos?  This is why FE gets so much backlash.  It’s more the people than the theory.  Offer evidence, be open minded like you’d like the people to be that you’re trying to convince, and maybe people would at least be willing to investigate on their own.

        never do they face the backlash of flat earth. Why is that?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Simple answer... because any time someone actually explains the evidence for a spherical earth, the flat earth believers simply deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, they say "where are the photos showing a spherical earth?" When someone shows them the photos taken by NASA and other space agencies, the flat earthers simply say "Oh, they're fake, NASA lies, its all bullshit".
      </p>
      <p>
       No evidence, not even an argument as to why the evidence is fake, just simple denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can show them the maths. You can show them photos of ships disappearing over the horizon from the bottom up. You can present all the evidence in the world, and all you get is denial and rejection of basic scientific facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these idiots couldn't even give you and correct explanation of "perspective" or the "vanishing point", but will at various times claim it is the reason we can't see past the horizon, but that it doesn't exist when used to explain crepuscular rays...
      </p>
      <p>
       Rational people end up presenting the same
       <em>
        unrefuted
       </em>
       evidence over and over again while flat earth retard after flat earth retard simply denies it exists while demanding to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets boring and annoying, which is why the rational people react so strongly to yet another flat earth retard asking the same questions and rejecting the same expplanations.

       For me, it's the lack of answer to the "why" question. Why would they want to tell us it's round when it's flat? there's no answer to that question so I assume it's most likely round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most conspiracies I can see the answer as to why - for example, the school shooting, the "why" would be: "to disarm the population".
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't figure out why they would want to lie to us about the shape of the earth.

       I believe the reason they would lie is for 2 reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1: To hide the creator. With things like space, round earth etc it takes away from there being a Creator. In the Bible, it talks about the earth being flat and there being a dome firmament. With them telling us the earth is round, it disproves the Bible this disproving God.

        It’s a form of sun (devil) worship. We know that the elitist are mostly devil worshipers. The heliocentric universe is a form of them worshiping luciferian (morning star) ideals. I could go into further depth but i think you get the gist.

       It's a logical fallacy to say that anything that doesn't exist now couldn't have existed in the past. Therefore to claim that past writers are lying because they talk about dragons and dragons don't exist anymore isn't necessarily true. It seems reasonable to conclude that, but it doesn't automatically make it so.

       How do you explain the Great Year on a flat earth? The cycle of procession? What mechanism could fake such a complicated and long process (25,800 years)?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The term Great Year has a variety of related meanings. It is defined by NASA as "The period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, about 25,800 years ... also known as [a] Platonic Year."[1] One complete cycle of the equinoxes here means one complete cycle of axial precession.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ancient civilizations including the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Olmecs, the Mayans, the Indians (Indus), and the Chinese were all aware of this cycle over 4,000 years ago. It was information passed on to them from a previous civilization.

       My bad, it's the rotation, rather than the curvature. Same idea though, as the effect changes based on latitude.

       Sadly this is not an example of deception, rather a simple mistake. Seriously, you can prove the earth is spherical with math that existed thousands of years ago.

       Would flying over the North Pole not prove the same point?  Actually, why do we have to go North/South in the first place?  I flew from the US to Europe to Asia back to US.  I don't remember seeing an edge that we flew over.

       That’s where your wrong. Those professions often require physics that are effected by the shape of the earth; for example, pilots monitoring the Coriolis Effect.

       “If you took a straight-lined flight from Alaska to Florida, you would find yourself far away from your goal because of the deflected wind. If you look at flight paths that airplanes take, they all have an arch to them. This is because while in the air the Earth is still rotating and the “final destination” rotates with it. Airlines are constantly adjusting to the rotation, while also using the Jet Stream to save fuel.[7][8][9]”
