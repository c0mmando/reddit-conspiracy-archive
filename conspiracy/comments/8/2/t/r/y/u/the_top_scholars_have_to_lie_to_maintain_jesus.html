    <div class="md"><p>Classicists and Ancient Near East historians all agree Jesus at least <em>existed</em>...he was called Jeshua, and was influential in early 1st century Judea. We know Pilate existed...and that he was a Proconsul...based on a rock inscription found in Caesarea. The debate is whether or not he rose from the dead, but most scholars believe based on pretty solid evidence that a man named Jeshua lived, was followed, and was crucified in the Pro-consulship of Pontius Pilate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta look at the broad strokes...clearly there was a social movement. Josephus attests to Jesus, and Tacitus in the early 2nd century mentions the &quot;Christian cult which follows Jesus&quot;...someone named Jeshua lived, and was executed by Roman authorities. What his followers did after that is totally up for debate, but the man definitely existed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter. Jesus and his cults historicity is verified by Josephus and Tacitus...who the early followers were, and the veracity of those accounts, is irrelevant. We know Pilate existed, we know a man named Jeshua existed. We know people were pretty well convinced that this guy died and rose from the grave...doesn&#39;t make it True, but it means that there is a core of Truth. It&#39;s really hard to argue he never existed at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what I&#39;m talking about lol. Jesus and his cult is attested by Josephus, writing in the 1st century, and by Tacitus, a pagan Roman senator, writing in the second. You can&#39;t argue that a man name Jeshua never existed...there were LOTS of Messianic figures in Judea at the time...it was a very rebellious place...that he was executed by the Romans and his followers started a cult around him isn&#39;t hard to imagine lol... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tacitus also got his info from the fact that actual Christian cults existed in his time...and said they worshiped Jesus. He merely reports it out of hand in like 2 sentences of the Annals...</p>

<p>You can argue Jesus isn&#39;t god all day long...but to say that someone named Jeshua just didn&#39;t exist and that Christianity is made up whole cloth goes against the very nature of myth making...there is always a core of Truth. That an influential Messianic figure named Jeshua was executed makes perfect sense...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the Gospels and Acts were composed AFTER Paul&#39;s letters.</p>

<p>Gerd LÃ¼demann says: </p>

<p><em>&quot;Not once does Paul refer to Jesus as a teacher, to his words as teaching, or to [any] Christians as disciples.&quot;</em></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><em>&quot;Moreover, when Paul himself summarizes the content of his missionary preaching in Corinth (1 Cor. 2.1-2; 15.3-5), there is no hint that a narration of Jesusâ earthly life or a report of his earthly teachings was an essential part of it. . . . In the letter to the Romans, which cannot presuppose the apostleâs missionary preaching and in which he attempts to summarize its main points, we find not a single direct citation of Jesusâ teaching.&quot;</em></p>

<p>According to Richard Carrier, Paul&#39;s letters indicate that Cephas etc. only knew Jesus from DREAMS, based on the Old Testament scriptures.</p>

<p>1 Cor. 15.:</p>

<p>&quot;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins <strong>according to the Scriptures</strong>,  and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day <strong>according to the Scriptures</strong>, and that He <strong>appeared</strong> to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that He <strong>appeared</strong> to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; then He <strong>appeared</strong> to James, then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to one untimely born, He <strong>appeared</strong> to me also.&quot;</p>

<p>The Scriptures Paul is referring to here are:</p>

<p>Septuagint version of Zechariah 3 and 6 <strong>gives the exact Greek name of Jesus</strong>, describing him as confronting Satan, being crowned king in heaven, called &quot;the man named &#39;Rising&#39;&quot; who is said to rise from his place below, building up Godâs house, given supreme authority over Godâs domain and ending all sins in a single day.</p>

<p>Daniel 9 describes a messiah dying before the end of the world.</p>

<p>Isaiah 53 describes the cleansing of the world&#39;s sins by the death of a servant. </p>

<p>Psalm 22-24 describes the death-resurrection cycle.  The concept of crucifixion is from Psalm 22.16 and various other passages in the Old Testament.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but his writing is important because it describes the events of <em>his</em> time. By the 60-70&#39;s AD there were already Christian followers, which Josephus records. That is what is important...that there were already followers. Like I said, you need to look at the meta picture. This doesn&#39;t mean Jesus was god but it&#39;s good evidence that Jeshua existed, and had people that followed him. What they did after his death is totally up for debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the strongest case to me is Luke. He writes like a historian, except for the early parts of his gospel where he probably copy pasted lots of existing information, but Acts is solid history.</p>

<p>Also it seems clear all the disciples kept in touch with each other - if we have a couple dozen letters that survived, there were likely many hundreds actually written. Even documents that later became heretical still point to a very real phenomenon at that place and time.</p>

<p>Finally, it seems fair to say that very strong traditions have some initial propellant, even if we cannot see the entire picture of the launchpad. In this case it seems not unreasonable to weigh the scatter of the atoms against the energy that scattered them. </p>

<p>If you are interested in reading a rigorous argument of why Acts is not history from a Biblical scholar you should read the work Richard Parvo did on Acts.  He did a version for layman that is fairly affordable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. To provide a little broader answer, not just about Moses, but about the Patriarchs in general, two scholars independently reached these conclusions, and published their work, relatively close together. The first was Thomas Thompson, already referenced in this thread, and he wrote &#39;The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives&#39;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Historicity_of_the_Patriarchal_Narratives">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Historicity_of_the_Patriarchal_Narratives</a></p>

<p>The second was John Van Seters who wrote a book called &#39;Abraham in History and Tradition&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK let&#39;s bypass Moses then and head towards Abraham.</p>

<p>Do you believe Abraham somehow culturally typifies the cessation of endemic and/or occasional human sacrifice in pre-Iron Age Canaan? Could that be a clue to something else? Is the aversion to human sacrifice unique to that tribe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No to all those questions.  In fact I would say that there are many clues in the Tanach that human sacrifice was condoned and practiced by communities that are responsible for these writings. For example, in the book of Joshua,  the &#39;dedications&#39; to YHWH consist of war booty, which often consists of human beings.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, but the need to find such a cultural type would yet remain, and in the same general direction. In other words if Abraham didn&#39;t exist, we would have to make an Abraham up.</p>

<p>We know human sacrifice was endemic among the Canaanites, Phoenicians and later Crathaginians, close cousins to the Hebrews, let&#39;s say in the range of 1000 - 800 BCE. We know that by the time of the second temple the Jews already had a strong reputation concerning sacrifice and cleanness that suggests they had institutionalized a non-human sacrificial system. Their reputation in that regard within Classical times is pretty well established.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t follow.  Changes in the ethical system don&#39;t need to be mythologized. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know this, in fact the archeological evidence strongly negates the thesis of this &#39;endemic&#39; and supposedly wide ranging practice.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know that by the time of the second temple the Jews already had a strong reputation concerning sacrifice and cleanness that suggests they had institutionalized a non-human sacrificial system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t have a lot of data to accurately reconstruct religious practices of the second temple. What data we have comes from preserved writings, and they support a view of extreme religious plurality, in both belief and practice.   Many of these claims are anachronisms and mediated through theological lenses. </p>

<p>I would argue that the &#39;lens&#39; most appropriate, when reconstructing ancient history would be interpretation of material data through archeology, and an analysis of ancient texts through scholarship that is scientifically informed.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Composed AFTER the letters of Paul, Mark and Matthew were INTENDED as symbolic fiction, being written in a symbolic chiastic structure.</p>

<p>Only with Luke-Acts did Christians start to view the four Gospels literally.</p>

<p>The sayings of Jesus in the Gospels are things Paul originally said. See Nikolaus Walter&#39;s âPaul and the Early Christian Jesus-Traditionâ.</p>

<p>The events in Mark and Matthew are based on the LXX, directly borrowing its language:</p>

<p><strong>The Donkey(s)</strong> - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.</p>

<p>Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).</p>

<p>Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.</p>

<p><strong>The Sermon on the Mount</strong> - The Sermon of the Mount relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isaiah 50.6-9.</p>

<p><strong>The clearing of the temple</strong> - The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed &#39;Canaanites&#39; to &#39;traders&#39;.</p>

<p>When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).</p>

<p><strong>The Crucifixion</strong> - The whole concept of a crucifixion of Godâs chosen one arranged and witnessed by Jews comes from Psalm 22.16, where âthe synagogue of the wicked has surrounded me and pierced my hands and feetâ. The casting of lots is Psalm 22.18.  The people who blasphemed Jesus while shaking their heads is Psalm 22.7-8.  The line âMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?â is Psalm 22.1.</p>

<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong> - Jesus was known as the âfirstfruitsâ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself. </p>

<p><strong>Barabbas</strong> - This is the Yom Kippur ceremony of Leviticus 16 and Mishnah tractate Yoma: two âidenticalâ goats were chosen each year, and one was released into the wild containing the sins of Israel (which was eventually killed by being pushed over a cliff), while the otherâs blood was shed to atone for those sins. Barabbas means âSon of the Fatherâ in Aramaic, and we know Jesus was deliberately styled the âSon of the Fatherâ himself. So we have two sons of the father; one is released into the wild mob containing the sins of Israel (murder and rebellion), while the other is sacrificed so his blood may atone for the sins of Israelâthe one who is released bears those sins literally; the other, figuratively. Adding weight to this conclusion is manuscript evidence that the story originally had the name âJesus Barabbasâ. Thus we really had two men called âJesus Son of the Fatherâ.</p>

<p><strong>Last Supper</strong> - This is derived from a LXX-based passage in Paul&#39;s letters. Paul said he received the Last Supper info directly from Jesus himself, which indicates a dream. 1 Cor. 11:23 says &quot;<strong>For I received from the Lord</strong> that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread.&quot; Translations often use &quot;betrayed&quot;, but in fact the word <em>paradidomi</em> means simply âhand over, deliverâ. The notion derives from Isaiah 53.12, which in the Septuagint uses exactly the same word of the servant offered up to atone for everyoneâs sins. Paul is adapting the Passover meal. Exodus 12.7-14 is much of the basis of Paulâs Eucharist account: the element of it all occurring âin the nightâ (vv. 8, 12, using the same phrase in the Septuagint, en te nukti, that Paul employs), a ritual of âremembranceâ securing the performerâs salvation (vv. 13-14), the role of blood and flesh (including the staining of a cross with blood, an ancient door lintel forming a double cross), the breaking of bread, and the death of the firstbornâonly Jesus reverses this last element: instead of the ritual saving its performers from the death of their firstborn, the death of Godâs firstborn saves its performers from their own death. Jesus is thus imagined here as creating a new Passover ritual to replace the old one, which accomplishes for Christians what the Passover ritual accomplished for the Jews. There are connections with Psalm 119, where Godâs âservantâ will remember God and his laws âin the nightâ (119.49-56) as the wicked abuse him. The Gospels take Paul&#39;s wording and insert disciples of Jesus.</p>

<p>I have talked to baptist evangelists with bullhorns.</p>

<p>I&#39;m giving you an opinion. That&#39;s all. I think it&#39;s a problem in your arc of presentation, which characterizes both you and your subject matter. Religion is not true or false like chemical weights or the acceleration due to gravity. It&#39;s a fine tensile fiber that runs through society&#39;s core. In places it is frayed and knotted. Else, it is smooth and strong. If you do not like my mode of presentation, well, at least we&#39;re even.</p>

<p>This is really outside my knowledge, but in my limited view, I think this broadly captures subsets of thinking in the ancient world. I just don&#39;t know enough about the scholarship on Origen to assess the claims about what he conceived as &#39;the soul&#39;.  You know how difficult ancient mysticism is!  </p>

<p>While that is an interesting topic, and I am interested in the shift to interiority, which is attributed to Christianity, some even go so far as to attribute it to Augustine, it is straying away from the proposition about historical methods.    </p>
