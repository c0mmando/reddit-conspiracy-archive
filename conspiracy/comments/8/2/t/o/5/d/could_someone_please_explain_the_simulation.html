    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you mean...some people honestly believe we live in a simulation. The idea is that since we can see over the near-technological horizon, and the conception and development of simulated realities is seen as possible in the near future, then it is likely that this technology, once developed, was already developed, and that we ourselves live within a simulation, nested ad infinitum. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really subscribed to this. What I find more interesting is Holographic theory...based off the Holographic principle, it posits that all information contained in a 3D space can actually be encoded on its 2D surface, which basically describes the event horizon of a black hole...this opens up the possibility for black hole universes, and the idea that we are potentially nested within a universe, within a universe, etc; but that each is just as real and exotic as the last...that the Universe naturally creates more Universes within itself...</p>

<p>Pretty crazy either way but fun stuff regardless...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet, to add to what you said ...</p>

<p>People see that in the future we will be able to simulate reality. They think given that this will become a possibility, it&#39;s highly unlikely that we would be the first to develop a simulation, and that it&#39;s instead most likely that we are a simulation (possibly within a simulation, within a simulation, etc..) that is about to develop a simulation.</p>

<p>that we exist inside of a &quot;true&quot; universe that came into being, spontaneously, out of nothing, about 15 billion years ago, and that all our present knowledge indicates that we are alone in this physical universe. We&#39;ve evolved over 4 billion years, and just in the last 50 we&#39;ve been able to conceive and implement incredibly detailed computer simulations...and we&#39;re just at the infancy of our technology.........</p>

<p>..........or all this happened quite some time ago. Somewhere else.  And we&#39;re inside of a simulation, the technology behind which we could barely even grasp if we were told.</p>

<p>The idea is that if it&#39;s possible to simulate things, and it seems it is because we&#39;re doing it, then there is only 3 possible solutions :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No civilization is old/advanced enough yet to run those kind of simulations in meaningful numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>For whatever reason, civilizations are just losing interest in simulations during their development so they don&#39;t exist in meaningful numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>There is civilization which is advanced enough and still willing to do simulations. In this case, you&#39;re mostly forced to be in one because millions or billions of simulated realities would exist while there would be only one real world.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk if that&#39;s actually what a holographic universe theory proposes. From my understanding, it means that all matter contains within itself, regardless of size, the entirety of the universe and existence encoded in its &quot;dna&quot;. At the smallest known measurement to man, the Planck length, when calculated against the measurements of the largest known black hole, it is very close to being identical in density to that of a single atom mathematically. </p>

<p>A holograph contains all of the information of the entirety of the holograph within itself, regardless of how small or large you cut the pieces of said holograph. </p>

<p>This theory proposes that all information in all matter that makes up the entire universe is contained within every piece of that universe regardless of size. This explains consciousness as a sort of feedback loop that exists in nature, which allows for patterns to form and life to be created. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of explain it like this:</p>

<p>Our universe is like a graphics engine using light to render matter fractally to create a &quot;simulation&quot; of the data/information. There is a natural underlying framework balanced in perfect equilibrium jitterbugging (spinning and collapsing in on itself) faster than we can imagine, creating a refresh rate of infinite HZ on our monitor. The graphics engine can potentially render the entire dataset from any single &#39;viewpoint&#39; or &#39;node&#39; within the simulation (meaning it is holographic), but it only renders what is &#39;observable,&#39; determined through interacting systems on any scale causing interference &#39;feedback.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual explanation for relativistic time dilation is even more elegant, so elegant in fact that it is one of my favourite examples of mathematical beauty in physics. Imagine that you&#39;re on a vehicle--a car, a plane, a spaceship, whatever you like--that is travelling one km/h slower than the speed of light (also known as the constant C). If you would get up from your seat and start running in the direction of movement, your velocity relative to a reference frame outside of the plane would be higher than C, which is impossible. The universe &#39;solves&#39; this problem by having time slow down aboard the vehicle, so that you seem to move slower to an outside observer and thus stay nicely within the cosmic speed limit.</p>

<p>What I find more interesting is Holographic theory...based off the Holographic principle, it posits that all information contained in a 3D space can actually be encoded on its 2D surface, which basically describes the event horizon of a black hole...this opens up the possibility for black hole universes...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The basic idea is as you describe, but it doesn&#39;t imply any possibility of a &quot;black hole universe&quot;, whatever that actually means.</p>

<p>The holographic principle is a statement that there exists both a 3+1 dimensional description as well as a 2+1 dimensional description. It doesn&#39;t tell us much about cosmology or &quot;what the universe is&quot; or anything like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many accounts of a place beyond this one from people who have gone there and came back. Details are hard to come by, however, as it seems to be a place that defies linguistic description.</p>

<p>People have gone there both voluntarily (by ingesting DMT, a chemical that is excreted during sleep and also before death) and involuntarily through actual death and medical re-animation leading to so-called Near Death Experiences.</p>

<p>The vague and sparing descriptions we have share great similarities across individuals, mechanisms of getting there, and also across time and cultures, indicating that it is in some indescribable way an actual place, be it physical, metaphysical, spiritual, or psychological (assuming those are somehow different things, which I don&#39;t think is so).</p>

<p>In my view, there is enough evidence to assume that there is some real phenomenon that is occurring, but not enough evidence to provide a comprehensive description or explanation for what the hell is going on with all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insight, I didn&#39;t know that it wasn&#39;t established conclusively.</p>

<p>Afterlife could be a misleading term to use, too, as there is no reason to think it&#39;s not the same &quot;realm&quot;, for lack of a better word, that we came from in the first place. I&#39;m also not sure if it&#39;s a universal place, a parallel dimension to this one, a subjective psychological space, or something else entirely, but it&#39;s curious that the experiences of Near Death survivors tend to be very concrete and very similar. It&#39;s also curious that the realms we enter when on specific psychotropic drugs tend to be very similar across individuals, and I suspect there&#39;s a link between these phenomena which we don&#39;t really understand at all yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is a battle on Earth for our souls.. if you aren’t in tune with a loving vibration, you will stay stuck on Earth until you learn. The way the media fights conspiracies and the idea of God makes t too obvious for me.. I’m 25 and I’ve had the feeling something is very off about this world since I was 18 and after 7 years of doing all the research and stuff related to the occult and what the bigger picture is, the afterlife is a no doubt thing.</p>

<p>You have a soul, if it’s always negative like how the MSM want to keep you, then like how the guy above described, you become trapped here on Earth.</p>

<p>No NDEs for me, but I have enough personal experience and research for me to have the 100% in the afterlife and this time I’m excited to see the other side and not come back to Earth... I have a feeling the “end times” of this age are soon and after this one, there is no reset button like the other mass extinctions.</p>

<p>If this implicates being separated from God for all eternity, THEN PEACE OUT EARTH ✌️</p>

<p>Us as individuals are nothing more than computer programs.  We aren&#39;t alive.  We don&#39;t actually exist in any physical sense.  We&#39;re just AI and everything that we think is realy/physical is just because we&#39;re programmed to accept it as such.</p>

<p>There&#39;s actually a good amount of science that backs this idea up.  For example the planck length.  The Planck Length is the smallest unit of distance with any solid meaning.  Basically a pixel.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also dark matter and dark energy.  Science has determined that our universe should have much more mass than it currently does so we came up with &quot;dark matter/energy&quot; to explain it away.  If this is a simulation then the numbers could be off because our universe isn&#39;t actually what we think it is.  It&#39;s just a &quot;level&quot; or an &quot;open world&quot; type video game.  Something like the Truman show but on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Then there is the fact that electrons and other particles exist as a wave until they are observed - basically the same thing as a &quot;map&quot; on a video game that has not loaded till you access it.</p>

<p>Then there is the mandela effect.  For the sake of this comment lets just assume its real (if its not then just disregard this part of my comment).  Some believe that the mandela effect happens because the simulation we are in gets updated, no different than a webpage, and some items that should be updated to reflect the changes are over looked.  This could include pictures, but also memories since if we are simulated our &quot;memory&quot; is just pulling from a database somewhere.</p>

<p>The big bang and &quot;coming from nothing&quot; would be no different than when you load up a video game.  Before you hit the power button the world and characters of that game did not exact, but then bang, there they are.</p>

<p><em>The second type of simulation is that the simulation we are in is actually natural.</em>  </p>

<p>Our consciousness has manifested this reality/simulation naturally and everything we experience in this physical realm is akin to a dream.  It&#39;s real in the sense that our consciousness is unable to distinguish the truth nature of our reality, but nothing here is actually physical.  It&#39;s all in our collective consciousness.  Kind of like Inception.  We are all in the same dream together, but its still a dream and not actually physical at all.</p>

<p>Something that backs this idea up is the experiences people have when taking shrooms or LSD.  Almost everyone gets a new outlook on what is &quot;real&quot; after taking those things.  Almost everyone reports seeing beings and having the sensation that they are &quot;waking up&quot; from the simulation and entering the true reality.</p>

<p>The idea of having a soul that goes to heaven after dying would align with this concept as well.  Many other religions outside of Christianity also believe in higher levels of consciousness too.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Someone else mentioned the holographic universe, and I personally believe the holographic principle is what this universe is based upon, but I don&#39;t think it has to be separate from the simulation theory either.  I do believe that a simulated reality could be holographic whether real or naturally simulated</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really gets me is that when you look at the odds we are in a simulation, those same odds apply to the ones doing that simulation (1 level above us). And so on and so on. How many simulation levels might there actually be? Hundreds? Thousands? milions? If there is one single intelligence in our universe/simulation somewhere advanced enough to do their own universe simulation program, that adds one more level to it, until an intelligence in that one does it too. How far are we from the top? And the weirdest part, that one single universe that created the first simulation, what is it like there, since they have had the most time to advance? And the scary thing.. if one computer doing the simulating in the chain of simulations crashes, all those universes below that one will crash as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you mention the WoW NPC&#39;s...</p>

<p>My best friend&#39;s husband passed away 3 years ago. We were in a top 100 US guild together for a very long time, and though her husband was never part of our core raid group he was a part of the guild as a friend invite. He was very sick and on disability toward the end, so he was logged in a lot on different alts, doing various things very often. Right up until a week or so before he passed. His favorite toon was his hunter. </p>

<p>A couple guildmates ended up working for Blizzard, and one in particular seemed to move up the ranks there fairly quickly over the years. To make the long story short, my friend&#39;s husband <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=110789/kettric">is now immortalized</a> in the World as an NPC. She&#39;s said that even though it&#39;s clearly not the real him playing his character beside her like all those years together, sometimes she logs on her hunter to go into Trueshot Lodge to &quot;see&quot; him. Something about being able to do that is really special to me - a little different than photographs or a headstone.</p>

<p>Figured I&#39;d share the story since it&#39;s somewhat relevant. He was a great guy and I&#39;m happy he got a permanent place in the World he loved to play in. Now, if <em>I</em> go before my Blizzard buddy, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll troll the shit out of eternal me and use the Patchwerk model or give me the Marge Simpson haircut I always HATED for my undead warlock. -__-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well described. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another thing for you: the finiteness of the speed of light. When you think about it - why should it be finite? this doesn&#39;t derive from any fundamental principle, kind of like Planck length. These are attributes of our universe that limit the &quot;humans&quot; (as in sentients) from going too far or too deep. They are representations of boundaries.</p>

<p>After all, if we could somehow get to other planets elsewhere easily, imagine how much more memory would be required to then simulate all those as well. So better keep them out of reach - at least until more &quot;memory&quot; can be packed in (at which point we may discover that the speed of light is not a scalar like we thought it was, or that there were ways of getting around it. Or we may just - all of a sudden - discover a few tachyons).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, if you were to study Physics in some depth, the wave particle duality actually makes lots of sense. It is also extremely elegant.</p>

<p>A little primer; waves and particles are two different ways of transporting energy across space. One is electro-magnetic, the other mechanical. Of course, in everyday life, the mechanical interactions (visualizable as one particle hitting another) is the most immediately accessible. But once you accept that energy can also be transported through distance (action at a distance) without actual contact of physical entities, then it&#39;s easy to understand why something like waves become necessary.</p>

<p>Another example is heat - especially when transported through space. Say from the sun. Obviously it can&#39;t be purely mechanical, so physicists found another transport means through distance and called it &quot;wave&quot;. The hard part to visualize is not that light travels as a wave, but that it also has a particle nature, under certain circumstances. That particle aspect does not however become manifest in our macro world. But it obviously has to be something like that when a light photon &quot;packet&quot; &quot;pushes&quot; an electron from one state to another.</p>

<p>So, no, you need not believe anyone. Indeed, if you can come up with alternative ways of explaining both macro and micro worlds, the more power to you. many do not &quot;believe&#39; in Quantum mechanics and indeed, Einstein himself was one who just didn&#39;t care for the &quot;statistical &quot;nature of the Micro-world (god doesn&#39;t play dice, he said. Though may be he didn&#39;t know god, who might just like to jest). There are many others who keep trying to prove Quantum mechanics wrong. Alas, the burden of finding an equally successful alternative is on them.</p>

<p>PS no white coat here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the speed of light isn&#39;t a finite speed. </p>

<p>The speed of light is always 1c no matter how fast or slow you, yourself is moving (even if you move at 99.9999999...% of the speed of light, light will still travel at 1c relative to you. Spooky). </p>

<p>Please remember that everything in the universe is moving, nothing is standing still, so you have to consider everything from your own frame of reference. Earth moves at about 107000 km/h relative to the sun, and the solar system moves at roughly 800,000 km/h relative to the Milky Way&#39;s center. Then of course the Milky Way moves relative to the local cluster, etc, etc.</p>

<p>So why is this important? (lets forget laws of physics for a second) If you manage to move at the speed of light, 1c, then time and distance seizes to exist. From your frame of reference no time has passed and you have traveled no distance (actually you would occupy everything in the universe all at the same time), but from an outside observers perspective you have certainly traveled a certain distance and taken a certain amount of time to do it. Speed of light is a funky little thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about that that always weirded me out was that light itself would experience no time since it travels... at the speed of light. So if light could think, its journey from its star across millions of lightyears of space, to you, would occur instantaneously. </p>

<p>The whole relativity thing always bugged me when I try and imagine it. If Im moving at .999c through empty space, it doesnt really mean anything. To me, time is flowing normally. But when you compare yourself to anything else, say Im moving at .999c relative to earth, then time is flowing very slowly for me even though everything seems normal. When I got back to earth it would be far in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought experiments are an interesting concept. Especially when we try to approach  limits asymptotically.  </p>

<p>Here is a funny conundrum: as the speed of a particle increases, getting closer to the speed of light, its inertial mass increases (ie it takes more and more energy to &quot;move it&quot;). Yet the things that do travel already at the speed of light are massless: photons, neutrios (big debate about the latter due to some experiments). The ink spilled to walk through this conundrum could fill a small ocean.</p>

<p>Relativity presents many such dilemmas. To your point - you can get perhaps ever closer but never reach your &quot;destination&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.</p>

<p>One thing you didn’t really cover, is the distinction of does consciousness reside inside or outside the simulation.  In your first example, you kind of imply that the consciousness is inside the simulation, similar to some people’s belief that consciousness is created from the matter within the brain, so if the matter doesn’t exist outside the simulation, consciousness couldn’t either.  I don’t really subscribe to this theory.  I think our consciousness exists outside of this 3D body, and controls this body as an avatar.  So like a video game, I exist outside the game, but the game creates the physical body that I control.</p>

<p>The other thing you didn’t really cover is the nesting of simulations.  I think originally we pool our consciousness together to create the reality we want to cocreate in.  But I think that if you look at our current situation, we are closing in on the ability to create virtual worlds within a computer system that will be identical in realism to the natural one (but maybe at a reduced scope in size?)  So if we’re at that point, than the option has to exist that perhaps we aren’t in the original cocreated reality, but one that exists within a computer that is within the original cocreated reality.  Maybe we exist within a computer created reality, that’s within a computer, that’s within a computer, that’s within a computer … that’s within a computer, that’s in the original reality.</p>

<p>A third type of matrix would be the limitations of our belief systems.  It’s pretty clear that the so called elite are sending us to schools that corral us into being working stock for corporations and the elite.  They are flooding the channels with misinformation, so that we struggle to have an accurate understanding of reality.  Furthermore, we continue to have an increasingly virtual presence, where we are connected more through virtual realms of games, cell phones, etc. and less through natural methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a long-time atheist, discovering simulation theory has been the first thing that has instilled doubt in my mind about the atheistic view of our universe. </p>

<p>It also gives a new perspective (added weight, even) to a number of major conspiracy theories, particularly the Apollo moon landings hoax.</p>

<p>If we are in a simulation, then it is not completely unreasonable to posit that the creators built in finite boundaries to our simulation - aka &quot;Earth&quot; - that the simulants (humans) must remain within. Perhaps we cannot leave the confines of our simulated world anymore than Mario can go beyond the boundaries that the SuperMario game producers put in place.</p>

<p>For us, the boundaries beyond which humans cannot travel might be, say, 10km below the surface of the &quot;planet&quot; (too hot thereafter), or 1000km above the surface of the planet (the so called Van Allen belts being too hot/radioactive beyond this). </p>

<p>The United States and the Soviet Union would have become aware of our planet&#39;s boundaries early on the space race, as they attempted (and were unable) to leave the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Perhaps they agreed not to reveal the truth about it because they thought humanity wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it. The USSR even stuck to their promise when NASA hoaxed the moon landings.</p>

<p>I believe Neil Armstrong&#39;s White House speech about discovering &quot;truth&#39;s protective layers&quot; possibly alludes to this.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.nikoskorpio.net/2016/04/30/truths-protective-layers/">http://blog.nikoskorpio.net/2016/04/30/truths-protective-layers/</a></p>

<p>Finally, if we are living in a simulation then many highly &quot;fringe&quot; conspiracy-type theories, like intelligent design and flat earth would suddenly seem not so far fetched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed I personally think it&#39;s a mixture of all 3.</p>

<p>Since you seem like you could help me understand this better, in emergence theory it&#39;s my understanding that our interpreted reality is made up of a 4D quasicrystal that is a projection of a 8D crystalline structure. </p>

<p>First question how did we come up with the E8 lattice and not a 9D,10D,11D etc? </p>

<p>Second question if we know our preserved reality is only 4D and we know it is coming from a source with more dementions than we can currently experience. Could this help explain the missing dark energy\ matter in our reality? </p>

<p>I think we are all connected to everything by something deeper than quantum entanglement. Could it it be that spirituality and the supernatural are just natural phenomenons that interact with these other dementions of our reality that we can not\have forgotten how to perceive and interact with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two more things re your nicely drawn descriptions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The assumption that &quot;if we can simulate a universe then we must already be in a simulated universe&quot; rests on a hypothesis which is &quot;intent&quot;. We (cf. future version of us) must WANT to build &quot;ancestor models&quot;, because we think we would. That hypothesis presumes, effectively, that something akin to &#39;curiosity&#39; is the single most fundamental attribute. IOW, for anything to be dynamic (as opposed to static), and our known universe is indeed dynamic, the &quot;desire for change&quot; (rather than just &#39;change for its own sake&quot;) is the most fundamental attribute that underlies not just our universe but any universe that we (or a future advanced &#39;we&#39;) would care to build. I always thought that the famous book &quot;an experiment with time&quot; by Dunne (which posits infinite, contained time lines) offers  interesting correlations to this question of &#39;change&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a second fundamental attribute which underlies the Simulation theory, namely, gamesmanship. If we are part of a sophisticated universe constructed by a future version of us, then judging by the universe we see, playing games must be fundamental. As in a &quot;desire to play games&quot;. Looking at human history, one can&#39;t help but revel at some repeating patterns and coincidences. It&#39;s like there are &quot;rules&quot; but the &quot;making of rules&quot; is part of the game. As in we always want to be the ones who are in a position to make the rules, as well as impose the, All wars can be reduced to this one little model &quot;he who has the gold, makes the rules&quot;. Yet we are each locked in our own consciousness which is governed by our finiteness. For this last one, Heidegger may have had some interesting things to say (Being and Time).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So I had one of my &#39;science fiction&quot; dreams the other day. I don&#39;t remember it exactly but it was something about our memories being written over, using a different operating system. I, the dreamer knew it, but others didn&#39;t. The world was kind of grey, an all built-up futuristic skyscrapper world. WE could walk or sort of float in it, but we did not have access to our own original memories. But there was a way around that - I chose to have a reload of the &quot;operating system&quot; which, for a period of time allowed the old memories to surface, sort of, and for a time everything acquired color, and there were real people around, and real thoughts. Then , as time went on, the new planted memories would take over and everything would slowly fade to grey again.</p>

<p>The dream turned into a nightmare when I was told that one can go through this )somewhat painful) reboot only 8 times before the &quot;system&quot; crashed permanently (as in a failing hard drive). And i was on my 7th time and had to make a decision.</p>

<p>So I decided to wake up.</p>

<p>I believe this is a bit how the simulation must work. periodically there are updates and suddenly we all know something that may have happened, except for a few of us. Because no update is perfect and there are glitches in The matrix. So sudden;y one of us will remember something quite differently than the way everyone else does. That happened to me four or five times. It can be something small, or something more consequential. </p>

<p>Also, my dream was no doubt inspired by the failure of two of my hard drives simultaneously. One of which was the backup I used. been busily trying to salvage various bits and pieces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the craziest thing about the speed of light is that it is one of the only things in the universe that <em>isn&#39;t</em> relative.  If you aren&#39;t moving at all, light will move away from you at 671 million mph, if you are chasing a light photon at 90% the speed of light, that light photon <em>will still move away from you at 671 million mph.</em>  It&#39;s because the speed of light is the speed of time, it always moves away from you at the same rate because the closer you come to approaching it&#39;s speed, the more time slows down.  Once you&#39;re theoretically going the speed of light, time just doesn&#39;t happen.  </p>

<p>It really makes you wonder, though, how come light doesn&#39;t move infinitely fast if it isn&#39;t constrained by time?  The fact that there is a &quot;speed limit&quot; in the universe is very suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fermi Paradox could be solved by the simulation theory.  </p>

<p>The idea is civilizations eventually create a virtual reality advanced enough to render their wider participation in the physical world obsolete.  Economic and social activities would transition to the simulation.  We already see a little bit of this with social media and the internet.  So we don&#39;t see any interstellar civilizations because they are just playing around in the outernet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fermi Paradox is stupid, and not a real paradox.  We are such a miniscule speck even in the galaxy, the idea that we &quot;should have&quot; a clear signal of life is just evidence of how self absorbed we are.  The radio signals we&#39;ve been sending out into space take years just to reach the closest star, hundreds of years before anything significant in our galactic arm, and tens of thousands of years to span the galaxy.  And that is just 1 out of billions of galaxies.  What type of intergalactic civilization would communicate with something as archaic as radio waves? They will have almost certainly surpassed the light-speed barrier.  </p>

<p>Something like the Prime Directive is most likely a big part of galactic life, it is not right to interfere with a growing civilization, especially a bunch of monkeys with nukes.  </p>

<p>And lastly, we do have evidence, there are literally hundreds to thousands of recorded sightings every single day.  Metallic objects with extremely advanced propulsion systems fly around the earth constantly, it is a very real phenomenon.  </p>

<p>Nothing against your idea, I just don&#39;t like the Fermi Paradox, it&#39;s always thrown around as if it&#39;s some sort of proven scientific tenet, it&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you fully understand the logic and observations that are the foundation of the theory.  </p>

<p>Its not just radio signals.  Thinking in terms of Kardashev scale, a species capable of interstellar travel within our galaxy would almost certainly leave traces of some sort such as megastructures in space, satellite clouds, harvesting of solar energy on a massive scale.  We see no evidence of this when we examine stars.  </p>

<p>Space travel to other stars is incredibly difficult.  A species capable of intergalactic travel to other galaxies would be unfathomable to us.  They would be so advanced as to be nearly indistinguishable from a God-like, all-powerful entity.  </p>

<p>The radio signals we send out are weak but even very strong signals are limited by space and would take years at best to reach other planet systems.  Another problem besides travel for an interstellar species.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the person you are replying to does give a decent argument against the paradox, he forgets about how time can amplify things. There is no reason to think that aliens evolved around the same time as us. There are planets that are far older than our own that could have supported life. A civilization with a mere 10,000 year head start on us would likely be far more advanced, let alone a million or billion year head start. If we manage to survive another 10,000 years, we will likely be able to travel the galaxy. Any aliens that may be out there could have done the same. So, either we are the first, or we are alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re completely ignoring much of my post.  If aliens followed a prime directive of non-interference, then we wouldn&#39;t see them, even if they were there.  </p>

<p>Why assume that a galactic civilization would make a giant noticeable mark on a galaxy? As I explained to the other poster, megastructures like dyson spheres are completely unnecessary if you can harness an energy such as zero-point or antimatter, it makes all massive scale construction obsolete.  If anything, your civilization being completely visible to anyone who wants to look into the sky makes you a <em>target.</em> </p>

<p>Our telescopic capabilities are not good, we can&#39;t see much of anything on a solar system scale.  We can only infer the existence of planets by the dimming of stars, we certainly can&#39;t see them.  Also, most galaxies we do see, we are seeing them as they were millions or billions of years in the past.  It&#39;s basically impossible to see a distant galaxy at the resolution needed to see life.  </p>

<p>Also, you can&#39;t just simply rule out UFOs, people record legitimate craft almost every day, it&#39;s a real phenomenon. &quot;<em>If there are galactic civilizations, where are they?!?</em>&quot; They&#39;re right fucking here, flying around in our atmosphere every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, we can&#39;t see megastructures, at all.  We can <em>barely</em> even tell if there are planets in other solar systems.  Maybe some of the objects that pass in front of distant stars and dim their glow are megastructures, we honestly can&#39;t tell at this point.  </p>

<p>Harvesting solar energy using a dyson sphere is an unbelievably inefficient and cost-intensive way of harnessing energy.  Judging by the propulsion of UFO craft that we see all the time, they use an other form of energy, that is likely orders of magnitude more powerful than fusion in a star.  Most people say it&#39;s taken from the &quot;zero-point field.&quot;  As Feynman said: &quot;The energy in a single cubic metre of empty space is enough to boil all the oceans of the world.&quot;  If aliens could harness this type of energy, a dyson sphere would be completely obsolete.  </p>

<p>I understand the Sub-lightspeed travel problem and it seems pretty apparent that a galactic civilization would have solved it.  The strength of the signal doesn&#39;t matter, all radio waves propagate at the speed of light.  Why do you assume an intergalactic species has to be unfathomable? They could just be little grey men that tapped into zero-point, found the dimensions we can&#39;t see and phased into them to bypass spacetime.. or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple people hit the topic straight on with a lot of people trying to tie it to something else. Let me reinforce what it is but then speak to the probability of it.</p>

<p>The simulation theory states that we’re all computer programs. If you know the computer game “The Sims”, imagine that you and I and everyone else are Sims and the world we live in is that game environment. Clearly our universe is rendered many many times more elaborate and immersive, but really, how much computing power would it take to get a realistic lifelike version of The Sims?</p>

<p>It all boils down to developing the technology necessary to simulate a universe. Even from that, you don’t need to simulate an entire universe, but just the observable universe. Our technology is <em>almost</em> good enough. Maybe in just a few more years we will have computers powerful enough to simulate a universe from The Big Bang and then let the simulation run its course.</p>

<p>Why simulate a universe? Well, imagine if you tweak the variables just slightly enough at the beginning to get a very different universe. If you set up enough universe simulations with observable Earth-like planets then you’re sure to eventually see an advanced civilization rise up. Since it’s a simulation, you can easily fast forward millions or billions of years to see how other civilizations may rise or fall. Since you have the ability to go forward or back in time (think of these simulations as a YouTube video. There’s no reason you couldn’t skip ahead on time to see how your variables play out).</p>

<p>If you have a few simulations running at the top level, then within the simulations they run, there’s bound to be simulations that can reach our technology level or beyond, meaning that those civilizations would also be running their own simulations. With enough computing power between all the different layers and layers of simulations that could exist, it becomes almost certain that we are living in one of those simulated universes as opposed to the “real, original, top layer”.</p>

<p>Whether our civilization gets to the point that we can simulate universes, it’s really a moot point. If we can get there, taken there’s no reason to believe we’re in fact the top layer. Instead, our universe is likely a simulation that’s within another simulation. Hell, we could be 100 simulations deep from the “real world” and we would have no idea.</p>

<p>Our simulation may not even have anyone observing it or playing god. Perhaps it’s just a computer that was set up to run 10.000+ simulations and is only going to alert the creators if our universe or civilization reaches a set defined parameter. We could easily be a “throwaway” universe that doesn’t meet the requirements they’re looking for, so they’re not going to bother even looking at our universe. That still wouldn’t stop us from creating our own universes which could create their own and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>What does that mean for you and I? Not very much from my perspective. Whether this is real or not had no bearing on the outcome of our lives. We all still just have our 100 years of life, so we might as well make the most of it whether we happen to be in the real universe or just one of the infinite number of simulations.</p>

<p>It’s pretty much like impossible for us to test if we’re a simulation too. We have our set of rules and physical laws, and since we can’t change the parameters outside of that, we have no way to test it. Still there are some things to consider that suggest we are a simulation. </p>

<p>Someone mentioned how an electron changes once it is observed. This behavior is similar to a video game. When you play a game, the entire game isn’t loaded up and rendered. You only load one level at a time and even then it loads in pits and pieces only where the player can see. This reduces the amount of processing power needed. There’s no reason a computer simulation wouldn’t work the same way.</p>

<p>It’s the most interesting “conspiracy theory” on my opinion since the logic behind it points to it being practically 100% certain that we are in fact in a simulation. Really really interesting stuff to me.</p>

<p>Look up “The Simulation Argument” by Nick Bostrom. As far as I can tell, that was the first scientific thought put towards this topic and does a good job of outlining why it’s almost a certainty that we’RE in a simulation. For an interesting movie that kind of deals with this, watch “The Thirteenth Floor”. It probably goes without saying, but also watch “The Matrix” and “Inception” if you haven’t seen these two very popular movies since they deal with this idea on some level as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simulation theory in a nutshell:</p>

<p>Computer technology is a relatively simple technology and has developed from from Pong to realistic 3D games indistinguishable from real life in just 80 years. Knowing this, we can check the simulation theory on those premises.</p>

<p>Any advanced species will develop some kind of computing to outsource calculations and make it easier.</p>

<p>It is highly unlikely that we are the first advanced species to exist in the universe.</p>

<p>Therefor it is highly likely that some species has already developed advanced computing, therefor has advanced simulation.</p>

<p>So many people think that an advanced simulation would have to simulate every atom in the universe itself and that the computing capacity would be impossible to achieve for any kind of technology. Those people have not understood how modern video gaming works.</p>

<p>Basically we have two methods for advanced simulation, that makes universe simulation actually achievable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>vector and voxel technology, basically instead of simulating every pixel, we use math to interpolate the pixel to infinity</p></li>
<li><p>map loading, basically we only load what we can see and need, therefor all other galaxies and far enough stars could be simply an advanced form of background. with our technology we could never check because they are too far away</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If an advanced species runs a simulation, and it is highly likely that such species exist, they will at some point in time try to simulate worlds and universes just like we do for games.</p>

<p>If there is only 1 single species in the universe who happens to run an universe simulation, then it will be impossible to tell if our universe is a real existing universe or a simulation.</p>

<p>Simulation theory now is trying to find out if we are indeed in a simulation and how we can verify or break the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s stupid. It&#39;s basically: If a universe could be made of purple cheese, and time exists long enough, then statistically eventually there must be a universe made of purple cheese, therefore we must live in a universe made of purple cheese. Only replace &quot;purple cheese&quot; with &quot;a simulation&quot;. Basically it&#39;s argument by lack of imagination: &quot;I can only think of one possibility, therefore that possibility must be true!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard conspiracy mongers like Linda Moulton Howe make allusions to something about iterations, like our laws of physics supposedly show evidence that the universe has gone through iterations, and simulations work by going through zillions of iterations and examining them. But they never explain wtf they are talking about thoroughly, and I can&#39;t find any articles on the internet about it.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong but it seems that proving we do or don&#39;t live in a simulation from within the simulation is empirically impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren’t even close to what the simulation theory is about. If we can simulate our universe, and that simulated universe can do the same, then it is infinitely more likely that our universe is simulated. To try and test for it, we can look for this in reality that behave like we would expect a simulation to behave. Some evidence of that is the Planck length and the constant speed of light making the observable universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome comment below, can&#39;t really add much onto that. I just want to say one thing though: With the way that we&#39;re heading with technology, AI and VR particularly. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see us building some sort of simulated reality (whether it be entirely AI or full blown immersion) in the next 100+ years.</p>

<p>The general idea is that if we&#39;re able to accomplish such a task, the idea that another species/civilization has done it before us and that we are currently living in said simulation. (This comes with the AI idea).</p>

<p>This has been my view on it, but other comments are interesting as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of the matrix version.</p>

<p>The discovery of the higgs field gives credence to the idea that the physical universe isn&#39;t itself, rather a bunch of indicators which interact with another &#39;dimension&#39;; one which is infinite in energy. These indicators which our physical universe is made of, indicate to the higgs field how much mass/energy to let pass through into the universe which goes onto manifest matter itself.  </p>

<p>Then one might think, that if this is true then this (physical universe) might be some kind of &#39;simulation&#39; as if it exists in a computer like thing or something that is a part of another greater thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read into it too much. However, my understanding is this:</p>

<p>If we lived in a simulation, there&#39;d be virtually no way to detect it. Anything you try to point to could be explained as just a quirk of physics. The time it takes for a simulation would be irrelevant, as we would only experience time at a rate proportional to how fast we&#39;re simulated. </p>

<p>I think the idea of being in a simulation is close to meaningless. Would the parameters of your life really change? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo it’s a byproduct of reason relying on the implication and the inability to prove one’s axioms. If you understand the universe, then you can computationally model it (or at least sub parts). Upon realizing this, we note that if this is the only kind of understanding we can have of the world, then the world is indistinguishable from one which is itself a computational model.</p>

<p>So,  IMO, it’s just another way to phrase that we are in Plato’s cave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll use the video game Minecraft as an example of my own personal theory. In the game the world is procedurally generated, which means that as you move around, the map is somewhat randomly generated based on where your character is located, let&#39;s call this the focal point. While playing, you can look around and see the world. But everything that you don&#39;t see has not loaded in yet. They do this to save processing power. Now imagine that earth and our immediate vicinity is a focal point. It&#39;s loaded in just like what you would see on your screen in the game. The computer couldn&#39;t run the entire universe at once due to the amount of processing power it would take so instead has a focal point which would be us and procedurally generates what is beyond us. Also planck length acts the same as a pixel. Technically we are pixelated just like the character in minecraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When scientists run experiments they do it multiple times and from the variance they trace a form from reality.     (re:maxwell). This internal abstract form is used to perceive external reality, so there are infinite number of possible forms. Hume&#39;s principle (adding some Bergson too) states that nature is chaotic but by applying our abstract forms we are able to perceive a course of action within the chaos.  This helps engineer solutions to reality problems, which is mostly the point.   However, when our path of action is not immediately clear to us to engineer such solutions YET ALSO we are presented with a perception of a reality based on forms (like reading about blackholes in Scholastics) we are put in a position where we are invited to literalize these forms, in their infinite variety, as if they are reality.   Sad symptom.</p>
