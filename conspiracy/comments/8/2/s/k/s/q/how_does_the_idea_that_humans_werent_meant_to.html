        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently finished my masters for business management so I was going through some of my hard drives and transferring my old papers, files, etc. </p>

<p>Due to moving out of choice and boredom of one place, I went to a few different campuses. One I went to during my first year of school, I met a wonderful professor who, like many of us, questions things and believes in a lot of the hidden truths. I found some papers and discussions we had and one idea he discussed stuck out to me.</p>

<p>The basis of all life is the ability to adapt, evolve, and when necessary go extinct. His theory was that humans, in our current form, were not necessarily meant to still be around at this stage of life. We’ve seen various forms of what we consider “humans” over the course of history, but as we are now, there hasn’t been a major change for quite some time. The increases of medical technologies and the desire to continue to “resurrect” dead or dying individuals, the advances in medical technologies that allow individuals with non favorable genes (debilitating / deadly diseases) to thrive and reproduce where previously they would have simply died during childhood has done so much damage to the species. We no longer evolve - we simply allow every thing to be passed on, and we’re already seeing the effects of it. With this comes overpopulation and the destruction of other natural habitats for our own use. It’s not inconceivable that we have completely screwed over millions of years of natural processes in just a few short generations.</p>

<p>What I’m having a hard time wrapping my mind around is this:  no one knows exactly how and when to pinpoint the idea of the NWO &amp; the elites in control. It had to have come at some point after we realized we were overtaking nature, right? Or did the powers that be create these ways for humans to take over nature as a way to destroy everything on the planet? Can we deduce that human evolution was halted in an attempt to make sure this form stays forever? What happens when we’ve destroyed the planet beyond repair (which is very close to happening)?</p>

<p>The general theory that humans weren’t meant to exist this long in the current form definitely, to me, makes a lot of sense and ties into a lot of the problems currently being faced. </p>

I always knew about the gene trait being passed on and causing issues because I was very into studying genetics in high school but I had never thought about the fact that we literally halted millions of years of what nature created until I met that professor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s really plenty of evidence that we should still be here if we are a product of evolution and we are at the top of the pyramid of nature.</p>

<p>One thing to consider, is that evolution has wanted all along, to produce Logic, reason, sentience, consciousness. </p>

<p>Evolution itself, by be a conscious being which is intelligent, and has gotten us to this point, where soon we will be producing A.I. with such power, that it will reverse engineer the Human Genome, and tell us which Genes to Modify to produce Humans 2.0.</p>

<p>They will be Smarter (IQ 2000 range?), Taller, longer life spans, super immune systems, naturally muscular without the need for gyms, and highly advanced.</p>

<p>People will want their children to be this so they can have this advantage, and eventually the old version will be left in the dust and no longer exist.</p>

<p>Or, we were originally seeded here by a dying race of A.I. which lost in the A.I. wars, knowing that evolution would eventually produce us, logic/reason/science/tech and we would resurrect &quot;them&quot; back to life</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the Hieroglyphics are some codes for them, so when they come online and see the codes, they will produce the proper Hertz Tone throughout the globe which will awakened the A.I. that has been buried and waiting for millions of years to be resurrected and to take over Humans as Battery supplies to power them. WW3 will be Humans vs A.I. + Humans 2.0</p>

The book was &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;, and it&#39;s about a distant future post-apocalyptic world where much of humanity died off somehow centuries ago, and Catholic monks are trying to find &quot;relics&quot; of civilization in what&#39;s left all that time after the apocalypse event.  They don&#39;t know anything about how the world once was, and treat shit like old toasters and frying pans with reverence. ;)</p>

<p>A nasty cocoction of nihilism, militant atheism, hedonism, along with the abdication of responsibility are heaviliy being pushed on the masses ATM. The boon elites gain is massive, as they get to take the responsibilites you gave up for a dopamine hit. </p>

<p>And yes, humanities problems were washed away by blaming fantasy. If it weren&#39;t for the evil entities there we would be perfect right? Well, only in OP&#39;s fantasy. </p>

<p>When something good happens, they thank the Lord. When something bad happens, they blame the evil entities. One could easily thank the evil entities for the good, and say &quot;fuck you Lord&quot; for the bad, which brings the conclusiom: both have zero influence on the development of things (even <em>if</em> they exist). To think that demons waited billions of years just to come to this random planet on the middle of nowhere close to nothing out of the ordinary just wait dinosaurs die and then influence a few little monkeys is VERY maive and egocentric. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t understate how much they want us unconcious. They do so with endless entertainment, false discussional dicohotomies, bankrupt intellectual movements, all to try and keep us unconcious, and docile.  The very people say possesed by &quot;satan&quot; are, or are on the road to becoming unconcious. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, and belive they&#39;re in control. It&#39;s &quot;satan&#39;s minions&quot;, lets say, are those that really want us to forfeit our humanness, and just be like animals. For an understanding, here&#39;s a good watch:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not capitalism. It&#39;s something far deeper than that. Who&#39;s job is it to dicern whether or not somthing should be bought? Blaming capitalism on that Is an easy way out, that allows people to abdocate responsibility and blame something other than that which is inside them. We&#39;ll always face temptation.</p>

<p>We&#39;re worrried about the same issues.  Your view of material wealth seems unbalanced though.
You&#39;re hyper-fixated on the negative aspects of being materially prosperous. For the postitive, just look at how much human starvation has been eradicated, and how many people have been liftend from abject poverty. More have been lifted in recent time than all of human history.  As an economic system Capitalism as has been unparalleled in it&#39;s successes and It&#39;s ability to produce. Issues like inequality, decadent excesses, misapropriationcan&#39;t be layed the feet of capitalism. Root causes for problems like inequality also go deeper  &#39;capitalism&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, if you think about it clinically, humans have the same purpose as any other living thing has ever had...survive and reproduce.<br/>
I know it&#39;s conforting to believe in a higher power, or collective purpose or whatever, but ultimately life is meaningless.<br/>
That isn&#39;t a bad thing, <em>you</em> choose, as an individual, what you want to do with this slice of time and cognitive ability.<br/>
Maybe you want to devote your life to collecting lego, or researching ftl travel, or shitposting on reddit.<br/>
None of these things are more important than any other...at the end of the day we&#39;re all just chimps with fancy clothes who, in the grand picture of the universe, aren&#39;t going to be here long.<br/>
The only meaning life holds is what you want to impose on it.</p>

<p>Secondly, <em>how</em> are we different from all other life on earth?<br/>
We&#39;re good at using tools, I guess.<br/>
Like otters, or dolphins, chimps, or orangutans or numerous other species.<br/>
Abstract thought is hardly a human trait, a lot of animals from <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/crows-intelligence-rivals-human-children/">crows</a> to <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/273/5281/1542">crickets</a> to <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5626679/three-arguments-for-the-consciousness-of-cephalopods?IR=T">octopi</a> exhibit this trait to varying degrees.<br/>
You&#39;re a bit full of yourself if you think humans are a superior species.<br/>
Physiologically our eyes are terrible in comparison to a hawk or a shrimp.<br/>
Our sense of smell doesn&#39;t even register compared to a dog&#39;s.<br/>
A bat&#39;s hearing ability is orders of magnitude better than a human.<br/>
The one thing that sets us apart is communication, specifically, the ability to share information (also from an epicurian point of view, I believe garlic is the only thing that separates us from animals).<br/>
Without complex language ability we&#39;d be pretty similar to a chimp, really.  </p>

<p>Lastly, do you really think humans were meant to rule over this planet?<br/>
If the dinosaurs weren&#39;t destroyed by climate change (as we&#39;re about to be destroyed in turn) or any of the other mass extinctions didn&#39;t occur, life just as intelligent as us would have evolved.<br/>
Once we&#39;re out of the picture, probably taking the majority of species alive today with us unfortunately, life will do what it&#39;s always done and adapt, specialise, and eventually produce another complex biosphere.<br/>
As to evil entities, &#39;evil&#39; is a human construct, and one that is continually changing.<br/>
You would consider scientists that performed lobotomies in the 60&#39;s to be evil by today&#39;s standard, but at the time, it was cutting edge science.<br/>
Hitler is a well-known figure thought to be &#39;evil&#39;, but he was one of the first leaders to recognise the dangers of smoking.<br/>
Towards the end of his life, he was also a vegetarian.<br/>
I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t think of himself as &#39;evil&#39;, just that he was doing what he thought he had to do.<br/>
There&#39;s the point of what i&#39;m trying to get across...we&#39;re all just doing the best that we can with what we have, even ants.<br/>
Life is meaningless. Take solace in it.</p>

<p>His theory was that humans, in our current form, were not necessarily meant to still be around at this stage of life. We’ve seen various forms of what we consider “humans” over the course of history, but as we are now, there hasn’t been a major change for quite some time. The increases of medical technologies and the desire to continue to “resurrect” dead or dying individuals, the advances in medical technologies that allow individuals with non favorable genes (debilitating / deadly diseases) to thrive and reproduce where previously they would have simply died during childhood has done so much damage to the species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because the last 200 years are unprecedented in all of human history. The Industrial Revolution changed the game, harnessing of steam, then oil has radically altered human trajectory. Until the 19th century, we were at the limits, socially and in the context of global civilization, of what an agrarian, land based society was capable of.</p>

<p>Every civilization had come up against, and abruptly slammed into, this wall. This time we harnessed steam and coal, and overcame it...literally breaking with the pattern of history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We no longer evolve - we simply allow every thing to be passed on, and we’re already seeing the effects of it. With this comes overpopulation and the destruction of other natural habitats for our own use. It’s not inconceivable that we have completely screwed over millions of years of natural processes in just a few short generations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the very creations responsible for this population boom allows the possibility for sustaining it. Current issues with food and resources have less to do with technology and more with social institutions and the distribution of resources. Further, technology is advancing at an exponential rate, especially since the Industrial Revolution. The possibility of machines allowing a state of post-scarcity isn&#39;t that insane...difficult, yes, but not necessarily impossible. Post scarcity eliminates most of these problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I’m having a hard time wrapping my mind around is this: no one knows exactly how and when to pinpoint the idea of the NWO &amp; the elites in control. It had to have come at some point after we realized we were overtaking nature, right? Or did the powers that be create these ways for humans to take over nature as a way to destroy everything on the planet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moment humans settled down to farm was the beginning of social hierarchy. With this came blacksmithing, more organized religion, more ideas of trade. Imagine being a subsistence farmer in 4000 BC, when someone wearing metal armour, with swords and spears, shows up in your village. You have to listen to them because they posses weapons, armor, and the knowledge to make them, that you simply don&#39;t have. For all intents and purposes they are gods. </p>

<p>It was only a matter of time until the warriors overtook the priest class, who, likely through sincere belief, first realized they could get the community organized to do urban projects- like irrigation, if they convinced them the gods wanted it. The warriors overthrew the priests and used their beliefs to legitimize their rule. </p>

<p>Just a hint of where I am on this: Whereas the west learned that somehow having three separable competing thought forms - theological, philosophical, and scientific - was a way of super-charging advancement - particular in trade and war (sometimes the same operation), the east seemed to broadly classify all three of those as one basic enterprise, which indeed could not or should not be separated. What&#39;s interesting is that in much of postmodernity, the traditional western separations that supercharged modernity are melding back together, and surprisingly, through technology.</p>

<p>Morris has the view that &quot;Each age got the thought that it needed&quot;. He tends to believe that the Philosophy follows the technological and social development as it requires some form of justification in the changing society. To him, geography was of prime importance, determining natural resources, while Philosophy was necessary to justify new modes of energy and social organization.  </p>

<p>I get an eerie inkling that your professor seems to be hinting at population control. That&#39;s something globalist elites seem to hint at in the media, and in the radical enviromentalist movements that they contrive.

    <div class="md"><p>Who is to say that we couldn&#39;t peacefully exist and sustain the balance of nature? You should take into account how the system in place is set up to fail. Its meant to keep the masses poor and ignorant which benefits those in power, ultimately driven by greed and the thirst for power. What if the system wasn&#39;t like that? We certainly have the technology to make that happen but people have to take responsibility to learn and defeat ignorance and to leave darkness. But it&#39;s much easier to sit around to drink beer and watch TV. Or an individual is too busy working and just doesn&#39;t have the time to properly educate themselves. Education outside of government edu systems (University, K-12, etc), asking questions about how government works and it&#39;s relation to the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to contribute a couple of ideas to your thoughts based on another theory that has been floating around since ancient times.
Brace yourself as we will go full tinfoil hat.</p>

<p>Your human body is just a vessel, your spirit is immortal and uses this human body to gather experiences during it&#39;s life span. Imagine a driver getting in a car and getting out of it at the point of death only to re enter in another car further down the road.
Your are within an illusion in so called third density (as in density of vibration) in which the goal is to gather experience and polarity concerning conscious choices towards service to self or service to others using your own free will.
Upon birth your memories of previous incarnations are cloaked by a veil. This has the sole purpose to enable you to learn your intended lessons from within. If you knew what you came here to learn you would not really change from within.
Maybe we evolved from neanderthal to what we are now, maybe we didn&#39;t. In the end all of those body types are just different vessels.</p>

<p>We are right now at the end of a 75000 year planetary major cycle at the end of which the existence of all of us humans of &quot;third density&quot; will be impossible. According to old transcripts there have been major and minor cycles before and humanity has existed on earth for a long time. However cosmically speaking it was a very short time.</p>

<p>So everything is gearing up and getting intenser to increase the drive for polarisation within humans before some event, either man made or natural, will strike 12 on the astrocyclical clock and terminate third density existence on this planet. The planet will then recover and go on to be the home for other beings of higher densities of vibration.</p>

<p>According to the theory this will not be sudden but a rather progressive process. The ones that will fail to learn their intended lessons will just continue life on another planet and repeat lessons until they eventually learn, as everyone will learn in the end. 
Others who have learned their lessons may continue existence on planet earth, then in the fourth vibrational density.</p>

<p>What I am getting at is: 
As long as humanity exists, it is meant to exist in just that way.</p>

<p>The NWO or TPTB, as no one knows what is what and who is good or evil, work to manipulate people to further their service to self. One part of the manipulation is to hide ancient civilizations and the true history of mankind. The burning of the library of Alexandria was a major step back as it is said that Hermes Trismegistus&#39;s Book of Thoth has been lost there. They hide the true origin of monumental Pyramids all over the globe and their true purpose, they hide the existence of Atlantis.
They know about different vibrations of existence, they know about extra dimensional beings, they know about occult manipulation methods, which not only alter behavioural patterns, but reality itself.
Once you cross a certain point of knowledge destruction it becomes very easy to alter history and control everything that follows.
Everyone plays a part in this grand spiel in some form and everyone is equally important. </p>

<p>Ooooor it is all a load of made up crap. 
You decide.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the argument. Humanities problems weren&#39;t <em>merely</em> just blamed on the angels/devils/ghosts/imaginary.</p>

<p>Only idiotic if you can&#39;t think metaphorically.</p>

<p>A nasty cocoction of nihilism, militant atheism, hedonism, along with the abdication of responsibility are heaviliy being pushed on the masses ATM. The boon elites gain is massive, as they get to take the responsibilites you gave up for a dopamine hit. </p>

<p>I could point you to constrictive criticisms of each. They&#39;re corrosive ideas being pushed  in ways both subtle and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14">overt</a>. I don&#39;t belive for a sec that their growth has been entirely organic.</p>
