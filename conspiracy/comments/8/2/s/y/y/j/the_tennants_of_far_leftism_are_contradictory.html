       Equality means that we are all the same. Diversity means that we are all different. Striving for one or the other makes sense. Trying for both is cognative dissonance. 
Antifa calling for censorship of individuals with traditionally liberal views, freedom, liberty, and independence, are showing that they only value diversity if it is skin deep. Ideological diversity is apparently "fascistic".

       Race based college admissions are leveling the playing field. See, Brown people have less access to resources such as education, healthcare, disposable income....allowing a Brown person into college over an equally, maybe slightly more, qualified white person breaks the cycle of oppression. That’s not fair?

       But that doesn't make sense,  Poor white student has just as much adversity as an equally poor student of color. Why does the diversity quotas apply to even well off people of color?

       Oh you mean admissions? Yeah they are trying to give more opportunities to less privileged people. That's why they have quotas. And the supreme court seems to agree that's fine.

       Then why does it go off of race and not income or tax bracket? Isn't the rich poor disparity of opportunity much wider than any racial disparity?

       Those same universities give, "legacy," students with low scores. 
Why didn't the daily signal mention it?

       A legacy student is the child or a big financial donor, a child of a professor at that university and or a child of a previous graduate.

       Because back during the olden days before the Civil Rights legislation, 
There were separate and not equal schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because beginning with the Nixon PResidency, city schools began withholding funds from segregated urban schools and the discrimination in those separate and unequal states continued to not educate some students.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowances for test scores was used as a tool to provide an equal opportunity at a later date.

      <p>
       The same universities allow accept, "legacy," students with lower than standard test scores, do you know what a "legacy student," is? And why they get a  break on their test scores.

       I sort of believe this, I dont see race and culture an importance and shouldnt define your self. I understand why it is important to non whites but there a different between embracing and consuming culture. Yes pride a good thing but it will prevent you to be open minded to other cultures. Race and cultures is nice and should he acknowledged but it should be used as a tool to divide people or to stay ignorant.

        I think there's a concerted effort to get society so confused about everything, from gender to the shape of the earth to whether we can trust the government, that society will throw its hands up and say "I don't even know what's real anymore!" This confusion is brainwashing 101. Once enough people are confused and have no strong sense of identity, the next level of control will commence.

       I can see where you are coming from. A lot of these topics are confusing, I would even say *
       <em>

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the reasons why a lot of 'conspiracy theorists' become so dogmatic. They feel a need to convince other people to their way of thinking, to try to restore order to an increasingly-senseless world.

       People also do not understand the difference between equality and equity which fucks with policies in things like education.

Equity - give what individuals need

       As a liberal, I want to correct you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeking equality opportunity for all does not equal seeking equality except in the political arena.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeking equal opportunity means giving everyone the same starting tools in education for example,
      </p>
      <p>
       Not allowing race, religious, sexual identity be used to prevent this group or that group of this individual from entering the economic or political arena.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is conservative propagandists have spent decades screaming that equal rights for all means something is being stolen from the group that in the U.S. and other nations once had the only ticket in.

       Here is what I was saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Equality - the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a society, there are some fundamental levels of equality. A person should, for example, whether male, female, or transgender, be able to get a similar job (such as a teacher).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Equity - giving individuals what they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once equality standards are met, then equity comes into play. In a classroom, for example, Johnny who has vision issues may get special accommodations. Not every student needs those accommodations. Equity takes into account the individual circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       When basic equal rights are met, people, people should be fighting for equity at a higher level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Education is a great example of this.

       Handicapped children used to be sent to special expensive schools where they weren't taught much at all.

      <p>
       Now everyone bitches because they do learn more in regular schools but it costs.  It does not cost more than when they attended special separate schools.

       Minimum wage is another equality/equity area.

       You don't even know what diversity means.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means we are first last and always, all human.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we have different religions and social customs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multicultural means, we don't all try to be the same but that we hold that all are human and all have a few basic individua human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example,  people from different religions can co-habit in the same, community, city, state, nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But each must be held to strict human rights and not be allowed to attack someone or deny employment or housing for example 
because of their religious differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diversity and multiculturalism are the opposite of forcing everyone to believe the same thing except the one important thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That each must respect the other's right to their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This includes an agreed upon age of consent for sexual activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This includes that women have equal legal and political and economic rights as men.
      </p>
      <p>
       This especially includes that one must not  be forced to surrender their own beliefs nor impose them on others.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why we are suppose to be a nation of laws, where the law is applied equally for each citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why the figure of justice in monuments is blinded.

       Lots of conjecture there. I have to be uninformed to have the opinions I have? A typo made by auto correct disregards my entire post?

       You have to be uninformed to not know the difference between tenants and tenets, which implies that you are generally uninformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You absolutely don’t have to be uninformed to have the opinions you have, but you do appear to be uninformed, not because you have those opinions. This is a common theme among people with those opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure, it’s always a typo, but in reality it isn’t and you know that. And I know I could check your past posts and comments and find more instances of it.

       People who don’t know basic words are under-informed. People are free to think differently than me, and I won’t call them uninformed for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re building a false correlation here, pretending I’m saying anyone who disagrees with me is uninformed, but you know that isn’t what I’m saying, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had agreed with me and used “tenants” instead of “tenets”, I still would have thought you were misinformed and I probably still would have said something, because it isn’t “disagrees with me therefor misinformed”, it’s “lacks basic English skills therefor uninformed”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve just found that the same demographic of people seem to lack basic English skills, and they also seem to be misinformed. It might be prejudiced of me to assume a correlation between the two, but clearly the correlation has held up in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who lack basic English skills tend to be pushing far-right wing narratives. That’s my point.

       You're hermeneutic conjecture on my wording mistake is extremity intriguing. A very interesting pilpul tactic that I haven't seen in a while it's a nice way to distract from the post. I'll just delete this one and post it again in the morning with a few corrections. Thank you for pointing out that mistake! It is really nice to have people nice enough to proof read things and take the time to give their honest opinion. I hope you have a lovely night! :*

       Like come on you aren't even sneaky about it, you're clearly spreading right-wing propaganda. In fairness, you didn't have as many spelling errors as I would have expected to see. I would say you don't fit the mold of the kind of person I was talking about, otherwise there would be many more of these errors. I still disagree with much (but not all) of what you're saying though.

       The true left that used to believe in liberty and freedom that now believes in micro aggressions and identify politics is obviously being co-opt by Marxism. How is that not a conspiracy?

       a conspiracy is something like '9/11 was an inside job' or 'the moon landings are faked'.

       Your original post is not like either of these. It's just you talking about why you don't agree with liberals. that's not a conspiracy.
