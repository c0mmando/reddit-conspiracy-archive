    <div class="md"><p>Life isn&#39;t meaningless. The entire history of the Universe lead to this moment. The iron in your blood was baked in the guts of a long dead Star. You are literally a part of the Universe itself, sentient.</p>

<p>What does that mean? If there is nothing after Death, if we realyl are nothing but star dust, then what matters is each other. Your fellow human brothers and sisters, all blessed to live <em>together</em>, at this very point in history. <em>You</em> are the change you&#39;ve been waiting for.</p>

<p>Yes, the world is bleak. Yes the Elites still have much control- but we are in a time of great change, the likes of which hasn&#39;t been seen for ages. Change opens windows of opportunity, and though the Elite seek to use them, their inherent danger is that the <em>People</em> can use them too.</p>

<p>No snowflake thinks it is responsible for the avalanche, but they all are. This goes for the good things in life as well. As Tolkien said &quot; it&#39;s the small deeds done of ordinary folk everyday that keeps the darkness at bay&quot;. Start by recognizing how you fit into your local community, your family, your world, and working outwards from there. We are all in this together my friend, and you are <em>not</em> alone. </p>

Your actions in your life may be forgotten in memory, but not by the Universe. Everything you do effects your base Reality.

<p>Their childrens childrens childrens children will still live. The human race will go on, we may fall down and stumble, but we will continue. The Universe is going to live for a very, very, very long time. Our ancestors will learn and do things we never even dreamed. Perhaps Entropy is wrong? Perhaps we can cross into other planes of existence? Other Universes, Realities? Who is to say that the end, as impossibly far off as it is, will Truly come? The future is wide open and it is up to us in the present to make sure that the Future is everything it <em>can</em> be, by our actions now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the beauty...you aren&#39;t born with a purpose. You <em>determine</em> it. You make your own way, your own impact, your own decisions. Living for each other, and living for the future, ensures that your actions live on, even if forgotten, by the lives they shape and influence. Untold generations will follow us, just as they preceded. We must live for each other, and live for <em>them</em>. </p>

<p>200 years ago Science knew a fraction of what it knows now. As today&#39;s science knows a fraction of what tomorrow will.

    <div class="md"><p>Explaination of this is hard without using language that will make you think of archaic belief systems used to control us.
But the fact is that world religions hold firm  offering golden thresds of truth strewn throughout the tapestry of lies.
One of those cosmic truths is that &quot;God&quot;, a silly name, I believe we are all gods.  &quot;Source&quot; is a name I prefer,  really, truly does love you, uniquely, thoroughly, permanently.
Love is not the chemical response that compells creatures to mate.
It is a cosmic creationary force, and it is all-permeating.
To see like source does, learn to have love for all things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no purpose or meaning to your life im afraid. The best you can do is become aware of your existence and appreciate for the nonexistent moment that it is. You are energy and the universe become aware of itself. Interestingly, we have all actually experienced death before. It was the negative infinity before your birth. Since you were birthed from infinite nothingness into a temporary perception and then sent back into infinite nothingness it stands to reason that you will live your life endlessly. The moment of your death will be the moment of your birth and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if life continues on after you die? There is no way to know for sure. Live your life while being aware of death and recognizing its inevitability. Face death and the fear of it and you will be freer than before. Because being aware that your time here is limited gives life a special spark and relevance.</p>

<p>But what happens after death? Don&#39;t worry about that now. Live in the present. Live well and be kind, this will help you lead a happy and meaningful life and in case there is an afterlife, heaven, hell, reincarnation, ... you will continue onwards pleasantly as well.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe in reincarnation. I have through personal experience made quite clear to myself,  through a decade of meditative practices that I am more than the body or mind. But believing me won&#39;t really help, it might be helpful for a while for some to believe, but experience is more valuable in my opinion.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, as I said, whatever your perspective is, don&#39;t worry about death. Be aware of it, of the fear of it - embracing that will help give you more energy and zest in life.</p>

<p>But ultimately, you&#39;ll only really know what happens after death when you die :)</p>

<p>May I leave you with a cool quote I first read when I was just a kid, many years ago:</p>

<p>&quot;To the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. &quot;

    <div class="md"><p>It takes a certain type of experience but if I&#39;m catching that poster&#39;s jive, they found the part of themselves that extends far and beyond what we would consider as ourselves, but because in the moment of it, they understood and experienced this abstracted place as their self.  Essentially, all one needs to know they do not begin and end in the neural tissue of the brain, is a single experience in which they have perception, yet not perception of the mind or body.
I too am more than my meat and have been shown this, it&#39;s literally life changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is difficult to describe, but as you do these practices you find that you aren&#39;t really the body or the mind, but the awareness beyond both. It&#39;s difficult for me to explain how this is, because conveying such experiences over text is not really possible. Suffice to say that you can reach a point of ecstasy and freedom where you are freed from the limitations of the body-mind vehicle, at least temporarily. Thus this is more like having glimpses into your infinite nature. In the east one of the words used for this is Satori.</p>

<p>One could then ask how I can know that this experience isn&#39;t simply a chemical reaction in the brain. All I can answer to that is - you will know it when you experience it. You will see and feel that you are beyond the body and the freedom that you are is not merely confined to the material. It is a knowing that comes over and over again, at full awareness, not a dream or illusionistic daydreaming type experience and thus impossible to really convey through words.</p>

<p>But again as I said, I&#39;m not sure if believing or disbelieving me can really help. What will help the most is really living life and finding the value in every moment. I just wanted to peak your curiosity a bit and make you think of the possibility that there may be more to life than just the material experience :)</p>

<p>To find more meaning in life I would still recommend a meditative or introspective practice (even writing a journal counts and can be extremely useful for bringing your limiting  thoughts and emotions to light and getting to know yourself beter). Through it I&#39;ve also found that life is inherently meaningful and that no matter how much apathy or pain there is on the surface, there is always peace, freedom, love, meaning and purpose underneath. Sometimes you just have to dig for it a little, face your inner pain and embrace it and dispel the fog with your awareness.  For all of that, any work that helps you bring to light your pain and misery (which we all have) and helps bring you into the present moment, your seat of peace, happiness and power, is useful. </p>

<p>Meditation, simply being more mindfull and aware, conscious in your everyday life, being more aware of your emotions and thoughts....all of these things in my experience slowly help bring you that little bit closer to the peace and freedom that is always underneath any apathy, fear or inner struggles. Knowing yourself, knowing this moment, being able to sit still in silence - all of those are great keys that may be useful. </p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t think your main issue is related to death or knowing what happens afterwards.  You simply feel life is empty and you are in apathy - or so I&#39;ve discerned from your post. That is why what I&#39;ve written above and that sort of path may be more helpful to you than thinking about what exactly happens after death, which is something that can be difficult to know for certain.</p>

<p>The meaning, the spark of life is here now. It is underneath the fog of your thoughts and emotions. Look within, face and dissolve them and you will see that there is a lot to live for. Be aware, be present in this moment, listen to the silence, observe the space. Peace is there,  it&#39;s everywhere,  it&#39;s the background stillness of all existence.  You just have to become more and more aware of it, you just have to shift your awareness ever so slightly. And that stillness is also joy, it is also love, it is also freedom. It starts subtle but it evolves over time if you give it your attention.</p>

<p>Best of luck :)</p>

But unlike the rest of the average joes we are wide awake and fully aware of the corrupt elites and the one-world government conspiracy so technically our minds are already free. In terms of life being meaningless it really depends what you want from this life because ultimately we do have control over our lives and one of the key ways to fully establish a fulfilled life and a life that isn&#39;t being micromanaged  by elites is to have financial freedom. Money doesn&#39;t buy happiness but it sure as hell does solve plenty of problems; not to mention the connections and influence that come with it which by then you would be able to bring forth the change that you desire.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_ULZCnGu7Q">sticky tape on the lunar module</a>.</p>

<p>Is it possible that they are trying to encourage those of us with functioning brains to see through the lies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know how you feel; I felt the same way; then I came across dmt. Now I realize that sure in the grand scheme of things my existence is a finite blip but it is my blip. And it is ok if it meant nothing to others. The point is to better yourself. Some try and find it in material and money or lust of the flesh. And happiness will be found but it will  be fleeting. And like drug addicts those same people will lash out into  the darkness for their next fix or handbag or bmw or submissive ect. But a wise person can not impart wisdom on those that do not seek it for they will not comprehend it. Instead they will laugh a ridicule the wise one. So just work on your meaning. Its super frustrating sometimes but try to  except, forgive and have mercy on the ones that do it to themselves. </p>

Why would he do that? most of his content is behind a $20/ mo paywall and he wants you to pay him. </p>

<p>Most of his points just point to a basic lack of understanding of research, science etc.</p>

<p>He believes that there is no space, no planets, no moons, earth is not round, does not orbit the sun, all of history is fake, all wars are fake, nukes don&#39;t exist, atoms are fake, dinosaurs are a lie, evolution is a hoax etc...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bother engaging him because he won&#39;t add anything, he wants you to pay him for his genius, I mean he call himself worlds greatest skeptic on his website. He will, however, troll and ask &quot;why&quot; repeatedly like a 3 yearold play the &quot;why game&quot;... although sometimes he substitutes why for evidence, impossible standards of evidence (that he never applies to his own malformed and still born thoughts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life is meaningless except for whatever meaning you give to it. It is difficult to stand firmly on nothing and by your own authority say, &quot;this has meaning (to me)&quot;. Wealth, slavery, jobs, war, kids, etc. everything has no meaning. You are on a ball of mud circling a minor star. What you do with your time is up to you. You will be forgotten, and even if you weren&#39;t what does that actually have to do the the conscious being you are now? Many people turn to religion because it gives an external meaning; a cosmic purpose (however vague and without proof). Where do we go from here? We stand naked before a meaningless universe and do the best we can despite our limitations (or jump off a mountain (the universe doesn&#39;t care either way)). </p>

<p>work on not having to work.  the paradox is that you have to work on yourself and your skills so you can earn enough money to not have to worry about money.    (yes yes its a paradox)</p>

<p>shun materialism and move towards minimalism.</p>

<p>then work on your health and fitness.  natural healing is true you just need to eat clean and excersize.   research veganism for health and get into something like cycling.</p>

<p>don&#39;t have kids (optional but really works for me).  </p>

<p>ditch TV radio and newspapers.....( this helps a lot)  cut down on screen the dopamine rots your brain.</p>

<p>get into juicing....  you will feel amazing.</p>

<p>be the change you want to see, do no harm and walk lightly upon the earth.  the universe will reward you in ways you cannot yet imagine :D</p>
