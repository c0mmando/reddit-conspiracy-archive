       Both parties are shady as shit. That's why I don't mind trump because he freaks his own party out
On the reg. Why shouldn't we critique the Democratic Party? Obummer had 8 years to change shit for the better. We had a black president and yet you can still got to federal prison for smoking a plant.

       I never said you shouldn't. But people will upvote anything negative about Hillary or democrats, without even reading the link in question. This place is basically the donald lite.

       No Russia is not innocent, but it's irrelevant.  Muh russia is about Trump colluding with Russia to win the election.  Muh russia is the 1.5 year long witchhunt that has turned up nothing but nothingburger after nothingburger after spin-off consolation prize like manafort.  Meanwhile, Hillary colluded with powerful croneys to cheat our election system from the inside, and it's public knowledge but no burning of the witch.

       It's clear you only see what you want to see. That's called confirmation bias. Both "sides" get trashed and called out here (I've been here for ~8 or so years),
       <em>
        as they should be.
       </em>
       Whether one gets "called out more", is completely irrelevant and frankly, untrue. Take your partisan goggles off, the world will be far more clear, when you do.

       No it isn't. And it's not a partisan issue, because I'm not a democrat either. You can sell almost anything negative about Hillary on this reddit and people will buy it. But post something negative about trump(that isn't about weed) and users downvote and dog pile on you. I was skeptical about the Russian shill claims until I started visiting this sub and others like it.

       Look this just isn’t true. It depends on what thread you pop into. If you pop into a “pro” trump thread then yeah sure you see one side dominate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pop into a “Trump Collusion” thread and you see the other side dominate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve gotten upvoted/downvoted en masse on comments that are basically the same theme, only difference was what thread I was making the comment in.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent you see anti Hillary threads, it’s because a startling number of well known and publicly credible “journalists” dined privately at John Podesta’s house during the campaign season. She was the media darling and Trump was evil and his supporters nazis despite Hillary being an equally giant piece of shit in her own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a conspiracy sub, Hillary was a media darling the entire campaign despite being a warmongering, no principals, devil woman. Users here don’t take kindly to that. Not to mention most people here probably think Hillary has contracted to murder a number of people that is above zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re in r/conspiracy. You can have political debates here, but Hillary’s been a political ass hat for 30 years, don’t be surprised to see her baggage trotted out often.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will talk Trump Russia too, but not if you approach it with an arrogant tone that it’s a forgone conclusion because CNN, MSNBC, etc. report on Mueller’s work with about as much regard for accuracy as the National Enquirer and who Kim K is f***ing this week.

       Both party leaderships are two sides of the same coin...but one of those sides has complete control over the institutions of government, and the other is effectively marginalized.  It doesn't make sense to focus on the latter as opposed to the former.  Clinton's a criminal, sure, but she isn't president.  Trump is.

       I saw exactly what the democrats did to free speech on reddit in the run up to the election. Fuck the left. But fuck the right equally. Left vs right is the made up fight,
For those who'd prefer to remain out of sight.

       I'm not saying Hillary is good. But this is ridiculous. Something is going on, either people are just genuinely stupid or this sub reddit is being influenced in a specific way.

       For the most part people on this sub are slowly emerging from the CLINTONS ARE THE PUPPET MASTERS OF THE WORLD fever dream, given that 2016 kinda proved their impotence.  The Uranium One stuff is usually scoffed at, for instance, and Sean Hannity's rambling nonsense is laughed off.

       The prevalence of anti-Hillary content shouldn’t be of concern. There are legitimate reasons to be suspicious of Hillary, and there’s every chance she would have been worse than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s in the past though, and Trump is actually President now. What should be of concern is the hostility towards ideas that are critical of our President and our government as it is right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t blame anyone for not defending Hillary, but it’s pretty unbelievable the lengths people are willing to go to in order to defend Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump’s a smart guy. He probably planned it this way from the start, when he was stirring things up in the birther movement.

       So I have been on this sub for a while my whole two years on reddit and let me tell you it was really awesome before the 2016 election. It was a land of awesome discussions and theories, and really cool people, and it I loved every second of it. Then the election case and I expected a lot of politics because of course it’s an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened was a bunch of early Bernie supporters and Bernie haters, and Hilary is sick/Hilary email post and a few a very small few trump supporters. Then Bernie lost and the onslaught of Hillary began (which I could tolerate because I personally hated her) after that came an odd uptick in not trump supporters but Hilary opposers, people who posted to convince other people trump was the right pick because anything was better than Hilary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then somewhere along the line trump won and pizza  happened and this sub basically became the_donald 2.0 for an entire year. People were awful and I mean that, the post were ridiculous, almost all about Hilary, trump draining the swamp, the same recycled pizza post you’ve seen ten times, or some misogynistic post about how woman are awful. It was so awful that I left, unsubscribed for 2 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came back around Thanksgiving maybe? It’s been better than it was, some days you see more conservative post, and Hilary bashing and misogyny, and everyone go buy guns because I’m fear mongering. Then other days you see more liberal post that are like look at the stupid shit trump did today (I don’t honestly see many liberal post liberals comment more than post in my opinion) but mostly the post have gotten better, there have been some big events like Florida and Vegas that have sorta taken over.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day there are ALOT of trump worshippers here (go ahead and downvote me guys, it’s just the truth) and a few stubborn liberals trying to fight with them, which causes divide, which in turn can make this sub frustrating. However if you can try to ignore the bullshit and just read what interest you or looks like it contains actually legitimate useful information you may find it’s not as bad as it seems on a surface level. I lean liberal but am more anti government than anything and hate the climate this sub has been at since the election but I do my best to try and get past all the echo post and silly anger baiting post from either side although sometimes I can’t help it ( as I had a multi comment argument with someone on guns the other day)

       No Russia is not innocent, but it's irrelevant.  Muh russia is about Trump colluding with Russia to win the election.  Muh russia is the 1.5 year long witchhunt that has turned up nothing but nothingburger after nothingburger after spin-off consolation prize like manafort.  Meanwhile, Hillary colluded with powerful croneys to cheat our election system from the inside, and it's public knowledge but no burning of the witch.
