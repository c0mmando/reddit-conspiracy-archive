       He was well known around here and I've seen people say a couple times that we don't hear from him anymore. He went from full throttle posting to nothing, so somebody was bound to check his account and see what's up.

       His account was suspended 3 days before the 13 Russian Troll were indicted, so either Reddit knew about what was coming down the pipeline or it was just a coincidence.  I noted it in a couple comments from back then, because it seemed like an unusual time for it to go down.  Although I myself have had an account shadow banned for no perticular reason, so anything is possible.

       I'm not saying they were a Russian troll, only the timing seemed odd.  In fact, I've speculated they were banned in the lead up to the indictments so reddit could act like they were doing something about it when only banning specific vocal users.  Kind of like the 13 indictments were of Russians running a click farm operation rather than trying to influence the election.

       Do you suppose a mod could come over here and explain how this happens - I mean, do they give the user notice, let him explain anything suspicious, or mount a defense? I mean, are all Russian citizens banned - or accounts originating on a Russian server, or what?
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens to all their post history? I am already having weirdness with my conversations with CaptainAppollton in my history. Am I suspect just because I had multiple conversations with him (usually very friendly even tho we did not see eye to eye on many issues).

       I could see the outrage if Russia had actually changed the outcome of the election by hacking actual voting machines and changing the tallies.

      <p>
       But this is a really stupid witch hunt.  It's the WORLD WIDE web.  Of course you're going to see content from Russians living in Actual by god Russia.  And if the Russian government has something they want said on the interwebs it's by god gonna be said.  And if anyone REALLLY thinks some damned Russian trolls  adding a handful of voices to the innumerable random opinions someone finds browsing the web changed the outcome of the vote...

       The issue is not the fact they influenced the election, the issue is how they did it. They are being accused of a massive covert state funded operation to influence the US election through social engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       They allegedly did so by creating massive numbers of accounts fraudulently identifying themselves as Americans as to gain the trust of real Americans they intend to influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They allegedly used the members they embedded into US community groups to spread and amplify false news articles. They allegedly did so in coordination with members of one of the candidate’s campaign team.
      </p>
      <p>
       In today’s global society it’s impossible to be free of foreign influence, but there are definitely lines that can be drawn on what would be considered unacceptable. If Putin comes out and says he thinks Trump would be a great leader, that’s perfectly fine. If Putin spends millions in a covert operation to help Trump’s chances then he’s most definitely crossed the line.

       Are you serious??? This is insane!

       The entire nation was stunned and confounded by being presented with an off-field candidate D Trump in 2016. He was not even on our radar prior to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile we had the first openly socialist party candidate for president take off with Bernie clearly out-politicking Clinton.

       How the hell did Clinton beat Sanders? How the hell did Trump beat Clinton? We don't know.

       I know for damn sure no Russian had any effect on my vote. I voted, as I always have, for a 3rd-party candidate, with pride, in the ability to do it.

       What the actual fuck?
      </p>
      <p>
       How did Clinton beat Sanders? Easy, Clinton is a household name and is synonymous with experience and wise policymaking in most households(I'm a Sanders supporter but my parents voted Clinton, because they knew her). And Clinton made sure to setup the Democratic Primary and media coverage to heavily favor her.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did Trump beat Clinton? He didn't act like the election was his from the get go, he put on a populist mask, talked in layman terms, managed to spin his inherited wealth and business experience as good for the country, and he campaigned in the right states unlike Clinton who ignored several key states.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has pinned Trump's presidency to be caused by Russian trolls, just that so far it has played in a part in securing some votes for him. If you're so ready to believe that MSM, Reddit, YouTube, and Facebook are in on some evil plan to influence and censor the internet you better damn well believe that Russians ran sizeable operations in order to disrupt the 2016 election. Our intelligence agencies support it, our allied countries' intelligence agencies support it, Mueller has indicted several Russians who've confessed to it. And if you still decide to continue to yell that Russians did no wrong, despite having a reputation of trying to disrupt Western democracy for a while now, and that our allies, government, Reddit, Google, Facebook, and MSM are all lying bastards you need to reevaluate some stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nice that you can say your vote wasn't influenced by Russia, but you put too much faith in the average person's ability to identify legitimate sources of information and falsified manipulative propaganda. Get something shared, tweeted, upvoted enough and it will seem legitimate and get spread to gullible people.

       Oh no, you put too little faith in "average persons". This is a democracy. That means everyone votes. Under the bell curve, the vast majority of us are "average persons". Or did you mean that "superior persons" would do a better job selecting our leaders? That would be... the bankers? ...the scientists?  Well maybe its too late and that is where we are in this country. But if it is, tell us. Because we may have something to say about it...

       There's plenty of proof that multiple members of the Trump campaign has had undisclosed contact with Russian officials. Things like
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.html">
        Felix Slater's email

       , to

        Trump Jr's meeting
       </a>
       to
       <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/jared-kushner-russia-back-channel-testimony-2017-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">
        Kushner's back channel
       </a>
       . Those are just the major ones, there are dozens of smaller events tying Trump's campaign to suspicious activities involving Russian officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       More facts are coming to light as a part of Mueller's investigation. Under corroboration from domestic and multiple foreign intelligence agencies congress has deemed there to be irrefutable proof of Russian election meddling. As a result they have passed sanctions on Russia that Trump has continuously delayed, and last I heard, refused to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if think there's "no proof" then it's only because you've got your eyes and ears closed. Also for your information, Trump did try to turn it around by alleging Hillary committed massive voter fraud. He launched an investigation that turned out evidence they didn't want to see so he scrapped the investigation and destroyed all the documents.

       it's been what a year? How many indictments does he have related to Russia.  I'm not saying those guys are angels but there is literally nothing to prove any sort of Russian government collusion with Trump's campaign.

       We DO know though that the Democratic primaries were rigged and we didn't even need Russians to do it.  If you fixed a football game or a horse race people would be going to jail.  you defraud millions of people into donating extensive time and significant money into a political campaign in what they believe to be a fair primary and that's just fine.

       Fuck off you shill cunt.  The Russia story is so piss weak it's not even worth talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about British influence in US elections?  Why is that not mentioned?  British banks have a huge influence on elections in the US.  They even have a say in who gets to run.  Trump was okayed by them too.

       I hope I don't get banned for always posting about how the "Trump-Russia collusion" story is a bunch of bullshit, and how every day the story falls apart a little more.

       But I don't think he was banned for that anyway. Peyote was just rude, and used a lot of "no-no words" when talking to people here because he got too emotional about it. He gave them the perfect excuse to ban him, really.

       mumpitz ... the story you talk about is a fake news story on the fake news paper thedailybeast
      </p>
      <p>
       as when this would be even a story ... banned accounts on reddits are a non story because its jsut 2-3 clicks to make a new one
