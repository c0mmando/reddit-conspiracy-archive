       I was at work when one of my coworkers wanted to get on the topic of quantum mechanics.  He apparently studied nuclear physics at Florida university.  This made him an expert on the topic somehow.   I entertained the convo a little as he seemed really geared up for the discussion.  I personally am not educated on the topic and wasn't able to offer much convo with content.  I was trying to engage the topic though by offering up quirky/fun questions.  Like "do you think time is linear?" or "since The law of conservation of energy states energy can not be created or destroyed what was it's origin?" I was attacked personally and belittled in front of a crowd of my coworkers that had decided to become this guys audience. It was really disappointing to have been present in that situation and see people behave that way. My question still stands though and Im looking for a well articulated response to the question.   Do you think time is linear why or why not?  I personally do not.

       My argument for this same response while at work is that's it just a measurement of light.  Its  How many times we revolved around the sun and turned on our axis.

       I have this idea that we exist in a moment of eternity, but our remembrance of the past and expectation of the future creates this illusion of flowing time.

       The ravages of time, however, are not a human concept.  If time is space, at least according to the General Theory of Relativity, time is a sort of universal constant.  However, I do not believe in the General Theory of Relativity because it does not exactly correspond to the real world - so as a working field theory, I believe it has failed.  For the General Theory of Relativity to work there should be space-time waves everywhere; shit does not happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the effects of time are definitely measurable, so something is happening - science currently is just not sure exactly what is happening.

       Western science and empiricism is so far up its own arse that I doubt anyone that studied physics there has much clue is up when it comes to the sort of questions you ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you'd be way more at home looking at Eastern things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The failings are pretty clear when it comes to topics like this. Science having no real ontological basis really struggles pinning down things like time and infinity. They get brushed under the carpet.

       People who have a habit of being the smart person generally don't like having that sort of thing sprung on them. I've come across so much hubris, arrogance, douchebaggery and lack of rationality from the supposed vanguard of such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you mean but I think it's interesting and a function of the prevailing culture that you ask if it's linear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most previous cultures firmly believed in the cyclic nature of time. It was only thanks to Galileo (an artillery gunner) that we came to view time as one long linear chain of stuff from big bang to the now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short answer to your question would be it depends what you view time as and where you're standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I quite like the holofractal outlook on things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of the holofractal, there is no time, it's a static thing. Inside, time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within it, can it be non-linear.. sure.. ever taken DMT?
      </p>
      <p>
       That feels pretty non-linear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time as you're talking about it is a property of mind I think. Other sorts of time, like cycles and periodicity and whatnot fall into a different bucket.

       You're perfectly right according to all the physicists and books I've read about Quantum Mechanics. Time isn't linear, which is not to say that we don't physically experience it in a linear way, which is a very different thing and where the problem arises.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of time and all possible events and outcomes exist simultaneously and rather than any time passing, we, or rather "our consciousness" is actually passing through that already existent time and in doing so steadily unfold our own physical experience in multiple frames of three dimensional space.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all likelihood something like several billion such frames per second considering that's what the smallest energetic particles they have been able to detect seem to be winking in and out of existence, or being replaced in a "new frame" by another which is what leads me at least to interpret it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to cast aside any Newtonian and materialistic ways of thinking that aren't and never were correct. Energy is not some property of matter and entropy only exists because there is no such thing as an isolated system, not because there is. All matter is simply an expression of quantum energies that are essentially all that is, ever was, and ever will be and it all exists within the same single instant of Creation that we are always in. That ever-present "Now" if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard to give you an analogy. You could say that those quantum energies are the paper and ink that we are writing and communicating our physical narrative on and through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being as completely immersed in creating and being the story as we are, we are unaware of "the medium" that facilitates it or that our consciousness induces what we then physically experience as being our role and participation in that narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All forms of science by nature of their own definition and self-imposed limitations take all physical existence and our physical reality simply as "a given".
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions regarding the true nature of that reality itself and how it comes into being or what purposes it may serve are all more properly philosophical, metaphysical, and psychological ones.

       Honestly I think it’s impossible for the human brain to comprehend something as just “being” and not having been “created” and/or “destroyed”.
      </p>
      <p>
       What created the universe? If it wasn’t created, how did it come to be? How can it have always just “been”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Truly smart people realize the section of “what we don’t know” is clownishly larger than “what we know” despite our impressive technological advancements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally view individuals who speak confidently on matters as confounding as the nature of the universe and for that matter, reality itself, as some of the absolute dumbest muthafuckas in the game honestly.

       I honestly have no idea. I only have what I've been able to observe and reports of what other people have observed. For all practical purposes, time as I experience it is linear. Maybe time isn't linear, but using a linear approximation seems to work to suit my needs. I would use the curvature of the Earth as an example. For the typical scale of construction and activity, it works to assume you're on a flat plane, but we know that the Earth is an oblate spheroid. Whether time loops around onto itself doesn't seem to affect me in the scale of time that I'm able to interact with and observe.

       I've experienced a weird phenomena recently where time as "sped up". No I don't mean the ol' "time feels faster as you get older" phenomena. What I mean is, when this phenomena is occurring, it takes me longer to due mundane tasks than it normally does.

       I think our perception of time within our illusory existence is indeed linear. 
However as everything exists in cycles, time will exist in cycles aswell which would make it one giant linear loop.
