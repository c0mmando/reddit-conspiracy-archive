<p>No it doesn&#39;t.  People downvote shit all the time for no reason.  Especially other post submitters thinking if they downvote your post right away, theirs will rank higher.  Plus people on <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a> just clicking upvote/downvote without much thought.  It doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to be a bot.  Could be.  Isn&#39;t a given.</p>

<p>Also on mobile I can&#39;t remove a downvote. I can only turn it into an upvote. Somethings don&#39;t deserve an upvote so they get stuck with my accidental downvote. This skews the system obviously but only microscopically. </p>

Although it was fun watching my coworkers get hosed down by the fire crew. But no, the 3 individuals who were transported were fine and the tests came back negative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d chalk it up to the placebo effect and hysteria. The 3 people were completely fine and mainly just transported for safety purposes. The other 9 people didn’t experience symptoms, they were just in the vicinity of the exposure area. I’m good friends with two of them and they were completely fine. I wish I could tell you something interesting or something more complex is at play here, but it’s not. It’s some crazy person just sending letters through the mail and fucking with us. The letters don’t even contain any information; the hand writing isn’t even legible. Other minor incidents like this have been going on for as long as I can remember. It’s just the area and the base being a good target. </p>

<p>I would imagine that a chemical attack these days would include some of the extremely potent opiate derivatives coming from China. Maybe the powder was carfentanil ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the nail in the coffin for the deep state including the MSM will be that they keep repeating their methods and tactics over and over again. This makes sense because they have been very effective strategies to date, but once you see the pattern, it serves as a signature or modus operandi marking all the false flags and psy ops they have had a hand in. Essentially, it creates a house of cards effect, admit to one, and it is only a matter of time before the rest come out. A good metaphor is when they capture a serial killer and he/she&#39;s methods expose all the other killings.</p>

<p>The parallel between modern day anthrax and other white package scares is of course the unabomber.</p>

<p>They create or select a believable persona or type of event that they then use to hijack to push an agenda.</p>
