        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been a lot of shootings and terror threats since Trump has assumed office. It feels like there have been quite a few more than when Obama was in office.</p>

<p>Why? Is this just a coincidence that all of this is building up as Trump became president? Or this the deep state lashing out at Trump? Or could these events be staged by Trump himself to “unite people against a common enemy” like Bush did with 9/11?</p>

<p>Because correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t Trump de facto in charge of the Executive branch, including the FBI? Or has he had no control of his government all along?</p>

<p>Just seems weird that these events keep taking place at such a rapid pace, and each one seems to generate more controversy than the last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah sorry, I misread. Thought you said you’d been at one yourself.</p>

<p>Well, let’s start with evidence of a gunshot wound or damage from rounds striking something which can be traced back to the event itself without any ambiguity.</p>

<p>For this, there would need to be evidence of a round striking someone or something on camera, and that person or thing later shown to display damage commensurate with the alleged round that was fired at it.</p>

<p>With so many shootings to choose from, there must surely be a single piece of footage and the corresponding physical evidence that can tick this box?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just taking Parkland as the latest example, how anybody could see the various inconsistencies and bizarre details as evidence of a &#39;lone wolf&#39; truly makes me scratch my head.</p>

<p>Even if you believe that a shooting took place, it has to be the least likely of all the shooter scenarios given the rest of the padding.</p>

<p>But then again, no shooting did take place, did it. There isn&#39;t any evidence for it, unless you believe the lies you are fed by the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the shit I like. Any time a terror event happens we are supposed to skip the part where we are proven that it really happened. When you ask questions like you just did it throws the whole game plan awry. They don&#39;t count on being able to present a realistic shooting, they just hope people will accept it at face value and then hurtle into their partisan debates and speculative pseudo-theories like &quot;second shooters&quot; and &quot;arms deals gone wrong&quot; and whatever else. </p>

<p>Take Vegas for example, there should have been a steady trickle of new videos and photos that confirmed a real shooting including the progress of people&#39;s gunshot wounds healing. But nada. I bet if you ask most shills on here for evidence of a shooting they will <em>still</em> point to the fake-ass Liveleak video that came out the day after. </p>

<p>Like the Kids in columbine. They shot the school up because the people treated them like social pariahs. I wish we could see those unreleased tapes they filmed.</p>

<p>Plus you have cyber bullying which is so easy. Plus you have over medication of youth any boy who cant sit still must be given zombie juice.</p>

<p>Plus Killers are glorified in society and thats something these outcasts want recognition and you even give them a high score to set.</p>

<p>Plus you have the fact THE X is probably 100 years ahead of civilian psychology based on all the research they have done. I wouldnt be suprised if they could program a human with zero effort.</p>

<p>though you could just use that drug that takes away free will. Now if that drug exists its the scariest thing in existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is not left nor right, he is trying to fight them from the inside out. He inheretit an almost completly broken system with many bad people on the inside. Sure he knew this from the start, but the actual bad apples had not yet reveiled themselves fully.</p>

<p>He had to smoke them out by slowly andlet them reveil themsleves while he was just telling covert truths and mocking them until they dropped their guards becouse of fear or anger. He seems to divide people on the surface  becouse of the biased msm, but he is actually raising awareness and willingness in the people to unite and is preparing everybody before all the complete truths are reveiled.</p>

<p>Too much of anything at once is bad, even if it was good at the beginning... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a billionaire who is President, who is loved and defended by Fox News, who’s son in law is a literal Zionist, and who himself has multiple connections to organized crime, who has been accused (with good reason) of hanging out with pedophiles and even being one himself, who is trying to abolish the 2nd amendment, and who is ingratiating himself to the MIC.</p>

<p>He sure seems to be both left and right to me, and certainly seems to be one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oke, but his son in law or any other employees are not Trump himself... Most people he did not chose himself and becouse he was and is an outsider of the estahblishment he couldbever know who is what untilhe knows more or they reveil themsleves. </p>

<p>Just that you know, are friended or hire somebody does not mean you know everything of them. Yes fox is biased, but it is leaning more to the truth and towards Trump and he is representing the people upto now IMHO. Is he a part of the an other or future cabal? maybe, but only the future can tell this becouse he has not reveiled everything of himself yet.</p>

<p>try to look deeper, what is the only actual treat to humanity?</p>
