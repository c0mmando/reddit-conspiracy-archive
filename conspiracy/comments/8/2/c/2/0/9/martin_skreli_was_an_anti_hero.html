        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Martin Skreli was an anti hero. He was so transparent in what he was doing and how he was doing it. He hiked drug prices legally all in the similar fashion that other companies manipulate prices, except he made himself a figure head, which is where the plan backfired. Instead of the public becoming infuriated with the policies that allowed this greedy man to make a fortune, the public demonized him instead of the policy. Big pharma swooped in, wrestled Skreli into a nice, compact evil incarnate figure and took his money. NOT because what he did was morally apprehensive, but because it brought light to the completely fucking arbitrary prices of drugs. Big pharma couldn&#39;t care less about how much you pay, but this waa the perfect opportunity to make it seem like they do. It&#39;s human nature to direct your anger at a person, but wayyyy more difficult to generate outrage from some intellectual concept like policies and faceless businesses. The public feels like we&#39;ve accomplished something by taking Skreli money, but in reality we&#39;re right back where we started. Which is actually pretty funny. Now well just continue to get fucked by faceless corporations rather than individual figure heads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he did was still ethically corrupt at best. Frame it anyway you want. The man made huge profits over the back of sick people. Did he ever create a platform to change regulation? He did not. Did he donate all his profits to sick people? He most definitely did not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh it was absolutely ethically corrupt. But he detailed the arbitrary prices by artificially spiking them which made (not enough) people question the synthetic prices of pharmaceuticals. He&#39;s a human, he&#39;s greedy, he&#39;s not about to turn down millions of dollars. but at least he, whether by grace or stupidity, gave us insight into the artificial prices of drugs, and big pharma didn&#39;t like that. Drug prices are being spiked all the time lately, but it&#39;s all behind the scenes and nothing open like skreli</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you&#39;re saying this as if you just made the greatest discovery since the invention of the wheel. The rest of the world has known this for ages. But the thing is that the complete absence of regulation in your country is impossible to fight against for the rest of the world. Somehow, most of your politicians not only accept this status-quo, but also effectively manage to convince people in your country to still vote for them. (Republicans are the worst offenders, but some democrats aren&#39;t any better) And the worst part is that other parts of the world have regulation against big pharma, like the EU for instance, and what does it do? It creates an even bigger monopoly for the American sector. It&#39;s ridiculous, and the whole world is suffering because of the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Y&#39;all need to look into his story more. He was giving away product for free to those who couldn&#39;t afford the price raise. It was only a high price raise because he was the only one producing the product for that specific problem. No other company was manufacturing it. So he raised it so he could focus on research and development on a better product. Also, it wasn&#39;t that bad of a price raise that the media makes it out to be. He had an interview where he described why he carried out with what he did. He is an incredibly well spoken individual. Media turned a good person into a monster once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people needed the drug and no one was making it anymore. So he took it, increased the price so he could begin researching and developing a better drug while giving the old one out for free to those who couldn&#39;t afford it but needed it. He please the 5th because he has nothing to say. He knows the courts are against him and he doesn&#39;t want to fight that fight. Big Government with all it&#39;s regulations will protect what they want want and what they don&#39;t want, which happens to fall onto Skrel since he was being an actually decent human being which apparently you can&#39;t even see</p>

<p>The thing that you fail to understand is that what Shkreli said about there not being anyone willing to make these medicines is simply false. My uncle has a non-profit company in the Netherlands that tries to do excactly this. As soon as patents run out, they crack the formula and make a simplified one dollar version. However the most nefarious part about what sharks like Shkreli do, is that they renew the patent so that they get their monopolies, and then raise the price by 52 times. that is 5200%. Let that sink in. </p>

<p>As long as the USA keeps letting these big pharma stay clear of regulations, there is no way to solve these problems.</p>
