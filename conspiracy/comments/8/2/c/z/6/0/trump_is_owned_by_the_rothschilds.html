<p>Note the satanic devil horned &quot;Red Shield&quot; in the middle with the jewish hat that looks like a condom.</p>

<p>Loads more going on that will fly over your heads, but i&#39;d like you to concentrate on the fist clenching the 5 arrows, that represents the 5 sons of Rothschild.</p>

<p>We see it again on the dollar bill either representing the 13 colonies of America or the 13 Bloodlines of the Illuminati (real name Brotherhood of the Snake aka Red dragon vs Black dragon can also be blue or yellow or white etc)</p>

<p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fazcapitoltimes.com%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F02%2Fmoney-dollar-bill-eagle.jpg&amp;amp;f=1">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fazcapitoltimes.com%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F02%2Fmoney-dollar-bill-eagle.jpg&amp;amp;f=1</a></p>

<p>You are probably used to seeing it look like this...</p>

<p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fferrebeekeeper.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2Fmedical-logo.jpg&amp;amp;f=1">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fferrebeekeeper.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2Fmedical-logo.jpg&amp;amp;f=1</a></p>

<p>In ancient civilizations it looks like this</p>

<p><a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2Ff3%2F58%2Fd1%2Ff358d1a5b6fe3b613cb9d65fb9a52fa2.jpg&amp;amp;f=1">https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2Ff3%2F58%2Fd1%2Ff358d1a5b6fe3b613cb9d65fb9a52fa2.jpg&amp;amp;f=1</a></p>

<p>Wings or an Eagle represent E.T whether you can handle that or not is irrelevant. It is also where left wing/right wing &quot;dichotomy&quot; politics comes from.</p>

<p>Now then...</p>

<p>Here is Trumps C.O.A</p>

<p>Note the clenched fist and arrow...pretty simple math to initiates and people who can put two and two together.</p>

<p>Plenty of other masonic things going on also but again over your heads and far away...the twin headed eagle is just another brotherhood of the snake logo (see bottom page link)</p>

<p>Rothchild owns Trump.</p>

<p>They bailed him out 30 years ago when his casino/hotel businesses were going bankrupt again.</p>

<p>You can read much much more about this from this extremely clued up Christian man. His site is full of undeniable expose.</p>

<p>Check out and compare to Russias C.O.A all tied into this. Internet hindsight is an amazing thing...</p>

<p>We are no longer in the election, and no one’s saying we should replace Trump with Hillary or even a Democrat. If Trump is fucking us all though, shouldn’t we take him to task for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol nah just stalking new as well. I hope he’s a true patriot, but I’m not holding my breath.</p>

<p>I think he’s designed his campaign around being an outsider and fighting around TPTB, but he sure seems like more of the same to me, when you look past the rhetoric and to his policy decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An excellent question, I think so, but I don&#39;t know have all the answers/ideas.  The split certainly helps Russia, which is a good thing, as we need a balance of power in the world.  </p>

<p>We already are benefiting from the split, as with Globalists in control we would likely have attacked Syria and ended up in direct conflict with Russia i.e. WW3 would be underway.  The Democrats were also pushing for forced vaccines (i.e. forced poisoning).  </p>

<p>The Zionist side speaking out against vaccines before the election was mostly to get support when they needed it, as you&#39;ll see Trump hasn&#39;t pushed forward with that since, instead getting on to other Zionists causes like North Korea.  We have to insist that the Zionists do some good in order to receive our continued support, and not just pretend to.</p>

<p>The good thing about a Globalist Vs Zionist battle at the top is that they mostly live within the same countries and areas, so it is not so much a physical war, more a war of propaganda, money and power.  The Zionists are willing to do the real people a few favors in order to win our support, as they are not as powerful as the Globalist side, they need more help.  The Globalists appear to be planning to play the &#39;Civil War&#39; card, which is why they are so keen to ban the republicans from having guns, so as the Globalists will be almost certain to win.  If guns aren&#39;t banned then the Globalist will be less likely to risk civil war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right that the Rothschilds who went before them had their eyes set on Israel, they got it.  However this latest generation have far greater plans, they want to control the planet.  They would like to keep in with the Zionists, but it&#39;s not possible right now as there is a conflict between the two; Globalism and Zionism do not mix.  The Rothschilds will benefit by getting their world government, but the Israel will lose out.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Rothschilds literally invented Zionism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thats not necessarily right, but still, could be:</p>

<p>&quot;What couldn&#39;t be fulfilled under the rule of Napoleon I can be fulfilled by Wilhelm II,&quot; Theodor Herzl wrote in a letter to Kaiser Wilhelm II in March 1899.</p>

<p>Herzl&#39;s statements, quoted in a new book by an Israeli scholar, appear to support the claims of those who view Napoleon Bonaparte as the harbinger of the Zionist Movement. But Napoleon&#39;s Zionist notions met an untimely death, due, in no small part, to the English and Napoleon himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the difficulty they have, Globalism (UN) needs the trust of the Islamic world otherise they will not be accepted as rulers.  To get this they need to citisize Israel and tell them off, instead of giving Israel a free pass.  Israel will not accept anyone telling them off or critizing their wars/behavior, so until some arrangement can be found the Zionists (who are ruthless as you know) will do whateve it takes to dismantle and disrupt the plans for global governance and the climate change taxes which are their to fund it.</p>

<p>Key Globalist player George Soros is not friends with Isreal, he regularly does battle with powerful Zionists.  Perhaps when his time has come to an end there will be someone more willing to build a bridge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good points, i am only not sure who benefits from the climate taxes.  also, netanyahus successor might change things in unexpected ways and the russian/iranian presence + the hezbollah might threaten israel in the very near future.</p>

<p>i also think that if things go on like this in the us for much longer america simply wont be able to support israel any more. but i might be wrong about that</p>

<p>and if you think about it, the muslims are already welcomed to the globalist table big time. the gulf states are globalist hubs, the saudis are made into a formidable, soon to be nuclear, power, muslim refugees are given free reign in western countries, they are becoming part of the political establishment (sadiq khan)  and the elites are doing business like they always did anyway.  so its not necessarily an issue any more. nevertheless you are right in what you say about un criticism of israel, which kinda makes me look for other, ulterior motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we look into the origin of climate taxes, we see the first mention of the from the UN think tank the Club of Rome.  They said that in order to unite the nations under a global government, a tax would be required which was justified by an outside threat which effects all nations, they proposed using either disease or the climate, as we see they decided on the climate and setup a bottomless pit of funding for any scientists to find causes of manmade global warming, they weren’t allowed funding for other types of global warming, only manmade, so the scientists of course jumped on the gravy train and got proving what they had been told to prove, hence why we see all these studies about it these days even now.  These taxes once fully agreed will be paid to the Rothschild World Bank and will be used to fund global governence, the new world order as they say.  If countries had been asked to pay taxes for a UN workd government without a seemingly good fakr reason, like climate change or disease, many would have disagreed, they had to be tricked into it along with the public too.</p>

<p>Agreed that Netanyahu’s successor could well change things, also as you say Israel doesn’t want a war with Russia in too close to its borders.  As you point out, the US public is gradually turning against Israel, it is becoming more difficult, but if AIPAC can maintain their position then it will likely continue.</p>

<p>Agree that the Muslim world is generally positive about Globalism for the reasons you stated.</p>
