       It's not the conspiracy, it's the people involved.  Traditional "conspiracy theorists" and Trump's constituency have a high degree of overlap, so they don't want to look at it.

       Do you disagree? Let’s say Seth Rich was the leaker. Do we know he wasn’t working with Russia? Are we operating under the assumption that the entire Russiagate conspiracy hinges on Seth Rich being the leaker?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does Seth Rich being the leaker have anything to do with the various Trump officials, trolls on twitter, shills on reddit, or propaganda blogs, all which have been linked to the Russian government/oligarchy?

       They knew the leak came from an American citizen who was known to post pictures of himself in American Flag outfits, who died under very mysterious circumstances soon after.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leaks showed that the DNC was willing to "teach a lesson" to leakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite this information being fact they decide to mislead the public and say that "The Russians hacked the DNC"
      </p>
      <p>
       Once this was proved completely false,
 that first off they weren't "hacked" and second their was no connection between Seth and Russia

       Once their allegations were proven false they try and flip the narrative to

       There’s forensic evidence that the leaks were perpetrated by Russia, and I don’t mean the Russian language settings in the word documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows if Seth was working for Russia (let’s be honest, probably not), but there’s actually no evidence that he was the leaker aside from the word of Kim Dotcom and reddit detectives who found an account with the word panda in it’s name.
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless of all that, we do know what Russia was doing during the election, because there’s plenty of evidence of this. It’s entirely possible that Seth was exposed to some of the propaganda they were spreading.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey, maybe that was just the very true accusations against Hillary, but maybe that exposure also includes false stories and other propaganda pushed by Russia.

       Did you not pay attention to vault 7? The CIAs tools which got leaked into the wild allow for undetectable alterations to digital forensics meaning its a useless piece of "evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it even makes it less likely Russia was involved as that would mean Russias government sanctioned/funded hackers were so fucking incompetent they couldn't cover their tracks or forge the forensics to deflect blame, if incompetent hackers could bring the US to its knees that is our governments fault it is their duty to reasonably protect us from outside incursions, other countries should be expected to poke and prod us and if we are so unprepared we need to fix our issues not sit around crying that another kid pushed us on the play ground

        Who knows if Seth was working for Russia (let’s be honest, probably not), but there’s actually no evidence that he was the leaker aside from the word of Kim Dotcom and reddit detectives who found an account with the word panda in it’s name.

       Do you not see that you are looking for and twisting information to fit the narrative that is beijng fed to the world through the MSM instead of altering your opinion with facts you embrace anything that supports the Russia narrative and anything that doesnt you disregard

       If Russia put a puppet into the highest seat of power in the USA, and there is so much evidence that this story can be ran on repeat on all US news channels, publicly vouched for by talk show hosts and celebrities, and be obvious to random redditors. ( all of which are hallmarks of a controlled narrative BTW)

       What does it say about our national security that he is still in office making world-altering decisions? Yeah they say he'll be taken down any day now but they have been saying that for over a year now with nothing to show for it other than taking down his associates with literally any bit of dirt they can possibly dig up which is all generally unrelated to Russia or not evidence of collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly we need to be friends with Russia by whatever means necessary if you didn't see Putins last speech they are the 2nd or 3rd most powerful country on earth and this bullshit warmongering against them is nothing more than theatre that will lead to WW3 or deplete the national budget

       No one has been saying he’ll be taken down any day now. Q has been saying that about a lot of folks, but none of it has materialized. Everyone knows that the Mueller investigation will take time, and it hasn’t been without results up to now.

       The corporate media is itself a conspiracy who is complicit in covering up other conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll never see CNN tell you about how the government killed MLK though. You'll never see Fox News tell you about how the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag. That's not how the corporate media works, they're driven by profits above all else, and will always push the interests of the state due to how access journalism works.

       How about Fox News. If fox news talks about it, can we count out the theory? Because Fox is literally the most watched cable news media.

       Well they don't seem to buy the Russia stuff at all. And they are the biggest cable news station in America, not to mention the mouth piece of the president. So are we not supposed to trust the media, or are we just not supposed to trust liberal media?

       I dont know to be honest, I like what Fox says sometimes but they also package in a large amount of crap and as i said MSM is not to be trusted so that list should include Fox, the difference is that Foxs stuff alot of times is fairly logical and a conspiratorial individual can find a lot of corroborating evidence for the stuff they say on conspiracy forums BUT again I figure that their tactic is to put out a neutured truth so that every individual that doesnt buy the narrative doesnt instantly go alone to find the truth for themselves but gets an approved truth from a controlled source

       Liberal Media is usually factually/statistically false but focused more on the illogical emotional side that "sounds" appealing on the surface and makes people have warm-fuzzy feelings for helping out their fellow man or makes people angry at "oppressors"

       Is it really wrong though?
      </p>
      <p>
       Immigration for example 100% based on illogical emotion, "yay lets save the suffering third worlders" there are billions living in squalor and by taking in 1% of those many previously great European countries are going to complete shit with Rape in the streets and perpetrators getting off scott free due to "cultural differences" not to mention irreparable damage to their national culture/heritage
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, you arent making the suffering of third worlders better you are just making 1st world countries worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet many liberals support open borders to the worst most low IQ countries in the world.(coincidentally immigrants are like 90% liberal)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another issue, gun control, on the surface it sounds so nice to take away tools of violence but then you realize they just turn every incident into a nationwide spectacle and forget to mention that in terms of population the US is actually pretty good about gun deaths, and the areas contributing most to US gun deaths have the strictest regulations.
      </p>

       What other issues do modern liberals stand for?

       Most liberals definitely don't support open borders. But anyway, from what you said here you're obviously on the right. So I think you've answered the original question. Since you're on the right, you think we shouldn't trust liberal media. Which would be a pretty obvious sentiment for you to have. So when people say we shouldn't get behind a conspiracy theory that CNN talks about, it's not because it's the MSM. It's because is liberal MSM.

       He makes a strong case for something to be a conspiracy theory in the cultural sense it needs to be against the official narrative.  In other words, what gives is the same thing of why, the claims that Saddam and Al-Qaeda cooperating, or that 19 hijackers crashed into 2 skyscrapers and brought down 3 are ignored, they are PR campaigns.

       I use the term "regime propaganda" instead of "administration PR" because we're seeing something unique from this group in modern American history.  Trump admittedly admires Putin, and his team is plainly trying to emulate the "Nothing is True and Everything is Possible" Kremlin/RT playbook that's kept Putin on top of the dance for the last two decades.

       Yeah, you hear it here folks, Chris Hedges and Lee Comp are practicing ' nothing is true and everything is possible RT playbook.  RT is filled with leftists that can't get any air time in the corporate media.  By the way, where did you get your information about what the 'Kremlin' playbook is?

       Because this sub has a right-wing bias and since the left-wing have adopted Russiagate as their investigation, no one here will touch it and whenever they do, its massively downvoted. To be fair, its not that interesting though, its just the Russian government doing what our own government has been doing for decades. I don't know about the "traitor president" part though, there hasn't been any solid evidence Trump himself deliberately worked with Russia to swing voters in his favor and from what's been revealed about the  Russian troll farms, it looks like Russia backed the most incompetent and radical candidates they could find.

       This sub generally doesn't need "solid" evidence to explore a potential conspiracy, though, just enough to prompt investigation.  Like, if the victim of a shooting massacre has a weird facial expression for two seconds there'll be a five front-page posts within 20 minutes.

       And what evidence is there for Trump himself deliberately working with Russian trolls? The recent report from the FBI that summed up what Russia did to manipulate the election never stated that anyone from the Trump team or Trump himself were aware of these actions and if they were involved in them did so without knowledge of their true nature.
      </p>

       This is exactly why you can't discuss this topic. People immediately jump to the extreme ends of the issue by either denying it or calling all Republicans traitors and demanding Trump hang.

       Everyone here picks up on it, dude. We are a community of question-askers, and we're still tracing the threads through the reverse-engineered loom to get at the full truth. Maybe there is an actual conspiracy, but you yourself are not the judge of that. You'd be better off asking questions about our beliefs and opinions than to criticize our intellect, investigative powers, and intuition. Don't try to confront; rather, try to understand.

       A conspiracy is Alex Jones is actually Bill Hicks, or that nukes are all fake, satellites and space aren't real, etc. If your conspiracy is the theme of Hollywood's current season of movies, like Atomic Blonde and Red Sparrow then it's not a conspiracy, it's just the current propaganda and plot line of political intrigue they are selling.

       When you're deep enough down the rabbit hole, you realize that the people in control of this world are in charge both in the US, Russia, China, etc. The Cold War was a racket, and the current drama swirling around Russia and Putin is just a fake, manufactured conspiracy designed to disguise and distract from what people should really be concerned about. It's just more bread and circuses.

       You should look more carefully in this sub. The blatant conspiracy of a presidential candidate involving collusion with foreign interests, the rigging of a primary election, the deaths of inconvenient bystanders and witnesses, the treason and perjury over mishandling and illegal use of secret info and SAPs, the colluding with intelligence agencies to erase all this and pin the blame on the opponent that won by some weird fluke... that's been analyzed here to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is that candidate has, so far, the media and friends in high places with deep pockets on her side; otherwise she'd be disgraced by now, instead of still being touted as Chicago's Mother Theresa.

       I dont know to be honest, I like what Fox says sometimes but they also package in a large amount of crap and as i said MSM is not to be trusted so that list should include Fox, the difference is that Foxs stuff alot of times is fairly logical and a conspiratorial individual can find a lot of corroborating evidence for the stuff they say on conspiracy forums BUT again I figure that their tactic is to put out a neutured truth so that every individual that doesnt buy the narrative doesnt instantly go alone to find the truth for themselves but gets an approved truth from a controlled source

       Liberal Media is usually factually/statistically false but focused more on the illogical emotional side that "sounds" appealing on the surface and makes people have warm-fuzzy feelings for helping out their fellow man or makes people angry at "oppressors"
