    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Nice. I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are on Douglas Murray and Katie Hopkins. I more than likely already know your position, especially regarding Hopkins who I find utterly charming and brash as all get out, but I get she&#39;s a provocateur and thus controversial . Murray&#39;s a newer one for me, in that I just discovered him on youtube the other day. In any case, I was oblivious to the issues Europe in general is dealing with regarding immigration and free speech. Based only by your prior comments, I think I may already know how you feel about these things. But I would still very much appreciate a first hand account of what things are like, at least from your perspective, from across the pond. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what I&#39;ve seen has been on youtube, not infowars or Breitbart. I first saw Hopkins and Murray on The Rubin Report. I then saw Hopkins through various interviews she had on many different programs. And after watching Murray on Dave&#39;s show I then watched a debate he had I believe back in 2010, regarding the question &quot;Is Islam a religion of peace&quot;. </p>

<p>It appears to me that you&#39;ve prejudged me based on nothing other than assumptions you have of Americans. Much like I&#39;m sure the UK is, there are many different folks here with many different opinions, from all walks of life. Few in the world fit into a box.

I don&#39;t want to misrepresent myself, I believe in equal rights for all and I absolutely believe in freedom of religion. I just don&#39;t understand how those communities could be backing a religion that is so intolerant to their community. And maybe somehow I&#39;m misinformed, but from what I&#39;ve been reading and watching those seem to be intersected in a way. Thanks again for taking the time!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. One more real quick. What&#39;s your take on freedom of speech and college campuses recently? What I mean is that I&#39;ve seen what seems to be an increasing amount of what appears to be the progressive left, shutting down events with conservative speakers. Jordan Peterson and the McMaster&#39;s situation comes to mind. I don&#39;t find him to be so controversial, although I understand some may be misinformed and see him as such. But even the more provocative speakers such as Milo have the right to speak. It appears at least to me, that there seems to be a push to shut down what some consider to be &quot;hate speech&quot;. I&#39;ve legit considered myself liberal in the past just because they were the side that seemed to be about civil liberties, but I&#39;ve had to rethink that of late. And much of my rethinking stems from situations such as these. While I don&#39;t want to hear a white supremacists spewing nonsense, I do believe they have that right. So I&#39;m curious as to your take regarding this. Thanks again!</p>
