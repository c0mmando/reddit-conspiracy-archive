       "One of the deep, dark secrets of America's past has finally come to light. Starting in the early 1900s, hundreds of thousands of American children were warehoused in institutions by state governments. And the federal government did
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to stop it...the kids had been labeled 'feeble-minded,' and were put away in conditions that can only be described as unspeakable."
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's only the tip of the iceberg...

       As a part of the same program, over 800 pregnant women in TN were given radioactive iron tablets, told they were "super-vitamins". It happened in other places, cancer patients were irradiated as part of their "treatment", I believe it was in in OH, there was also a case in TX. Search "The Plutonium Files"; I dove into this one last summer. MIT and Quaker Oats were both sued for millions. Bill Clinton read an admission and apology statement on live tv about this, but it was the same exact day that the OJ Simpson verdict was also read so very few people caught it, or cared.
      </p>

       It's one of the big declassified cases I refer people to, to try to wake them up. If the government now
       <em>
        admits
       </em>
       to experimentation on non-consenting citizens of this sort, it's not a stretch to imagine what kinds of shady shit they're up to nowadays.

       Thank you for adding important info to this. As I recall, a woman named Hazel O'Leary was instrumental in getting Clinton to make a public apology (even tho he obviously had no part in what happened) and I recall it was quickly largely forgotten or more likely ignored. When I've mentioned the oatmeal/retarded children info I'm often met with....oh really?  Nothing much past that. No outrage...more like apathy.

       It's pretty frightening to imagine what kind of shady stuff is really going on.

       I would wager these experiments stemmed from Nazi experiments, possibly overseen by Nazi scientists given refuge in the US after WWII. They did similar experiments in the camps.

       I'd wager it had to do with nothing of the sort, because it doesn't take a nazi to continue the (international) tradition of

       The articles doesn't tell us jack about how intense the radioactivity was supposed to be, so all we're left with is the fucked up fact that they didn't tell anyone what they'd be exploited for.

        "We thought for a long time that we belonged there, that we were not part of the species. We thought we were some kind of, you know, people that wasn't supposed to be born," says Boyce.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fuuuuuuucked up. What's the conspiracy?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1994 Senate hearings, it came out that scientists from MIT had been giving radioactive oatmeal to the boys - men now - in a nutrition study for Quaker Oats. All they knew is that they'd been asked to join a science club.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Among those who attended the hearing was Almeida, also a member of the club. He says the boys were recruited with special treats: "We were getting special treatment, you know, extra dessert, we got to eat away from the other boys. We were getting extra oatmeal. We're getting extra milk."
      </p>
      <p>
       "But they forgot to mention the milk was radioactive," says David White-Lief, an attorney who worked on the state task force investigating the science club.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says he was outraged that the children were exploited without their knowledge. "It's my contention, and it was my contention on the task force, that these experiments, because of the lack of informed consent, violated the Nuremburg Code established just 10 years earlier," says White-Lief. "The lesson of Nazi Germany was we don't do experiments on people without informed consent. They didn't use the word "informed consent" - without knowing consent."
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I won't be buying Quaker Oats anymore.
