      <h3>
       Problem-Reaction-Solution
      </h3>
      <p>
       Most of us on this board, at least those of us who have been here a while, are aware of the problem-reaction-solution concept, roughly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The government (or whoever) wants a desired outcome, but they can't just come out and implement, or the public would reject it. They devise a plan by which they create a Problem (or in some cases, let one happen or seize on an already existing problem), and have the media portray the problem how they want it. In effect, they
        <em>
         create
        </em>
        the Reaction they want the people to have. Part of this Reaction is to demand a Solution to the Problem. "They" (the government, etc.) then give the people the Solution they were asking for, which gives they the desired outcome they wanted all along.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       9/11 is a common example of this, and fairly illustrative. (For the purposes of this post, it does not matter how 9/11 happened or who caused it. Even if you believe the 9/11 Commission Report, the rest of this applies.)  9/11 happened and was blamed on al Qaeda terrorists and OBL. The Problem was that our country was attacked. The Reaction, carefully crafted by the media and implanted in the first few hours when emotions and susceptibility were high, was one of anger, vengeance, and fear toward the "people who did this," which was largely expanded to mean most of Islam, and certainly "bad actors" in the Middle East. The Solution was actually multifold, because there were multiple Reactions. To quell the fear, PATRIOT was passed, and DHS and TSA set up, making the surveillance state possible. Vengeance and anger were quelled by the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a pretty stock explanation and example, and most of you likely understand. But I think PRS goes beyond this understanding, and actually represents a very different way of perceiving and acting on the world for these people in Rove's "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community">
        reality-based community,
       </a>
       " different than just about everyone else's.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Problem-Reaction-Solution as a mindset
      </h3>
      <p>
       We, or at least I, sometimes tend to look at the idea of PRS being these isolated, distinct, "plans," where the whole thing is planned out years or decades in advance down to the smallest detail, and I think this is how some of these operations are carried out. Yet that misses the bigger point, they literally
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       the world through the lens or reality tunnel of Problem-Reaction-Solution. Whereas you or I may see the world through opportunities to make our lives better through business/art/family time/research/etc., I think they see everything as PRS. Rather than see opportunities for places to grow or create, they see opportunities for creating Reactions that lead to their desired Solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they do look at the world this way, I think we might find that they directly cause and orchestrate fewer Problems than we might perceive, and more often than not just have the desired Reaction and Solution ready to go. Take mass shootings, for example. Without getting into the specifics of whether any one shooting is real, fake, or false flag, let's considered whether they would want or need to artificially "create" an attack. I would argue they don't. I would suggest that rather than go to the trouble of creating an incident, with all the risks of failure or discovery,
       <em>
        where they can
       </em>
       , they would prefer to act more indirectly, planting seeds that could turn into suitable Problems. Plant enough seeds, eventually you'll get enough Problems, you already have your prepared Reactions, and can implement your desired Solution. It's easier, less risky, and ultimately more effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't say any of this to in any way defend their actions; on the contrary, I find that this is much more dangerous and effective than if they were just planning a series of these events. Those events where they actually cause death and destruction are only worse in degree, not fundamentally different than just seizing on already available problems.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Problem-Reaction-Solution as a pervasive mindset
      </h3>
      <p>
       This less overtly destructive form of the PRS mindset is so dangerous because it's far more pervasive. While only a few dozen people may be aware of the full scope of something like Gulf of Tonkin, this PRS mindset permeates through bureaucracies, corporations, and political organizations to the point where hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions are utilizing the mindset on a daily basis, to some degree or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see this every time there's a divisive political discussion. Everyone in media and politics on the "right" immediately starts creating a Reaction in the minds of the people to implement their Solution, and everyone on the "left" does the same. These aren't secret orders being given down from above (sometimes they are), these are ingrained reactions by the people in the bureaucracies themselves. They don't need to be told what to say and think, they've internalized the entire PRS mindset and know what to say and think.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see this process so much it's become normalized. This is not a normal way to see the world, and it's absolutely not a healthy way to see it. In game theory, it's a vicious cycle and a zero-sum-game, or less than zero-sum. The mindset only creates outcomes favorable to the person using it, and directly make outcomes worse for other sets of people. The issue is, we can't just remove a few people at the top that are the masters of this game and expect the system to get better, because everyone else in the various political, corporate, and government hierarchies have internalized it and act on it, and most of the population outside those structures see it as normal and healthy.
      </p>
      <h3>
       A way out of Problem-Reaction-Solution
      </h3>
      <p>
       The upside is, we don't really need to directly confront or even know who the people at the top of the pyramid are. Whoever it is, their strategy is the same, and their weakness is the same. The PRS mindset only works for those at the top if the people in the lower bureaucracies act on it and the people outside those bureaucracies think its normal. If we the people did not accept it as normal that we solve our differences through war, and the people that work in the hierarchies that support war rejected it, we would not have war.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we focus on trying to find who is ultimately "pulling the strings," we will not find them, and exposing them or getting rid of them would not help us. We're trying to stop the Player without really understanding the Game. We need expose
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they're playing the game, change how
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       play the game (virtuous cycles and non-zero-sum), get others to play these better games, and make the PRS game unplayable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this will be easy, maybe not even possible, and I don't know any of the answers, but I do think these conditions (humans playing non-zero-sum games and rejecting zero-sum games) are fully necessary for anything other than a dystopian endgame.

      <p>
       What do you suggest though? If problem events occur spontaneously as you say false flags aren't necessary what we're left with is real events that require solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your suggestion that after a problem event we don't do anything?

       I think the biggest problem (hehe) with the PRS mindset as it is exercised is that it only seeks to address problems, but never the root causes. Take mass shootings, for example. The surface understanding of the problem is that someone used a gun to kill essentially random people, who were largely defenseless. The understanding is that the guns are the problems, and if he couldn't have accessed a gun, he wouldn't have been able to kill as many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is true as far as it goes; if he didn't have that gun, he might not have killed as many. But it doesn't do anything to address the root cause: why did he feel he needed to kill random strangers? Even if
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       was a false flag or hoax, that root cause still exists in many people, and is indicative of an unhealthiness in individuals, and in our society as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't think the answer is "mental health," at least not as the issue is discussed in the media and by politicians. These mentally unhealthy people are not simply aberrations in our society that we can "fix" by directing resources toward, they are direct products
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       our society. "It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, my suggestion is that we refuse to React to the Problem we're being led to react to. If the PRS is well designed, most Reactions will ultimately benefit its designer. Arguments over guns or terrorists or wars or collusion pretty much always end in bitter division and inability to empathize with the other "side", which acts as a desired outcome in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that walking outside and saying hello to your neighbor or starting a vegetable garden are both infinitely more valuable and effective as real solutions to the underlying root causes, rather than the symptomatic expression in the form of a Problem, than any solution a government has to offer.

       Interesting post. Thanks for taking the time. I think some of what you say is absolutely spot on. I'd never considered that we may somehow be programmed to want to respond in that manner. Been listening to Jordan Peterson and others quite a bit lately. In his Cathy Newman interview he discussed the many variables that make up the often quoted "women make x amount of what men make". I'd never considered that complex issues/problems aren't going to have a simple solution. While watching the Rubin Report with Larry Elder I heard him discuss the problems in poorer communities, especially the black community, and the many variables that are causing this problem. It was shit that I hadn't thought of before. There aren't simple fixes for complex issues. Like the Florida shooting. A lot of folks immediately decided that the NRA was the problem and that if we didn't have guns that tragedy wouldn't have happened. But as we've seen in the weeks since, there were MANY variables that played into that specific situation. A one size fits all mentality just doesn't work. If that makes sense. In any case, I appreciate the post, thanks for giving me a few things to mull over.

      <p>
       This is how I see these events happening. Planning takes too much effort and requires many moving parts. However, planting seeds is relatively easy, pollute every aspect of society and your bound to get some "problems" sprouting up. Enlist a few A list actors, a few late night talkshow hosts, maybe a few "analysts" and you have your reactions built in at the ready. Next thing you know you got yourself a country begging for your perfect solution.

       It's really as simple as the The Force Out. Be a really shitty girlfriend/boyfriend/employer without actually doing anything directly rule breaking. The just wait for your SO/Employee to snap and leave/quit. You get the desired outcome without the hassle of being the bad guy and doing the breaking up/firing.

       I don't think I've heard of this term before, but I get what you mean by it instantly. I think this could be a really good analogy to explain the process of PRS to people unfamiliar with it in a way that they can easily see corollaries in their everyday lives.

       It's an old tactic a buddy of mine &amp; I came up with 25 years ago. He desperately wanted to break up with his girl, but didn't want to be seem as a dick (and didn't have the balls to just say it), so I shared my use of the tactic to get rid of shitty employees. Turns out, it works in both situations. It's not one of my prouder moments, but it works like a charm.

       Not really, more like shitty shifts &amp; shitty detail work no one wants to do. Like I said, I’m not proud of it, but when you have a shitty employee that is walking the line hoping to get fired so they can retaliate, gloves are off. You make my life hell, expect the same in return.

       Bur really, I would like to argue that PRS could just be rephrased as making the best out bad situations. Our ability to use problems to our advantage is not the problem, it really is the intentions of the people powerful enough to take advantage of macrocosmic happenings.

       Take gun control, for example. Dems use the problems created by guns to argue against being able to have guns. Yet, they never actually get there nor does their arguably biggest figure (Bernie) even agree with that. Repubs use it to argue for better mental health but at the same time cut funding for it. Now, in a perfect world, both reactions could arguably be considered beneficial to society. The PRS paradigm appears to be working just fine until you realize their intentions are not the solutions. The solutions are a means to an end... mainly to sow discord and division... which I think you can dig ;).

       I think I can see what your saying, and I do agree. It's the intention behind it which causes and perpetuates long-term issues. Humans naturally seek to find solutions to problems, which isn't bad in itself, and I wouldn't really put into the category of PRS, at least in my current usage of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is the deceptive way in which the Reactions are elicited, and the Solutions are presented. The Solutions are not primarily intended to solve the Problem, that's just the cover reason for the actual purpose. For example, mass surveillance is not really desired for the purpose of stopping terrorist attacks, but to control the population and our ability to freely and securely communicate, especially subversive ideas.

       Agreed. I think division is a somewhat persistent goal in a lot of these PRS instances, as is state/corporate control of various aspects of individuals and societies. In some sense, division is more a means to that control matrix than an end in itself.

       I don't think anyone has ever written this much to agree with me before.. at least on reddit. Very insightful and thank you.

       I would go one step further with this point:

      <blockquote>

       I don't think suppressing subversive communication is even necessary anymore. They have the coin spinning so fast now there's no structural paradigm to really even subvert. The structure subverts itself, back and forth, while the top agendas don't seem to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posit that the mass surveillance debate is a fake issue for that reason and the reason that they really don't need our permission. They've been doing it for a very long time and will continue. If anything, this controlled discussion is really there to keep us thinking they haven't done it yet and, again, to put us in our bicker buckets.
