    <div class="md"><p>Look man, the point you are expressing here is I credibly narrow minded.</p>

<p>Just because YOU don&#39;t need marijuana for it&#39;s various medicinal properties, doesn&#39;t mean others can&#39;t benefit from it.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve really thought at all about this beyond &quot;I like pot and nobody can tell me not to smoke&quot;.</p>

<p>The issue is a tad more complicated than all that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you with respect to big pharmas involvement. Between them and tax hungry politicians mj prices are gonna skyrocket. But I do have to disagree on the medical benefits. I,  like you, smoke to chill and relax and become more introspective. I&#39;ve been in pain while smoking and it didn&#39;t help. But i do believe (or at least hope) that certain chemicals in trees, when isolated, can help solve certain medical conditions. But not through smoking or ingesting.

    <div class="md"><p>It hasnt met the standards for the FDA because it&#39;s schedule 1 which means you have to go through the DEA and the FDA simply to get a license and approval to study it. Big pharma are the ones attempting to keep it the way it is now, not the other way around as you&#39;re proposing. Big pharma has very close ties with the FDA due to past employees of the FDA working for pharmaceutical companies which is part of the reason it hasn&#39;t moved forward on a federal level. If big pharma wanted weed to be moving forward in the process of becoming accessible through their hands, it would&#39;ve happened already.</p>

<p>When it comes to recreation it has one use. (Safer alternative when compared to other recreational drugs legal today.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can something not have more than one function? Marijuana can be both recreational and medicinal. Where it&#39;s recreational, you have to be of a certain age to obtain it, but what about kids under that age that need it for medicinal reasons? Should they not be able to have their medicine because they aren&#39;t old enough? You&#39;re argument for big pharma wanting to control medicinal weed is ridiculous. Look at their lobbying against it over the past years, why would they pay millions of dollars against something if they simply wanted it for themselves? If anything, big pharma is scared that marijuana as well as holistic doctors are going to be detrimental to their business of selling drugs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is totally a perspective thing. I understand your argument for recreational as opposed to medicinal, but if you were a user due to a medical issue, you would probably be arguing the exact opposite. Just because you don&#39;t need it for medical use doesn&#39;t mean the nobody uses it for that purpose. There are certainly people who obtain it through doctors for recreational use, but that doesn&#39;t describe the entire population of medical marijuana users. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that the scenario you outlined exemplifies the need to have it recognized as medicinal across the board. If it&#39;s only recognized as recreational, kids won&#39;t be able to access it even though it could help them. Your &quot;what if&quot; is solved by having it be recognized as medicinal for those who need it. If it&#39;s only recreational, people can get it and self medicate but again, that doesn&#39;t help anyone under the age of 21. </p>
