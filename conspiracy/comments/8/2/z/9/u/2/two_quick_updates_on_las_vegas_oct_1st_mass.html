        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Be aware that tomorrow, Friday, March 9th, Clark County District Judge Richard Scotti will decide how much media companies should have to pay to get police videos and 911 calls from the shooting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/37678700/judge-weighs-media-cost-for-police-video-from-vegas-shooting">http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/37678700/judge-weighs-media-cost-for-police-video-from-vegas-shooting</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/03/07/us/ap-us-las-vegas-shooting.html">https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/03/07/us/ap-us-las-vegas-shooting.html</a></p>

<p>Quoting from the NY Times article, &quot;Las Vegas police have been asked since Oct. 1 to respond to a massive document request by several media companies, including The Associated Press.</p>

<p>But he noted that the department estimates it will cost more than $400,000 to search for, retrieve, prepare and copy records, including footage from police body cameras, dispatch logs, 911 recordings, contracts and other documents.</p>

<p>Las Vegas Review-Journal lawyer Margaret McLetchie says police can&#39;t be allowed to charge excessive fees for public records.&quot;</p>

<p>So be looking out for that ruling tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also, speaking of District Judge Richard Scotti, looks like he&#39;s in hot water himself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/nevada-supreme-court-overturns-las-vegas-shooting-autopsies-ruling/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/nevada-supreme-court-overturns-las-vegas-shooting-autopsies-ruling/</a></p>

<p>From the Review-Journal article, &quot;District Judge Richard Scotti violated the First Amendment when he barred the Las Vegas Review-Journal from reporting on the redacted autopsy report of an Oct. 1 shooting victim, a three-justice panel of the Nevada Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.</p>

<p>“While we are deeply sympathetic to the decedent’s family’s privacy concerns, the First Amendment does not permit a court to enjoin the press from reporting on a redacted autopsy report already in the public domain,” the opinion states.&quot;</p>

<p>I had not heard about autopsies being redacted, that is very disturbing. </p>

<p>This case relates specifically to the autopsy report of off-duty Las Vegas police officer Charleston Hartfield, though the article doesn&#39;t go into details about exactly what changes where made.</p>

<p>Keep pressing, everyone, let&#39;s not continue to let the largest mass shooting in modern history continue to disappear from public interest.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, a single flash drive or hard drive (these days)  could hold all of that stuff.  $100-$200 max (if hard drive) just for the equipment (the drive.). $400,000 is ludicrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All government agencies (even police departments) have to usually get things done through contracts. If no contract for that activity currently exists, then they would go through the process of creating a bid for one. Even that could take months, and it is possible that they do not currently have a contract to handle that work and this dollar amount is a total for the whole process. Not just how much hard drives and worker wages cost.</p>

<p>What seems silly is that they are inferring here that the media companies would need to reimburse this money and you then wonder is the police selling this for a profit or on the dime with their own costs? Either way, someone is making a profit on that dollar figure, and it will be whichever company or contractor gets the bid to do the actual legwork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does seem that way. I&#39;ve only been involved as an outside party to such things, how I know that they exist. I don&#39;t know the reasons why they are used/required or why they were brought into being in the first place. Other than the &quot;I can get my friend at company x some money by using this&quot; type of idea, but that might just be a symptom of that type of system instead of the reason why it exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While 400,000 is a large sub I think its fair to assume they arent just talking about hardware. Its the time and pay checks of the people compiling all the information and like the other reply to you says they would probably have to pay a 3rd party to do that. Everything is more expensive when it comes to the government if you haven&#39;t noticed. In <em>theory</em>  you get a very high quality product for all that $$$, but as I am sure you are aware that is rarely the case. Gov is good at very few things but wasting money is probably their strongest suit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The redacted autopsy you mentioned is that of a police officer who was off duty at the time of the shooting. his widow attempted to block the release of his autopsy citing privacy concerns even though the autopsies were anonymised prior to their release. Apparently family members were not notified before the autopsies were entered into the public record. </p>

<p>Peculiar yeah, I agree with the decision to release the autopsies for sure, but tbh, grieving widow, I could see how she might be upset over that</p>
