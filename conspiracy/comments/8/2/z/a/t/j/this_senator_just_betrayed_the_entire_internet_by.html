        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey Reddit, this is important.</p>

<p>Senator Kennedy of Louisiana just betrayed his constituents, Louisiana small businesses, and millions of Internet users by <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kennedy.senate.gov%2Fpublic%2Fpress-releases%3FID%3DE1352949-BF5D-4CCA-8707-BC2B098D27B1&amp;amp;t=YjQ2MTM0NGZhNTkyMGI0MWEyOTFlZDNhZDY4MmRiNTYzMThkYzYxMCxwM0ZZV1Z0Mg%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AKMlLl9GOPd0Y9ROFg2ygww&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.fightforthefuture.org%2Fpost%2F171632833653%2Fupdated-senator-john-kennedy-r-la-just&amp;amp;m=1">introducing</a> legislation that essentially outlaws net neutrality while claiming to save it. His bill is a companion to telecom shill Marsha Blackburn’s (R-TN) ridiculous “Open Internet Preservation Act.”</p>

<p>This bill is NOT net neutrality. It’s not even “weak” net neutrality, or a “compromise.” It’s a bill to kill net neutrality. It <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/gop-net-neutrality-bill-would-allow-paid-fast-lanes-and-preempt-state-laws/">would</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Legalize paid prioritization, opening the floodgates for ISPs to charge new fees and discriminate between online content.</li>
<li>Kneecap the FCC’s ability to prevent abuse from ISP monopolies. </li>
<li>Prevent  states from enacting their own net neutrality rules (like the one Washington just passed.).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is significant because Senator Kennedy had previously <a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/369255-democrats-search-for-51st-net-neutrality-vote">claimed</a> he was considering supporting the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality, which provides the clearest path to restoring basic protections for Internet users and small businesses that never should have been taken away in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>This is a pivotal moment in the net neutrality fight. It means that we need to unleash the force of the entire Internet on the remaining undecided Senators and tell them to support the CRA rather than selling out to the ISPs like Kennedy did.</strong></p>

<p>These are the other Senators who are still likely to support the net neutrality CRA. Call and tweet at them right now and tell them to support the CRA to save net neutrality, rather than legislation that would permanently undermine it.</p>

<p>Senator Kennedy told Politico that he’s still considering supporting the CRA in addition to this terrible legislation that he introduced. That’s a head scratcher. It’s worth calling him and telling him you’re outraged he would introduce such a bad bill. He should withdraw it and publicly support the CRA instead.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s his number: (202) 224-4623 and his twitter handle: @SenJohnKennedy</strong></p>

<p>If we can’t convince Kennedy, then we must get through to the Senators listed above. <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/call">Call them</a>, <a href="http://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard">tweet them</a>, drop in to their office, <a href="http://events.battleforthenet.com/">organize a protest</a>, and make it clear that they MUST support the net neutrality CRA, or you won’t vote for them come election time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s the &quot;neutrality&quot; word that triggers them. I&#39;m shocked that this sub is for NN.</p>

<p>NN is a trick. The internet is a cash cow that is not regulated. The government can&#39;t stand to see all that unregulated money slip through their fingers. It&#39;s right there in front of them, flailing around spitting out money all over the place. They want it. They want it bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the internet is in free market hands, even if those hands are trying to control it, that&#39;s still an area where voting with your wallets, protests, and hurting those companies bottom lines (and worrying their shareholders) can make a HUGE difference in the actions of those companies.</p>

<p>When in the internet is in the control of the government (especially an unelected body like the FCC), we can&#39;t do <em>dick</em>.  That&#39;s the difference, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m anti-NN.  Because big government is NOT your friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people in government do want to control, and some people in government believe in less government regulation.  Removing NN frees up regulation for companies which are the gatekeepers to internet access for citizens.</p>

<p>Think about all of the Middle-Eastern countries where the government can send out a message to all of the country ISPs saying &quot;Hey guys, Twitter is banned until further notice.&quot; and all of the ISPs dutifully comply.  That&#39;s an example of full government control over internet access.</p>

<p>We are not there, and having NN would not put us there, but removing NN takes us a firm step back from such a point, which is why the repeal bill has my support.</p>
