        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all, I don&#39;t frequent this sub a lot so apologies in advance if you&#39;ve seen this before. I just thought of this like a week ago and I can&#39;t get it out of my head.</p>

<p>If you folks have any information debunking my theory I&#39;m all ears. I haven&#39;t done too much research into this subject so pardon me for being ignorant if that&#39;s how I come off, that&#39;s not my intention.</p>

<p>Okay, so here it is. American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. We all know that. The pentagon is 71 feet tall (21.6 meters). A boeing 757 (the plane used to crash into the Pentagon) is between 44ft 6in (minimum) and 45ft and 1in (maximum) (13.59 meters (minimum) and 13.74 meters (maximum)) according to (this)[<a href="http://www.b757.info/boeing-757-200-specifications/">http://www.b757.info/boeing-757-200-specifications/</a>] website. This is based off of tail height. It made a direct impact going at over 530 mph. (~853 kph).</p>

<p>My question is how did just a few pilots who had very limited commercial flight experience manage to direct the plane off course, set a new trajectory east, managed to lower it from their current flight altitude which is difficult without it going into a tailspin, manage to get it 70 feet off the ground going 500+ mph and make a direct impact into the pentagon.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even fly commercial planes like you would little Cessna or the else like. With smaller planes (I&#39;ve heard, I&#39;m no pilot just a curious person about this flight) you can &quot;essentially&quot; fly it like a car, just in the air. Observe your surroundings, you use your eyes and a few instruments. Where as it seems like commercial planes are all instruments and a lot less visual intake to fly those machines. How did one master all the controls on a commercial plane in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m open ears to anything you folks have to say I just think it&#39;s too curious not to think about.</p>

<p>Because logic dictates that all four aircraft on 9/11 were remote controlled drones.</p>

<p>There is even historical president for this, they wanted to use commercial aircraft drones in the 60s for a false flag terror event, it was code named Operation Northwoods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Anyone who has so much as driven past the Pentagon can see with the naked eye that there is absolutely NWIH that a Boeing 757 flew at that trajectory, speed, etc., missed all the trees, highway overpasses, streetlamps, and didn&#39;t so much as disturb one freakin&#39; blade of grass until it hit the building absolutely bulls-eye. Can&#39;t pull off that turn, at that speed, at that angle, and leave no trace...well, we all know.</p>

<p>Bottom line; anyone who believes the official story is a moron...the greatest &quot;feat&quot; in aviation history pulled off by idiots who couldn&#39;t even fly Cessnas according to their own script...lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. Air traffic controllers have had the ability to over ride a aircraft flights path with remote controlled capability, in the event of a hijacking. I forgot the exact term for this technology, but its been around for a while. Some speculate the trajectory for these crashes were pre programmed and remotely piloted.</p>

<p>I don’t have any evidence to disprove your theory, I’m just here to support it. 
What did it for me was wtc 7.  And Silverstein saying “we decided to pull it” while knowing it takes days of labor and planning to set up a building to collapse in its own footprint at terminal velocity.  I think he spoke the truth and the entire complex was rigged to collapse perhaps weeks in advance.  He took out some massive insurance on the property just before those events took place, coincidentally.  </p>

<p>I just can’t wrap my head around the thought that there’s people who would participate in such horrors. 
Or how they stay silent about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>free fall speed, not terminal velocity</p>

<p>the shills will argue the semantics of the phrase &quot;pull it&quot; by saying that he meant to &quot;pull&quot; the firefighters and let the building burn</p>

<p>so its best to focus on what he says right after, which is &quot;... and then we watched [WTC7] collapse&quot;</p>

<p>since WTC7 only took a few seconds to collapse, its clear that Larry Silverstein was looking directly at WTC7 when it collapsed</p>

<p>and why would he be looking at WTC7 of all things, at that exact moment, unless he was anticipating something...like a collapse </p>

<p>theres not much ambiguity when he says &quot;and we watched the building collapse&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even with just a couple hours flight time in a flight simulator, flying a commercial jet that size like it’s a fighter jet is impossible and would destroy the framework of the plane. </p>

<p>Just flight 77 alone (God rest their souls) with the Pentagon strike.... just as you said, 500+mph, 70 feet off the ground is like hitting a bullseye, at the bottom of a twisting playground covered slide with a bow and arrow.   </p>

<p>I don’t know the answers, to what happened that day. But any intelligent mind must ask how so many coincidences happened. </p>

<p>The biggest red flag for me was when (((they))) found that hijacker’s passport in the street.  And offered it as evidence that the entire operation was a terrorist plot. 
See that doesn’t work, if a massive jet slams into a building with enough fuel to melt steel beams, absolutely obliterating anything inside that jet, how can a paper booklet survive unscathed? No fucking way. </p>

<p>Then there’s the clip of 175 (of which I knew two victims from my hometown) going into the wtc over and over and over....not exploding externally but only exploding after it had disappeared COMPLETELY into the building like a phantom. Doesn’t make sense. Feels like I’m watching cheap video game CGI. </p>

<p>But what do I know. I’ve never seen a plane hit a skyscraper before. </p>

<p>I bet that’s what (((they))) were counting on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why is it that if an airplane crashes into the ground and its NOT terrorism related, they gather up all the wreckage and rebuild the airplane in a hangar, down to the last rivet</p>

<p>but if that same airplane crashes into the ground and it IS terrorism related, they don&#39;t reconstruct the airplane because its best to assume what happened instead of verifying what happened </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if they expose idiocy, or just shoddy thinking.  Most people just parrot what they&#39;ve heard before, because it&#39;s hard coming to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually never heard <em>Correlation</em> <strong>Precludes</strong> <em>Causation</em> - anybody that says that doesn&#39;t understand logic, but if we&#39;re talking about reddit comments, that seems to be the rule rather than the exception.  It&#39;s getting harder all the time to find anyone who can objectively parse a simple declarative sentence.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor is a little trickier - most that use it don&#39;t understand it&#39;s a rule of thumb, not a proof; the trick is knowing when to apply it.  You always have to remember that, when you hear hoofbeats, it just <em>might</em> be zebras.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correlation Precludes Causation is a bit of tongue-in-cheek</p>

<p>often when i am debating someone i will give an example of a cause-and-effect, and they will invariably say </p>

<p>&quot;thats a correlation... and correlation doesn&#39;t mean causation&quot;</p>

<p>and they dismiss the example precisely because it has a correlation, as if they have been conditioned to think that correlation precludes causation </p>

<p>for example, ill cite this case where vaccine caused autism, and observe how you respond to it...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I like it. One of my favorite things to say in a &quot;debate&quot; is &quot;All murderers have eaten mashed potatoes, so if we make mashed potatoes illegal, there won&#39;t be any more murders, right?&quot;, but the irony is usually wasted.</p>

<p>I read an interesting take on illiteracy that applies to too many of the positions I see proposed.  </p>

<p>3 Levels of Illiteracy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1) Can&#39;t read a soup can</p></li>
<li><p>2) Can read the words in an article, can understand what most of the words mean, but not what the article is saying</p></li>
<li><p>3) Can understand what the what the article is saying but not understand the point the author was making, or the logical thinking the author used to get there</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Group 1) is getting smaller, but there are an increasing number of people who fall into 2) and 3), as evidenced by their willingness to spout stock phrases from the herd or some &quot;authority figure&quot; of dubious distinction because they can&#39;t think things through for themselves.  (If one were of a conspiratorial nature, one might assume this increase is the desired result of the current clown show that masquerades as &quot;education&quot;.)</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just me using anecdotal evidence, I guess.</p>

<p>i heard somewhere that half of the population is &quot;functionally illiterate&quot; which means they can read the words but can&#39;t comprehend the meanings behind them</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/">There are some interesting ideas here.</a></strong></p>

<p>The notes on illiteracy are from the March 5 essay &quot;Suppose you write to your child and then remember he can’t read?&quot;</p>

<p>From the essay:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Any person who has looked into the history of education in America soon learns—from authors John Taylor Gatto and Charlotte Iserbyt, for example—that the system has been intentionally rigged and degraded, because who in power wants millions of independent, literate, logical minds out there questioning and analyzing what elite power is really doing?</em></p>

<p><em>The way back from the swamp of incompetence and futility isn’t a short journey. But it can be accomplished, one teacher and one student at a time. One class at a time.</em></p>

<p><em>If not in a school, then at home.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you listen to the witnesses, especially Roosevelt Roberts, a Pentagon police officer, you&#39;ll know that no plane hit the building.  They blew it up, its the only option if Roosevelt saw a plane fly away from the building.</p>

<p>He ran from the loading dock after the explosion and saw a plane.  There wasn&#39;t two planes so......they blew it up and the impossible turn and loop that Hani Hanjour did was done by a decoy plane.  Made to look like it impacted.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they took 84 video tapes from the area.  If the all showed the plane actually impacting, they would be used to prove their side of the story as legit.  Since they were all taken away, you can guess they don&#39;t show anything except a plane flying over the building.</p>
