       A spenders tax vs. an income tax.  I'd rather be taxed on spending because it encourages more savings (something most people have none of but they all have 65 inch TVs and 1,000 cable channels)

       same here.  I buy all my clothes and shoes at salvation army.  You can usually find some really nice stuff that's barely or never been worn.  I think people are more embarrassed to actually shop there than they are to wear the clothes, because you can find some seriously expensive stuff for like $2.  Their loss

       THIS.

      <p>
       When you tax consumption instead of production, it is fairer for everyone. The rich end up paying a whole lot more than what they do now, and the poor actually contribute to the system. (Over 50% do not pay any federal income tax currently)
      </p>
      <p>
       The rich guy wants to buy a $60 million yacht? Fine, but you will end up paying $6 million in sales tax.

       This is completely untrue. The wealthy invest much more than they spend, while lower classes live paycheck to paycheck and are forced to spend their income on taxable expenses, which would go up by a huge margin

       We already have this in most states with state sales tax, and nobody bats an eye. It's the fairest tax structure there is. The more you consume, the more you pay in taxes. There are certain things that are generally exempt from state sales tax, such as quite a few food stuffs.
      </p>

       I'd be fine with exempting things such as food and clothing and other essentials from federal sales tax, while implementing a federal sales tax on other non-essential items such as electronics.

       True there hasn't been much outcry against state sales tax that I know of, but it is generally a small tax. In my state there has recently been a very large movement to get rid of property taxes, which are another regressive tax of a similar nature

       That's fine, but it's still going to place a higher burden on the lower classes. If a family who makes 50k and buys a ps4 it doesn't mean a family who makes 1mil is going to buy the equivalent of 20 ps4s. Rich people simply don't buy as much to stimulate the economy proportional to their income

       Rich people do tend to spend their money though. More expensive cars, bigger houses, bigger televisions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, 50" 4k TV's can be found for less than $400 now, which enables those with less money to obtain one. You want a 55" OLED TV though and you are looking at $2,000+.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly will place A burden on the lower classes. I wouldn't say higher because right now the lower classes have no federal income tax burden.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that means that they have to save a little longer for a PS4 or go without, then I'm ok with that. I'm tired of people thinking that wealth is a "right" when in fact it isn't. "Pursuit of Happiness" is not the same as "I get everything I want because it makes me happy."
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up poor, the oldest of 6 kids. Most of my clothes were hand me downs from my uncles. My father was the only bread winner in the family. I got a toy on my birthday and a toy on Christmas. My parents would save a little each month, and they had a budget of $20 for each kid's birthday gift and $100 for each kid's Christmas gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We didn't have video game systems, big screens, etc, and if there was anything we wanted we had to come up with the money ourselves. I remember a neighbor needed her entire perimeter fence painted, and it took me 3 weeks to do it, working a few hours a day. I was paid $20 for the entire job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never did my parents once ask for assistance. If we were low on cash, well we broke out some food storage and had barley soup for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       It never crossed my family's mind that anyone owed us a damn thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gotten to where I am now because I worked my ass off. I wanted to go to college, and instead of getting massive student loan debt, I worked my ass off. If I didn't have enough money for a class, I waited until next semester. Did it drag college out a bit? Absolutely, but at least I don't have all of that debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not rich by any means, though I would consider myself upper-middle class for the area of the country in which I live. My point is this: If I can do it, anybody can. People need to remember that the country is about EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, not EQUAL OUTCOME.

       You are partially correct. The Federal Government does NOT tax sales. There is no federal sales tax.

       Sales tax is specifically a state thing. There is state sales tax. I'm talking about implementing a federal sales tax.

       I was /s.  I have my old parents sofa from 20 years ago, free kitchen table set a coworker gave me in 2009, I dont own a large TV let alone have cable. I buy stuff and expect it to last forever.  I dont buy a new bed thinking I am going to buy a new one in a few years, I am buying a bed to last as long as possible...like the Ikea 20 yr bed I bought 6 years ago, still good and I still have the receipt just in case.

       What is your response to the fact that those taxes disproportionately impact the lower/middle classes?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason we are taxed on both income and spending, eliminating taxes on the majority of the upper-classes and corporations income would result in a much higher sales tax in order to bring in income to balance the budget. This tax makes it much more difficult for the lower/middle class to purchase day to day items and services

       My response is they don't pay those taxes anyway, they can afford loopholes to be created/exploited.  A tax on spending = no loopholes.  I'm for a flat income tax (like 9%) with tariffs but higher state sales taxes.  I'd rather the money go to my state that has lower corruption than the federal govt who just waste or steals it.

       There’s a finite number of ways you can legally reduce income taxes owed, so closing every loophole isn’t some impossible task.

       No but the high priced lawyers always find a way.  That is why facebook has its revenue in ireland, and the panama papers are a mile long with names.  It's less about regulations that they will 100% evade anyway given enough time, and more about reducing the initiatives to cheat the system and make it a flat tax system for all that reduces the potential for future loopholes.

       You don’t show why a flat tax is necessary.  You correctly identify the flaws in the current system, claim that they’re the result of loopholes, and propose that we should close the loopholes to solve the problem.  Then you tack on “flat tax” to it for no reason.

       Because anyone with a pencil can audit Amazon, Google, Facebook's taxes in minutes.   Simpler is always better.  If companies are paying 0% now it would be easier to get them from 0% to 9%, vs. 0% to 35%.   And the international rates are more in the 10%-15% range anyway, so we have to be near that or they will just move the revenue offshore again.  Once you all tiers,  people will look to game the system and you are back to square one wuth the loophole searches and lobbying.

       I feel like some investigative journalism needs to be done on how the wealthy and mega corps avoid paying taxes, and what they end up paying across all governments.  Deductions within the US tax code are one method, and offshoring is its own thing; solving the former is just a matter of getting rid of the regs that allow the deductions, the latter might be a matter of adding regs.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A flat tax is necessary because there is actually no other form of representative taxation that is ethical. You and I should pay the same portion of what we're worth for protection by the government. That is the essence of taxation. Any divergences from that part "same portion" is fundamental discrimination. Everyone is so quick to be a proponent for taxing the rich heavier than the poor, but that is actually wrong. Seriously, there's no way around it. Progressive and regressive taxes are seriously wrong if you actually believe in personal freedom of enterprise in the US. Not everything is concrete though, there are outliers such as corrupt business owners who abuse workers, and disabled workers who cannot support themselves with a job, but there is government intervention for that. Let me pose this simple question and scenario:
      </p>
      <p>
       You make 500k a year. You're in the highest tax bracket, meaning you get taxed a whopping 39.6% of your gross income. You are a brain surgeon who does not make mistakes, with 100k left in student loans and a PhD to back it up. A cashier at Burger King working full time might be taxed 15% of their income($9,325+). Think about your qualifications, your skills, your daily hard work, and your schooling with debt compared with that of a entry level worker. How do you justify to
       <strong>
        yourself
       </strong>
       , not the cashier, that you get taxed nearly triple in proportion with him? It's very easy to say that a lower income person should be taxed less because they already make less, but that is completely irrational and against the foundations of equal capitalism and democracy. Given that in the absence of corruption as prevented by the government, a person's wealth is
       <strong>
        directly
       </strong>
       related to the advances that a person has made in their experience or education. I do not believe a rational person who is actually making a high income would be able to justify it. It's because it's unjustifiable.

       Do you support equality in the market? If your answer is yes you cannot disagree with my statements. Unless you value unfair and discriminatory taxation, there is no other argument than that everyone should be taxed equally. As I said, there are outliers, like the corrupt. But the average rich person is not corrupt. It is nothing short of criminal to make a more successful person forfeit a higher portion of their money yearly.

       Your skills, education, job, and income are not discriminated against by government policies, practices, and corruption in the market, whether it be through physical discrimination by companies or poor workplace standards set by law-breaking corrupt employers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we have a huge corruption problem in our domestic markets, and we also have huge monopoly problems. Those problems along with the support of the impoverished are the only purposes of our government in the market. My point is that all of that aside, there is no way in hell it makes sense to tax the rich more. They fucking earned it. There is literally nothing else to say other than they deserve to have the same proportion of disposable income. There are other ways for the government to make money than to unfairly scalp the rich because they can balance the checkbooks easier.

It's unethical to let people hoard wealth when so much preventable suffering is happening in the world due to poverty.  Progressive taxation allows for a redistribution of wealth to help those who need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking poor people who are less able or unable to afford taxes to pay the same rate as rich people who are more able to do so seems backwards to me.  You're exacerbating the situation for an already vulnerable section of the population by asking them to pay the same rate as those who are invulnerable (in terms of wealth).

       I hope you understand a flat tax can be implemented at less than 15% for everyone, equally. Welfare is the problem, and promoting an actual crime like a progressive tax is the wrong way to solve the problem you think we have.  Welfare is not a support system to supplement the income of the poverty, it's a restriction system that only helps people when they literally act as dead meat in the market (consuming with gov't money instead of creating capital themselves). Abolish welfare, institute &lt;15% unified income tax, reduce sales tax but implement it in all states in a smaller amount, and you can then actually give out income subsidies. Income subsidies are negative income taxes, and the government would be able to offer it with the funds from the welfare system. The government would offer 50% of the poverty rate in the US to every taxable head, as a subsidy, to replace welfare. There are no employment restrictions in this method. When you make more money, you get a smaller portion of the income subsidy, but for every 1$ you earn in wages you would lose less than 1$ in the subsidy(which is an incentive to not be unemployed).
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope that makes even a shred of sense because you are really missing the point I'm trying to make about the tax. It's completely not about whether the rich
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       pay the tax, it's "is the tax fair". It is not fair. That is a fact. You seem to be familiar with Marx so I'll also make the point that there are much better ways to decrease "alienated workers", that don't conflict with the laws of equal liberty most people believe in. My entire first paragraph is an example of a better way.

       You keep stating that's it's unfair to make the rich pay a higher rate because it's unequal treatment.  That's just one way to frame it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to frame is in terms of excess income (i.e. income remaining after necessities).  You could say that poor people only have &lt;10% excess income before taxes and rich people have &gt;90% excess income before taxes.  Framing it this way, it seems unfair to make poor people pay the same rate when their excess income can't even cover the 15% rate you propose.  You're making poor people pay a greater share of their excess income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since these are both valid ways to frame the situation, the question now becomes a matter of what's more unfair:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Making rich people pay a higher tax rate, or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Making poor people pay a greater share of their excess income
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenario 1 is asking more of people who are able to sacrifice more, whereas scenario 2 is asking more of people who are less able to sacrifice more.  Both scenarios are asking for more, but asking for more from the poor seems less fair to me.

       Sure, closing all loopholes would be a great idea.  I wonder why no one's ever thought of it before.

      <p>
       If it's as easy as "let's just close all the loopholes!", then let's just end all of corruption and stop spending so much on war related expenses.  Then my taxes are much lower by orders of magnitude and I don't care so much about how much I'm being taxed or loopholes because it's no longer an unreasonable amount.

       I was responding to someone who proposed a spending tax to close loopholes.  My point was why not keep progressive taxation while addressing those same loopholes.  With that context, it’s a legitimate question and not the asinine one you’re making it out to be.

       Another thing is that now that they have less competition, the prices will go up.

       They buy more because the tariffs mean that American workers are no longer having to compete on wages with foreign workers who make very little and an industry heavily subsidized by foreign governments.  So American workers take home higher wages and buy more stuff.

       If wages go up then the price of the finished American-made product will go up as well. So now you have huge price increases on domestic AND imported products. The lower classes will end up paying
       <em>
        more

       in net tax  than before.

       Actually you are the one who argued that wages would
       <em>
        increase

       if tariffs are added. So I said that this would case price increases as well.

       Removing minimum-wage is not going to help in this situation, because those added tariffs are causing the wage increases (by your argument).

       Yeah, that's how paying a decent, living wage works.  It raises the price of things.  That's the appeal of outsourcing jobs (like, say, steel and aluminum manufacturing) to countries where employees make a tiny fraction of what American workers make, it lowers the cost of goods.

       But if prices of things increase, then the increased wages don't matter. The poor worker will still be poor, and since there are tariffs on imported goods then he also still can not afford the imports.

       Even if jobs pay more then things will also cost more so it's the same or worse. 
Secondly, there wont necessarily be
       <em>
        more

       jobs, some businesses that rely on low tariffs might fail and so jobs will be lost also.

       What is your response to the fact that the current income tax system in our country is absurdly progressive and disproportionately impacts the upper/rich classes?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two sides to every coin. The terrible part is we are stuck in a system that abuses both ends of the income spectrum and funnels money to the government. The solution, in my opinion, is a complete abandoning of the current welfare system, drop the progressive income tax in favor of a 14-16% flat tax, and institute a smaller sales tax in place of the high sales taxes on common goods. With Welfare gone and their employment-restrictions for support gone, a yearly income subsidy can then be added. The amount would depend on half of the poverty wage, with actual incentives, not restrictions on hours or pay like welfare, to stay employed. As your income rises, your subsidy lessens. The rich would get little to nothing yearly and the poor would get the max amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a really quick explanation of what I believe but if you're interested on the actual viability of a system like this in the US then check out

       What happens when you stick $1,000 in the bank and wait a month? It gains interest. What happens if in that same month you deposited $5,000? You'd earn 5x the interest compounded monthly. Rich people get richer. That is how shit works. They also buy all of the factors of production in the market. What I'm saying is your entire comment is bullshit. Please explain to me how it is
       <strong>
        fair
       </strong>
       to pay triple in tax. Don't explain to me why you think the rich can handle it, because that doesn't matter. The tax is not fair in any sense of the word. Any tax that takes money away disproportionately is ridiculous. Would you support a Caucasian tax so that white people have to pay more? No, that's inherent racism, and the same concept applies to making the rich pay more. It's systematic discrimination based on income. How can you support both communist ideologues and our capitalist system? Pick or choose one man you cannot believe in personal liberty
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       wealth redistribution. Those are two polar opposite ideas.

       It isn't a hard concept: the rich can contribute more to society. But not only that, but many of these rich people exploit the workers in this country, so why should these same workers pay the tax rates as their exploiters? Why should the Waltons, who have a greater net worth than the bottom 40% of this nation, get taxed at the same rate?

       I would completely disagree with you. The rich are taxed at a higher rate, but the burden on them is far less due to how much money they have or make. A middle or lower class person is far more impacted losing 15-25% of their salary to taxes than a millionaire is at losing 40%, especially since that tax rate only applies to any income they make over 470k. We need more/better tax brackets, but it is false to pretend like the rich are actually impacted more by our tax system than the middle class is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of your post, I have generally leaned libertarian  in my life and I'm familiar with negative income taxes. The fair tax act failed to satisfy me since the prebate was small and I am opposed to the flat tax being a sales tax, but I think there is potential in the idea if it were to have a flat income tax that properly taxed investments and capital gains, and that the corporate rate were separate and higher

       By the way, I was not referring to Paul's plan, but Friedman's and others much earlier. There of course is a long way to go in determining the optimal rates and amounts of the plan, but the system is already fairer in practice than income taxation. My point is not about whether the extra burden is feasibly paid by a rich person. My point is also not about whether a poor person can handle their tax burden when it is higher. My point is that taxation should be fair, and a flat tax already proportionally takes your money away. The rich pay abundantly more in taxes (except under our current system with loopholes), but the poor still pay 10-15% too. Under the ~15% flat tax, nearly everyone's rate would go down, except for the bottom 9k of earners (part-time). The poor would not be taxed heavier in any other capacity other than the &lt;$9,325 bracket, because it would increase from 10% to 15%. All else stays the same, except the rich gets taxed 25% less. You may think that this 25% would go into their pockets but that is not true. More than 20% of that extra cash would go directly back into investment. Can you imagine what a 20% increase in the velocity of money would do to the GDP? The only time the rich are bad is when they got there through illegitimate means or they are corrupt. All other rich people bolster the economy, innovate, and create. Not one rich person just amasses wealth and sits on it, unless they won it in a lottery. Why should the working poor get a income tax subsidy(essentially what it is compared with the rich's taxes) with no discernable skills, no higher education, no motivation. They need to toughen up. Get the fucking skills and put yourself in the damn 1%. There is nothing stopping you in 2018 from doing that.

       People aren't saving because healthcare, education, and housing are incredibly expensive, and the middle class has been gutted. It has nothing to do with cheap TVs or cable/xbox.

       I’ll play devil’s advocate for a second..
      </p>
      <p>
       The tariffs prevent foreign companies from undercutting American products, therefore the tariffs prevent the US consumer from buying equal products at a lower price. They still pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don’t mind. I’d hate to live in a country that relies on foreign products because all of the domestic producers have been priced out.

       When the economy is global it creates a situation where one company can work freely in counties borders. This creates an unfair and almost imperial advantage when foreign companies displace indigenous ones. It's simple imperial theory of center periphery but with multiple centers and the world as a periphery..

       Based on a variety of other factors, higher wages can be good or bad. I think in this instance that these higher wages are good.

       I don't see how bankrupting farmers makes that goal more likely. Regardless. The main point here is that there will be retaliatory tariffs that affect millions of american jobs. The idea that this is only about the us domestic market is a dangerous oversimplification. The countries that are going to be worst affected by this are Canada and mexico. I don't see how damaging the country's closest allies is a smart move. Especially when it is a move that forces the rest of the world to work against the interests of the us.

      <p>
       Taxing commodities like steel and aluminum actually helps foreign products.  For instance, if you impose a steel tariff, suddenly auto manufacturers in the US have increased input costs than auto manufacturers abroad, meaning they have to price their cars higher.  That makes foreign cars more competitive and better able to undercut US auto manufacturers.

       We shouldn't need those with income taxes either.  They exits because (1) the tax preparation lobby repeatedly kills efforts that would have the IRS do the calculations automatically for the vast majority of Americans with simple returns, like many western countries already do, and (2) Congress loves to give handouts to favored businesses or try to effect substantive policy through tax preferences, complicating everything.

       The reasoning behind this is actually that having an “opt-in” income tax system forces people to calculate their own tax, thus insuring they’re liable for the minimum amount allowed, whereas a system like you’re describing would have the government send you a bill and you defend your position for owing less tax. It’s both less efficient, from a practical stanfpoint, to do it that way and would leave many Americans in a position where they simply pay their income tax bill, right or wrong, without ever actually checking it. Forcing people to calculate it themselves is for their own good.

       The amount of increased expenditure id have to pay on commercial items compared to what the government currently extracts from my paycheck is insane.  I’d much rather have the choice then see the $1000+ a month I pay the government just to work and provide for my family sounds like a fair trade to me.

       It's just standard economics. It's not "them passing costs on to you", and it's not them keeping money for marketing and jets. If there's any sort of tax on goods, supply and demand will make it so that the consumer and producer will both bear the costs of the tax.

        Tariffs were the main source of revenue for the federal government from 1789 to 1914. During this period, there was vigorous debate between the various political parties over the setting of tariff rates. In general
        <strong>
         Democrats favored a tariff that would pay the cost of government, but no higher

       Republicans also ended slavery while Democrats had supported slavery. People aren't lying when they say the Democratic Party was the party of the KKK. The thing is that there was a huge politicial realignment in the 20th century when racist Dixiecrats became Republicans and the Republicans started using the "southern strategy" of using racist dogwhistles to appeal to racist white identity politics. Seriously though Republicans used to be progressive. Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican and he quit the party to try to start a third party, and he called it the Progressive Party.

        Roosevelt left office in 1909. He had selected Taft, his Secretary of War, to succeed him as presidential candidate and Taft easily won the 1908 presidential election. Roosevelt became disappointed by Taft's increasingly conservative policies... They became openly hostile and Roosevelt decided to seek the presidency. Roosevelt entered the campaign late as Taft was already being challenged by progressive leader Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin. Most of La Follette's supporters switched to Roosevelt, leaving the Wisconsin Senator embittered. Nine of the states where progressive elements were strongest had set up preference primaries, which Roosevelt won, but Taft had worked far harder than Roosevelt to control the Republican Party's organizational operations and the mechanism for choosing its presidential nominee, the 1912 Republican National Convention. For example, he bought up the votes of delegates from the southern states, copying the technique Roosevelt himself used in 1904. The Republican National Convention rejected Roosevelt's protests. Roosevelt and his supporters walked out and the convention re-nominated Taft. The next day, Roosevelt supporters met to form a new political party of their own.

       One of the reasons why we have subsidies and tariffs, and things like "Buy American", is to grow our nation's independence and maintain a strong and diverse industry.

       Buying cheap labor from a foreign country (human rights abuses aside) is fine, except you pay for it tenfold in the future when the prices hike and your domestic industry is too far behind to compete.

       I did not know that so thank you for this. Also kind fun 1913 the year the Fed was started and the tax rape of American works started. I can see them now we don't need to tax foreign company's and country we can tax our own people to death. Time for the old way to come back.  America is one of the biggest consumer driven country in the world and tax hike on import won't stop them from doing business  here at all they make to much money from our consumer driven scociaty.

       They weren't taxing "us," unless by "us" you mean the tiny percentage of Americans who controlled almost all the wealth in 1913. At that time the average factory worker worked over 55 hours a week was paid crap, and almost all the wealth was being taken in by the few at the very tippy top. There's a reason that only about 15% of Americans paid income taxes at that time, they weren't taxing the average worker, just trying to correct the gross collection of wealth at the top that was created by the gilded age.

       Basically. I genuinely think that if people read more about the abuses that large monopolies engaged in during the late 1800s and early 1900s we wouldn't have to constantly re-debate these issues. They weren't called Robber Barons for nothing, and that is the truth of undebatable truth of unrestricted Capitalism.

       No. Thats not free market capitalism. Thats a mixed economic system like the one in the USA which is more closely aligned with the principles of socialism than capitalism: progressive taxation, redistribution, central banks etc. Those are anti capitalist ideas born of socialist principles.

       Are you serious? Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production. Something we must produce is money and that is privatised.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government controlled the central bank we'd be communist. This is like pre 101 dude.

       Yeah a capitalist idea to get more cash into the hands of more people. You only see the entire system as a system of socialism when socialism is only used just enough to stop the peasants from revolting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed is a private entity because of capitalism and we must "borrow" to get more money. If the government controlled the Fed then we wouldn't be "in debt".

       You're just not getting it. You can't create an endless capitalist consumer culture without unlocking the money supply from a finite resource like gold. On top of that, it's just flat out cheaper to ship mass amounts of items over the Pacific than it is to hire American workers.

       It shouldnt be cheaper to produce it thousands of miles away and ship it unless there was some way.... i know! Lets use slaves and resources mined by slaves! And thats why i pay double or more for the things i buy which arent made by slaves.

       No, that's not true.  It's similar to the tragedy of the commons.  Even accepting your premise - that purchasing goods from China "contribut[es] to the people who ruin the economy and enabl[es] them further" - for an individual there is no rational self-interest in purchasing goods at a markup to avoid that situation unless everyone (or at least most) makes the same decision.  Hence the push for tariffs to force the decision on all people through government policy.

       It's not about "too stupid to be ethical on their own," it's about incentives.  A lot of regulations are based on incentives.  I assume you're not "too stupid to be ethical" and do things like voluntarily recycle, invest only in ethical corporations (socially responsible investing), pay full price for media (and never pirate), and the like even when against your own financial incentives.

       Ok then ill just state it outright: socialism doesnt work and its an unethical system. Its not what i advocated at all. How you got that i would like socialism from what i said indicates that you have poor reading comprehension.

       I am specifically referring to China, as they fund the warlords in Africa and have colonized it for the purpose of extracting conflict minerals to use in manufactured goods that retarded westerners go out and buy(iPhones and assorted Foxconn trash like that). They give the warlords weapons and in return they get slave mined resources, including gold, which China has been stockpiling over 90% of the annual production of for about a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you havent been paying attention to whats been going on in places like Sudan for decades either, slavery is thriving in Africa, thanks in large part to China. Slave labour also thrives in shitholes like China and N Korea. You may not realize just how many slaves there currently are throughout the world. Perhaps you should google up the statistics before you go buy your next piece of Made in China garbage.

       As much as I love Trump taxing imports of steel is a bad decision. It will put every manufacture in the US that makes anything with steel at a disadvantage compared to foreign manufactures that can buy cheaper steel on the world market. Good for the US steel industry, bad for everyone else. If you are going to put up tariffs, do it on finished goods.

       So you buy 100% of the goods you purchase from a slave labour using communist regime. I see no problem with you paying twice as much on principle alone.

       "Slavery" isn't meant as literal. They're enslaved by circumstances (take this job or die of poverty) not by an actual enslaving force.

       We already have this in most states with state sales tax, and nobody bats an eye. It's the fairest tax structure there is. The more you consume, the more you pay in taxes. There are certain things that are generally exempt from state sales tax, such as quite a few food stuffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be fine with exempting things such as food and clothing and other essentials from federal sales tax, while implementing a federal sales tax on other non-essential items such as electronics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do need food and clothing to function, but you don't need a PS4 or big screen.

       same here.  I buy all my clothes and shoes at salvation army.  You can usually find some really nice stuff that's barely or never been worn.  I think people are more embarrassed to actually shop there than they are to wear the clothes, because you can find some seriously expensive stuff for like $2.  Their loss
