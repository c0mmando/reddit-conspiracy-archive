    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re getting heavily down-voted but you&#39;re at least somewhat right. Personally I started smoking weed because I did research and saw that it wasn&#39;t as bad as we were being told. However, a majority of people I smoked with couldn&#39;t care less about health effects, they also smoked cigarettes. I think a lot of people at least tried weed because of pop culture. If the powers that be don&#39;t want people smoking weed than why is controlled pop culture so heavily in favor of weed? It&#39;s difficult to reconcile. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that tptb want weed to be both popular and illegal, thus funneling money into the black economy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of cognitive dissonance surrounding the marijuana debate and it doesn&#39;t seem so black and white.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is it should be legal. It&#39;s no worse than any other legal drug and can cause people to view subjects from perspectives they may not have considered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. It&#39;s complex but the min and largest point is that there <em>is a lot of research and evidence</em> and it&#39;s easily accessible, which it wasn&#39;t before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right. There&#39;s a real movement of responsible drug use that has come about due to the information age. Drug test kits are supplied at a lot of festivals these days and drug education is focused on risk management rather than risk avoidance. </p>

<p>(When I was taking health in hs ~5 years ago we still got fed a bunch of bullshit though, we got told the story about the guy that took acid and thought he was a carrot and had to water himself under the hose every day for he rest of his life. lol everyone&#39;s uncle new of a similar story as well)</p>

<p>Although this movement has been contributed to by an independently informed citizenry, I find it odd that it hasn&#39;t been countered with more propaganda and social manipulation. Those in control have <em>a lot</em> of control, so why are we being allowed to forge a path toward freedom?</p>

<p>Although I think it&#39;s great progress, all drugs should be legal, I find it interesting it&#39;s not met with more resistance.  </p>

<p>The only answer I can come up with is inflating the back economy in the short term. Ultimately though legalization is going to hurt organised crime, and that&#39;s where a great deal of power is sourced. I&#39;d love to see more discussion on the topic of potential motives for the progress toward legalization. The problem is you can&#39;t discuss it without being accused of being anti-drug. I&#39;m pro legalization but I also want to explore the pop-culture phenomenon and possible motives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is less resistance because falsehood and lies can only survive for so long in the face of facts, research, and a consistently positive sharing of experiences. </p>

<p>The reality is that the real safety issues around drugs arise from poor social policies/lack of healthcare and social support, aggressive criminalization, and spreading of false information as opposed to correct information with encouragement  of self-care and proper safety. </p>

I tend to be overly skeptical, especially when faced with a good thing.

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you exactly what they are going to do, they are going to put glycerol in it, specifically to form Acrolein, which reduces glutathione in the body, the main antioxidant, the big boss. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898112000411">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898112000411</a></p>

<p>&quot;The results suggest that stroke is aggravated when nervous system tissues have a reduced level of glutathione.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584993900583">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584993900583</a></p>

<p>&quot;The fact that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a more potent stimulator of oxygen radical formation than acrolein indicates that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a toxic metabolite of acrolein and may be responsible for some of the in vivo toxicity of acrolein.&quot;</p>

<p>Acrolein literally forms an adduct bond with glutathione and turns into glutathionylpropionaldehyde, which in turn, loses its free radical scavenging ability (loss of glutathione), AND there is a GREATER production of free radicals, and most of them being oxygenated species, some of the strongest, greedy little fucking oxygens. </p>

<p>Everyone immediately wondering, what does this have to do with smoking?</p>

<p>Remember when I told you that they add glycerol to cigarettes? </p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.200700412/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.200700412/full</a></p>

<p>&quot;Chemical reactions responsible for release of acrolein include heat-induced dehydration of glycerol,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Smoking of tobacco products equals or exceeds the total human exposure to acrolein from all other sources. &quot; <strong>THIS IS IMPORTANT, because acrolein is formed in small amounts when we deep fry french fries, and other various food stuffs, BUT NOTHING compared to what a smoker will get, literally like 100~500 to 1 in terms of exposure amounts</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Acrolein is metabolized by conjugation with glutathione and excreted in the urine as mercapturic acid metabolites.&quot;</p>

<p>Glutathione is depleted by Michael addition to acrolein, which leads to even more ROS/free radicals. The glutathionylpropionaldehyde formed, as stated with peer reviewed information, also enhances/increases the amount of ROS/free radicals, and glutathionylpropionaldehyde does an even better job at elevating ROS than acrolein alone. </p>

<p>This can all can be found in &quot;Frontiers in Antioxidants Research
Book by Harold V. Panglossi&quot; as well. </p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.200700412/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.200700412/full</a></p>

<p>&quot;The biological effects of acrolein are a consequence of its reactivity towards biological nucleophiles such as guanine in DNA and cysteine, lysine, histidine, and arginine residues in critical regions of nuclear factors, proteases, and other proteins. Acrolein adduction disrupts the function of these biomacromolecules which may result in mutations, altered gene transcription, and modulation of apoptosis.&quot;</p>

<p>The last linked quote is the fucking scariest when you pull it all together. </p>

<p>What they are going to do is add glycerin/glycerol to marijuana, so it is doing the same thing as tobacco.</p>

<p>They have to.</p>

<p>Marijuana has... amazing abilities:</p>

<p>&quot;Altogether, these data strongly suggest for the first time that activation of the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway may play a pivotal role in the oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation and atherogenesis. &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958274">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958274</a></p>

<p>&quot;Sustained ceramide accumulation in tumor cells mediates cannabinoid-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies. This effect seems to be due to the impact of ceramide on key cell signalling systems such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and the Akt pathway.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR: THC or CBD oil intake increases ceramide levels, generated by hydrolysis of the membrane sphingophospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) through the action of a sphingomyelinase, and the increase ceramide levels control programmed cell death, and much more that we are still learning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531545">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531545</a></p>

<p>&quot;This enzyme is regulated by several mechanisms, including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated protein FAN (for factor associated with N-SMase activation) and <strong>oxidative stress</strong>. &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0300_313">https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0300_313</a></p>

<p>&quot;Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active component of marijuana, induces apoptosis of transformed neural cells in culture.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; intratumoral administration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced a considerable regression of malignant gliomas in Wistar rats and in mice deficient in recombination activating gene 2. Cannabinoid treatment did not produce any substantial neurotoxic effect in the conditions used. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Experiments with two subclones of C6 glioma cells in culture showed that cannabinoids signal apoptosis by a pathway involving cannabinoid receptors, sustained ceramide accumulation and Raf1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.&quot;</p>

<p>BUT WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THE KNOWLEDGE IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, MAYBE I LIED, MAYBE I MADE ALL THESE PEER REVIEWED STUDIES TO TRICK YOU, who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Denver Police Department said the violations are criminal in nature, but <strong>would not go into specifics</strong>. Officers executed search and arrest warrants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How convenient... As far as we know they were raided for no good reason, because the police department “won’t go into specifics”.</p>

<p>And again, even if they were to “go into specifics” and make known the reason for the busts, the fact remains that licensed dispensaries were raided. Hopefully it’s as simple as a crime being committed and a legitimate raid being conducted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Trump administration threw the burgeoning movement to legalize marijuana into uncertainty Thursday as it lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the pot trade in states where the drug is legal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That happened. We can all hope it amounts to nothing, but why was it done in the first place if not to <em>raid dispensaries</em>?</p>

<p>And let’s not forget...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who represents Colorado, one of eight states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, said the change contradicts a pledge Sessions made to him before being confirmed as attorney general</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should come as no surprise, since plenty of pledges have been contradicted at this point.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/apnews.com/amp/19f6bfec15a74733b40eaf0ff9162bfa">https://www.google.com/amp/s/apnews.com/amp/19f6bfec15a74733b40eaf0ff9162bfa</a></p>

<p>So sure, if we want to engage in mental gymnastics to try to spin this as something other than it is, we can proclaim that nothing has happened yet (although that’s clearly up for debate), but the fact remains that it happened and it does not bode well.</p>

<p>But none of this comes as any surprise with the Republican Party in control of the government. After all, muh big government except when it comes to drugs, abortions, gay marriage, and I’m sure any number of other issues. Then screw states rights because muh morality, which is really just muh religion shitting on the first amendment as, again, Republicans are apt to do.</p>

<p>Many conservatives are wary of what they see as federal intrusion in areas they believe must be left to the states. </p>

<p>Colorado&#39;s U.S. attorney, Bob Troyer, said his office won&#39;t change its approach to prosecution, <strong>despite Sessions&#39; guidance</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is from the horses mouth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the Department&#39;s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,&quot; considering the seriousness of a crime and its impact on the community, Sessions told prosecutors in a one-page memo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ya, he’s telling States what to do about these federal prosecutions, which previously they were letting slide.</p>

<p>But I digress, as do you. Because the fact remains that, regardless of Colorado PD or any other local law enforcement agency, Sessions did this. He did.</p>

<p>What do you suspect his reasoning was? Do you suspect he really didn’t mean what he said and he isn’t against marijuana? </p>
