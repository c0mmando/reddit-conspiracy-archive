        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It won&#39;t happen overnight, as people&#39;s habits take time to change, but the recent purge of alternative voices on all of these platforms will soon backfire.</p>

<p>Very powerful, moneyed interests saw the danger an open internet represented, so they helped a few tech start-ups in the early days corral everyone into these ghettos. Now that they&#39;ve essentially cornered the market, they feel emboldened to try and censor, and/or outright eliminate, voices THEY DON&#39;T LIKE.</p>

<p>Decentralization is the key to solving this problem, and it&#39;s why peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies are vilified by most mainstream outlets. It represents the final death knell for the control freaks.</p>

<p>There are a number of alternatives blossoming as we speak. So, instead of waiting for the inevitable lawsuits to wind their way through the courts, or for the government to enact anti-trust legislation on these monopolies, take matters into your own hands.</p>

<p>For browsers, consider <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">PaleMoon</a> or <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>. Yes, both are a little buggy, but they&#39;re new and need some time to work out all the kinks. Hell, even try Explorer. Anything except Google Chrome.</p>

<p>For search, anything but Google. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> is a decent alternative, as is Bing. Again, it&#39;s about sending a message, so try to use a search engine not using Google on the back end, like StartPage.</p>

<p>There are many YouTube alternatives coming up. Try <a href="https://steemit.com/video/@heimindanger/introducing-dtube-a-decentralized-video-platform-using-steem-and-ipfs">DTube/Steemit</a>, <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/">Bitchute</a>, etc. <a href="https://www.minds.com/">Minds.com</a> is another interesting up-and-coming Social Network. </p>

<p>The point here is to try and refrain from using the typical platforms. Yes, that even means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> is a secure and encrypted e-mail service you can use.</p>

<p>And, of course, there&#39;s <a href="https://gab.ai/">Gab</a> as an alternative to Twitter.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning, many more not listed here are just starting up. The information age is still in its infancy, and the days of monopolistic control are dying... good riddance.</p>

<p>List your own alternatives here. </p>

<p>EDIT: The title really should be, This is the beginning of the end of the <em>dominance</em> of Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc., as they&#39;ll probably still be around in 10 years time, but in a much diminished capacity. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to free your mind, brother - there&#39;s no need to anthropomorphize a concept. Happiness didn&#39;t cause Tuesday, same as a system didn&#39;t cause exploitation, that would be the handiwork of one Mr Jones and Mr Smith. If you can stomach the fact that humans, actual humans are willfully engaging in actions that are pernicious, you can move forward and begin to forge a plan to deal with the specific Mr Joneses and Mr Smiths of the world who are causing all the pain.</p>

<p>The young realize that rampant, mindless consumption isn’t a good thing, it only leads to greed and trouble. The young have the compassion to care for all whether or not they “deserve” it. The young want to explore new ways of distributing wealth while maintaining freedom. The youth know (in a general sense) how fucked and wrong the world and the “game” has become.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a stereotypical comment if there ever was one.</p>

<p>We’re all in this together and we’re all awaking at the same time.  The “old and rich” are the people that built all the systems that made it possible for this awakening to occur.  We’re all standing on the shoulders of giants.  There is no reason to continue the divide and conquer rhetoric by trying to separate people based on age.  And if young people are going to be full of compassion, they shouldn’t be looking down on the old from their high horse, because that’s not what compassion is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By definition stereotypes aren’t valid for all the people being stereotyped.  Aren’t the young supposed to be against stereotyping?  I know it was taught to me that stereotyping was bad when I went to school.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, when I look at the people I see in my life.  I see people across all genres that are fed up with the way things are and are ready for a change.  Trump was voted in on the backs of the working class who were sick of the establishment.  These are people who are ready for change.  I know plenty of young people that are working for the man, heavily indebted to the system, just like the older people that came before them.  It doesn’t matter what people’s intentions are, it’s really hard to live without becoming entangled with the beast.</p>

<p>Old people don’t hate the young.  Old people know what it’s like to be young, and full of energy and optimism.  Old people have families with children and grand children.  I do think older generations have a concern for younger people that have grown up in a purely electronic age by overprotective parents and society.  I’ve heard a lot of comments about how much more freedom to just be a kid that they had when they grew up. </p>

<p>The disenfranchised of multiple generations are becoming more enlightened during an explosion of information becoming broadly available to the masses.</p>

<p>The older disenfranchised had pre-edited information given to them by the companies that work for their paying advertisers.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think that information was corrupted?</p>

<p>What topics are they really censoring though?</p>

<p>Mostly they&#39;re going after anything &quot;ALT&quot;, as in alt-right, alt-health, alt-left, etc. Or what &quot;they&quot; consider &quot;ALT&quot;, as a number of channels are getting swept up by this, not only by the algorithm changes, but by their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/technology/youtube-children.html">newly hired hall monitors</a> as well.  </p>

<p>The problem is who decides what&#39;s ALT, or even offensive or objectionable. Obviously, if it&#39;s illegal, such as child porn, or snuff films (yes, they do exist), then it should be banned. But most of the stuff, even if it&#39;s disinformation or bullshit, should be allowed. Let the viewers decide what content they approve of or not. </p>

<p>Now, whether or not advertisers want to have their commercials on certain content, that&#39;s their prerogative. And content creators who produce or promote controversial subject matter should already be aware of that and find alternatives as means of revenue (if that&#39;s their goal).</p>

<p>In discussing these things, I&#39;m always reminded of what Evelyn Beatrice Hall said when summarizing Voltaire&#39;s stance on free speech: &quot;I don&#39;t agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m just wondering if they’ve actually censored any <strong>topics</strong>. The only one I could find is the David Hogg crisis actor theory. I couldn’t really find any videos representing the side who believes he is a crisis actor.</p>

<p>Aside from that though, what actual topics are actually being censored? There still seem to be plenty of videos about satanic Hillary and her democratic pedophile ring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should probably clarify the semantics, they&#39;re not outright &quot;censoring&quot; any particular <strong>topics</strong>, except for the one you mentioned. But they are banning and/or making it exceedingly difficult for a number of channels, especially if they have large following (i.e. Infowars, etc.). </p>

<p>It&#39;s also very difficult to catch everything, as even with the algorithms and hall monitors, it&#39;s an imperfect system and they can&#39;t get it all.</p>

<p>Again, as far as the <strong>topics</strong> being targeted, I&#39;d take a look at the content creators and/or channels that have been given strikes or outright removed. The pattern you&#39;ll see often involves politics and, more often than not, those with a conservative or libertarian persuasion, so to speak. </p>

<p>Take that for what you will.</p>

<p>I would say steemit seems close to Twitter in form/function too. I like steemit because their crypto currency platform effectively makes it so that earning upvotes for good posts directly equals money. I don&#39;t know anything about Gab though, what&#39;s the advantages there? </p>

<p>So to sum it up. Look at what stocks to a huge hit during our last trade war and buy put options on them today.. Because for some reason the stock market is going to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. So they&#39;ll be on sale.***</p>

<p>unbubble.eu (i like this one), searx.me, ixquick.eu, scout.click are good alternatives.
its even better to use startpage, which admittedly still uses google, but at least anonymizes the user, preventing profiling.
i would use duckduckgo only with something like disconnect. i dont trust them, since i read some damning info about them.</p>

No search history retained, no cookies collected for cross referencing habits, it&#39;s SO much faster than firefox or chrome mobile versions because it doesn&#39;t have all the extra features. The only thing i use the other browser for is when i want to go to a website that requires some form of login or saved settings.

    <div class="md"><p>Wire and Signal are great alternatives to Google Hangouts. Both are encrypted end to end with emphasis on privacy and security.</p>

<p>Nextcloud is an amazing alternative to Google Drive and has badass features like Calendar and Contacts so you can even replace Google Calendar with it and have your contacts backed up without Google.</p>

<p>Should check out r/degoogle for some great alternatives.</p>
