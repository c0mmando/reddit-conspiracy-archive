       From Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Main article: 2012 Stratfor email leak
WikiLeaks announced the initial publication of more than five million of Stratfor's e-mail messages on February 26, 2012.[25] Anonymous claimed to have provided WikiLeaks with the data.[26] George Friedman stated that third parties may have forged or altered the e-mail messages, but that Stratfor would not validate either alterations or authenticity.[27] Stratfor condemned the release as "deplorable".[28] Journalist Amy Goodman, writing in The Guardian, referred to the first published leaks of Stratfor material as peering into an "intelligence-industrial complex".[29]

       i already from the start know what it is, because i've been around. doesn't mean it's inherently fishy. The private solution to public  problems has its place.

       what i mean is, Big Gub'mint has already been usurped by assholes (arguably until trump got elected).
      </p>
      <p>
       a lot of times there is a reasonable explanation as to why a private corporation can acheive the same results as a government project, with less cost and higher efficiency.

       You should be against it if you care about free speech in my opinion. If the law says that a christian baker has to bake a cake for a gay couple than Youtube should have to allow conservative voices to have a platform without discrimination as long as they don't break the law.

       True. I think he's saying that if the government can compel one business to do a thing it can force another. The problem is that the government shouldn't be able to compel either. A business should be able to refuse service to anyone. Net neutrality and all.

       I agree with you mostly, however there is the argument that social media platforms should be treated like public utilities.  Google has received $632,044,922 in government subsidies since its inception. Had it not received that funding it's unlikely it would be the monopoly it is today, so perhaps it should be government regulated. It's funny that you bring up net neutrality because that is government regulation used in order to stop private companies from doing whatever they want with the internet.

       I am saying that you could argue that Google should be treated as a public utility because it was essentially funded from it's inception by the government. Without government funding it would never have become a monopoly. I don't think this is a good thing because now they have virtually no sustainable competition. Either Google/Youtube should be regulated like how ISP's were regulated under title II (but in regards to censorship) or there should be monopoly busting.

       The alternative is mass censorship like what is happening right now. 
I'm usually for the less government intervention but in this case what is the bigger evil? Regulation or censorship?
Maybe I'm wrong but watch this video and tell me you're not creeped out by it.

       Why should there be any censorship? (Besides in cases where laws are being broken) Hundreds of right wing Youtube accounts were taken down last week "by accident".

       This is not even a conspiracy, this is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you agree with the content that is being removed or not is irrelevant it's the fact that they are censoring people based on their political content that's the issue. I could understand marking something with a warning or as adult content but removing it because it doesn't fit Youtube's political narrative without full transparency seems biased and wrong to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech is essential for a civil society, we solve problems by openly discussing and debating them. As soon as we start censoring people for wrong think it's a slippery slope, it's Orwellian.
In the words of Evelyn Beatrice Hall: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" Those words mean something to me.

       There are other bakeries yet that bakery that refused service lost it's lawsuit. I guess what I am looking for is consistency of the law here. Either it's okay for all private companies to refuse service to certain groups or it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be totally transparent, I'm a professional Youtuber who has dealt with censorship from Youtube (as many of us have) I could leave and go to another platform but I would be leaving thousands of subscribers behind and starting over on a platform that could never complete because Youtube has close to a monopoly. It wouldn't be so bad if Youtube was completely transparent about what it's doing and why but they haven't been. It's not very comforting to wonder if If they are going to block or ban me or demonetize me based on their loose rules they won't clearly define.

       Not really, I'm arguing for Youtube to be treated like any other company refusing service to a certain group. I don't know what you mean by "it's the viewers that do that"? It is Youtube who deletes your channel not the viewers. They use algorithms that pick up on code words they don't like to give your channels strikes. It's very Orwellian. They are definitely targeting conservatives and conspiracy theorists, there have been several articles about this in the mainstream media this week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people argue that net neutrality is a good thing because it uses government regulations to mediate large ISP's so they don't throttle or censor certain content providers right? Why would it be such a crazy concept to do the same with large content providers? Googles received millions of dollars in government subsidies so it's not crazy to argue that they should be regulated like a public utility and held to the same standards.

       You are employed by them to provide content which makes them money.

       From what I gather it mostly has to do with him attaching his name to a conspiracy and then making it seem "idiotic" ... for example pizzagate had a ton of steam, he then picked it up, made a couple stories about it and then dismissed it in a over the top manner. He follows this pattern repeatedly

       well he was on the brink of being sued into the dirt. He does have a business and I can kinda understand that hesitance, because the evidience with pizzagate is kinda there, but requires more solidity.

       He's a gatekeeper, plain and simple. All you have to do is look how he acts and look into what he doesn't get into (Khazars, Jesuits, Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Black Nobility, etc etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       He serves a good/useful purpose for newbies, but, the point is to break through the gatekeeper's gate(s). Many of us have here with AJ.

      <p>
       Like I said in another comment about him/Infowars, it's like 70% garbage, 30% decent commentary. Many legit people have move on from his company, and there is good reasons for it, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       He’s just a member of the Christian taliban who wants to oppose his way of living on everyone else. He’s an authoritarian and his ideas are dangerous. Just because I distrust the government, doesn’t mean I’m ok with bad ideas. I listened to Alex Jones a decent amount, simply don’t understand how any atheist or apathiest could support the guy

       I respect Alex Jones bec, as anyone who has actually stood against the establishment knows, it comes at a cost.  I believe he almost, or did, lose custody of his kids not long ago.  About the time he backtracked on some reports.  So if he mixes it up some so he will be allowed to at least throw out some bits of truth out there under guise of plausible deniability, be redpilled enough to understand it. Just like r/conspiracy seems to be allowed some latitude bec ‘tin foil hats’ ridicule discredits whatever is discussed, then there comes a point where it’s too threatening. Enter the trolls.

       Alex Jones is an Entertainer.  Nothing more. He does his show, runs a few commercials and collects some revenue. Simple formula.

       He's a gatekeeper. He brings some attention to legitimate issues, while ignoring others, just like the rest of the corporate media. His performance on camera is also over the top and ridiculous, and he does it on purpose.

       That's not to say he deserves to be censored though. The weird users you see who are glad to see him censored aren't real members of the community. They're astroturf trolls.

       Then no, you have not been paying attention at all.  I'll repeat a previous comment I made since the Alex Jones isn't a shill narrative is being pushed so hard right now.

       All you have to do is listen to him fake cry on 9/11 and also the video of him trying to take over a peaceful 2nd amendment rally with his bullhorn. Those are two of about 2000 examples you could point out.  His Y2k meltdown is another example to show you how long he has been spreading and manufacturing fear.

       Alex is by design the "conspiracy archetype" that the mainstream media must put "conspiracy theorist" into a box with. That way they can control any conspiracy narrative they want by having Alex interview/debate people and the mainstream public will think that Alex speaks for ever "conspiracy theorist". So when Alex goes on a crazy screaming rants it makes everyone that questions an official story seem crazy.
