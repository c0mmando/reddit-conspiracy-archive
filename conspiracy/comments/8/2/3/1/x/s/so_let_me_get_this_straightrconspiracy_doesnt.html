<p>From Wikipedia. </p>

<p>Main article: 2012 Stratfor email leak
WikiLeaks announced the initial publication of more than five million of Stratfor&#39;s e-mail messages on February 26, 2012.[25] Anonymous claimed to have provided WikiLeaks with the data.[26] George Friedman stated that third parties may have forged or altered the e-mail messages, but that Stratfor would not validate either alterations or authenticity.[27] Stratfor condemned the release as &quot;deplorable&quot;.[28] Journalist Amy Goodman, writing in The Guardian, referred to the first published leaks of Stratfor material as peering into an &quot;intelligence-industrial complex&quot;.[29]</p>

<p>a lot of times there is a reasonable explanation as to why a private corporation can acheive the same results as a government project, with less cost and higher efficiency.</p>

<p>i  realize blackwater is a tainted example, but this interview made me reconsider it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you mostly, however there is the argument that social media platforms should be treated like public utilities.  Google has received $632,044,922 in government subsidies since its inception. Had it not received that funding it&#39;s unlikely it would be the monopoly it is today, so perhaps it should be government regulated. It&#39;s funny that you bring up net neutrality because that is government regulation used in order to stop private companies from doing whatever they want with the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>I am saying that you could argue that Google should be treated as a public utility because it was essentially funded from it&#39;s inception by the government. Without government funding it would never have become a monopoly. I don&#39;t think this is a good thing because now they have virtually no sustainable competition. Either Google/Youtube should be regulated like how ISP&#39;s were regulated under title II (but in regards to censorship) or there should be monopoly busting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why should there be any censorship? (Besides in cases where laws are being broken) Hundreds of right wing Youtube accounts were taken down last week &quot;by accident&quot;.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/youtube-s-new-moderators-mistakenly-pull-right-wing-channels">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/youtube-s-new-moderators-mistakenly-pull-right-wing-channels</a>
This is not even a conspiracy, this is real.</p>

<p>Whether you agree with the content that is being removed or not is irrelevant it&#39;s the fact that they are censoring people based on their political content that&#39;s the issue. I could understand marking something with a warning or as adult content but removing it because it doesn&#39;t fit Youtube&#39;s political narrative without full transparency seems biased and wrong to me. </p>

<p>Free speech is essential for a civil society, we solve problems by openly discussing and debating them. As soon as we start censoring people for wrong think it&#39;s a slippery slope, it&#39;s Orwellian.
In the words of Evelyn Beatrice Hall: &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; Those words mean something to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are other bakeries yet that bakery that refused service lost it&#39;s lawsuit. I guess what I am looking for is consistency of the law here. Either it&#39;s okay for all private companies to refuse service to certain groups or it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>To be totally transparent, I&#39;m a professional Youtuber who has dealt with censorship from Youtube (as many of us have) I could leave and go to another platform but I would be leaving thousands of subscribers behind and starting over on a platform that could never complete because Youtube has close to a monopoly. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if Youtube was completely transparent about what it&#39;s doing and why but they haven&#39;t been. It&#39;s not very comforting to wonder if If they are going to block or ban me or demonetize me based on their loose rules they won&#39;t clearly define.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, I&#39;m arguing for Youtube to be treated like any other company refusing service to a certain group. I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;it&#39;s the viewers that do that&quot;? It is Youtube who deletes your channel not the viewers. They use algorithms that pick up on code words they don&#39;t like to give your channels strikes. It&#39;s very Orwellian. They are definitely targeting conservatives and conspiracy theorists, there have been several articles about this in the mainstream media this week. </p>

<p>Most people argue that net neutrality is a good thing because it uses government regulations to mediate large ISP&#39;s so they don&#39;t throttle or censor certain content providers right? Why would it be such a crazy concept to do the same with large content providers? Googles received millions of dollars in government subsidies so it&#39;s not crazy to argue that they should be regulated like a public utility and held to the same standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If YouTube is a service, then they are the employer. </p>

<p>You are employed by them to provide content which makes them money. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t provide a service. They provide a platform. </p>

<p>The user provides support of content. 
For free. </p>

<p>They choose to give views. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you were a reporter in Austin. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you got people enthused and riledup, but the editor was the peace times. They don&#39;t want you riled up and refuse to host. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you could afford to produce on your own platform, but refused to pay for it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you did what you do best, and tried to rule people up through other platforms, to get youtube to pay you?</p>

<p>Sounds like mobmentality and strong arming. </p>

<p>Sounds like a pay-op. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect Alex Jones bec, as anyone who has actually stood against the establishment knows, it comes at a cost.  I believe he almost, or did, lose custody of his kids not long ago.  About the time he backtracked on some reports.  So if he mixes it up some so he will be allowed to at least throw out some bits of truth out there under guise of plausible deniability, be redpilled enough to understand it. Just like r/conspiracy seems to be allowed some latitude bec â€˜tin foil hatsâ€™ ridicule discredits whatever is discussed, then there comes a point where itâ€™s too threatening. Enter the trolls.  </p>

<p>i&#39;ve been paying attention to this shit since it was a beef between bill cooper and alex jones, and i&#39;ve not seen anything to suggest that alex jones is controlled opposition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then no, you have not been paying attention at all.  I&#39;ll repeat a previous comment I made since the Alex Jones isn&#39;t a shill narrative is being pushed so hard right now.  </p>

<p>All you have to do is listen to him fake cry on 9/11 and also the video of him trying to take over a peaceful 2nd amendment rally with his bullhorn. Those are two of about 2000 examples you could point out.  His Y2k meltdown is another example to show you how long he has been spreading and manufacturing fear.  </p>

<p>Alex is by design the &quot;conspiracy archetype&quot; that the mainstream media must put &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; into a box with. That way they can control any conspiracy narrative they want by having Alex interview/debate people and the mainstream public will think that Alex speaks for ever &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. So when Alex goes on a crazy screaming rants it makes everyone that questions an official story seem crazy.</p>
