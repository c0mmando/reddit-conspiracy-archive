        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Firstly is the anomaly of the polygonal masonry. True 
polygonal masonry is both functional and beautiful. Such 
as the works in Peru where the giant blocks are laid in 
patterns reflecting the likeness of various animal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66x9VLwZaDQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66x9VLwZaDQ</a></p>

<p>That is one way to recognize true megalithic prowess 
from the cargo cult.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_masonry">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_masonry</a></p>

<p>The historians have tried to paint a picture of northeast Asia as rustic and wooden. When that couldn&#39;t be the furthest thing from the truth. We see huge megalithic ruins far north.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gornaya_Shoria_megaliths">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gornaya_Shoria_megaliths</a></p>

<p>We see very fine brick work often times 2 meters thick. </p>

<p>And the surviving temples often have cast iron floors that 
never rust.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/4s1YV">https://m.imgur.com/a/4s1YV</a></p>

<p>we have Hollow columns of St. Isaac&#39;s Cathedral and many others</p>

<p>like these columns in Pompeii</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/w5t8Kjk.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/w5t8Kjk.jpg</a></p>

<p>speaking of Pompeii we have en extant city depicted on maps from 1570</p>

<p>Globally we have this phenomenon of out of place skill and material. Sometimes we read about Siberian hard wood used to make elaborate carpentry work by anonymous builder such is the case with the Loretto staircase .</p>

<p>the oldest images we have of this palace show it located amongst a desolated landscape. Post cataclysm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keeping you warm is not what a chimney is for. It was invented to more efficiently draw smoke out of the building.

    <div class="md"><p>Yet true. Unless you have some archeological evidence the rest of the world isn&#39;t privy to. And again, chimneys were not invented to keep you warm. They were invented to draw out smoke. The reason it does this is not inherently obvious and I doubt they even knew why. As with many inventions of the past, its efficacy in this regard was probably discovered accidentally.</p>

But the sub linked seems to imply there is something else, and it seems to have some ulterior motive which is sketchy.  The point being that we don’t need aliens or hidden tech and such (not to make a judgement about that), the human mind and capacity is amazing enough when dedicated to a task, even with low tech tools (as in the statues.

<p>So, that&#39;s a yes?</p>
