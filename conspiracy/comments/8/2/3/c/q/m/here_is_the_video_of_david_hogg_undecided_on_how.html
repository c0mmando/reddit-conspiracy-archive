    <div class="md"><p>Ya know, sometimes my answer changes too. A lot.</p>

<p>It depends on what criteria is in my mind at the moment someone asks:</p>

<p>How many friends do you have?</p>

<p>Who is your best friend? (Do I claim to have one or piss off all my other friends?)</p>

<p>What IS a friend? (Do I include people throughout my life, the last year, the last FIVE years?)</p>

<p>Is a friend someone you have close relations with? How often? Daily? Weekly? What about monthly or yearly if it is someone you have a very close connection with but rarely see?</p>

<p>These questions, all subjective, make even less sense when you are asking a third party about their sister&#39;s friends. How the hell would he know what she thought? He is also making assumptions. He cannot know.</p>

<p>How many friends was she arguing with at the moment? And God knows teen girls do have their feuds. Do you count those currently on the &#39;outs&#39; or not?</p>

<p>One of my best friends died of cancer while we were in a dispute. It was not our first. It wouldn&#39;t have been our last had he not died.</p>

<p>We had been through these disagreements repeatedly and they sometimes got very heated. We were both passionate about our stances.</p>

<p>When he died we were still feuding. But we had been friends for 25 years.</p>

<p>So, does he count as a friend or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beats me.</p>

<p>One theory, which I like, is that the people running these events purposefully make them unrealistic to alert discerning people to the fakery.</p>

<p>Those who notice receive the benefit of knowing the news is fake from that moment on. It gives them an advantage in life, which they can choose to leverage (or not) by focusing on more important things than what’s in the news. Things like self improvement, or helping others.</p>

<p>I don’t buy the idea that there is anything inherently evil going on, or that there is a specific agenda in play. Life is a game, and these events offer useful clues about how to play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, speech is fluid sometimes and we embellish or subtract based on things like our audience or our own personal gain...However some things are finite and don&#39;t change.  </p>

<p>Your friend of 25 years did die. You can&#39;t dispute that part of your story. </p>

<p>Likewise, the deaths at Parkland were finite and Hogg could not be fluid with numbers because of the limit of # of people who were killed that day.  If 4 out of 17 killed were his sisters best friend - that is much more unlikely than 2/17.  It is also verifiable given such a small set.   </p>

<p>Sorry, this is not a great explanation. I&#39;ll review tomorrow and try again. </p>

<p>For me there is something so unsettling about his character.</p>
