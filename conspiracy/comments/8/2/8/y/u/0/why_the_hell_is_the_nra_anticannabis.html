    <div class="md"><p>I know currently that something like 3% of Americans own 50% of the guns.  I imagine several decades ago, it was much broader of a spread.  I also know that percentage of people who hunt has dropped by like half in the last 40 years.</p>

<p>So a few decades ago, your typical gun might be owned by someone who had a handful of weapons and liked to go hunting and fishing.  Now your typical gun is likely to be owned by someone stockpiling for the Ragnarok and who&#39;s never seen a duck blind or tree stand in their life.</p>

<p>As the NRA moves from targeting the former to the latter, it&#39;s gotten <em>weird</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hard when the folks pushing for &quot;common sense gun laws&quot; are saying the same thing.  Seriously, all the NRA has to do is quote directly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOWTTYG/">There is a whole sub dedicated to compiling this nonsense.</a></p>

<p>Yes, the NRA uses fearmongering emotional propaganda to goad people to go vote.  But as someone who doesn&#39;t listen to the propaganda and throws away all NRA mailings without opening, I can promise you they don&#39;t have to reach very far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I own a gun for the same reason I own a fire extinguisher. I am prepared. If you think I&#39;m dumb for being prepared I&#39;m not sure if logic or reason will convince you otherwise. My dad caught a prowler outside our house when I was very young because he was prepared. I survived an armed break in at my apartment because I was prepared. My parents live in a community where the median income is almost 200k and there has been 1 murder in 100 years, my dad still needed a gun to protect his house once. I was in an area where the median income was 85k, still needed a gun. Anyone who doesn&#39;t take responsibility for the protection of themselves, their loved ones, and their home is dumb. I feel sorry for your potential wife/children/pets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s an unfortunate failing of the NRA myself, but I think you&#39;re correct that there&#39;s a pandering to a certain type of NRA member who&#39;s socially conservative.</p>

<p>I also think the NRA tries pretty hard to gain the support of rank and file cops.  They&#39;re all gun owners and the NRA needs to have buy-in from law enforcement to some degree.  If 100% of the cops (not just liberal big city police chiefs) were pro gun control, it would be ever more difficult to preserve gun rights.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also argue there&#39;s a certain point at which you&#39;ve made your political alliances and you have to support them, even if it means supporting some unpleasant political issues.  I&#39;m sure the NRA has used its lobbying ability during critical moments to support anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage and other Republican policies in exchange for crucial support for blocking gun control initiatives.</p>

<p>Political advocacy doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum -- you can&#39;t achieve legislative success and ideological purity at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NRA is pretty stupid not even gonna lie. A lot of people support them because there aren&#39;t many other pro gun lobbies with the same power as them. A lot of pro gun people will be quick to point out that the NRA has been in favor of several detrimental gun control measures over the years. Detrimental as in they do nothing except give money to the government. You have to pay $1000 if you want to buy a gun with a barrel less than 16 inches long, courtesy of the NRA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought short-barrel rifle restrictions were part of the National Firearms Act, passed in the 1930s, which effectively criminalized owning fully automatic guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns and suppressors.  I realize they&#39;re not actually completely illegal, you can do the paper and buy the tax stamp if your state allow allows it.</p>

<p>Whatever the NRA&#39;s involvement was in this in the 1930s, I&#39;m not sure that blaming the NRA completely is fair.  I think there was a lot of hype surrounding the John Dillinger/Bonnie &amp; Clyde type outlaws who made use of many of these weapons.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also wager there was some genuine fear by TPTB that these folk hero bandits were kind of the tip of the iceberg and would encourage some kind of larger movement.  Today&#39;s bank robber with a Thompson submachine gun could be tomorrow&#39;s left-wing insurgent leading the people against establishment capitalism.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also argue this same fear energized the FBI against Posse Comitatus in the late 1970s.  I think the Feds have a special paranoia when it comes to politically motivated rural armed resistance.</p>

<p>But it makes sense that the NRA would chase what it thinks the conservative base likes. If the NRA believes the conservative base dislikes MJ legalization, then against it the NRA is. Same on all the other points brought up on this post. Chasing standing among members and trying to pull in higher membership. </p>

<p>Are you sure the NRA has an anti cannabis position, or just one person in the NRA has a personal anti cannabis position?</p>

<p>It looks like someone had a &quot;public service announcement&quot; style advertisement on NRA&#39;s online TV. </p>

<p>You would think that MJ production is similar to owning a gun--- it&#39;s self-sufficiency. Very odd. </p>

<p>The NRA is just another institution, though. Who knows how the strings connect behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Yes, the NRA uses fearmongering emotional propaganda to goad people to go vote.  But as someone who doesn&#39;t listen to the propaganda and throws away all NRA mailings without opening, I can promise you they don&#39;t have to reach very far.</p>
