<p>Edit 2: I am overwhelmed with the positivity in this thread. Thank you all. And, thanks for the gold, whoever gave it to me. My only hope is that people can see this and upvote and share it. This type of cyber bullying is true &quot;hate speech.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 3: you should see some of the messages I am getting...</p>

<p>Hello everybody,</p>

<p>If you do not know me (<a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a>), I have been an avid poster on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and related subs for years. I have had some pretty big posts over the years, and I archived them all to the best of my ability (with the help of a friend). However, you will no longer be able to find most of them, and I think that is okay. Yesterday I deleted my account and post history, and I am saying goodbye to Reddit. </p>

<p>About a year or so ago, I was linked to <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> for the first time. I had no idea that it would turn into a year of constant drama and harassment.</p>

<p>Because I continually was linked to them, I decided to start my own sub <a href="/r/conspiracyundone">/r/conspiracyundone</a>. It took off and is still growing. Unfortunately, I demodded myself yesterday.</p>

<p>In 2017, the harassment became so bad that I was developing severe anxiety logging on, but I did not want to give up. I made posts about it the harassment, and they were often infiltrated within minutes by TMOR users - downvoted to 0 so that nobody could hear my voice. Still, users encouraged me to stay and not give up. I took their words to heart, and I appreciated the encouragement. </p>

<p>People told me to ignore them, and I did. However, it was getting to a point where they were posting about me almost daily. Why? I&#39;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>

<p>I sent reports to admins several times. Then a miracle happened. In January of this year, one of the mods made a post that essentially they should/would not post about me anymore. I could breathe again. I am not sure if this was a result of admin intervention or something else, but it does not matter. I respected their decision and also said I would leave them alone in return (and I did).</p>

<p>Well, the honeymoon did not last forever, as many users correctly predicted. They started posting about me again, but this what I really need you all to understand,</p>

<p>I do not care if they call me stupid, ugly, mentally ill, whatever. This is the problem: they are labeling me as a Nazi and twisting my words on Reddit. For example, the other day, I made a comment on my sub that sometimes nationalism can be good and sometimes it can be bad. I said it can promote connection, but it can also be used for manipulation (paraphrased). There was then a thread saying I supported Nazism with nearly 100 upvotes. What the actual? Not only cannot I not comment there and defend myself, but I did message one of the mods and said that was a completely unfair post. They just continued to say that because I supported nationalism on any level that I was a Nazi. I am not kidding. </p>

<p>That is what angers me - it is the twisting of my words, and not only that, it is accusing me of something I am not. Over the years, the large themes of my posts have been:</p>

<p>1) Being kind to others/developing empathy
2) Caution about technology viewed as progress/Transhumanism
3) Christianity/Satanism
4) Analysis of pop culture: music, movies, etc.
5) Education (generally its flaws)
6) My worries for the future
7) Spiritual topics (spiritual battles, death, etc.).</p>

<p>Rarely do I post anything political, and I would say in the conspiracy world, most of my posts are pretty harmless. Over the years hundreds upon hundreds have reached out to me and thanked me, and I do not mean that arrogantly. That is what kept me going. I loved connecting with people, and I met so many awesome people on here, some I even call friends. In that way, Reddit changed my life for the better. I could now discuss topics I cared about with an audience who cared, too. When the world seemed dark and bleak, and almost too much to handle, I could login and there was always somebody to uplift me. I am thankful for that.</p>

<p>But, the negativity began to overshadow that positivity. At the same time, I was getting some terrible threats, and people said to ignore them, but this is where I am going to disagree. When people started threatening my life, I did not care if it was real or not - it made me sick to my stomach. (Yes, I reported all of this to admins over time - no, not all of these threats have been from <a href="/r/tmor">/r/tmor</a> users). </p>

<p>This weekend, I got another threat, and it just was kind of the end of the rope (yes, I reported it). Yes, I think the user was a <a href="/r/tmor">/r/tmor</a> of user. I am going to be vague about this threat, but it was disturbing. I told the mods on my sub that I was done. I had to say goodbye. </p>

<p>Real or not, I just realized this was not worth it anymore. I cannot keep coming online trying to guess what is real, and what is not. I cannot keep having anxiety about posting on Reddit. As my sub was growing, I knew that it was only going to get worse.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is that this is allowed. Why do these people hate me so much? I think half of them are paid shills, and I am not sure about the other half. Again, though, they are desperate to try to link me to Nazism, and as a teacher that is dangerous. In no way  shape or form have I ever in anyway indicated the support of Nazism. They claimed my sub encouraged Nazism, but you all can take a look at <a href="/u/conspiracyundone">/u/conspiracyundone</a> and tell me if you think that is true. I just wanted a sub where we could all post our free thoughts without being attacked. By the way, there are/were rules there, and we removed posts that went against Reddit site-wide rules, and the mods and I were very careful about what posts were allowed on our sub. </p>

<p>But, in the end, they got what they wanted. They won. I am gone. That is the conspiracy. They would not do these types of tactics if they did not work. They wanted to push me to a breaking point, and they have several times. </p>

<p>I want to address some counter-arguments before this gets attacked:</p>

<p>1) You are weak - suck it up: I would not deal with this type of bullying in real life, why should I allow it online? In real life, I have experienced severe abuse, and I told myself that I would never allow somebody to treat me like that again. Online harassment and bullying are real, and they can push people to their breaking points. I did try to ignore it as much as I could. Ignoring was not helping (or it only helped so much). </p>

<p>2) You are a Nazi: No, I am not. This world is starting to get so strange where that word is so carelessly and dangerously thrown around. It is a control mechanism, and it is a way to censor people. What is funny is that hundreds of pages of post history showed who I was truly was - somebody who really cares for others and is tired of the dark and evil in the world. In no way shape or form am I a Nazi. This one bothers me the most because, as I said, it is dangerous, and it is unfair. It is a &quot;dirty&quot; tactic because it is libel. It is a way to damage my reputation. </p>

<p>3) Get over it/nobody cares: Some people care, I think, and if you do not, I suppose you can downvote and move on.</p>

<p>4) Well, that is just part of being online: Is it, though? Should it be? Why is this sub allowed? I know I am no the only person they have pushed to a breaking point. If they were actually sitting their debunking conspiracy theories, then fine. That is NOT what they are doing. Feel free to browse <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> and look at the comments. What is the real purpose of that subreddit? </p>

<p>I honestly NEVER had problems on Reddit until I was linked there. Sure, there was the argument with the occasional shill, but nothing to this capacity. </p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I am really saddened today. I did my best to bring some light through my writing. Of course, I will always write in some way, shape or form, but I will miss the community I had here. I know I can continue to post on alt accounts, but I spent a lot of time building up <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a>, and I am not really sure I even feel motivated to do that anymore. I feel depleted. </p>

<p>Please watch out for the comments in this thread. My posts are usually immediately downvoted to zero, and I am have no doubt that <a href="/r/tmor">/r/tmor</a> users will come to say that I am some evil person because I question the world around me.</p>

<p>I feel I was bullied into silence. Maybe they won in the end. At least for me, I always have hope in spiritual justice.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone over the years who has reached out to me. I am really thankful for these experiences. </p>

<p>If you read all of this, thank you.</p>

<p>&lt;3 polkadotgirl</p>

<p>PS: No, I never said people did not die at Sandy Hook (one they have been throwing around lately). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if it makes you feel any better all that is justification for the information that you were putting out there on Reddit for us. Reddit is just the same as Facebook and Twitter people are going to act like big tough people online that they would never do in person. So do they really mean it probably not. You remember the old saying haters going to hate? It&#39;s a badge of honor wear it and be proud don&#39;t let it get you down. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why anyone would ever pay them any mind at all. I wonder if they&#39;ve ever tried trolling me. I do recall being stalked to other subs by a troll one time a long time ago, but I usually only make comments and maybe that allows me to avoid their notice? I never go there though and I can&#39;t even imagine a way of checking to find out. I also have literally 1000+ troll accounts blocked by now, so there&#39;s a good chance that I wouldn&#39;t even be able to see it anyway even if I could find it. </p>

<p>But I understand, this stuff is not worth it if it is having a detrimental effect on your personal life. I know that you realize as well as I do that these shills live sad and pathetic lives, and that their opinions are worthless. In fact, the fact that they targeted you shows that you were doing something right. But still, dealing with their constant annoying ways can certainly get tiresome, so I totally understand.</p>

<p>You&#39;re clearly a wonderful person, and I appreciate all that you&#39;ve done for the conspiracy community. You have had the patience of an angel, and I think you are a great role model when it comes to dealing with these disgusting people. I wish you all the best in the real world, and I hope we meet again someday!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am so sorry to hear about your experiences. I have enjoyed your posts very much, especially your &quot;Conspiracy of Loneliness&quot; post. It is important to me that you know that you DID bring light into this sub, and I am sure your posts had a positive impact on many people, including myself. You demonstrated that there are others out here who share spiritual values like compassion, empathy, and Universal Love. </p>

<p>I am sure you know this, but those that attacked you lack the compassion, empathy, and love of humanity that you have demonstrated in your post. Therefore, the joke is on them. While you will move on and maintain your love of life, they will remain petty and miserable. Therefore, you will have the last laugh on them. </p>

<p>Good luck and God bless. I speak on behalf of this sub when I wish you the best in life. We will miss you, and this sub will be less without you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They absolutely have it out for you over the other mods.  It is seldom that I am tagged or replied to by a shill/TMOR.  Even before you made r/conspiracyundone, you were highly targeted and stalked.  I suspect it is more about your influence as a user more than anything.  r/conspiracy has far more users than r/conspiracyundone has.  Your posts reach at least 100 up votes pretty much every time; barring some of your more controversial posts.  It also depends on when you post.  I believe your posts were vote manipulated so that they would not reach too high.</p>

<p>I expect to face more flak now but not anything in comparison to what you did.</p>

<p>You hung in there for a very long time.  There have been other times you thought about doing this only to have the community lift up your spirit with encouragement.</p>

If you tell the truth, you&#39;re going to be insulted, harassed, intimidated, stalked, and threatened:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our NBC reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of YouTube and Blogger, the targeting of Anonymous with the very same DDoS attacks they accuse “hacktivists” of using, the use of “honey traps” (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses. But, here, I want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself.</p>

<p>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.</p>

<p>Under the title “Online Covert Action”, the document details a variety of means to engage in “influence and info ops” as well as “disruption and computer net attack,” while dissecting how human beings can be manipulated using “leaders,” “trust,” “obedience” and “compliance”</p>

<p>I like your statement, that is my motto as well.  </p>

<p>The reason that the TMOR/Media Matters/NGO trolls went after PDG is because she had empathy for humanity.  I, on the other hand, am very much looking forward to the Day of the Rope/Bullet for people like TMOR/Media Matters Shills...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HORkT4a2MhQ">Let the Bodies Hit the Floor</a>. I just store up all that hostility and anger in a nice neat little package with the idea of their names, bodies and faces on the gift tag.</p>

<p>The absolute best part about it?  </p>

<p>They are too stupid to realize that the totalitarian government they are ushering in, with all this (albeit paid) effort, is going to target them second (right after the dissidents like myself) if they &#39;win the war&#39;.  Totalitarian governments are not known for tolerating a bunch of suddenly unemployed &#39;crafty people&#39; who know how to harass and cajole change within a populace (these types of people are just as much of a threat to the new government&#39;s tenuous position as dissenters ever were, perhaps more so, because they have inside information; they NEVER leave them alive).  Course, if they &#39;lose the war&#39; they will be targeted by the government that they were trying to overthrow and become first in line to bite a bullet in the name of &#39;ideology&#39; for the crimes of high treason, subversion of the state, and traitor tendencies (and in TMOR&#39;s case Communist/Marxist subversion).  </p>

<p>No government wants people like this around, no matter how &#39;exciting&#39; it is to play the &#39;rough and tumble as &#39;revolutionary&#39; in the moment, in the long run they are a HUGE liability to ANY state who has even an ice cube&#39;s chance in hell at longevity.  TMOR Trolls have not correctly evaluated their own position in terms of the liability and their own potential usefulness.  Totalitarians are not known for valuing pawns over their own vaunted positions of power and wealth or for their tolerance of people without any moral boundaries.</p>

<p>As bonus humor, they actually think they have a &#39;lasting value&#39; and are not just a useful cog in the machine (there is no way out of that system, when you willingly enter into it)...that shit is on your permanent record, that you are traitor to your government and traitor to your people, no fledgling government wants those &#39;type&#39; of people around.  </p>

<p>Odds are very high that no one will even know what happened to them when all this shakes out...who knows, maybe years from now forensic anthropologist will dig up their bones from a mass grave out in the middle of nowhere...or, maybe not.  I don&#39;t really care.  So many of the TMOR types are &#39;not clever at all&#39; and just barely above retardation levels (I know based on my own interactions with them)...so they are not a loss for a totalitarian government from that perspective either (as a matter of fact the stupidest ones might not even be worth a bullet; so at least 1/2 of TMOR, is literally, too stupid to bother murdering).</p>

<p>No matter what happens to someone like me, they are D E A D for supporting the very cause that they think they are fighting for...LMFAO...dead, dead, dead...they were incapable of calculating that this was always a lose-lose proposition for people like themselves.  It is so fucking R I C H, that I have no real words for it.  I just cruise along doing my own happy little thing and enjoy the shit out of the whole fiasco.  It is amazing to know that they will be biting bullets, as the second in line, for all their &#39;service&#39; to their masters, their usefulness will cease when their job of overthrowing the existing government in favor of their idealized regime is complete.</p>

<p>Hmmm, priceless and delicious.  May the TMOR Trolls enjoy many more days of a wasted life on something that is going to steal their lives from them in the end.  The perfect ending to people who could not be more deserving of it.</p>

<p>1 Why not use their words against them. The vast majority will condemn anyone who behaves like them. Their reputation would be over if anyone knew what they were doing.
1 Why not block such users, so you don&#39;t have to see their BS?
1 Why not ban such users from your sub?
1 Why read <em>anything</em> on their sub? I spent about 10 minutes once reading the tmor sub, and I could see there was no reason to ever go back--zero value.</p>

<p>a) They use vote manipulation to make it appear that their arguments are &quot;right&quot; and anything counter to them are &quot;wrong&quot;.  </p>

<p>b) They also use numerous sockpuppet accounts so reputation is not incredibly important.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>See b) above.  You still have to see it in order to block it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why read anything on their sub? I spent about 10 minutes once reading the tmor sub, and I could see there was no reason to ever go back--zero value.</p>

<p>They use username mentions which send a PM to the user.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why delete your account? That discourages others.</p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>Yes. Top Minds of Reddit brigade attempts to destroy subs by infiltrating, cyberstalking, discrediting and bullying the mods of those subs.  They hit <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> hard.  We hid the voting arrows for posts and comments and report as spam button in CS. The admins required us to restore the report as spam button. Thereafter, we reported over a dozen more report as spam brigading to the admins. Just a half a year ago, we restored the voting arrows.</p>

<p>I kept records of their downvote brigading, reporting as spam brigading and harassment to give to admins. I made numerous reports to admins updating the records. Little enforcement of Reddit&#39;s rules. History is below.</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago, TMOR brigade downvoted my original account&#39;s comment karma. The admins temporarily banned several brigadiers but refused to restore <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a>&#39;s comment karma. The default setting in preferences is to hide all comments by all Redditors with minus 4 and below. Thereby, Reddit circumvents negative comment karma from ever being restored. Belatedly, <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a> created an alt account, me, so his future comments will be visible.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/80760k/censorship_our_new_mod_is_my_new_alt_account/?st=jeu6mbxd&amp;amp;sh=dde19850">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/80760k/censorship_our_new_mod_is_my_new_alt_account/?st=jeu6mbxd&amp;amp;sh=dde19850</a></p>

<p>I recommend <a href="/u/vespertineloquence">/u/vespertineloquence</a> to do the same. Ask your other mods to send you an invitation to mod. Each time TMOR downvotes your comment  karma for minus 4, create a new alt and invite the new alt to mod. Don&#39;t let TMOR win.</p>

Socrates was murdered but from him we got Plato, Xenophon, Critias, Aristotle, and the full development of Classical Greek philosophy and then Western Philosophy.

    <div class="md"><p>These people have literally sold their souls to the devil, not even joking.  There&#39;s a reason they sound like the people on pol.  My theory is that it&#39;s all the same people, a mix of nsa/cia.  Think about it, the pipeline.  Pol Nazis are always dog whistling the donald, and they have the same abusive rhetoric.  The normal Maga ppl, who I may not agree with completely but can at least have a conversation about the underlying causes that pushed them to trump, are attacked by the top minds and politics/dnc ppl, and by the Nazis whenever they are critical of the racist s*** or the intervention Trump has been pursuing in the Middle East.   The Nazis eventually dog whistle them over to 4chan pol, which turns them into animals.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the Richard Spencer/twitter celebrities of the alt right are always pushing the idea that there is overlap in the alt right and left. They try to present it to normies superficially as if the alt right and left  must share the same boogeyman philosophy  of the function  and powers of government - that is absolute bullshit.  </p>

<p>Never is that conjecture phrased in a way in which there is some  nuanced truth - that there are the shared material problems of the working class but the Direction and tactics to correct those problems are completely different in each ideology.  No the accusation is always phrased in such a way that it benefits the DNC.</p>

<p>Not unlike the strategy of the Middle East over the last couple decades.  Set the area on fire, culminating with the Syrian War and it&#39;s Refugee crisis.  They made sure to have their proxy terrorist groups set up in such a way and invade in such a way that the only route was on boats from Damascus to Europe. Have a surplus labor pool Europe!  Maybe you can do what we do and just enslave them in jail!  Except for this case think of it in terms of users and communities migrating to pol or in the case of the left two other boards that they try to control with this sick bullying.  Keep feeding them this unnatural hatred and normalize dehumanizing interactions.  Pretty soon one of them will jump off the deep end most of them come in wobbly on the edge anyway.</p>

<p>Finally just like the United States is trying to push Israel to take over the port of Damascus in order to control the natural gas pipeline, all these communities and boards that they push people out of get their shills installed in the mod team, today then effectively control the content and flow of information on the board.</p>

<p>I can only hope that enough normies figure out this tactic and that Reddit is not a cross-section of the actual opinions and ideas of people anymore.</p>

The paid ones do it because job availability is scarce and it&#39;s way easier to do this then work a 9-5 at some store. It&#39;s just how it is in this economy. It&#39;s only going to get worse now that it&#39;s allowed to use propaganda and the U.S. government funds propaganda networks.

<blockquote>
<p>I do not care if they call me stupid, ugly, mentally ill, whatever. This is the problem: they are labeling me as a Nazi and twisting my words on Reddit. For example, the other day, I made a comment on my sub that sometimes nationalism can be good and sometimes it can be bad. I said it can promote connection, but it can also be used for manipulation (paraphrased). There was then a thread saying I supported Nazism with nearly 100 upvotes. What the actual? Not only cannot I not comment there and defend myself, but I did message one of the mods and said that was a completely unfair post. They just continued to say that because I supported nationalism on any level that I was a Nazi. I am not kidding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who care how random internet people think of you or speak of you..? It&#39;s easy to just block anyone who does so. Posting from your alt account that you&#39;re polkadotgirl just painted another target on this new account for TMOR. Regardless of what the haters say, the message that is said is what is important. The message is not for everyone to agree with, it is for those that are ready to hear it.</p>

<p>To be honest, your posts were one of the only things of actually value I found on this website, everything else is echo chambers and trash. <strong>Please don&#39;t let your flame be snuffed.</strong></p>

<p>The latter will always be the stronger and more fulfilling route. We&#39;ve made a lot of progress over the years with becoming independent, but there are still many people out there too scared or worried to step outside of the lies they&#39;ve fabricated themselves. It takes speeches of great magnitude (such as long posts you&#39;ve made in the past) to wake these people up. One person down for us is actually hundreds or thousands or maybe even more, down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear all that bad stuff happened to you polkadotgirl. It takes a lot of effort to ignore groups like TMOR, but it&#39;s the only way. They&#39;re just liars who want to make you mad. And I know you know that, but the emotional navigation of that can be complicated, I totally understand that. Just ignore those silly fools, they&#39;re not worth wasting one moment considering, even if they say the most triggering of lies. If they find a button that works, they will press it repeatedly until the target goes on tilt. That&#39;s their whole game. Only way to win is to have no buttons to press, because who truly cares about the words of those who are known liars?  :) Not me! No one sees you as a Nazi, because no one trusts those losers, even if they fake upvote each other to make it look like majority opinion. Don&#39;t let it stick in your craw, because that&#39;s their method of disabling you. I know you know this as well, I&#39;m just reminding you that we know it and see what is going on, and we&#39;re on your side. </p>

<p>Anyway, I wish you the best, and I&#39;ll be glad to see you around at saidit!</p>

<p>Thanks, I really have tears in my eyes as I read through this thread</p>

<p>If we were all in person, we&#39;d give you a massive super group hug that would cause Nuclear Fusion to start, and we would share the tech with the world freeing everyone from the Power companies. </p>

<p>Anyhow, on another note, I wanted to share something with you. I had an OBE from a work accident (took 15 mins to resuscitate me) and got a sneak peak of what happens after we leave here. I&#39;m not going to get into the 1000 page version of it, but I did want to mention 1 detail.</p>

<p>I saw that every single tiny act you do, even feeding some ducks, a smile to a child, a post on a forum that only gets read by 1 person, all of these things effect the whole. Its literally an infinite tapestry where pulling on 1 fiber undoes the whole thing, or throwing a tiny pebble in the ocean still causes a ripple.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give up. More and more are waking up to the bullshit everyday. Change just takes a long time, sometimes decades or more, but still you are also a part of the whole</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &quot;asked to step down&quot; because it&#39;s the easiest way to explain the situation. </p>

<p>I taught AP/regular government and economics to seniors who had the option of taking a summer course prior to 12th grade to get their gov/econ credits out of the way. A lot of kids prefer this option as they have a shorter day their senior year and can leave school an hour early. </p>

<p>This meant that I had to have solid recruitment to get kids to take my class over the quickie summer course. I had a ton of kids sign up for my class and had good numbers every year- I was an artsy, young, fun conspiracy teacher so it wasn&#39;t too hard to get kids to sign up. However, at the end of the school year (after the town hall that I got seriously chewed out for), I was pulled into the office and told that not enough kids signed up for gov/econ the following year and was offered to teach a low level freshman class. I knew it was political and it was done to strongly encourage to leave. There were a ton of other sabotage things happening as well; I felt like I was going crazy: my teaching materials were constantly getting messed with  and my evaluations took a sharp dive. The bureaucracy was coming down on me quite intensely and I knew I was no longer welcome so I chose to quit instead of grovel for the shitty teaching job they offered. </p>

<p>I found out through friends who still worked their that there was no student recruitment problem and plenty of kids signed up for the course. A former US Marine was teaching gov/econ. Maybe they follow orders better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People just say &quot;tmor&quot; instead of &quot;Top Minds of Reddit&quot; to save time, people aren&#39;t talking about r/tmor when they say &quot;tmor&quot;. I&#39;ve also seen these kinds of users called &quot;minders&quot; or &quot;top minds&quot; themselves, but it&#39;s all the same shit. That sub exists to call out and harass people they hate due to questioning the official narrative. It&#39;s a hate-sub for &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, and the sidebar there makes their intent rather clear, as long as you can understand irony. Have a look around the sub if you&#39;re having a hard time grasping it, looking at their popular topics should clear things up completely if you&#39;re still unsure about what is going on there. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re hiding what they&#39;re doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>| Rarely do I post anything political, and I would say in the conspiracy world, most of my posts are pretty harmless</p>

<p>No, ALL of your posts are harmless. They are words and thoughts. Thats the issue here. People are afraid of your thoughts lol. What a novel concept. Just keep that in mind as you move forward. The weak minds fear the strong ones. You seem to be right in the middle, looking at both sides saying &quot;What the fuck is wrong with everyone&quot;. Just like we all are. You&#39;re not alone. And just because your voice WAS silenced, who cares, know there are more rational, well minded people who want free and open discussions rather than labeling someone they disagree with as a Nazi.</p>

<p>And furthermore, how pathetic of a thing to compare someone to. Nazi&#39;s put people in death camps and silenced disodence. Much like this site choses to do.... how ironic. </p>

I am so sorry to hear that you&#39;ve been threatened and harassed. No one deserves that. I&#39;ve perused some of your posts and really appreciate your thoughts.

Keep your head up baby girl, take a moment, breathe, meditate go to your source and know that only light can shine through darkness. &lt;3 and light. </p>

<p>Start at 32:50 and listen to Wolfgang Halbig.  He says it.  No one died.  All the parents that &quot;lost&quot; children received $281,000 from that day and they complained that they needed more.  Then they all left Newtown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you&#39;re not gone for good, couple years ago I made a mistake of deleting my old reddit account when I found out I&#39;m a targeted individual and was worried about something. I can&#39;t stand reddit anymore though cuz of crazy influx of fake accounts and I&#39;ve left it just at that, I just don&#39;t value this place too much so I don&#39;t put too much time in it anymore. Like you said you&#39;ll probably keep writing here and there, I just hope when you feel it&#39;s a good post and the right time that you&#39;ll post it so the rest of us can enjoy your writings. Reddit can be a good place to get stuff off your chest while feeling good that you might be enlightening people at the same time, it&#39;s not a really bad activity if you don&#39;t overdue it, overall using social media less and being more involved irl is a healthy choice as a collective imo. </p>

A Reddit mob came after 16-year-old Harshita Arora, claiming she didn’t make her Crypto Price Tracker app. Turns out she did—after a prestigious internship and an MIT program.&quot;</a></p>

<p>No one is spared these pathetic weasels.</p>

<p>The worst pm I&#39;ve gotten was to delete my account and cease all activity. You and Axolotl have both mentioned getting death threats. </p>

<p>To me this seems like a serious enough accusation that if you both went to the media and someone picked it up, it would be more effective than going to the admins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do. I worked in the counseling field and we all end up dealing with the mentally ill now and then. I&#39;ve been stalked in my real life, as well. One thing I would tell you is always take the threats seriously. Report them to the appropriate authorities. There are some very obsessive people out there, and they can be unpredictable. I still don&#39;t post the city where I live anywhere online. While they&#39;re probably just harmless trolls, there&#39;s something unbalanced with guys who do nothing but search out and put down others. And to set up a whole sub to do that? Think about what kind of degraded person would even be attracted to that kind of negative behavior. </p>

<p>But, at some point, you have to get back in the fight, because <em>we are the only ones that can win this thing</em>. And because we&#39;re winning so much that they are pulling out their hair trying to keep the lid on the truth.</p>

<p>Just imagine these online stalkers rounded up and thrown in jail. Because that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to happen to every single one of them, and I hope every single western intelligence agency links to this comment from TMOR.

I once signed up for a chick forum that was hacked and my info, along with info of 7000 more people was leaked online( all over one user getting into an argument with another).

 People are shit. And they can get pissed off over nothing. It doesn&#39;t have to be conspiracy related. And yes, they can go to great lengths to fuck with you. This is the way most people are. Always assume a person is a piece of shit that will do anything to destroy you and let them prove otherwise (not the other way around). Internet just gives people more confidence. They don&#39;t have to pretend to like you and they know there won&#39;t suffer any consequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus you shills are so bad at this.  See what I mean about the pattern?  I think I actually read a study done back in 2013 By the Chinese about the effectiveness of this kind of social media influence campaigning.  I want to say they were the ones who also came up with an algorithm that could detect with 90% accuracy shill postings - bc even if it is an empty husk of a person behind the key board, the pattern of harassment and lack of worthwhile ideas are very easy to spot.</p>

<p>I wonder why reddit doesn&#39;t want to take advantage of something like that?  Because of course they would lose the money that&#39;s coming from these shill contracts(and boy, i bet it&#39;s some crazy money).

    <div class="md"><p>Why in a fuck did you feel compelled to reply to my comment with this nonsense. First of all, I&#39;m not a child. I didn&#39;t bully this chick. 
Although I did read some of her posts and they were not a conspiracy thread material. They were college level opinion essays; based on very limited knowledge, years of brainwashing and sheltered lifestyle. To me it seemed like something a woman, who wants validation from a certain type of men would write. And this post is a great indication of that. As soon as she stopped getting the attention she wanted, she got pissed off and decided to make a dramatic exit. Infantile, attention seeking behavior. So you were &quot;bullied&quot; on the internet (who would&#39;ve thought?!) and it bothers you, don&#39;t post without creating more drama and trying to attract more attention. You people are exhausting. If you want to chit chat about nonsense like &quot;girl shaming and internet bullying conspiracies&quot; create your own subreddit. I come here for actual conspiracies.</p>

<p>all of these social media platforms are racking up a considerable history of clearly either targeting users with a certain POV or allowing users with a certain POV to be harassed.  These platforms are all private companies but <strong>they have to apply ToS sanctions equally.</strong>  There&#39;s a critical mass gathering for a class-action suit.  Especially among producers of income producing original content who made good faith assumptions YT et.al. would continue interpreting the ToS as the ToS had been interpreted for the past x number of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been feeling exactly the same way. Wow. It’s actually a form of gang stalking and targeted harassment. I understand that Reddit has advertisers that might want to shut down debate and discussion.  However there was a time that the internet was about debate and sharing knowledge. I saw a show yesterday about Mary Dyer and how she was hanged by the puritans for her beliefs (she was a Quaker) is that where we are heading? Segregating groups of people becaus you disagree, harrassing groups of people because you hate them, is always wrong. Whether it is blacks or whites. Will we have to sit at the back of the Reddit bus now because Reddit admins must protect their advertisers interests? Reddit what happened to you? What happened to the Aaron Swartz legacy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me that everyone engaging in the back and forth between both subs should take a step back and think about what is actually happening.</p>

<p>It’s like watching 15 year olds from two different schools meeting at 4pm for a fight.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is a place of fun and enjoyment for me. Sure I don’t give credit to 99.9% of the theories, but it is fun to read. Instead of getting involved in a pointless reddit fight you should get on with your day and find something else to talk about.</p>

<p>I don’t know if pdg is right, if tmor are really that smart or if everyone is about 25 years younger than me and just don’t know any better. Either way the best way combat this stuff when it is true is to ignore it and carry on as usual.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t buy that anyone online can be &quot;bullied into silence&quot;. This is one website and you have one account. You don&#39;t like the response you&#39;re getting on Reddit? Leave or make a new account. Or better yet ignore them. I don&#39;t know why this is so hard for some to do, you don&#39;t have to come to Reddit everyday, you can take a week or a month off and everyone will have forgotten. These people feed on reactions. You deny them of their precious drama and they go away. Controversial subs like this are always going to have crowds of people who take every opprotunity they can to degrade and harass. I think things will get a lot better if we shrug them off, maybe take some of their criticism into consideration and move on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never had a prominent online presence like yourself so I may not fully understand, but if things get to a point where you&#39;re getting anxiety even visiting this website, its time to reevaluate things. From what you&#39;ve posted, it seems like you were pretty vocal about calling these people out for their harassment and that&#39;s the worst thing you can do as the more you openly complain, the more fun they have mocking you and things start to snowball. It also helps to look at all the positive feedback you get as well. Spend less time bothering with the harassment and more time engaging with the people who appreciate what you do. Trolls suck, but ultimately its just words on a screen. Also, keep in mind that there are internet personalities who are much more controversial and prominent and who receive unimaginable amounts of hate that still continue to do what they do. They push on because their belief in the righteousness of their cause and the love and respect their fans give them overpowers any amount of childish trolling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just block the person the second you get a (fake) threatening message? Put them on an ignore list, eliminate them from your online existence.</p>

<p>How are any of these people going to know who you are in real life to follow up on  a (fake) threat. you have to know that there is no way for them to follow up on it, and in the end they are cowards at heart anyway, cowards who are NOT going to do anything.</p>

<p>I still think that blocking people is an effective way to deal with people who engage in perpetual negativity with you. In the end, if you can&#39;t see it or read it is is just. not. going. to. bother. you.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t feed the trolls&quot; is a cliche&#39; for a reason, it&#39;s a truth and has been since the advent of the online environment.</p>

<p>I think it is a mistake for you to give them this much power over you. What I do not understand, is that on some level <em>you have to know this</em>. I guess I thought, based on your writing alone, you would not give those who dwell in darkness such a complete victory over you. You allowing them to drive you off the internet or to drive your voice into silence is doing nothing more than encouraging them even more to do this to others in the future. You are going to validate for them that this behavior works.</p>

<p>You need to reconsider this for your own sake. This fear-based action is invalidating a lot of what your own writing has told the world you, supposedly, stand for. Consider coming out of it on the other side as someone who is only stronger and more resilient, because I think in the end that is who you <em>really</em> are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to offer a counter-perspective, but first let me be clear: Personal threats of violence are never OK. I&#39;m really sorry that happened to you.</p>

<p>I have gotten in to it with you once IIRC. We disagreed pretty hard, but for the record, I never thought you might be a Nazi.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an SJW and a subscriber to TMOR and also a subscriber (since joining reddit like a decade ago) to conspiracy. It&#39;s no fun being a left-wing conspiracist if there&#39;s no well-meaning right-wing brothers to spar with, so I&#39;m sad to see you go. I also predict you&#39;ll be back because, with all it&#39;s flaws, there&#39;s nothing else quite like reddit out there.</p>

<p>One final thought: Not all at TMOR are shills. Some maybe way too zealous. Many of us are unapologetically elitist and leftist, but most of us want things to go well for everybody, and are &quot;we may disagree with (and/or find extremely humorous) what you say, but we will defend your right to say it&quot; kind of folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading a lot lately on spiritual topics like dharma and zen. I believe the only way pure conspiracy theorists can make it through this hell hole is to adopt the view that godly work should be done irrespective of the anticipated fruits of your actions. Conversely, you shouldn&#39;t back away from battle simply because you feel like these individual entities are ganging up on you and smothering your voice. Speak your mind and if the downvotes come, you know that you did your duty. Evil will always work hard to overcome good. If you let yourself get caught up in that, you might prevent yourself from acting when the world needs you most. I appreciate everything you&#39;ve contributed to reddit and this sub in particular. Please do not stop fighting the good fight. Also, don&#39;t think of TMOR as powerful evil people. Think of them as weak people who are suffering so immensely that they are lashing out at you and others in this sub in the most immature manner. If anything, they deserve our compassion. If they knew any better, they&#39;d be on our side of the fence. They aren&#39;t, but with the way the world is, can you really blame them for being products of their environment? Thanks for reading. Please continue keeping real interactions going on this site.</p>

<p>It will be a shame to see you go.</p>

<p>At the same time, this is the internet. It is not &#39;real life&#39;. I know that in the past I have been guilty of forgetting that, in a certain sense, none of this is &#39;real&#39;. It is ones and zeroes, it is red/blue/green light being emitted from a screen.</p>

<p>As humans we would prefer that people respect us and appreciate the efforts we put into trying to do the right thing. We become frustrated when our efforts are disparaged, and anxious when it seems that our fellow humans are against us. These are natural responses to what we sense around us.</p>

<p>The internet is an amazing thing, one which few of us seem to truly understand the significance of. Like a sword or a gun or a strong intellect, it can be used for &#39;good&#39; or for &#39;evil&#39;. When we find ourselves feeling overwhelmed by the negative aspects of it, such as brigading by anonymous cowards on certain subreddits, it can all seem like a waste of our time, not worth the effort.</p>

<p>And then we can be reminded that other people out there appreciate what we do, and remember that everything is merely a matter of perspective :)</p>

<p>The world is changing because the internet is becoming real life. It can make or break people. For example, cyber bullying is a huge problem my students face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not trying to downplay the significance of cyber bullying.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the work of Jean Baudrillard? His book &#39;Simulacra and Simulation&#39; is shown briefly at the beginning of <em>The Matrix</em>, and for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFAlxCSPnv4">good reason</a>.</p>

<p>What he tries to explore is the notion that the simulation (in this case, the &#39;cyber&#39;) is now standing in place of the real. When we allow our online presence to substitute for a real presence, then the consequences -- even if entirely online -- are just as real as anything which came before the cyber.</p>

<p>People like you and I use the internet as an outlet for our honest expressions of concern about certain elements of this existence. This means that our online identities become very important to us. So important that when we are attacked online, it feels to real.</p>

<p>But is it <em>really?</em></p>

<p>Hey, so John le bon, step2thejep, just randomly dropped a link to a john le bon video... which guess what, he made and that is why he is here, to advertise his videos and website. Why would he do that? most of his content is behind a $20/ mo paywall and he wants you to pay him. </p>

<p>Most of his points just point to a basic lack of understanding of research, science etc.</p>

<p>He believes that there is no space, no planets, no moons, earth is not round, does not orbit the sun, all of history is fake, all wars are fake, nukes don&#39;t exist, atoms are fake, dinosaurs are a lie, evolution is a hoax etc...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t bother engaging him because he won&#39;t add anything, he wants you to pay him for his genius, I mean he call himself worlds greatest skeptic on his website. He will, however, troll and ask &quot;why&quot; repeatedly like a 3 yearold play the &quot;why game&quot;... although sometimes he substitutes why for evidence, impossible standards of evidence (that he never applies to his own malformed and still born thoughts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More good can be done for the world’s that way :).</p>

<p>This is an issue that is going to become even more pronounced among younger generations...  those of us old enough to have grown up <em>alongside</em>, rather than <em>with</em> the internet interact with it in a fundamentally different way than those younger than us.  (Oddly, also, than many of those older than us).  The idea of never revealing your personal identity online was fundamentally ingrained, and nearly as much of an impression was made that <em>the Internet is wholly different from real life</em>.</p>

<p>The latter because the internet, at the time, and the anonymity it offered, was an entirely revolutionary thing.  There was not, before that, a way to interact with such a large group of people in total anonymity.  Add to that that many of us started out on AOL where one chose a username (never your real name) and that it became a sort of <em>avatar</em>. You wanted your username to be known, but not as you.  It created a separation from self, a buffer.</p>

<p>I would wager that this is exactly were the original groups of internet trolls got their ethos and drive.  Most of that group (and I participated in the early days of 4chan, something awful, and the afore-mentioned encyclopedia dramatica) were about the same age, the “Proto-millenials”.  I was an edgy wannabe asshole, I never actually participated in actively harassing anyone but did find sadistic humor in the reports of those doing so, “Chris-Chan” being a prime example, I saw that go on for almost a decade.  Sad stuff.</p>

<p>The reason I mention all of this is that the current generations <em>do not have this same ideal of separation</em>, their own self has become their “avatar” and online reputation or interactions have no mental difference to them than the real life ones (probably most anyone under 30 give or take).  The social media generation.  For them, most of the internet is directly linked to their real lives and places that offer “anonymity” are the exception.</p>

<p>This has two huge drawbacks, and a very strange consequence to ponder.</p>

<p>The first drawback is clearly simple exposure...  they have no safety blanket; what happens online is directly tied to their life and their real-life social group.</p>

<p>The second drawback is that this makes them <em>far, far easier prey to both harassment like cyber bullying and also propaganda and media manipulation</em>. Again, what happens in the online sphere <em>is their real life</em>.  It is altogether dangerous for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>And the odd effect to ponder is the very idea of treating oneself as the avatar...  the online “image” <em>is</em> themselves but almost a “brand icon” in that it is hoped by people to be an idealized version of self.  Presenting only “good pictures” on the various vapid picture sites, using social media to seem more interesting than they are, getting <em>true validation</em> (as in psychologically identical) from likes and shares.  The <em>self</em> as the avatar, the <em>false</em> as more real than the <em>real</em>!  </p>

<p>I am honestly interested to hear your take on that applied to a religious view, it is something that really hasn’t been looked at with the specificity that it justifies and a religious view is an important one there.  </p>

<p>I would say <em>that</em> is the most important aspect that an educator could attempt to fix among the youth they have access to, above all else.</p>

<p>Oh, and I glanced at TMOR, it lacks most of the <em>anarchistic zest</em> of the troll sites I mentioned before, it seems a rather sad echo chamber for the r\politics types who don’t feel heard enough and want to self-congratulate and mutually masturbate each other’s egos.  Browsing there felt very similar to the time I discovered r\incels was a thing and actually went and looked through that mess of similar self-reinforcing... whatever it is.  Wouldn’t worry too much about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah.  I&#39;m way beyond caring now. That place is an echo chamber anyway. I always loved your well thought out posts and the fact you were able to have civil discourse even when not in agreement.  You seem like a good person judging by your posts and how you intetracted with people.  You saw this place going down the shitter and wanted to make a better place and I respect that and followed you there.  I wish you the best in your future endeavors.  PM me if you ever feel your life is truly in danger. I would do all in my power to help. Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basicallt TMOR is a subreddit which attempts to use vindictive mockery and harassment, as a means of preventing the circulation of ideas which they find offensive.  They usually don&#39;t have either the ability or the inclination to refute the actual idea itself, so they respond by attacking the reputation of the person expressing said idea.  </p>

<p>Part of the reason why they like using ridicule and various forms of harassment such as death threats, is because they like to maintain a false veneer of Utopian pacifism.  If they are able to cause a person to be fired from their job, or to encourage them to commit suicide, then in their own minds they are able to continue to ethically compare themselves with Gandhi.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of different people from both Reddit and Twitter suffer enormously in terms of both their physical and psychiatric health, as a result of the psychological warfare used against them by groups like TMOR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck that...Go to war..</p>

<p>You need to start a collective of trusted users and do everything they do to you back x10.</p>

<p>Then put together a small fund (talking like $100 to start off). Buy AI bots.</p>

<p>Then use the bots to forum slide and to raise post that are backed by websites whiling to pay you for a &quot;legit post&quot;.</p>

<p>Take that money and split it. Half to your fund the other half goes to more bots.</p>

<p>While this is happening use your base to create 10 accounts per person. Everyone needs to be using TOR to avoid reddits tracking.</p>

<p>Half the accounts will be &quot;against&quot; you while the other half are on your side.</p>

<p>Use bots to double up your posting and thumb counts and to create fake discussions where the &quot;against&quot; ends up looking like a tool.</p>

<p>Continue making money and growing your &quot;collective&quot;. In less than 6 months you will see a massive change. Within a year you may be modding your most hated sub.</p>

<p>Hit me up if you seriously want to change the world you live in. I&#39;ve been on conspiracy and other forums researching forum sliding techniques by intel agencies long enough to start my own group...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad to see you go. All I can say is follow the path that leads you to greater, freedom, love and peace. If you feel the right path leads you away from Reddit, then it is time to go. Trust yourself, trust Life, trust God, whatever you wish to call the infinite force that surrounds and interpentrates the Cosmos and beyond, that connects all life in a seamless unity....and you will continue to be on the right path and of great service to the world.</p>

<p>If you are not drawn to Reddit again, that is fine. Look at it as a chapter in your life from which you can learn and grow. You have helped many and now perhaps life is calling you elsewhere. All things are interconnected and all events have their place and meaning. They may have bullied you off, but even TMOR has a place in the great cosmic game. Your way is crossed by darkness and light and every being and circumstance has a part to play in the unfolding of your life. Listen to yourself and you will know what to do. If Life, if God is calling you to help elsewhere than that is where you need to go, that is where you will be most useful. </p>

<p>An intertwinement of our will and that of all life is the path we are all to take. As one door closes, another opens. All you have to do is remain aware and open and the open door will become apparent to you more and more.</p>

<p>Much love PDG, I predict you will remain (and even grow as) a great aid to healing this planet.</p>

<p>Stay well :)</p>

<p>If you choose not to respond to this request, I completely understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re trolls and they know it would bother a sensitive person. That&#39;s the only reason they do it. I mean, how unoriginal is that? There are no &quot;top minds&quot; there. That&#39;s the biggest joke. Nazi is  the most common and over-used insult as of late. They&#39;re just a bunch of creepy losers. We all know a few in our real lives. They can&#39;t get a nice girl to look at them, so they sit around and run them down behind their backs instead. If you could see what they look like, it would all make sense. They can&#39;t tell off the girls in their everyday lives for ignoring them, because then they&#39;d appear to be that much more creepy and unbalanced. They&#39;d become an even bigger social pariah. But they can gang up on one online and fantasize about doing it to the nice looking girls who see through them at work, school, etc. Why else would they get on here and gang up on you, and make fun of you when it has nothing to do with them? These little twerps never learned the lesson called &quot;live and let live.&quot; They&#39;re just freaks of nature with no social skills. And nobody but one of those pathetic fringe lefties would call anyone a &quot;Nazi.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can relate.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8212ta/youtube_deletes_entire_health_ranger_video/dv6zwya/">This</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8212ta/youtube_deletes_entire_health_ranger_video/dv6vwy1/">this</a> comment are currently both at least -5, and in both cases I consciously attempted to be civil and non-inflammatory to the people I responded to.</p>

<p>I think the hard Left are basically using the accusations of Nazism and white supremacy to attempt to condemn literally anything that they don&#39;t like.  I remember a year or so ago I met a German backpacker who said that something similar was happening in Germany.  She said there were factory workers who were in poor conditions, but if any of them tried to complain or protest, they were immediately accused of Nazism and compared with Hitler.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ironically those people who most want to be able to tell everyone else how to think, who are the most likely to accuse you of being a fascist if you disagree with anything they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would encourage you to follow my posting history, if you are interested.  You may notice that I have started attempting to use much more neutral and less emotionally charged ways of stating things, (at least at times) and that can help me slip under the radar and receive minimal downvotes.</p>

<p>Some suggestions:- </p>

<p>a}  Never state definite conclusions; always leave that up to the reader.  Ask rhetorical questions and make lists of individual premises, but don&#39;t tie it all together with your own overt answer.  Apart from anything else, my objective is not to get anyone to accept a definite conclusion at this point anyway, but merely to encourage them to actively think, regardless of what the outcome is.</p>

<p>b}  Never make &quot;you,&quot; statements.  Whenever I encounter behaviour in someone else which I consider objectionable, I always try and give that person an account of how I used to engage in that behaviour myself, (because generally speaking I will have, at one time) but I gave it up because I found it to be harmful, and I will then list the ways in which it harms me.  This results in the reader feeling neither blamed nor attacked, but simply gives them information which they can potentially use to improve their own lives.</p>

<p>c}  Make your choice of words both emotionally neutral, and ideally limited to things which are demonstrably provable.  Avoid discussing feelings or emotions, due to their almost complete subjectivity; and likewise avoid discussing individuals, as opposed to ideas.</p>

<p>d}  Don&#39;t talk about &quot;isms.&quot;  The entire reason why &quot;isms&quot; are more useful to your opponent than you, is because they usually have no precise operational definition, which means that they are perfect for making straw men out of.  The fact that you have been called a Nazi is itself an example of this.  I will assume that the people who called you a Nazi made no attempt to concretely define what they believed a Nazi was; because a specific definition can be logically refuted.</p>

<p>As another example of this, I do not speak specifically of the disadvantages of centrally planned authoritarianism, in those terms.  Instead I cite networking theory, in which it is known that a network becomes less efficient, with the more edges or greater distance there is from the nearest center or vertex.  With this statement, I&#39;m not just saying, &quot;Communism sucks.&quot;  I&#39;m describing a practical reason why centralised government does not lead to desirable results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Freemason, I don&#39;t agree with how you&#39;ve characterized us in the past. I think your views, in that regard, are very misguided.</p>

<p>That being said, disagreements should simply be that: disagreements. I&#39;m sorry to see you go; I know that a lot of people on the sub do appreciate your threads and comments. Do what you feel is best, and if you feel you can brave the waters after some time away, please do come back. I believe that this thread is proof enough that you are appreciated.</p>

<p>Reddit is great in that many people feel empowered to speak their mind. That&#39;s also a bit of the problem, though, in that some people feel empowered to stifle the opinions and views of others. Don&#39;t let their actions get you down. Always keep your chin up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is a problem not just on reddit but IRL. If someone is accused of being a Nazi or a racist or some other term that happens to be controversial, even if it doesn&#39;t apply, their arguments and their reputation will be damaged regardless of what they do or say. It&#39;s kind of like mob mentality.</p>

<p>Being falsely accused of something and then having to prove your innocence to no avail is a horrible experience, its incredibly enraging when it happens to you. Best of luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swarms of imbeciles and shills pelted us with a steady stream of nonsense and harassment.
So you helped build a respite for us.  This is a place where we can discuss, share and regroup.  It’s a place where we might persevere.</p>

<p>But you’ve had to face much more than a drip – drip – drip of harassment.  You’ve faced a continuous deluge of pointed, personal attacks.  It was inevitable that, at some point, you would have to withdraw.  </p>

<p>So now it’s time for you to step away and regroup. Live some life, take some walks, pet some dogs.  And reflect on this experience because it was a battle.  Although you might feel that you lost this battle, you step away battle-hardened.    Use that wisdom and experience to plan for the future and most importantly – use it to persevere, because resilience is the gift won through facing difficulties.</p>

<p>You may not come back with the same name and you may not come back to the same place.   But your presence will be felt and your voice will be heard. 
You are a leader.
And this was just one battle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha it was only one month worth of comments but it still took my script about a half hour to scrub 700+ comments.  That just goes to show how much you do with the time that you have considering the time you spend on Reddit is a pretty small part of your day.</p>

<p>Basically, how it worked is that I used JavaScript, which is code that runs on web pages, such as this one, to programmatically loop over every comment on the User Profile &gt; Comments tab, edit the comment, save it, and then delete the comment.  Apparently Reddit still keeps a record of deleted comments so this will scrub them before deleting them, which is better privacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay away from MSM.  They are definitely not going 2 touch anything that has obvious CIA/nsa partnership.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to find a group that will investigate shilling and shill tactics, and link them to all the posts and documentation of the extent to which they took their bullying tactics with you.    Intercept, someone on consortium news (be careful, since Robert parry  died, the content isn&#39;t nearly as consistently well researched in analysis.  Your best bet would honestly be to either write it yourself or have someone you personally trust write it for you while you provide them with the material and research.  He then have to find the right place to get it published, most alternative news sites outside the mainstream media these days will take submission articles that are of enough quality.  </p>

<p>I want to do a project like this but unfortunately all my time is stolen by school right now.</p>

<p>One thing they&#39;ll be very careful the other reason you don&#39;t want to do mainstream media is because this could be a lot bigger in scope than you realize.  Any news organization that looks like it will check with the government for approval is going to hand over everything you give them, especially personal info.  </p>

<p>Here, they call you a nazi.  In chapo, the faction is &quot;tanky&quot;.  My wife is a vocal opponent against imperialism against north Korea there, and she was roped into hours long exchanges that were exhausting baits, and essentially called an authoritarian trying to destroy leftism.  They are working their way into r libertarian now, bullying and insulting the gullability of anyone who even suggests they can see where Bernie is coming from.  Surprise, it always ends with accusing them of not being a &quot;real&quot; libertarian.</p>

<p>There is a psyops on, and it isn&#39;t pretty.  The elite are doing everything they can to make sure the working-class stays split on the demarcations  of their choosing.

If you tell the truth, you&#39;re going to be insulted, harassed, intimidated, stalked, and threatened:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our NBC reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of YouTube and Blogger, the targeting of Anonymous with the very same DDoS attacks they accuse “hacktivists” of using, the use of “honey traps” (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses. But, here, I want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself.</p>

<p>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tactics they boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (posting material to the internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fake victim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputation they want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on various forums.</p>

<p>Under the title “Online Covert Action”, the document details a variety of means to engage in “influence and info ops” as well as “disruption and computer net attack,” while dissecting how human beings can be manipulated using “leaders,” “trust,” “obedience” and “compliance”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear all that bad stuff happened to you polkadotgirl. It takes a lot of effort to ignore groups like TMOR, but it&#39;s the only way. They&#39;re just liars who want to make you mad. And I know you know that, but the emotional navigation of that can be complicated, I totally understand that. Just ignore those silly fools, they&#39;re not worth wasting one moment considering, even if they say the most triggering of lies. If they find a button that works, they will press it repeatedly until the target goes on tilt. That&#39;s their whole game. Only way to win is to have no buttons to press, because who truly cares about the words of those who are known liars?  :) Not me! No one sees you as a Nazi, because no one trusts those losers, even if they fake upvote each other to make it look like majority opinion. Don&#39;t let it stick in your craw, because that&#39;s their method of disabling you. I know you know this as well, I&#39;m just reminding you that we know it and see what is going on, and we&#39;re on your side. </p>

<p>Anyway, I wish you the best, and I&#39;ll be glad to see you around at saidit!</p>

<p>I hope you get some time to heal yourself. You are an educator of minds, so you are at the very front lines of the battle. Consider this no more than a chink in your armor and keep fighting somewhere.</p>

<p>Thanks for all you did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kind of new, but based on reading a few articles and comments from Polkadotgirl, I am confident that such attacks would be entirely dishonest, and they know they are dishonest. So:</p>

<p>1 Why not use their words against them. The vast majority will condemn anyone who behaves like them. Their reputation would be over if anyone knew what they were doing.
1 Why not block such users, so you don&#39;t have to see their BS?
1 Why not ban such users from your sub?
1 Why read <em>anything</em> on their sub? I spent about 10 minutes once reading the tmor sub, and I could see there was no reason to ever go back--zero value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people have literally sold their souls to the devil, not even joking.  There&#39;s a reason they sound like the people on pol.  My theory is that it&#39;s all the same people, a mix of nsa/cia.  Think about it, the pipeline.  Pol Nazis are always dog whistling the donald, and they have the same abusive rhetoric.  The normal Maga ppl, who I may not agree with completely but can at least have a conversation about the underlying causes that pushed them to trump, are attacked by the top minds and politics/dnc ppl, and by the Nazis whenever they are critical of the racist s*** or the intervention Trump has been pursuing in the Middle East.   The Nazis eventually dog whistle them over to 4chan pol, which turns them into animals.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the Richard Spencer/twitter celebrities of the alt right are always pushing the idea that there is overlap in the alt right and left. They try to present it to normies superficially as if the alt right and left  must share the same boogeyman philosophy  of the function  and powers of government - that is absolute bullshit.  </p>

<p>Never is that conjecture phrased in a way in which there is some  nuanced truth - that there are the shared material problems of the working class but the Direction and tactics to correct those problems are completely different in each ideology.  No the accusation is always phrased in such a way that it benefits the DNC.</p>

<p>Not unlike the strategy of the Middle East over the last couple decades.  Set the area on fire, culminating with the Syrian War and it&#39;s Refugee crisis.  They made sure to have their proxy terrorist groups set up in such a way and invade in such a way that the only route was on boats from Damascus to Europe. Have a surplus labor pool Europe!  Maybe you can do what we do and just enslave them in jail!  Except for this case think of it in terms of users and communities migrating to pol or in the case of the left two other boards that they try to control with this sick bullying.  Keep feeding them this unnatural hatred and normalize dehumanizing interactions.  Pretty soon one of them will jump off the deep end most of them come in wobbly on the edge anyway.</p>

<p>Finally just like the United States is trying to push Israel to take over the port of Damascus in order to control the natural gas pipeline, all these communities and boards that they push people out of get their shills installed in the mod team, today then effectively control the content and flow of information on the board.</p>

<p>I can only hope that enough normies figure out this tactic and that Reddit is not a cross-section of the actual opinions and ideas of people anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>My guess is you became a target by moderating a conspiracy sub that &lt;they&gt; did not have any control over. And they hate that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Top Minds of Reddit brigade attempts to destroy subs by infiltrating, cyberstalking, discrediting and bullying the mods of those subs.  They hit <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> hard.  We hid the voting arrows for posts and comments and report as spam button in CS. The admins required us to restore the report as spam button. Thereafter, we reported over a dozen more report as spam brigading to the admins. Just a half a year ago, we restored the voting arrows.</p>

<p>I kept records of their downvote brigading, reporting as spam brigading and harassment to give to admins. I made numerous reports to admins updating the records. Little enforcement of Reddit&#39;s rules. History is below.</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago, TMOR brigade downvoted my original account&#39;s comment karma. The admins temporarily banned several brigadiers but refused to restore <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a>&#39;s comment karma. The default setting in preferences is to hide all comments by all Redditors with minus 4 and below. Thereby, Reddit circumvents negative comment karma from ever being restored. Belatedly, <a href="/u/microwavedindividual">/u/microwavedindividual</a> created an alt account, me, so his future comments will be visible.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/80760k/censorship_our_new_mod_is_my_new_alt_account/?st=jeu6mbxd&amp;amp;sh=dde19850">https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/80760k/censorship_our_new_mod_is_my_new_alt_account/?st=jeu6mbxd&amp;amp;sh=dde19850</a></p>

<p>I recommend <a href="/u/vespertineloquence">/u/vespertineloquence</a> to do the same. Ask your other mods to send you an invitation to mod. Each time TMOR downvotes your comment  karma for minus 4, create a new alt and invite the new alt to mod. Don&#39;t let TMOR win.</p>
