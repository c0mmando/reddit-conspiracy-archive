<p>But isnt that just what Fox does? It&#39;s a right wing, republican news service. </p>

<p>There is just as much propaganda from the left as there is from the right. Always has been too, it&#39;s just out in the spotlight now. Today Russia is the talking point, by this time next year it could be China.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Donald Trump is the president of America. To an outsider like myself, <em>nothing</em> is far fetched anymore.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying that Trump is compromised, I&#39;m saying that every single one of them in is compromised to some extent. If it&#39;s not to a foreign power, its to a corporation. </p>

<p>Romney was talking about Russia just a few years ago and Obama seemed to dismiss the notion that they were a geopolitical threat.</p>

<p><a href="http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/26/romney-russia-is-our-number-one-geopolitical-foe/">http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/26/romney-russia-is-our-number-one-geopolitical-foe/</a></p>

<p>In my opinion, I believe the recent Russia hysteria has more to do with the lobbying by the Ukrainian government. And on an even more conspiratorial point, the Russian pipeline. These are only opinions however, I just think there&#39;s more to this &quot;Russia, Russia, Russia&quot; hysteria than Trump. But I appreciate you looking at things through a different lens and being honest in that it&#39;s more of a hunch than anything backed by hard evidence. Discussions are good. Enjoy your day! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL is literally the comment reply parallel to your post. </p>

<p>Riddle me this. DNC finds out there’s a Russian breach in late APril 2016. Crowdstrike gets on the case ASAP. May 5, 2016 crowdstrike goes in and begins to rid server of breach (forgive if techie terms are incorrect).  From the May 5th until the end of may when the last email is wRitten, 16k emails are released out of the 27 available on WL. Freon early 2015 through the May 5th date, only 11. Why did they ramp up the emails after they knew they were breached?</p>

<p>Furthe; nine out of ten of the emails noted as most damaging by WAPO were written after Crowdstrike cane on board to resolve the  breach. </p>

<p>Even more fun is that beginning in Sept of 2015, the FBI notifies Yared Tamene, the DNC IT contractor, (working for company owned by Obama’s campaign IT director) repeatedly on the phone and in person that there is a breach linked to Foreign servers, one of which is in Russia. FBI agent Hawkins called with an urgent message at one point indicating that the malware was “phoning home” which is believed to have meant sending data to Russian based servers. This initial breach was ignored at first and then yared googled the dukes and ran an anti virus program but found nothing so he continually ignored the FBIs warnings.  At some point in 2016, second breach takes place. This time Yared tamene is on the case. Crowdstrike is brought in. Most damaging emails are written and leaked. </p>

<p>At this point in time, no law enforcement agency has been given accsss to the DNF server and all reporting is based on crowrstrkk w
How many times must tue fbi warm the dnc?  They could have resolved this problem very early on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why you guys are trying to imply that Russia isn&#39;t pulling some shenanigans here to some degree that&#39;s worth exploring. You&#39;ve got the White House National Security Adviser himself saying that Russian interference/meddling in the 2016 election is &quot;incontrovertible&quot;, indictments with regard to defrauding the US handed out to 13 different Russian entities from the Mueller special counsel, actual demonstrations being organized by Russians to the extent that they were paying Americans to build props and dress up as Hillary and Bill Clinton to mock them (NPR just did a radiolab podcast over this and it was pretty interesting to listen to: <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/curious-case-russian-flash-mob-west-palm-beach-cheesecake-factory/">http://www.radiolab.org/story/curious-case-russian-flash-mob-west-palm-beach-cheesecake-factory/</a>) I&#39;d say hysteria is very much warranted, or at least some curiosity to try and figure out what the hell is happening on this front since the White House isn&#39;t concerned about it for some mysterious reason. </p>

I don&#39;t deny that a small troll group was engaged in multiple campaigns for commercial interest, probably at the behest of American citizens.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you’re right. 100 Russian internet trolls have figured out how to infiltrate every major organization in every developed nation, simultaneously.</p>

<p>Look Russia made every effort to fuck with American voters, but being hysterical and screaming “Ah! Russians!” At every single thing you disagree with is a really dumb way to handle it.</p>

<p>Do you really think MSNBC is any better than Fox? They know they’re audience, they cater to it, simple enough explanation, no?</p>

<p>Beef up cyber security and listen when the FBI calls you to tell you you’re compromised and don’t wait 11 months before you involve someone more senior than the receptionist.</p>

<p>If reporting is to be believed we had about a 2 year heads up that the DNC was compromised by Russians and we did jack shit about. The FBI talked to the receptionist a couple times and then was like “oh well! YOLO!”</p>

<p>Lesson learned, hopefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude the only stock I&#39;m putting into anything is Robert Mueller&#39;s investigation. It&#39;s my last hope that some semblance of the United States my grandfather fought for still exists today. I love the US and I still think we&#39;re the greatest country on the planet but our government fucking depresses me. </p>

<p>I try to pay attention to both liberal and conservative media outlets and I&#39;ve never seen such vitriol from all sides. We&#39;re all Americans here, we&#39;re not enemies but we&#39;re damn sure treating each other as such based on the media content that you and who you&#39;re disagreeing with at any given moment consumes (using &quot;you&quot; collectively). Seriously, you&#39;re a dumbass shill that should be shot if you don&#39;t watch Fox News or you&#39;re an ignorant bigot if you do. Everyone hates everyone and I&#39;m sick of it.</p>

<p>So why is it so laughable that I might get a feeling about a foreign entity influencing the content that US media outlets produce to pit Americans against each other.  And by the way I&#39;m more than happy to include MSNBC and CNN with Fox as having been infiltrated by the foreign entity. </p>

<p>If you read my title, no where did I say I believe this to be fact. I&#39;m trying to have a discussion here. If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible on any level tell me why as others have done. Let&#39;s not be shitty to one another though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I mean those are all great points. I just hear of instances of demonstrations being setup here in the US by Russian troll factories  via Facebook/Twitter and the people going to those demonstrations are largely consumers of Fox News content. </p>

<p>It just gives me the feeling that the true extent of Russian influence on supposed US media hasn&#39;t even been scratched yet. </p>
