Putin doesnt mind using it as a tool to scare other assets while knowing his hands are clean of it. Obama did this to the drone operators when one was killed in a hit and run while on vacation in Spain. It silenced others who taljed about it while also being a separate attack Obama coukdbt be tied to. Israel did the same to the guy who went to turkwy and released info on Rafael misconduct. Rafael killed the guy but Netanyahu used it to threaten his own Mossad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mystery of the former Russian agent who was poisoned with a nerve agent in a small English city on Sunday is getting more complex by the day. The Telegraph reported Thursday that Sergei Skripal—who remains in a critical condition in hospital alongside his daughter and a British police officer—was in close contact with a security consultant who worked for Christopher Steele, the former British agent who compiled the infamous Trump dossier. The newspaper refused to name the consultant, but reported that a LinkedIn page deleted in the past few days stated that he was based in Salisbury—where the attempted murder took place—and had previously done work for Orbis Business Intelligence, which is run by Steele. The Telegraph report states: “If the Kremlin believed that Col. Skripal might have helped with the compilation of the dossier, it could explain the motive for the assassination attempt in Salisbury town center.” On Wednesday, Valery Morozov—a former construction magnate who fled Russia—told Channel 4 News that Skripal was not retired and met with military intelligence officers every month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why kill him now? The swap was in 2010, unless he’s still privy to inner kremlin machinations, what info could he possibly have divulged that would warrant having him killed now?</p>

<p>Not saying Russia didn’t do it, they certainly could’ve. I’m just curious as to why they’d wait almost 8 years to do it.</p>

<p>Assuming he recovers and still has his mental faculties, I’m assuming he’ll have a story to tell about what recent actions could’ve warranted his assassination.</p>

<p>Very interesting case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very easily, just as easily as MI5 or anyone else with the access to something like polonium could have offed Litvinenko to make his death look like a so-called Russian hit. They claim that Mossad knocked-off Arafat that way. </p>

<p>When you&#39;re dealing with a double-dealing double-agent you&#39;re very apt to get double-crossed by them especially if they&#39;re strictly in it for in the money. Some sell what they know about the two they&#39;re playing to some other foreign power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As if the Russians are going to give a shit about being found out. They&#39;ve killed lots of people in the UK. This is just a public reminder.</p>

<p>The bigger question is why was the first police officer on the scene a Detective Sargent? CID (Criminal Investigation Department aka Cunts In Disguise) are not first response officers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skripal hasn&#39;t even been in GRU since the 1990&#39;s.</p>

<p>He has been working for MI6 since then. He has zero up to date knowledge about anything important. His only &quot;job&quot; was to be a living token of defection, a show piece for NATO to dust off and beag, &quot;see? we got one, we weren&#39;t completely dominated and doubled and subverted by the Soviets for decades, reducing all of our mega billion elaborate machinations of espionage into a punchline.&quot;</p>

<p>Putin didn&#39;t assassinate Skripal.</p>

<p>MI6 gassed him.</p>

<p>Because he was the phony Russian source that Steele used to authenticate the bona fides of his pornographic tabloid dossier.</p>

<p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you who told me the pee-pee tapes are real, but it is an asset high in the Kremlin who&#39;s authenticity is unquestionable.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, dummy Steele was forging the source of entire dossier to disguise that it was just him all along! Of course the Clinton Crime Cartel knew all along and they abused Attorney Client privilege to pass through the bribery pay off through Perkins Coie to pay hatchet man Steele.</p>

<p>MI6 has to fall back on the oldest trick in the spy book--blame it on the dead guy.</p>

<p>Now Skripal can&#39;t talk, so Steele can never be exposed, and MI6 will never be ass blasted and shamed before the public that it was them who attempted to run a coup against Trump on behalf of their Overlord Crooked Hillary.</p>

<p>The Brits owed Crooked Hillary a solid for her disastrous invasion of Libya. David Cameron was up to his neck in overthrowing Libya. We have seen his leaked emails on Wikileaks where Cameron and his cronies discuss how to sieze the oil from Qaddafi, and how to steal the $50 BILLION in gold from Qaddafi.</p>

<p>Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Services say &quot;thank you Crooked Hillary, abusing GCHQ to spy on Trump and his supporters and loaning MI:PIE out to run the hit jobs is the least we could do for an old friend.&quot;</p>
