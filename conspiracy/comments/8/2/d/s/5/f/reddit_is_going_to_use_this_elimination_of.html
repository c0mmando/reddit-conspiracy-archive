       No one said their system is infallible and will immediately catch all the accounts.  You start with the worst offenders, then work you way down to less obvious accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I don't believe you - lots of people are using robot automation for these purposes - but your theory would be alot more solid if you specifically cited users who violate this.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why so many of the T_D bots got banned, because people took the time to document their automation beyond a reasonable doubt.

       actually it was supposed to be a commentary on post war england. the original title was 1948. orwell's publisher made him change it.
      </p>
      <p>
       people forget that orwell was an informant. he spied on his fellow writers and reported them to britain's version of HUAC. he knew what he was talking about...firsthand...
      </p>
      <p>
       in one sense, it is good that it was shifted to the future, people are more receptive to warnings, than admonitions, but it also meant that people have kidded themselves into thinking 1984 was always on the horizen, when it was here all along, for going on 70 years. the lunancy of people living through HUAC and the red scare and not realizing 1984 was already real.

       The first amendment isn't nonsense. Without the US tax payers money building the infrastructure for the Internet to exist in the first place these "public forums" wouldn't exist. If you're piggybacking off of the US government you should be bound to its laws like every other entity. If bakers have to cook cakes for whiney gays then reddit should have to put up with stupid Trump supporters. How would you feel if I banned all your stupid opinions on every platform. How would you feel if you couldn't speak your mind on twitter,facebook,reddit,youtube, etc? How would you feel If you couldn't even host your own website to display your opinions without a bunch of neurotic fucks crying until you get shut down. This  shut down   of public discourse is what leads to divides which end in violence. People you can't talk to are enemies.

       Except sexual orientation is a federally protected class, being a Russian spam bot, and/of having differing political views is not (although political orientation is protected in some states). Basically, following your line of thinking here, Reddit isn't actually doing anything wrong in terms of the law.

       We will see. There is currently a case involving twitter and that Amren guy that looks promising. It's in my opinion that public forums such as these should have to adhere to our constitutional rights. As for Russian bots that's different. I don't believe they should have the right to censor content that they disagree with. These leftists would freak out if the shoe was on the other foot and they were being censored in public forums.

       I'm not disagreeing with your point about liberals freaking out if it it was on the other foot, but I do disagree that you believe they don't have a right to censor their content. It's a private forum, and freedom of speech protects you from prosecution from the government, not from being censored on a private companies website. I think you have a very broad interpretation of the first amendment, and it's not an uncommon interpretation either.

       In its current status it might be true. Things can change especially when it comes to interpretation of law and how it is worded. In the past we have had to pass laws to regulate monopolies in order to create a fairer market. When our marketplace of ideas and public discourse gets put into the hands of a nepotistic bunch whom seek to monopolize it for their narrow range of political interests I don't see why there couldn't be changes made.  Years ago sexual orientation might not have been protected. Today it is. Today free speech on Internet might not be protected but with a world where public life is increasingly being woven with the Internet I think things may change. Or at least be spoken about to see where we are on the issue.

       I'm not disagreeing that it could or shouldn't be changed. I'm stating that the comparisons to "whiny gays having a cake baked" isn't a very straightforward comparison as this commenter makes it seem. Personally, I'm for communities self-regulating what is and isn't put on their website, but I'm sure I'm the minority here, and that's fine.

       Violating free speech would be the government arresting you for saying "russia is great lol", not for reddit for deleting low-effort content like "russia is great lol".
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't a violation of free speech to keep certain rhetoric out of your community, as much as you may think it is wrong, it doesn't make a first amendment violation. You cannot come into my house and say "russia is great lol" if I do not want you to come to my house and say that. (granted, I would probably just laugh and invite you in if you are my friend)

       Right, not limiting free speech, just "keeping" certain rhetoric out of your community. That is some Orwellian wordplay going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are proposing sets a terrible precedent, and the window of accepted speech will only get smaller. But if you don't have much worth saying you have nothing to worry about, so keep doing you man.

       Free speech is protection from the government arresting you for saying whatever you wany, not from a community deciding it doesn't want Russian bots spamming them.

Reddit could instead choose to offer no-comment viewing of artwork, or puzzle games, or any other form of website that doesn't mislead people into thinking it is offering a venue for people to speak openly.

        Reddit isn't actually doing anything wrong in terms of the law.

      <p>
       The law isn't the only...or even the primary... basis for evaluating wrongdoing.  Censorship is morally wrong regardless of whether it is done by a government or a non-government entity because it violates a fundamental human right of free speech.  Owning a website doesn't miraculously transform that wrong into right.  At the core of the problem is deception.  They infer that anyone is free to set up an account and express their views and no mention is made at the time of account creation that the website owners intend to prohibit specific viewpoints.  Thus, when a person takes time to establish an account after having been mislead that their free expression would be allowed, when that turns out to not be true, then the website has defrauded them of the time which that user invested in establishing the account, reading, and replying. In short, since the website's ad revenue is based upon viewership, they are falsely luring in people to increase their ad revenues, but doing so with the intention of actually not letting the user speak freely.

       I don't know what else you need bub, it literally says it right there, any reason we choose, says they can remove anything for any reason. I don't care how ambiguous or unfair you think that part of the ToS is, the point is they can remove your post for whatever reason they want, and they never mislead you about that fact. You have no argument here. I am not going to sit here and argue about the semantics of their ToS, if you feel you cannot adhere to them or come to terms with them, then you should not use Reddit (it also says that in the ToS, which I suspect you did not read until now)

       I personally don't find it ambiguous at all; I stated that you may find the post ambiguous or unfair. It states that they can remove your post for any reason, what is misleading about that?

      <p>
       "muh internet" lol, do you seriously think that solely you own the internet. Our tax dollars, not just your tax dollars funded it, so that makes it
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       internet.. which you probably wont like to hear since that's a pretty socialist idea. Sharing something as a public service that all of our tax dollars funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, the fact that you think it is
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       internet and not
       <em>
        our

       internet, as in
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       can do what they want with it, and the fact that you think a company has to bend to your will because you do not like their terms of service that
       <strong>
        you agreed to when you made your account
       </strong>
       whilst spouting I have some sort of socialist agenda that I am pushing is ironic and ridiculous to the point that I actually laughed out loud. The irony here is that, you believe I'm spouting socialist nonsense, when in reality this line of thinking (that a company can do what it wants with it's services free from government regulation) is more libertarian if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a grip on reality dude, I'm not sure how it's undermining your free speech. A company enforcing their ToS that you agreed to is somehow undermining your free speech rights. I just have to go ahead and assume that you don't even know what the 1st amendment actually covers, so I don't think I should engage in this pointless argument anymore until you get a grip on reality and learn what it is that you are actually arguing.

       lol you guys are so fucking retarded. None of those companies have done anything extreme or violated anyone's free speech. The reason they generally have a left-leaning bias is because their audience is generally left-leaning, and they have advertisers that want to target that audience. Your dumbass views aren't being censored they're just unpopular outside your echo chambers.

       Clearly not, as they are banning individuals with right leaning viewpoints, so the audience isn't 100% leftists.

       Furthermore organization and collaboration with other groups such as the ADL to make a blanketed campaign of censorship IS a violation of free speech.

       The advertisers wanted to advertise BEFORE this massive censorship campaign, advertisers want to reach the broadest audience possible, so then pray tell why an advertiser would want to limit itself from ANY group, left or right?

       There is not one good example of someone being banned without a good cause. The ONLY halfway legitimate example is when Twitter made a "mistake" and then corrected it.

       I swear no one in this sub has ever read 1984, they just cite it every time something happens that they don't like.

      <p>
       Can you explain to me what the parallel is in 1984 to a private company banning accounts, which are used to sow confusion among the electorate? I've recently read the book, for at least the third time, and I don't see it.

       So, to be clear, in 1984 they would switch who they were at war with and then they would force everyone to say that we have always been at war with them, and they would go back and edit all of the information to cleanse or add information that would support this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So are we suggesting that Russia isn't an adversary? Or that Russia just recently became an adversary and we have gone back in time and made up the cold war and the tensions that have existed since the fall of the USSR? That's amazing because I remember my sister went to Germany and was lucky enough to be there during the fall of the Berlin wall, and was able to take some chunks off of it. Hell, my family even has some of these chunks. It's amazing how well they edited history because they even put these rocks in my parent's and sister's house. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't see how reddit banning some russian troll accounts is anything like the "we have always been at war" claim from 1984.

       First, the top level comment makes no allusion to this. They simply state that what they are doing is reminiscent of 1984. There is no reason to believe they mean anything but what they actually claim they are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, care to show any proof of this claim? I see plenty of people, right here in this thread, going against the narrative, and they are still here. Why didn't they get them, too?

       Yes it does, you say you see no reason to be upset that "Russian trolls" are being banned, when in reality they are just a boogeyman. It was shown that they did what, buy some political ads?? Made a couple Facebook groups or something?? It was a drop in the pond.
      </p>

       Reddit has censored TD from appearing on the front page and changed vote weights, conservatives are being banned from twitter and youtube and having their videos demonetized in mass under the guise of "hate speech" when in reality they are just telling people the truth.

       You can argue that it wasn't effective, I'm not sure I agree, considering the claim is that they basically did their best to amplify spun talking points and fake news. But that is much harder to quantify. I'm still trying to figure out how this has anything to do with 1984.

       What he's saying is that calling something 1984 like because it's censorship is a complete misunderstanding of 1984 that does not go beyond the very surface. They deeper significance of 1984 is not about censorship, but the obliteration of the notion of truth. Which this has nothing to do with.

       As i said in another reply, Google has it's own shady things in play, yes some of them more than likely controlling info as they are primarily a large data company. However, saying I don't belong in a sub for sharing a belief counter to yours, especially in a sub about open discussion, is a bit much.
      </p>
      <p>
       The propaganda issue is a rather large thing despite you wanting to believe otherwise. Yes, said trolls spread messages on both sides of our political system. You seem to want to make this a right vs left situation. It's moreover Americans vs foreign influence. Additionally, there are facilities where people make comparable salaries to what we Americans make where people create content for social media and online publications. Don't think that much resource would be wasted on something that doesn't matter.

       I'm not making it a right versus left thing, i simply pointed out they bought ads for both sides and it was an insignificant amount, even compared to other foreign influence that's a much bigger problem, like for example China who nearly owns all of Hollywood now. It's only a big deal now because Hillary lost and they needed an excuse to why the spied on the Trump campaign so they rolled out this psyop on the American people.

       All i claimed is google censors it's results to push liberal news and tried to make it sound like i was crazy or something. It's extremely easy to see and pretty amazing that someone who i guess follows real conspiracies would deny it

       So you say it's not a right vs left thing but then go right into why it's right vs left. And surveillance into Trump was because of who Trump decided to do business with. Not like his associates were under watch before his run for President or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how is Google just pushing liberal news then? I can agree to censoring their results to an extent. However, why does Google still allow one to search for alt right sites and material while also supposedly censoring said material? You're making Google into the same construct you put media in that is against your bias it seems.

       Can you better define liberal drivel? It seems from your comment anything but Fox News is liberal, something granted I'd expect from a TD poster but still...

       Insignificant for either side but with a heavy slant towards the right? I'm kinda thinking you are putting commentary on actual news on par with commentary on opinion and propaganda. Can you give an example of said trolls on the left that equate to what we have on the right?

       i don't follow fox news at all so i don't know what you're trying to say by that, my point was they sprinkle one or two fox news articles in as their conservative sources and that's usually it. News that they themselves have branded "fake news" or alt-right" or whatever is nowhere to be found 95% of the time, or it's removed as a top result or suggested video if it get's too much attention.

       So you throw Fox as the example but don't watch said network. What do you label as alt right? I see WSJ and other right leaning publications when i look through news via Google. And if we take your word with merit, so a private company that shares aggregated news has a bias?
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are equating shareblue to trolls? How are they trolling aside from posting left leaning articles? And where is said evidence? I definitely see them as a left leaning publication bit it seems, at least to me, you are labeling blogs as trolling.

       they are a private company with a defacto monopoly on internet searches, along with youtube and Facebook in their respective categories. you really think companies that hold as much power as they do over the internet should be allowed to censor one side according to their own authority? I look at whatever sources I can find, what comes to mind for the "alt-right" labeled stuff i sites like breitbart, infowars, and conservative youtubers, radio shows. MSM claims the majority of these are racist nazis, but when you watch them or look at their sites there is absolutely nothing that suggests that
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes shareblue is trolls, their handbook was leaked online, I'll try to track it down. It went into detail on how to slide discussion on online forums, push their narrative and multitude of other techniques. It was rebranded after they were exposed from CTR to shareblue

       That claim on the majority being racist nazis is a bit over stretching, agreed. However, it's not entirely wrong as said group seems to favor those mentioned alt right sites. The alt sites are more a safe space for said racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Private" companies can do what they want, here "private" being non-governmental. It's not on them for users to get a balanced news diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't put shareblue in the same bucket as trolly alt right sites. Said handbook you are referencing is a response to the unbalanced information situation that existed and still exists. It more or less states that shareblue will act as anti-Trump in the sense of fighting against misinformation spread by said administration. For your view, I can see how they are the enemy as you are a regular on TD. However, it's not quite as radical as what it is in response to.

       Pretty sure conspiracy against the US is in the list of charges. So yea, in a sense as that would be said charge for said collusion.

       And so hold on, now you switch from the surveillance was a conspiracy to it happened but said crimes weren't connected. Not connected as in Trump didn't vet and hire said people to work for his campaign and presidency?

       Like I said there is no charge of Russian meddling and collusion to influence the election, and what has been charged is not connected to Trump. I don't know about the vetting or whatever that's separate issue, the point is the supposed crimes are not related to what the special counsel was created to investigate, they are process crimes

       So conspiring against the US is a process crime? And clearly Trump hiring them, which has to be done with vetting, has nothing to do with how he operates or his campaign because staff isn't important. Clearly hiring criminals for key positions means you yourself are innocent.

       what does people hiding crimes they committed have to do with Trump? you think he can just read their minds and find everything they've ever done? sometimes mistakes are made, let them serve their time if they did it, but it's disingenuous to try to put that on Trump.

       So Flynn, Page, Manafort, all being hired by Trump to work for our country with one being a national security advisor, and also getting jammed up with actual charges, has nothing to do with Trump? So if a manager hires bad employees whole knowing said employees' history means the manager isn't responsible?

       ?? you realize the Flynn thing happened AFTER he was picked as NSA while Trump was Pres. Elect right? The entire deal is he didn't explain exactly what he said on a phone call to FBI agent Strzk (yes the corrupt as fuck one with texts about creating insurance policies and shit. same guy).
      </p>

       Again I ask, which one is charged with conspiring against the US? is it something new or did I miss it?

       page and manafort I don't know much about, but wasn't Manafort a paperwork crime? like he didn't file something by a certain time?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you unknowingly hired a person that killed someone without you knowing, is it then your fault when he get's charged lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be missing my point that none of that has to do with Russian collusion and election meddling which was the entire point in the first place.

       Clearly all of Flynn's sketchy doings didn't stretch before Trump picked him. Not like Obama's admin gave advice to not hire the guy as he as previously fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Page plead guilty to a count of conspiracy against the US. I believe there were some others named but that is the one that comes to mind. Same dude who has FISA surveillance renewed on him for what like 2 years before he was hired by Trump. Manafort got caught up in paperwork initially but I think he has other charges on him now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case I'm fairly certain said manager knew about his employee's skeletons but still hired him anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure that whole conspiracy against the US is the Russian meddling charge you keep asking for. And as I said earlier, gotta wait til the end of the investigation before claiming no charges exist.

       They don't have to be buddy buddy, they both profit from the mass surveillance so it makes sense both would seek it in whichever way possible.

       I'm sure Russia has internet trolls, as I'm sure every other country meddles in every other country's business. Welcome to geopolitics. Russia's influence seems to be incredibly overblown. I'd be incredibly surprised if China didn't have a similar influence, as well as many of our allies. Everyone has a stake in the U.S election, they'd be stupid to not try and interfere. We're just using Russia as the current boogeyman as the middle east has been largely pacified and we always need an enemy.

       I agree we always need a scapegoat, at least that's how our current America seems to be. Russia definitely fits the bill as they have been a longtime guest on the sitcom that is America. However, from what has been gathered from not just US intelligence but from the international scene, Russia has been on the cyber game hard as of late and we, as in the US, seemed to have just ignored it until it became an issue. I think our country "needing" another boogeyman, a trend seen coming from the right as an observation, fell into a lap of convenience.

       So has China, and every other major power in the world. Russia was the one we went with because we have a history of being in conflict with them. If we
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       dug, I'd be surprised if there was a single major power
       <strong>
        not

       found to be interfering with our election. Lord knows at least Israel, China, Russia, and parts of (if not all) of the EU were. I'd be incredibly surprised to find otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's beneficial for everyone else in the world to blame Russia as everyone wants to influence the U.S but no one wants to deal with a pissed off U.S.

       I get the blanket of everyone wants to interfere with the US. However, as I said earlier, Russia is the country that is currently dominating that space. And Russia is the one country we still have a wealth of trade deals on hold with because of sanctions and our foreign policy.

       Good to know that you're smarter than every major economist who can't agree on this, or even come close to an underlying reason. Obama, a democrat, was the first president in history to fail to reach an annual 3% GDP growth.

       This was fun. I really enjoyed how you moved the goalposts completely away from what was being discussed. I'm glad you now admit that Google has plenty of motivation to push for mass surveillance.

       You are incredibly blinded. Democrats aren't peaceful little doves. They vote against things when it looks good for them, not out of principle (as can be seen with the Patriot act). You need to realize that
       <em>
        all

       politicians, except for a very select few, are out for their own good. Not yours. Not mine. Daddy government will always care for itself first which is why I prefer to limit its power.

       It's not exactly what I was led to believe. There's a couple of people with strong language, a few people that probably need to get out more, but that's about it. Hell, I found out that NK says it will consider getting rid of nukes and that Rand Paul is looking to finally have the Fed audited. I haven't seen those bits of news on any other sub.

       Man I'm glad you took the time to look yourself. it is definitely a circlejerk for Trump nonstop, which is a nice break from the majority of reddit, and I don't necessarily agree with everything he does or that is there. But it's nothing like those people would have you believe, it's the same people that claim were all white supremacist Nazis for supporting Trump so ya... lol.

       You know what's funny? I heard about both those things listening to NPR, which is actively demonized on T_D. You know what I don't hear on NPR? That we need to euthanize the right, that any political party is mentally challenged, or that talking about race issues is somehow a Jewish plot.

       Eh, I can hear NPR's bias. They used to not be that way. I read Axios every other day, as that's the most consistent site I have found to date. CNN, Fox, all of those jokers, I'm done.

       I see. I thought there was something wrong with the website. There is a ton of crossover between conspiracy and Donald and they both have people who regularly post dirty things like this. Sometimes they are up for hours even after being reported to a mod there.

       sometime and you'll see how bad some subs can get. The sub is left leaning , meaning either there isn't left related hate at this level or there is a clear bias. It does show the bottom of the barrel though.

       The Donald also hate the rally in Charlottesville stickied even though it was it was organized by white supremacists. And after Heather was murdered they tried to act like they never had promoted it. And still to this day people say Heather died from a heart attack because she was fat and not hit by a car.

       The thing is the Donald shouldn't be an extreme sub. It's 'the official' sub of the president of the United States.

       Is it really the official sub? Surely there's one that's less dramatic.

       Conspiracy, IMO, has been messed up on purpose. It used to be genuinely interesting, and now it devolves into name-calling instead of real debate and research.

       But it makes sense. Try going to r/worldnews and look at the amount of posts pushing the "Russia is the enemy" narrative. The heavy propaganda effort we experience today does remind me of 1984. (and yes I've read it)

       Do you believe Russia is the enemy?

       So what lies has the government spread about our adversarial nature with Russia? The only tie I've seen to 1984 was the false claim that this was the "we have always been at war with Russia" and that doesn't change the fact that it hasn't even been 30 years since the cold war ended, it would be ridiculous to believe that they went from adversary then, to neutral with us now.

       Obviously Russia is an enemy. We made a bunch of eastern euro countries nato right after the Soviet union fell, they're not gonna forget that for a long time. Now we're selling weapons to Ukraine and you think Russia is not an enemy? 300 Russian-Syrian forces were decimated by US artillery a month ago and you think they're not the enemy?

       Yeah... Do you remember 9/11? Whatever your opinion on it being real or an inside job or whatever, politicians and citizens were united in that there needed to be a response of force. Obviously the actions GWB took were... Not good, but its unfair to say he didnt live up to his campaign promises when he had to deal with the largest attack on american soil since pearl harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of your comment, yeah obviously you're not going to get real substantial change from the executive branch. Real change goes through congress, who has checked out of governing altogether. Expecting a President to swoop in and change/fix the country in any long term way is naive. You want change, vote out your undoubtedly courrupt state representatives and vote in someone who can't get bought for a 2,000 dollar check.

       The Russia angle is irrelevant, the concept in the book is complete obedience. It doesn't matter who the war is with, as long as you are always in line with the party line. The point of the book is the folly of being a sycophant, and never questioning anything those in power do or say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this sub has a bit of a problem with hyperbole and an inability to actually read content, instead of going for the most extreme theory and running with that as if its the truth. It is interesting to see how quickly people will fall in line when they are told what they want to hear, and how they refuse to question a theory that they themselves believe to be true.

       Agreed that the concept of the book is complete obedience. Which is exactly why I think banning Russian accounts meant to sow discord in our political system, regardless of how effective they were, isn't anything like the book.

       I think the most important concept is the obliteration of the concept of objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other books and other mediums have done authoritarianism and a totalitarian government, and will do it again. What makes 1984 unique is the fact that the state does not achieve its ends though intimidation or brute force; it simply makes it impossible to keep straight what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doublethink doesn't just mean someone contradicts themselves, it means that a person can believe with all their heart that the are completely dry, while being livid that you splashed them and hold these two thoughts simultaneously without seeing an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       They destroy any objective frame of reference so that there is no way to verify reality, to the point people can't believe their own thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate result of this is that whatever the state say is reality you have to believe. They say 2+2=5. You have no calculators of math books to check with. You can count on your fingers and know that two fingers on one hand and two fingers on the other hand will get you 4 fingers, and 2+2=5. "And" not "but". There is just no contradiction there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian are attempting to do the same thing by though different means. Rather than destroy objective truth they attempt to make truth and lies of equal credibility. Actively discredit reputable sources, while promoting their own websites that they wrote yesterday to say whatever they want. Make enough people think that all news is fake news then you have destroyed any objective frame of reference for reality. They can make any claim they want and people are won't be able to verify what is and isn't real. In stead of being unable to locate a calculator to check if 2+2=5, they throw 100 calculators into the room and tell you they're all shitty broken calculators. They make it harder for people to tell which one is and objective source.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when they say that 2+2=5 they can point to the broken calculator that says that. Then they can say 2+2=8 later, find the calculator that says that, and say the other one was busted. Maybe you can locate the working, objective calculator, but they have already raised so much doubt that you're not sure it that one really is working.

       I get your point and at some level I agree, as the goal is to get people in the position of doubting their own perception of reality. However, I would like to point that the whole end of that book is about them using brute force to break him.

       You're so spot on with some of your analysis, then it falls off the rails. The Russian government is not the only player here. It's not as if corporate news was all factual and then Boris came along to ruin the party. Any accusation against a public figure can be waved away as a Russian trick. That's not nearly good enough. Find out where power intersects.

       The problem is how do you define "Russian Troll" and who gets to decide. We have yet to see any solid evidence of anything they are claiming about Russia. And you're right, the analogy isn't 100% perfect so I guess we can't make the comparison at all, huh?

       Well, I'm taking their claim at face value. If the claim is that they aren't just banning Russian Trolls, then I don't really have any evidence of that, but I would like to see the evidence people have that supports this claim.

       Maybe not a major issue. I think that might be hard to quantify. But I would call Crimea a major thing, and it was only talking about 4 years ago. And the ongoing issues in Syria indicate that we are adversaries and that has been going on for quite some time.

       The only thing I find major about the Crimea situaton in that it was Russian first and had 95.5% support to join Russia in 2014, hence why after the referendum the Crimean leader
       <em>
        applied
       </em>
       to join. Yet funnily enough we talk about it like its some apartheid land grab on the levels of Israel or something lol.

       Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crimea is a place of strategic military importance, especially for Russia. It was part of another country, and had been for over a quarter of a century. This country, Ukraine, was vying to become part of the major alliance with the US. Russia invaded it, without wearing their uniforms, overthrew the government, and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       held a referendum asking what the Crimeans want to do. And most polls put rejoining Russia, admittedly with a plurality of the vote, at only 41%.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that an election where 95.5% (I think the official total was actually closer to 97%) of the people vote one way is likely legitimate, when the polls prior to that put it at 41% and when they allowed no international observers, you are naive. If you think that 95.5% of the people of Crimea want to be part of Russia, when only 33% of Crimea is Russian, you are downright foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't see why this is a big deal, and you can't see the blatant conspiracy staring you in the face, you probably aren't as observant as you like to think yourself. You are probably more about trying to make things fit your narrative, rather than actually objectively looking at what is going on and rationally concluding what is going on.

       Maybe we should stop at the admitted plurality of the vote and end the argument there, no? But then again I want to know what your thoughts are on the original decree from 1954? Disclosed to the people a week
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it was decided behind closed doors, through the front page of a newspaper ad, no less. It was also approved by the Presidium of the Supreme council which did not hold enough seats for the quorum necessary to even pass it, having only 13 of the 27 seats, aka under 50%.
      </p>

       It should never have been illegally stolen in the first place, hence why the plebiscite had such a turnout as it did and the vote went the way it did. Thank goodness the people got what they wanted in the end!

       You've caught yourself in a catch-22. You can't argue that we overthrew a government that was friendly to Russia and then they invaded it back taking something of strategic military value, but that it wasn't a major issue.

       No one said anything about a "purity ring," I was just pointing out the facts, none of which you actually disputed. Even if control of the government was completely orchestrated by the US and Russia, this is just evidence that they are, in fact, a adversary.

       The question wasn't whether or not it was rightful property of Russia or of Crimea. The question was whether or not the annexation of Crimea by Russia was representative of a adversarial nature between the US and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't be silly. Ukraine has been independent
       <em>
        with Crimea
       </em>
       for 25 years. It's no coincidence that Russia took it back once it looked like the Ukraine was going to join NATO. If they really cared about it being their rightful property, why wait 25 years until taking it back? What changed? Oh yeah, the obvious thing, they were losing their influence over them.

       Wow, you can't be serious. There was 123% voter turnout. We have polls from before hand that put support for it at less than half of what they claim to have gotten. You say I'm repeating propaganda, but the motivation for this move was blatantly obvious, the referendum was an obvious sham (123% voter turnout, BTW) and you are defending the move by parroting Russian propaganda. And you accuse me of being a victim of propaganda. This is amazing.

And that was just from the number of seats standpoint. Even if they somehow managed to pass the bill with the actual number of seats required it was constitutionally illegal anyway! A quote to better summarise:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Neither the Constitution of the RSFSR or the USSR Constitution … provide powers of the Presidium Supreme Soviet of the USSR and for the consideration of the changes in the constitutional legal status of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, members of the union republics. In view of the above, the decision adopted in 1954 by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviets of the RSFSR and the Soviet Union on the transfer of the Crimean region of the RSFSR to the Ukraine SSR, did not correspond to the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR and the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So the ruling was made well before a constitutional change granted the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (Advisory) Council the power to carry out transfers of territories. Done and dusted right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you seem to be really invested in the whole 123% voter turnout thing so could you enlighten me with those figures please? Because im scratching my head here. Everywhere shows the plebiscites turnout to be around 80-83%, even on MSM outlets, so im curious as to how your brain is working. Are you merely comparing the overall voter turnout to the Autonomous republic of Crimeas registered voters and not adding on the 300k or so from Sevastopol? Or, (and please tell me its not this) are you referring to the long since retracted yet widely circulated claims of voter turnout based on dodgy statistics given by ITAR-TASS? After reading through it would seem(i cbf editing) that you are indeed basing it off the aforementioned, as it was ITAR-TASS who originally peddled the incorrect 123% claim based on incorrect statistics that claimed there were 1,724,563 voters total as opposed to 1,524,563. They since retracted it but not before forbes and all the other scummy 'news' outlets peddled the disinformation. This is all backed up by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine so we can dispute the figures more if you want you but are absolutely incorrect about the matter and you will not find a modern piece that makes those claims today that hasnt since been retracted. Absolute rubbish this whole conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all the undecided users who couldnt be bothered reading a novel just peruse the internet and search away! Its not hard to find organic real people who are trying to shed light on Crimea since its return to Russia, wether it be through blogs or video etc.... Theres no question as to wether it was the right choice. Which is irrelevant anyway as it was the
       <em>
        peoples
       </em>
       choice.

       You accuse me of spreading propaganda, but you are posting what is effectively a propaganda arm of the Russian government that says "life's great in Crimea now!" LOL.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep telling yourself that the referendum that got 97% of the vote, despite it never polling above 70% before, when no intentional observers were allowed, was legitimate and that this wasn't a big deal.

       You are correct I got the number wrong. I came across it and its since been corrected.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so what? My other points still stand, 97% after no polls put it above 70% and no one was allowed to observe should be obviously suspicious to anyone. Even polls since then do not put it above 82%. And none of this changes the fact that you are still using a Russian propaganda paper to support your position. And none of this changes the fact that Russia, once it looked like Ukraine was going to join NATO, "secretly" invaded the area and overthrew the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can argue for days whether or not they should belong to Russia or Ukraine, and it's not even necessarily that I disagree with you on that, but the reality is that this was a big deal and trying to play this off as some kind of democratic "will of the people" is just propaganda of the Putin backed overthrow of that government. Trying to downplay this event as not evidence of a strong adversarial nature between the US and Russia is even weaker.

       They still have more nukes than anyone aside from the US, so from an existential perspective they are and have been a major political issue in the past decade. Just because they haven't been front and center in your news consumption doesn't make them a 3rd tier concern to US foreign policy.

       A) No one has provided a shred of evidence that this is actually the case and B) this sub is a perfect example of that not happening.

       Holy fuck, are you new to poli sci?  Please explain to me how a statist dictatorship is socialism?  It's not, isms are tools for shaping state not states themselves.  Socialistic tendencies have yet to blow up Norway, what's going on there?  Just because you can regitate northamerican political tradition understandings does not it so in the rest of the world.  Don't even try UK politics you'll see dirty commies everywhere.

       So as much as I'd like to throw out those character attacks as you clearly expect that, I would rather ask a question. When was the last time you read through 1984? And can you explain the actual relation to a private company deciding what user content to display?

       OK, I will entertain your troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parallels and similarities revolve around the censoring of differing  opinions and thought. In 1984, one was not allowed to speak or even think about anything that was not approved ministry of truth content. What the fear is on reddit, is that reddit, although a private company, might shut down differing opinions at the governments behest. That one might be punished for questioning the status quo. That is the similarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I never go around throwing out 1984 references as I don't feel it is a convincing argument to others. Realize, that for the bulk of redditors, this is about "the donald" subreddit. Its not. Banning that subreddit wouldnt solve the problem. The users would just move into other subreddits, escaping the containment of their subreddit, spreading their messaging in a way we cant easily ignore it. Given that it wouldn't solve "the problem", and that it wouldn't be effective in any way, I don't feel its an important first step. And what is the second and third steps when this first step doesn't work? I think banning all bots, even the "good ones" and then individual users is a better approach, but even that is problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do see danger in silencing people. I think we are seeing the effects of people being silenced for the last 20ish years in many many ways. Silencing people doesnt change minds. Silencing people further isolates them from society. They will never change and only get worse and more extreme if they get kicked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, reddit says that in their mass cleanup, they got rid of detectable bad actors (probably bots or the more extreme users). They say the rest are regular people who unwittingly were influenced by the bad actors. Well, how do you deal with that? I haven't seen one redditor who wants reddit Admins to "do more" actually come up with options. They are stuck on the idea that simply banning the Donald will work. So how does banning the Donald solve the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize that the Russian influence campaign didn't create sentiments in a vacuum. It was effective because it used real feelings and sentiments of the populous and amplified it. Its reminds me of the rust belt who formally voted for obama, turning to trump. They didnt do so "because of russia". Its possible that Russia was the only entity paying attention to how they felt though. The Democrats certainly missed the boat. They were "surprised"  that blue collar workers were even angry at their policies. So shutting down "dissent" speech is dangerous. You are not going to solve the problem of disenfranchisement by further isolating and ignoring people. Their sentiments are real. Its not "fake Russian news". If Russia amplified it, its still not "fake Russian news". These are real people with real feelings that Democrats took for granted and therefore ignored as a segment of their voting base they really should have been listening too. Same with Bernie voters. There is a big danger in the DNC chaulking up the last election to "Russia". Its a scapegoat that doesnt address the real sentiments of much of their base. Furthermore, the blame game, calling these people stupid over and over,  blaming them for Clinton's loss is only further disenfranchising them.  Its not solving the problem with how people feel, if anything, it confirms everything that made them want "change" to begin with. Don't forget, people wanted Bernie to run in 2012. The feelings were already there society. Banning the Bernie subreddits wouldn't be an effective to get these democrats back under the DNC tent, right? It would just further silence and ignore them.

       And the two party system is a lie anyway. The people on either side of governments are educated together, are in the same clubs and sit on the boasts of directors of the same companies.

       Which part of the government, though?  The Trumpistas form a minority party even within the realm of the GOP.  You cannot begin to suggest that the vast bulk of the US government supports Trump just because he is POTUS.  Many (most?) are anti-Trump, often viciously anti-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when it comes to censorship, is it the tiny Trumpista faction, or the bipartisan anti-Trump coalition that is literally
       <em>
        everyone else in government?

       To be fair, I don't personally think "the government" is sponsoring or directing this censorship.  More that ideologically-aligned people in both the public and the private sector are working in parallel to achieve a common goal.

       It’s been years since I’ve read the book, but I am a fan of Orwell. I think the most relevant parallel people are bringing up is the manipulation of assess to information by those in power as a key way to control the masses. If I remember correctly Winston’s whole job was to rewrite books to fit the government’s current narrative. I believe being in possession of a book that was not government approved was illegal as well. Today, in the digital hour, we don’t have to burn and rewrite books, those in power can just digitally change the information we have access to and most will blindly follow. They even have online sources to confirm that only their “facts” are true (I.e. Snopes).
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘Tech companies are private companies’ is one thing you brought up, but that is not necessarily relevant to comparison to the book. Yes, the government as a whole in the book fills the role of  ‘Big Brother/TPTB’ but in reality TPTB are thought by most here to be a combination of people (namely: the deep state, Soros, Rothschilds, big media etc.) We know that many tech industry giants like Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt (Facebook/google) where working directly with the dnc/Clinton/deep state machine, and in our world those are the people who have control over the information/narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe what OP is referring to is Reddit (another tech giant) branding those with voices of decent “Russian trolls” as a way of silencing opposing opinions and maintaining control of the public’s access to information so that it aligns with the  agreed upon narrative of TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this age we don’t have to burn books or imprison people for their opinion to control access to information- we can just delete (or change) comments and posts, we can just call things that don’t fit the narrative “hate speech” and call people who challenge it “Russian Troll”.

       Orwell was too heavy handed for the actualities of human nature.  Even yourself here, too heavy handed with your assumptions and acceptance of a perspective as truth.  It's more interesting than that, try brave new world, then prometheus rising then come back.  This kind of censorship isn't even close to 1984, and your acceptance of the deep state boogeyman is pretty close to 2+2=5.

       Dude, I’m just responding to someone’s comment about the parallels between Reddit censoring and the book 1984. I’m not saying it’s to the same level, I’m saying there are similarities.

       Last I checked this was the conspiracy sub, we regularly hypothesize about everything from entities like the deep sate or bilderberg or other secret societies, to the existence of the supernatural or extraterrestrial influence on the building of the pyramids. If you’re going to mock my statements, and claim a conspiracy I’m considering  is “2+2=5”, maybe this isn’t he place for you.

       I miss the days when this place was about having a dialogue and finding the truth together, not attacking people personally and  just shooting down any post you don’t agree with.

       So... exactly what is happening in the real world? Lol. The argument was never that "there is a secret society that has existed from day one". The argument is that oligarchies and "deep state"-style control is perfectly in line with every thing history tells us about human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       You yourself have just listed a fraction of the numerous examples that show that it is perfectly natural and overtly commonplace for humans to seek power and consolidate their power at the expense of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because every form of rule, throughout history, has collapsed or eroded over time, does not mean that it isn't part of human nature to build exclusive structures of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the ancient Greek oligarchs didn't have the boosted ability to spread propoganda that the internet provides. They didn't have nearly as extensive a capability as to gather data on everyone's online activities, television habits, porn habits, tax records, etc. They didnt have the ability to monitor phone calls, internet searches, read emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if anything, the state of technological advancement has empowered the power-seeking side of human nature for those who wish to capitalise on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, really, it's up to you to demonstrate that power-seeking people don't exist, and that it would be impossible for them to utilize the things I mentioned, plus many, many other things, in order to establish secretive oligarchich control over industry and politics.

       Oh hell yeah I'm coming back to respond to this, at work, but I can tell you don't understand my argument.  As for your technology example you're dead wrong and I'll list the Zheng as examples, information was WAY easier to control in insulated societies, it's how we got religions.

      <p>
       Riiiight... And that that information was so easily controlled is why every religion is fractured into competing groups with differing beliefs, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Religions are just a system of control; people, in keeping with their human nature, often seek to co-op these systems for their own gains in power. So, again, exactly what ive been saying. And, gee, I wonder
       <em>

       people would attempt to insulate a state's population from a diversity of information? It must be because it's

       human nature for a ruler to insulate himself against dissent.... right? Makes sense.

       I've read and enjoyed 1984. Here are some parallels I make: like Oceania spying on its citizens, the big companies monitor their customers' behavior and use it, like the Ministry of Truth, to censor the news or change them through "Newspeak" words.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can compare big communities to countries. You can compare admins to leaders. You can compare authoritarian communities to 1984.

       Reddit (and most other big online communities) don't want to get rid of ALL propaganda, they just choose which one they allow. Like in 1984.

       1) Corporations are granted charters by government and therefore function as agents of the government.

Yes, we have "choice," but the choice is largely meaningless.  You can shop at Target or Walmart, the choice is yours.

       That's not how charters work. The charters show that they meet the state and federal standards to establish a business. By your logic, every single corporation (no matter how big or small) is an agent of the government.

       It makes complete sense that this is out of 1984. You should read some of the other comments below here. I particularly enjoy this one via u/Grinfader

       <p>
        I've read and enjoyed 1984. Here are some parallels I make: like Oceania spying on its citizens, the big companies monitor their customers' behavior and use it, like the Ministry of Truth, to censor the news or change them through "Newspeak" words.

        You can compare big communities to countries. You can compare admins to leaders. You can compare authoritarian communities to 1984.

       First, we are narrowly talking about the removing of Russian bots, which is what the OS is about. So bringing in the "spying on its citizens" is a red herring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling this "an authoritarian community" because they ban some, as you admit (or at least the argument you quoted admitted), propaganda is quite a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       And claiming that what they did in 1984 to "not getting rid of all propaganda" is a ridiculous oversimplification. They banned and removed all dissenting views. It's not hard for me to look around reddit and see plenty of people dissenting to this very action, and to what is considered the major belief system of reddit (from this sub reddit).

       "Russian Bots" can easily be seen as an excuse. I actually has some eastern European friends, including my first ever job was at a metalwork company owned by a Russian Jew (owners son is still my friend) there are actual russian redditors who are not bots.
      </p>

       As you can see, we can create some sort of "excuse" and blow it up as a reason to purge those we don't like

       It's not a stretch, its literally the beginning of a purge of "those who the tech companies don't like under the guise of ______(Enter excuse here). In this case, the Purge is happening on Google, Twitter, FB, YouTube's Purge started last week, and lo and behold, Reddit's purge is also coinciding with the purge of the other Tech Companies. Context is everything.

       Because the formula goes like this:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.

       <p>
        Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

       If its "Just Russian Bots" then no one will bat an eye, because majority are not Russian bots, while they can also systematically scoop up a few of the biggest dissenters on reddit (highest karma, most active, a mod here or there, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after "Russian Bots" Reddit is already discussing banning T_D, r/uncensorednews, complaining that r/news mods are leftists like r/politics, and I think you can see where this is going.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are simply seeing step 1: First they came for the russian bots, but I did not speak out because I was not a Russian Bot

       However, avoiding facebook reddit and youtube is easy, you simply don't type them into your address bar and go somewhere else. While, for the vast majority of Americans, it is either a monopoly or a duopoly, and avoiding Comcast or Verizon is near impossible.

       Careful or they will "unperson"...err...shadowban you for thoughtcrime.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perverse sort of way its actually funny when Admins have to resort to shadowbanning because they know that it fully justifies a user coming back with alt accounts and then
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       engaging in a blazing hellstorm of mischief.  When Admins shadowban, they are just "cutting off their nose to spite their face" because they take  one problem and turn it into a dozen problem "hydra" when the person eventually discovers their supposedly "clever" tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, shadowbanning
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       waste the time of someone misbehaving, but in a war of attrition with "time wasting" as the goal, there will simply never be enough Admins to outnumber the angered users they are creating.  They are fighting a losing battle.

       tfw 1984 is about the government completely controling the masses and not a private business running a website banning people that don't adhere to their moral beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea what youre talking about, these sites can block/ban/do whatever they want in the realm of their own forum. the simple answer is, if you dont like the way a website/business is treating you, then stop using the service. Citing 1984 makes you look ignorant.

       I disagree. We're not talking about small forums but giant communities who have a huge impact on culture. Sure, you can stop using Google/Facebook/Reddit/Twitter, but you will probably become an outcast. Internet presence is getting more and more important. If you're an artist, or a programmer, or a small company owner or a million other occupations, you almost need to be a part of these communities. This need will grow, though the companies themselves may change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communities transcend geopolitical borders. Our actual nationalities are becoming less and less relevant. We don't care if the people we chat daily with are from another country as long as they're our brothers from our beloved subreddit/fb group/hashtag. Online communities are the countries of tomorrow.

       So then really your argument is that web forums are either more important than the government, or should be run by a government body? I disagree on both these viewpoints for a few reasons, more importantly, Reddit is privately owned and matter-of-factly doesn't owe you or your viewpoints shit. I'm not happy with that being reddits future, and you can do whatever you want with that information, but at the end of the day thats how it is.

       The difference is you waive your rights on this site. They have full control to do what they wish, as it is in their EULA. If you don’t like it, don’t participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If for whatever reason they began doing this, it isn’t the government doing it so your rights aren’t being violated. It’s a private company exercising their right over their domain.

       r/russia is particularly aggrieved by spez's announcement that reddit will be hunting high and low for hidden Russian trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dominant media corporations - Fkbook, twitter, youtube, reddit are the non-governmental versions of China's censorship, which in the west absolves them of any kind of free speech adherence; we're a private company we can do what we want.
      </p>
      <p>
       China is leading the way for where the internet is really going. And it ain't free interaction and mingling of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       European countries have passed laws against hate speech. China recently banned the N. When does N become ----&gt; hate speech and therefor ----&gt; banned by corporate social media platforms who can allow or censor anything they choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be sure that's exactly where all of this is headed.

       It is funny that I give people firsthand sources and still get attacked.   There is a video of Obama saying it is not possible to rig the election.  Of course, he said this when he was sure Hillary would win.  The ironic thing is Obama and Hillary tried to rig the election.

       I remember when it looked like Hillary was going to roll Trump right over in the polls, and Obama came out and said it was not possible for foreign interference in the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       She lost and all of a sudden it's the Russians that did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no proof they had anything to do with it, but the hypocrisy is amazing. The USA has meddled with so many elections around the world to bring a favourable outcome to them, but will happily blame another country on an election loss because it didn't suit their agenda.

       The USA were the ones who put Boris Yeltsin in power FFS, they even bragged about in on the front on Time Magazine.

       Yup. The intelligence agencies have lied to us to further their own agenda so many times you'd have to be a fool to take them at their word about anything. I don't believe anything that comes from them until I see the proof with my own eyes. How many times must one be burned before they stop putting their fucking hand on the stove?

       Apparently something so incriminating that all parties lied on their forms when swearing into public office. It's being investigated now and no amount of shilling is gonna stop it. I think they have 5 indictments so far. That's more than any investigation you can name in all of US history.

       You going to just run this in circles?  America had been circling Syria like a vulture for 5 years before that attack with no solid way in.  Why would Assad do the one thing that would vindicate American intervention in a war he was winning?  The only parties who would have benefited from that gas attack were America, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.  You're a fool if you think we wouldn't have done it ourselves to get on the ground there.  You don't think a shill would just hit the report button and this stupid fucking argument?

       Nice grammar, comrade.

       Anyway, your argument is ridiculous. Anything that could be construed as serving America's interests couldn't possibly have happened? So nothing in history that has ever served American interests has ever happened? WWII ending was just a smokescreen? The Cold War never happened or never ended?
 You're ridiculous.

       Fair enough...assume just for the sake of discussion that that was real...one point against Russia...now how about mentioning the multitude of points against Israel?  Did bombing school children with white phosphorus help the cause of peace any?  Has kidnapping, torturing and threatening children with rape...calmed things down?  Russia couldn't begin to catch up with Israel in terms of civilian violence.

       Jesus, you're daft.

       Because our current administration says so.  If it wasn't ok then they would in force sanctions on them to show that this action won't be tolerated.

       I'm being facetious btw... I agree with you.  All countries will strive to enforce their wills on others.  It's only the secure ones that can stand up to the bullies (even if they are bullies themselves).

       To be clear: Obama remarked it was not possible to rig election in response to Trump saying that if he lost they should investigate Hillary for rigging the election (since she is so corrupt). This was prior to the Russia allegations surfacing.

       Yes, but the poster, I believe unless I missed something Obama said, tried to spin the "rig" comment into "interfere," presumably to make their point that this was only made up after they lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a lot of evidence that Obama had been warned about this prior to those comments.

       Yes, and most everyone has long accepted the result, but are just saying we need to stop it from happening again. Trump was calling into the question the legitimacy of the election before it even had happened and Obama did give the sound advice to him to stop whining... But he still hasn't stopped.

       I've had people use this "tactic" on me (provide sources) and (although sometimes they are solid references) many times it is simply an appeal to an authority that reports false information.  It is all well and good to look for hidden information, but the appeal to believe something
       <strong>
        only because
       </strong>
       it is uncommon is a dangerous one.

       All information must be critiqued equally.  Burden of proof is on

       Pure silliness...burden of proof is only...and always only...upon the one making the affirmative assertion.  There are no exceptions to this...except perhaps among "debates" between mental asylum patients, but I'll not speculate on where you learned this "burden of proof is on everyone" idea.

       Who is making the "affirmative assumption"?  Answer: you are.  Online there is no third party athority that needs to be convinced.  It is always and only you and the person that disagrees with you.  In their mind, they are right and you are "making the affirmative assumption".

       Moving on to your claim about "no third party..."   You are aware that these posts are viewable by the public and are not private communications...right?

       Remember when they also said that we MUST accept the outcome of the election? And that we should not be divisive but move forward as a country? Yeah, fucking hypocrites. I completely regret voting for Obama. Pulling shit like making American propaganda to other countries legal in America and pulling Section 8 criminals from Chicago to Des Moines Iowa because it needed to be more vibrant. He will be proven to have been a corrupt, anti-American piece of shit.

       Trump was saying in 2016 that Clinton was going to rig the election with illegal votes and that if he didn't win they would challenge it. Clinton and Obama said that obviously wasn't true, and that whatever the election outcome was, they would accept the result in that context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's two years later and we know that the election was being influenced by a foreign government. Trump's win may indeed be less than "legitimate". Especially since we've also learned that Russian hackers had access to the voter rolls in many swing states.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, nobody is talking about declaring his win to be illegitimate and throwing him out if office and installing Clinton. We've still all accepted, including Clinton, that Trump is president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes you learn new information that causes you to change your stance on an issue. That doesn't make you a hypocrite.

       Just like you're about to learn that the intelligence communities you've been bandying about have come out and said Russia had to material influence on the outcome of the election and while they attempted to access voter rolls, none were changed. Are you under the impression that Russia hacked DNC servers and released truthful information that helped the public make a more informed choice? Even though I'd kinda appreciate that effort, I can see an argument where that's distressing on a national security level. The democrats don't think so though, because they refused multiple times to turn that server over for investigation by the FBI. Huh.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know many illegals we're registered to vote and some did, though a full investigation hasn't been performed. We also know loads of dead people seem to be big fans of the democrat party, and we have from the horses mouth from the dem NYC voting commissioner how they bus people around and fuck the system in that was. We have video of Scott foval admitting to fucking the republicans by cheating and that they'll be damned if they ever stop. There's also the question of why Soros owns 2/3 of electronic voting machines and why those machines are programmed with the ability to give individual votes a decimal point tally.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm sorry bub, but there were many legitimate questions going into this highly contentious winner takes all election. The sort of "meddling" you're referring to from Russians (and Chinese and whoever else) was known about by Obama when he made the statements we're referencing them. At the time though, they were certain Hillary was going to win so they didn't want to cast any doubt in the results if she did.

       Let's be clear in what they're saying. The IC doesn't think, according to what they've said publicly, that votes were changed or that voter rolls were altered, but they do think that Russia was involved in an influence campaign in the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the first hand accounts of people showing up to vote only to be told they weren't registered when days before that they checked and
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       registered, I think the IC has been slowly revealing more and more information about the depth of the hacking in order to not cause a mass panic by dumping what they know all at one time.

       That's the thing about propoganda; it often does have elements of truth in it.

       They had it privately investigated by a company that specializes in that kind of work. Should they have also had the FBI look into it? Probably, but then people like you would just say "well of course James Comey agreed with the DNC line" and so it wouldn't really make a difference either way would it?

       To be clear, he wasn't "admitting to something he and the democrats did together," so it isn't really "from the horse's mouth". He's alleging that other people do it. So okay, one dude claims that other people do something they shouldn't be doing. If he has proof, he should provide it so it can be stopped. Does he have proof? No, of course not. But all project Veritas has to do is find one idiot with a D next to his name that is willing to say some crazy shit and then that's immediately proof to you of a conspiracy to rig an election.

      <p>
       Yes, but NOT BY THE PUBLIC. He made those statements to the public in a way that the context of the situation at the time would only imply the specific meaning of a response to what Trump was saying. Trump was saying, "Clinton is going to rig the election via voter fraud". Obama responded to that, saying, "No she's not, it's basically impossible to rig an election that way". He wasn't saying
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       about Russia in that quote. This is like taking somebody in 1968 saying "we've never been to the moon" as proof that the moon landing in 1969 didn't happen. The context of the quote clearly implies that Obama was talking about Trump's claims of voter fraud. Not outside election interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time though, they were certain Hillary was going to win so they didn't want to cast any doubt in the results if she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, that claim was more fun when

       "Influence" is such a vague term that its meaningless. I influenced the election when I discussed politics with my elderly neighbor. My in-laws from Vietnam influenced the election when they told my family that they liked Trump. So who gives a shit?

       There no honest people who understand what is going on saying the election was
       <em>
        rigged.
       </em>
       If they are, that is not accurate based on what we know from the facts, or they are misusing the word. At least on a wide scale. It is reasonably possible to "rig" things on possibly a small scale, but even that would be a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument is, and has been for a while, that they have
       <em>
        interfered
       </em>
       with the election. They have manipulated social media to sow confusion and division among americans and distrust of major institutions, allowing people to be free to believe whatever they want.

      <p>
       The ironic thing is that we have a lot of strong evidence of an actual conspiracy here, the Russians using fake accounts to sow distrust in the American population, and this sub rejects it as fake. However, ridiculous claims about Obama and Clinton trying to rig the election, for which there which there is no evidence, get upvotes.

       Another reading of the facts would be that the IRA was exploiting the polarization of opinions in the US (which existed long before 2016) to generate demographically distinct audiences through sensationalist click baiting in an effort to peddle them to advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Mueller's Russian troll indictment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Defendants, posing as US. persons and creating false U.S. personas, operated social media pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and pages, which addressed divisive US. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by US. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by Defendants. Defendants also used the stolen identities of real U.S. persons to post on social media accounts. Over time, these social media accounts became Defendants' means to reach significant numbers of Americans ...
       </p>

      <p>
       And now the kicker:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Defendants and their co-conspirators also used the accounts to receive money from real U.S. persons in exchange for posting promotions and advertisements on the ORGANIZATION-controlled social media pages. Defendants and their co-conspirators typically charged certain U.S. merchants and U.S. social media sites between 25 and 50 U.S. dollars per post for promotional content on their popular false U.S. persona accounts, including Being Patriotic, Defend the 2nd, and Blacktivist.

       In the context of a commercial marketing scheme, the fact that the online activities ran long after the election, the fact that the ads and tweets were not universally anti-Hillary nor pro-Trump, the fact that the entire budget for the scheme was laughably small compared to billions spent domestically on the election, and the fact that everything was so amateurish and easily traceable all suddenly make sense.

       The reason the Russian trolls stuff was so sensationalist and polarized was not because they were trying to sow discord and division--it was because that's what fucking clickbait has to be to work.

       Doesn't "rigging the election" include registering non-Americans to vote, and then having them vote?

      <p>
       "The ironic thing is that we have a lot of strong evidence of an actual conspiracy here, the Russians using fake accounts to sow distrust in the American population, and this sub rejects it as fake."  The Russians did not do this, and, even if they did, it is not illegal.  There is Free Speech and Freedom of the Press, and it is no longer illegal to give propaganda to the American people.

       Rigging is registering non-Americans as voters, and then letting them vote.  Rigging is also allowing access to the Soros controlled election machines so the votes can be changes or discarded.

       I don’t know whether to upvote or downvote this. On the one hand I believe in a company’s ability to refuse their service, on the other hand I believe in people first amendment right and right now Reddit and YouTube are by far the most popular platforms, in text and video formats respectively, for people to voice their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       With YouTube hiring the SPLC to police their content they basically flaunted their bias. I mean come on, MAC, James Yeager, and a number of other gun channels being banned or striked / flagged right after the introduction of the SPLC, but no strikes for jake Paul Logan Paul etc? Yeah fucking right. Not to mention the InfoWars channel being striked for their crisis actor James Hogg video. It’s so obvious that they’re showing bias. Yes it’s disgusting content but it’s also free speech, they’re not inciting violence or releasing anything but his name and face thatve been plastered on pretty much every news outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m afraid for the future of society and our first amendment. I’d go as far to say all the assaults on the second amendment are distractions from our first amendment rights being stripped away.

       Orwell was a socialist when he was young and fought on that side in the Spanish Civil War. But like a lot of socialists/liberals when you grow up and hit 40, the whole narrative falls apart. 1984 and Animal Farm are basically Orwell's rejection of socialism.

       Thank you for that - that
       <em>

       a great article. You should post it to this sub, in fact.

        Still, you might say, it's all true! Russia did try to meddle in our election! We really are facing a foreign threat!

       <p>
        That might very well be. But the realness of a foreign threat in no way precludes Americans' ability to make a total cock-up of their response to it.

       I looked up the Ten GOP tweets and it just parroted whatever any Conservative says during an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimmy Dore, who's firmly on the left, looked into the "troll farm" and it was just a clickbait site pandering to the right posting shit like "six most controversial NASCAR drivers, number 1 will surprise you".

       The VP of advertising at Facebook said there were no significant as buys from Russia until after the election.

       I'm seeing a lot of accusations, what I'm not seeing is evidence Russia moved the needle in any significant way, especially in comparison to say Breitbart or CNN, who gave Trump wall to wall 24/7 coverage.

       I just find it hilarious that you retards still think Trump is doing anything resembling "draining the swamp" or going against the establishment. They love him. He's a braggadocious manchild that is too busy Tweeting on the shitter to understand what's going on around him. Too busy dividing Americans with his rhetoric to realize the shady shit going on in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "the establishment is shaking in their boots!" shtick is hilarious. I really wonder how far you can bury your heads in the sand before it finally becomes too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile he makes a comment about becoming President for life like is happening in China AND confiscating guns without due process and his supporters still slob on his knob. If that was Obama y'all would be out in the streets rioting for fucks sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a billionaire conman with billionaire conman friends, who have spent their entire lives looking after themselves and stepping on the little guy. Trump is entrenched in the establishment and has no intentions of "draining the swamp". They're not terrified of him, he's their useful idiot that takes all the flak for their fucked up policies.

       Please elaborate on how they influenced the election. Was it influencing both sides? If they were sharing content that somebody agrees with and shared anyway, what is the problem?

       Remember when you said the Russians didn't even intervene? Remember when you said everybody who believes Russia interfered is a shill? Remember when the President said this is all hogwash? Remember when you got the news that they really did and you changed your tactic to "but they didn't do that much".

       The Cold War has been over for a long time, but the media and its globalist handlers are trying to reignite it. The International Deep State and their ultra-wealthy globalists are 1000X more of a threat than Russia is. Sure, Russia isn't an ally, but you've got your priorities all wrong. Don't fall for their tricks and propaganda, please.

       Oh i forgot that after decades of bad blood that it all disappears because we decided the cold war is over. If you don't think Russia and China and even European nation's have thier hands in here just as much as shareblue you're a fool. I can't blame you for thinking shreblues the bigger problem though, the enemy at home usually is more dangerous than the enemy abroad.

       I'd be a fool if I said that no Russian/Chinese/Iranian whatever trolls ever come to English-speaking forums. I agree that they probably do. I, personally, think that their influence and presence is vastly overstated, and yes, that the enemy at home (and especially the international globalists and capitalists that have no allegiance to any country) are a much, much bigger threat. That's all.

       So what social network will everyone use if the top dogs of our favoured network crush freedom of speech?

       At the rate we are going, it won't be long before we have to have some sort of chip implant into our brains, and if we think negatively or outside of the box we get fined or arrested (obviously I am over exaggerating, or am I?)

       If they decide to ban users thinking they're bots but are actually human users, would you still sanction their bans? What if their process in determining who is/isn't a shill is that their talking points coincide with Russian talking points. Does that mean we should invalidate their opinions because we are afraid that human users have the same vale sets as Russians?

       Everyone wants shills gone, but the issue is Reddit controls that then. What if they just say all these people are shills, but they are actually real people that have opposing ideas but say it was bots? What if they use it to only ban the shills they don't agree with?
      </p>
      <p>
       It gives Reddit control to ban who they want while not having to explain it. They can just say it was "Russians" or "bots" and no one would be the wiser.

       We're on a conspiracy sub, so put on your conspiracy hat and try to entertain the thought: 
- How could this policy be abused? 
- Do people in power have a tendency to abuse that power when they stand to gain influence? 
- Do you take everything authority says as the truth, or might the rules be applied unequally or with malicious intent?

       They have distinctive posting patterns you could probably lock down using algorithms. As other people have mentioned, they will farm karma on a few sport or gaming related subs, before switching to hardcore political content. If that behaviour triggers a red flag on reddit's side, they can have somebody manually investigate the origins.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people operate on procedure. They are employees after all, they have supervisors and they have rules. if we can lock down on their tactics then we can suppress their influence on the platform.

       The world used to view the diversity of beliefs to be a strength.  Now they label and/or ban points of view that they disagree with or seem distasteful.  If they keep this up, the only people left on Reddit will be those who agree with each other and those who have differing beliefs will move to a different platform where they share a community of like-minded contributors (like Steemit).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that once this happens on a large scale is that you end up with echo chambers of users who all share like-minded ideas.  Any arguments deviating from the status quo becomes something to shun or ban.  Because these communities do not allow opposing viewpoints progressive thinking stops.  Instead, conversations turn inward and nobody questions anything anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the exact kind of 'divide and conquer' technique used by oppressive governments since the creation of mass media.  What is even more troubling is how many people seem completely OK with it because the media isn't run by "the government".

      </p>
      <p>
       1900s: "You want an 8 hour day and a 40 hour week? You're fired. Enjoy living on the streets."
1910s: "Our soldiers are dying in the trenches and you're sapping morale on the homefront by saying the war is pointless. That's sedition!"
1920s: "The Bolsheviks are taking over. Socialists like you have to be removed!"
1930s: "How dare you suggest that the government and corporations caused the Great Depression!"
1940s: "Why should we fight the Germans? They're the only ones doing something about the Jews and the commies."
1950s: "Heard you whistled at a white woman. Boy, that's the last mistake of your life."
1960s: "Oh, that Martin Luther King. He's just a race-baiting agitator! I hope somebody does something about him."
1970s: "Anybody against the war in Vietnam is a coward and a traitor!"
1980s: "Who cares if a bunch of fags die of this gay disease? They brought it on themselves."
1990s: "Of course we don't want another Vietnam. That's why we need to censor our coverage of this Gulf War."
2000s: "Love it or leave it! If you don't let the government spy on you, the terrorists win!"
2010s: "The only good communist is a dead communist!"
2018: "The world used to view the diversity of beliefs to be a strength."

       I lived through or studied most of what you suggest there, but I am confused on your take on the 2010's.  That quote seems more fitting for the 50's.  I recall lots of talk of walls and borders, immigrants and the greatness of capitalism, but the hatred was directed more at brown people and terrorists than commies.

       The bots were upvoting actual fake news, as in fake facts, not just personal beliefs or opinions. These "facts" were then spread all over social media leading people to believe fake things happened. There is nothing about beliefs, discussion or opinions being banned.

       Try getting a masstagger to see where people post and you will find some insanely sketchy accounts.  Tons.  Most are false positive, but there are so many sketchy shill accounts.  I think it is nice to know who I am interacting with anyway.

       It's not perfect because it acts as a catch all, but you can highlight the tag to see what they were flagged for and make you own calls. Redective is also useful for an overview of an account.

       I believe that there are a lot of actual Russians trolls.  Their banter is easy to spot when compared with normal conversation and discourse.  It only seems logical that Reddit would figure this out as well and do something about it.  This does not have to do with censoring different world views, only removing the weeds.

       They have succeeded in twisting peoples perceptions enough to now completely disregard one of our most fundamental rights right under our noses and its pretty impressive.

       I don't think people see much more than their social media accounts these days. There is an entire planet out there, full of riches, mysteries and beautiful things. On the flip side of course there are countless atrocities committed, starvation, degradation of peoples dignities etc.. that's the way it is. To impose an ideology on people that essentially tells them that there is a right way and a wrong way to think is worse than even the most horrendous thing a free thinking person could ever commit. They are trying to paralyze humankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have truly lost a great deal here. We've lost the art that is human existence and with it the ability to learn and grow on our own accord and of our own mistakes, instead we have manufactured our own version of it and processed the entirety of natural substance out of it.

       Not dissent to popular opinion because it’s hard to say what the popular opinion really is. Instead you will be banned for dissent to views deemed undesirable to reddit and whoever controls the reddit machine. Anyone could be an “other” at any point.

       is rehashing an old TMOR talking point here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been posting from the same handful of sources for a decade now (zerohedge, etc), and all of the sudden I'm a Russian propagandist!
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the sources I use is journal-neo.com, partly because I like their content, and partly because TMOR gets whipped into a frenzy because they are convinced NEO is Russian propaganda and I'm getting paid to spread it (it's not and I'm not).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it's concerning to me that a comment in
       <em>
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
       </em>
       that's accusing the mods of being Russian propagandists (without
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       evidence!) gets 57 upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to accuse us of something so dramatic, you'd better be able to back it up otherwise you're guilty of propagating this manufactured and divisive hysteria.

       he did not. Neither adam carter nor the Forensicator ever walked back a thing. If anything they delved deeper into the metadata to make the proof that Guccifer2.0 was a plant (made to appear like a leak), likely from the DNC through its Crowdstrike IT hit men, essentially bullet-proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing we know for sure is that there was deep collusion between the DNC and Crowdstrike, with the FBI agreeing to look the other way (no checky of no servers). Just as the DC MPD agreed 9were forced) to not investigate the Seth Rich assassination..

       We know the leaker downloaded the information onto a flash drive.  It wasn't a hack at all.  There's plenty of evidence proving Seth Rich was the Wikileaks source.  Julian Assange all but admitted to it when he offered a reward for tips related to the murder.

       Seth Rich is a topic that always brings the shills out in force, which only validates my beliefs about his murder.

       1.) You don't know that, you are basing it on your own co convictions and lack of critical thinking. If I see an incorrect or biased article, I will tell you exactly where they are wrong, and then I will make the claim that they are biased and are "propaganda".
2.) I've heard plenty of these conspiracy theories heavy conservatives and alt righters have put out, but none of them have ever been corroborated or backed up. They are simply stating whatever they feel like and people like you eat them up without ever thinking independently.

       I read the Daily Mail link and this was CNN's comment.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A CNN spokeswoman told the Daily Mail Online the emails are 'completely unremarkable'.
       </p>
       <p>
        'When preparing for interviews we are regularly sent suggestions from rival campaigns and political parties, both solicited and unsolicited,' she said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       'Casting a wide net to ensure a tough and fair interview isn't just common media practice, it's smart.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any proof that this is not standard practice?  For example, that Fox News never did this with RNC? How do we find out, since Wikileaks and Russia only released DNC emails and we don't have RNC emails to read?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think RNC emails will show no "media collusion" as you call it?

       The government (deep state) is what is directly influencing the media via the CIA. Research project mockingbird. Media talking points are all handed out from a single point of contact. When people mention the words "free press" they sure aren't referring to any of these gov controlled propaganda institutions.

       the two primary govt mouth pieces were nyt judith miller and tom friedman, were both passing direct information from rumsfeld and cheney, under the guise of investigative reporting, without any investigating. i dont mean, "sources say," i mean "i'm in iraq and here's what i see." judith miller got a pulitzer for lying. chris hedges, also nyt, really did do investigative journalism and reported that miller and friedman and the admisitration were wrong. he was fired. never rehired. he know has a great show on RT that has gotten him, along with lee camp, branded russian operatives.

       phil donahue had guests on who had direct knowledge of the bs of the WMD lie, he refused to stop airing shows critical of the iraq war build up and was fired. never rehired. his time slot went to rachel maddow.

       Not that exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they HAVE been caught leaking debate questions to hillary clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of there reporters were implicated for collusion in hillary emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimmy kimmel was caught directly colluding with chuck schumer to lie about Healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cnn was caught heavily editing a video of trump feeding fish to make him look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cnn alone was caught lying over 150 times in the first 3 months after tye election.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's quite obvious to everybody that cnn regularly colludes with the democrat party to push false stories

       No, the reporters contacted her campaign about a story they were going to publish anyway so they can add the comment to the story. They do it with all news subjects, including Fox News with Republicans.

       Seth Rich was behind the DNC email leaks.  That's plainly obvious to anyone who spends the time to research it.  His murder had nothing to do with a botched robbery because nothing was stolen.  His murder has all of the marks of a professional hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC would love for the Seth Rich story to go away, but eventually more evidence will come out.  Seth Rich was murdered, and I'll bet the orders came from someone at the top of the DNC.

       CNN and Fox are both bad, but not equally bad imo. Studies have verified this as well tbh, Fox News makes you LESS informed than watching nothing, which is pretty sad. They both lie and manipulate the truth, but Fox definitely does so to a greater degree.

       As every reliable study shows the OPPOSITE

      <p>
       that Republicans are MORE informed than democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       That democrats watching cnn are LESS informed.

       In fact according to politifact : fox has only gotten 60 things wrong EVER

       Compared to cnns avg of 50 lies a month.

       I’ve seen the study he’s referencing and you clearly have seen the study he’s referencing since you commented to refute it. So transitively I think we can both agree we are talking about the same thing. So while I could ask him to provide sources, we already know his source. Now I’m asking because you’re making points with no commonly known source.

       So you're gonna go with the one Pew study from 2007? Because that's the only study I can find going that way.
       <br/>
       I can find about a dozen going the other way, including one published in a
       <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272715000523">
        peer-reviewed economics journal in 2015
       </a>
       . That study found that Fox News viewers were more knowledgeable about pro-Republican topics, but less knowledgeable about pro-Democrat topics in a way that actually averaged out to zero.
       <br/>
       The other issue is that this wasn't about Republicans vs. Democrats, but Fox News vs. CNN. That same study found that
       <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2007/04/15/public-knowledge-of-current-affairs-little-changed-by-news-and-information-revolutions/">
        viewers who relied solely/primarily on Fox News scored lower than individuals who relied solely/primarily on CNN

       I’m dead ass serious when I say this. My co worker has been stressed and dealing with anxiety for a while, her doctor told her not to watch CNN anymore (her normal news channel) because they literally only talk about bad shit. She said he referred to it as “doom and gloom”. She stopped watching and her anxiety has died down. Take that how y’all will but it’s an honest to god story.

       I believe it. Watching the news at all is linked to higher levels of anxiety. The world is a shitty place. So is regularly viewing Facebook and listening to Christmas music.

       What a ridiculous load of bullshit.  FOX and CNN are both bad, but no one is worse than CNN.  They are basically the propaganda wing of the Democrat Party at this point, and cannot be taken with any level of seriousness.

       That sounds like propaganda, and I don't buy it for a second.  I wouldn't trust any so called, "study" without following the money behind it.  There's no significant difference between the quality of their programming. Their views on the issues are different, and that's what tends to dictate who watches their shows.

       They do more research than just reports and comments by users. The admins can easily find out where accounts are connecting from. This is circumvented by VPN of course but they can also track activity and frequency that align with some known accounts. Also, if what OP claims is true they would have used that logic to crush the_donald saying all the moderators were Russian operatives. Peter Thiel would never let that happen and the sad truth is that sub is Poe’s law like a motherfucker.

       [–]Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho 66 points 23 hours ago 
What signs do you look for when looking for them? Do they frequently phrase stuff in a similar way?
      </p>
      <p>
       [–]todayilearned83 116 points 23 hours ago 
I'm not going to tell them how they're messing up, but I will tell you I look for patterns and phrasing is one of them.

I love that dumbfuck mods are basically admitting they ban people for phrasing things weirdly. Also, isn't Reddit a website on the internet, which people from all over the world can connect to? Why do you think it's ok to ban people for speaking oddly?

       I have no doubt mods will abuse this because mods can be so easily corrupted by the power they have over their communities. I was talking about site wide, admin handled bans and IP bans. Those are reviewed and tracked. Flagged a few for myself when I noticed the same account spamming the headlines from RT and Infowars over and over and most but not all have gone dark since 2018 started.

       Mods even on here will permaban people for posting something like that based on Rule 10 of the sub, so I don't know why you're acting surprised on being banned and why you're complaining.

       I'm not complaining about the ban, look at the attitude of the mod.  They sound like something out of this subreddits comment section: "Oh they phrased that weird, obviously a russian bot".  It's idiotic to think someone could get banned because english is their second language; or the idea that no one from Russia can participate in reddit comment threads without being employed by the FSB.

       I don't think they really think you're a Russian bot, I think half the comments are tongue in cheek there, if you did not attack the mods you probably would not have been banned so easily. You just gave them an easy justifiable(to other mods, if you appeal) reason to ban you.

       Again, maybe someone can run an experiment where they make posts like yours, but not attack the mods like you did, and then check if they get banned. Your case is tainted because you broke the sub's rules against mod attacks.

       How do you feel about Trump's sexual harassment, assault, paying prostitutes for sex, trying to fuck his friends wife? If you're sickened by Biden being a hugger but not an actual sexual preditor, the that sick feeling is you your mental disease.

       I know how reddit has been changing and they are trying to have so much control that I know that they have an agenda. We need to have an alternative to reddit. voat.co could be a possibility but there are a lot of trolls there. I think in the future people will be going back to message boards, Reddit is just turning to shit. It's not what it used to be.

       Because the Alt in alt-right means that you're more right than far-right. It's extremist in nature. Adding the fact that alt-right so have literally been committing mass murder and Kelly Ann Conway dubbed the term Alternative facts to try and justify lies and you get your answer.

       I can't find a single pop culture reference to the phrase before this, and if there is it certainly wouldn't change my point and the fact would remain that she popularized it. Being pedantic and disingenuous won't change actual facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Alternative facts" is a phrase used by U.S. Counselor to the PresidentKellyanne Conway during a Meet the Press interview on January 22, 2017, in which she defended White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false statement about the attendance numbers of Donald Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. When pressed during the interview with Chuck Todd to explain why Spicer "utter[ed] a provable falsehood", Conway stated that Spicer was giving "alternative facts". Todd responded, "Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods."[1]
      </p>
      <p>
       Conway's use of the phrase "alternative facts" to describe demonstrable falsehoods was widely mocked on social media and sharply criticized by journalists and media organizations, including Dan Rather, Jill Abramson, and the Public Relations Society of America. The phrase was extensively described as Orwellian. Within four days of the interview, sales of the book 1984 had increased by 9,500%, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.[2]

       I'm not sure what you mean by that... but anyways sorry, I mean "Alt-right" where did that term start? Was it a self proclaimed term or a negative concoction of sorts? I remember that whole alternative facts in the news... crazy stuff.

       But the "spy" working closest with Trump's campaign wasnt a "Russian Spy" like the media says.. He was an American Spy who spent time spying on Russians.... Somehow that is "collusion".. Also... There were secret deals with the Obama administration and Hillaries people with the Russians over uranium deals. U.s. uranium from massive state lands was given to Russian interests literally by them.

       This is why I am very anti-censorship. You want to know why people continue to fall for this propaganda? Because we have never been encouraged to think for ourselves. Our go to has always been reporting any information we find repulsive to an authority so it can be neatly removed. People can't ignore what they don't like anymore, they have to see it completely removed. We also can't judge reality for ourselves, we need an authority to "fact-check" and let us know what's okay to believe.

       I can't believe low effort conspiracies get traction just because they go along with a pro-Trump narrative, but anything that is anti-Trump, even if it's a 3 page essay of conspiracy will get downvoted.  This sub is trash sometimes.

       You've really got to look at this through the lens of a cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Look at Scientology: The entire group of ideas are made up by people with clear psychological problems and a desire for power.  Many words are created out of thin air or defined however they feel like defining them.  Members are ostracized for questioning the faith, and people who try to stop them are attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Look at Modern Feminism:  The entire group of ideas are made up by people with clear psychological problems and a desire for power.  Words are created out of thin air or defined however they feel like defining them.  Members are aggressively ostracized for questioning the group, and people who try to stop them are attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Now look at modern social media culture:  The group has defined it's values based, significantly, on the modern feminism from above.  Words are defined however they feel like defining them.  Narratives, with very little factual support, are built up and held as absolute truth.  Questioning anything from within the group leads to ostracism and, thus, a desire to toe the line.  Objections lead to being aggressively attacked.  Direct opposition is (beginning to be) banned entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a pattern.  We've weaponized cultism.  The longer I watch this happen the less I believe it's organic and the more I truly believe we're being played like pawns on a grand chessboard.

       The cabal is doing a full court press trying to get the censorship ready to go. They are afraid damaging leaks are coming next and they want to silence any dissent for the upcoming elections. It's too late. I believe the overton window has shifted and people just need some real deal physical evidence or results shown on TV then the revolution is on and popping.

       If they ban The_Donald then I’m going to be seriously rethinking spending my time on Reddit. I can understand banning users who incite violence or actually break rules, but banning a whole sub? Fuckthat. Coontown and fatpeoplehate, as disgusting subs as they were, deserved a voice. It’s free speech ffs. As long as you aren’t inciting violence or spreading other people’s information I don’t see the issue; it’s just Reddit saying “Hey you’re banned for being bad for my bottom line”

       considering Trump stole the republican party and spent the 60s 70s and up to 87 as a Democrat...Supporting Trump isn't exactly 'partisan'. He's the most centrist Candidate we've had in a while...Even was willing to sign almost a 2million dollar DACA deal while running on 'Ban the immigrants!!!!'

       Haha I give credit where it's deserved.  He's all over the place but definitely doing his own thing.  I don't know the last good candidate.  Ron Paul was my boy for awhile.  At least he's a physician and not a damn lawyer too.  I dunno, I just hate seeing america so divided, even more so.  Never will everyone be happy either though.  Sucks for us average people right?

       I was extremely thrilled to hear his vocal support of mental health support and the idea that some people can violate their ability to own guns because of known threats. I think everyone should be able to own a gun...and I think if you openly threaten to kill someone your ability to own that gun should go away as soon as possible. This may result in more 'spontaneous' murders as people learn not to 'broadcast' which creates another problem to deal with. I don't think it's a never ending cycle it's just that a multi-pronged solution is necessary. Improving the overal mental health of our youth should be our Nation's number one priority. What sort of future are we to lead if our children are...well...Fucked in the head?

       I agree with all of that.  Well said.  You're a good example of a level headed trump supporter!  If someone gets caught exposing themselves they get put on the sex offender list.  If someone makes threats of any kind they should be barred from owning.  Guns aren't toys.  I live in Texas I know all too well.  I love guns lol.  They were doing protests by my house walking around with AR-15s over their shoulders.  Scares people but they're just pro gun guys, not nut jobs.  People sometimes can't differentiate enthusiasts from fanatics.  I think we have the same set of values for the most part.  That makes me happy lol.

       most people have the same sets of values...at least in America. It's why Trump is going to continue to do well and gain in popularity. He really is centrist about everything. The Democrats are just full blown commies at this point and well..Republicans are basically the same as Democrats just slightly different masters...and 'maybe goals'...but the goal always seems to be War so..

       I'm not a fan of him lol.  He's so unpredictable I can't figure him out.  I guess it's because he doesn't align with traditional parties.  It's scary though.  I don't like that he's failed to appoint ambassadors and is hurting our international image.
      </p>

       Honestly, I think the root of the problem is the federal reserve.  We were warned about having a centralized bank and political parties.  It gives them complete control and divides us. We do all have the same set of morals and values basically.  I think the problem is the dems and reps are too busy calling each other names and having their thumbs up their asses.  I'm a bit idealistic about a better united future but I'm also realistic lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish more people would talk to Trump supporters without the presumption they're some white supremacist idiot.  Same with the dems.  I enjoy talking to all sorts of people.   How else can you really know someone lol.  More people should try to be the bridge between opposing opinions.

       Lol after a quick search on your profile I learned that you defend the colonizing ass hats who took land from the real South Americans. Maybe If the Dutch stayed where they were from and didn’t pillage rape and teal for the land they have now they wouldn’t be persecuted but nah they had to fuck it up for themselves. You probably believe in white genocide too. Lmao good day.

       Do you realize how ironic it is for you to say that the Dutch were fleeing because of persecution yet when they got to South Africa they did the exact same thing. Systematically. For years. Do you know what apartheid was? That would NEVER had happened if white people could have stayed out of South Africa. The tea is exceptionally good today. 🤫☕️🐸

       No the original "colonists" were Dutch and French people escaping religious persecution. They filled a gap left over when the Portuguese illness whipped out the Khoisan. The British were afraid that the Dutch would get to wealthy so they took over the cape. The Dutch still wanting to be free fled into the interior where they made a deal with the zulus for land. A deal that the zulus backed out off and slaughtered the Dutch who were forced to fight back. Isn't history fun?

       You must really suffer from cognitive dissonance if you fail to acknowledge the Dutch started slavery there and are directly responsible for it. God forbid they don’t pillage people’s land and then claim to have made it a better place. How does it even make sense that white people own 70%+ farm land in South Africa?! That’s not right and karma is coming back for those who wrongly stole land. I’m white and I’m all for it. Karma is a bitch! Lol

       Haha I just don’t like to debate with a brick wall. You’re repeating the same fallacies, you aren’t acknowledging the links that provide facts you’re refuting, and you’re bringing up irrelevant points that don’t really have anything to do with the fact that the Dutch were the first to enslave black people in South Africa and didn’t do much to help them. Haha little rascal of a man! Or woman idk what you are not that it matters. Cognitive dissonance has definitely gotten to ya. Best wishes.

       Refer to the link. It explains it and actively debunks you’re asinine statements regarding it. Reading is a very useful tool especially when debating someone that knows more about the subject than you. I’m even offering you resources to help you but you’re just digging a bigger hole for yourself. But I get the vibe that you either don’t care or don’t grasp that concept and that’s okay. Some of us are a little denser than others

       I understand why. It is very convenient to have a common enemy for the people to rally behind. This has always been a great way to motivate large groups. If the media constantly talked about all of the it operations then it would seem like a non issue and people would lose interest. But focus all efforts on one group, one country and you can rally people.

       For the record I want justice served and Russia should be held accountable for this travesty. But a ton of foreign money influenced these electrons and the people responsible should be held accountable too. Efforts run by super pacs to manipulate voters was called astroturfing because it was so common and they pretended to have grass roots origins. Orgs like correct the record which flooding social media with propaganda are a prime example. No one should be let off the hook just because targeting Russia is the most convenient way to unite the country against a common enemy and potentially take out our idiot president at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I get it, we can't focus on everyone or else people might not care enough to do anything. So we focus on one or two bad guys and maybe some progress will get made.

       Money in politics is clearly a huge problem and has shown to quickly subvert the will of the poeple so we need to address that obviously but Russia attacking our democracy and infiltrating multiple branches of our government using psy ops is a more urgent existential threat. Dark money played a big part in that and also needs to be addressed.

       Not if they don't ban their own bots.

       They didn't say they'll ban them all, just the one that are problematic.

       It's known, but it doesn't always get reported to upper management.  You have lower level executives counting on numbers, so the reports to the top are usually a bit filtered.  I once had to move numbers from a traffic spike due to DOS attacks into general traffic so management could report a redesign as a huge success.  While it was live, the site never matched those numbers again.

       Is there a way to make sure this is indeed what they do?  Because people, we need to get RID of the bots, especially foreign, but stateside too.  But I also agree this needs to be done using an open process wherin some form of "Voigt-Kampf" test is issued and transcribed(in this case meaning something as simple as 'Did this account post something aggressive at the exact second they were allowed to post, reaching max capacity like clockwork?'  All these corporate leaders are all about Open A.I. -- We should start an "OpenAnalog" showing human mediated solutions to dealing with digital weaponization in our social networks and what not... Maybe something like this already exists?

       You sweet summer child. The method of implementation is much more subtle, pervasive and fucked up than you can imagine.
      </p>
      <h2>
       For the most part, the Russians stick to memes and news reposts.    But when you're a native English speaker, there's a whole world of pms and social interaction to exploit.  You can push buttons, stalk a particular user for weeks down voting everything they say, have several other...colleagues... join in to express incredulity that someone could possibly hold such ridiculous ideas...you can isolate them and emotionally devour them in the background using the psychology of the upvote, appeal to numbers.
      </h2>
      <p>
       By making every attempt to engage in ideas that before may have started heated discussion and a flood of random 2 cents now an imminent round of insults, incredulity, repetition of the same basic definitions that you've repeated countless times the last time you posted, you  make your fellow man into an object of anxiety and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The digging is relentless, and always cast with the implication that you brought it on Yourself.   Look,you've got 5 down votes and 3 people at once sitting on 15 upvotes calling you ridiculous and accusing you of harming whatever your given movement is by holding such ideas - clearly the problem must be you not them right?  But the response just seemed so rude and personal... but clearly the community thought it was reasonable to react in such a way, and why should I expect some rando off the Internet to engage with me as if we're in real life?  Its the internet, gotta let it slide off your back, sticks and stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       That works the first few weeks.  But your monkey brain can't stop analyzing those numbers of aproval and disproval, the character of the responses and the consistency....every time.  The repetitive conditioning that when you post, your ideas invite disdain and the community is united in their incredulity becomes the expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extend it naturally.

That must mean when i speak,
 everyone 
Is mocking me in their heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you dont engage with people like that! You  try not to be a dick, you dont just needlessly ridicule others or present their crazy unpopular idea as a representation of their general worth - but that must just be how society has evolved, and you were one of the weak who was so thick you never saw them laughing behind your back.
      </p>
      <p>
       You question where humanity has gone, and if there is any hope at all, any point in trying to make a better world if this is how we will treat each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you unsubscribe from the democratic socialists mailing list.  You never go to their meetings, or help them organize.  You probably skip voting - what's the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe you go the darker route, and vow to adapt...  It's every man for himself, now.  If society wants to treat you like a marginalized piece of shit, you'll join the other marginal pieces of shit then.  You won't be weak again, because now you've learned the truth of what human nature is, and it requires rethinking your entire approach to how society should and ought to functuon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark times upon us friends.

       Are we all supposed to get behind the winning team, voice Pro American sentiments?
All we are doing is confirming to the other 7 billion people stuck on this planet with us is that the United States is the problem.  How to Lose Friends and Influence people to hate you.....

       Not really a conspiracy if you do it openly. Dump a bunch of weapons and bombs on a spot, shit it's going to kick off. That was the strategy the whole time and was pretty obvious.

       To be fair, they did most of the arming and training before they were called Isis, but on a practical level it doesn't matter.

       Also, it matters very little at this point how woke the sheeple are, because the psy ops have a choke hold on social media and people are addicted.

       Why are Americans so racist against people of Russian ethnicity? I thought this country accepted all cultures? Is it because most Russian people have a pale white complexion?

       They don't have to be buddy buddy, they both profit from the mass surveillance so it makes sense both would seek it in whichever way possible.

       I'm sure Russia has internet trolls, as I'm sure every other country meddles in every other country's business. Welcome to geopolitics. Russia's influence seems to be incredibly overblown. I'd be incredibly surprised if China didn't have a similar influence, as well as many of our allies. Everyone has a stake in the U.S election, they'd be stupid to not try and interfere. We're just using Russia as the current boogeyman as the middle east has been largely pacified and we always need an enemy.

       I get the blanket of everyone wants to interfere with the US. However, as I said earlier, Russia is the country that is currently dominating that space. And Russia is the one country we still have a wealth of trade deals on hold with because of sanctions and our foreign policy.

       Clearly all of Flynn's sketchy doings didn't stretch before Trump picked him. Not like Obama's admin gave advice to not hire the guy as he as previously fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Page plead guilty to a count of conspiracy against the US. I believe there were some others named but that is the one that comes to mind. Same dude who has FISA surveillance renewed on him for what like 2 years before he was hired by Trump. Manafort got caught up in paperwork initially but I think he has other charges on him now.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case I'm fairly certain said manager knew about his employee's skeletons but still hired him anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure that whole conspiracy against the US is the Russian meddling charge you keep asking for. And as I said earlier, gotta wait til the end of the investigation before claiming no charges exist.

       lol you guys are so fucking retarded. None of those companies have done anything extreme or violated anyone's free speech. The reason they generally have a left-leaning bias is because their audience is generally left-leaning, and they have advertisers that want to target that audience. Your dumbass views aren't being censored they're just unpopular outside your echo chambers.

How about the Hapsbergs they actually did manage to consoladate and then bred themselves out of existence? Don't confuse intelligence communities for secret power structures, read more history.

        If you think the idea of a "deep state" isn't conpletely in line with human nature and every single piece of documentation we have about huiman nature for the last 3000+ years, then you are a fool.

       The concept is inline with human nature, the "in-practice" it not being throughly shared and common knowledge is impossible.

      <p>
       The lack of available evidence and documentation in a world with infinite examples of such evidence getting out, would suggest the impracticality of your hypothesis.

       How do you feel about Trump's sexual harassment, assault, paying prostitutes for sex, trying to fuck his friends wife? If you're sickened by Biden being a hugger but not an actual sexual preditor, the that sick feeling is you your mental disease.

       So then really your argument is that web forums are either more important than the government, or should be run by a government body? I disagree on both these viewpoints for a few reasons, more importantly, Reddit is privately owned and matter-of-factly doesn't owe you or your viewpoints shit. I'm not happy with that being reddits future, and you can do whatever you want with that information, but at the end of the day thats how it is.

       I’m dead ass serious when I say this. My co worker has been stressed and dealing with anxiety for a while, her doctor told her not to watch CNN anymore (her normal news channel) because they literally only talk about bad shit. She said he referred to it as “doom and gloom”. She stopped watching and her anxiety has died down. Take that how y’all will but it’s an honest to god story.

       most people have the same sets of values...at least in America. It's why Trump is going to continue to do well and gain in popularity. He really is centrist about everything. The Democrats are just full blown commies at this point and well..Republicans are basically the same as Democrats just slightly different masters...and 'maybe goals'...but the goal always seems to be War so..
