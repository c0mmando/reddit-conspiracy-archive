        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;biofeedback teaches the left brain hemisphere first to visualize the desired result and then to recognize the feelings associated with the experience of successful right hemisphere access to the specific lower cerebral, cortex, pain or pleasure or other areas in the manner needed to produce the desired result.
For example if the subject wishes to increase the circulation in the left leg in order to speed up healing he may concentrate with his left brain on achieving that result while carefully monitoring a digital thermometer connected to the left leg.
When concentrated effort begins to achieve success, the digital thermometer will register an increase in the temp of the left leg. At that point, the subject can mentally (left brain) associate the sensation experienced with the result achieved and can begin to emphasize, by memory recall, the same process to causing its strengthening by affirmation and repetition.&quot;
By utilizing the imagination, will power and belief we can heal ourselves faster, block pain and so much more.
We are remerging what we lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sadly our cells did not evolve to be perfect machines, nature just rolls with whatever works. the longevity of a species correlates with the age it reaches sexual maturity, which is why the nautilus lives much longer than other cephalopods. there&#39;s lots more to it than that (there&#39;s fun research on the fitness benefit granted to offspring by the presence of grandparents), but nature had no obligation to select against a cell that would be likely to develop cancer after forty years.</p>

<p>what youre saying is fucking true tho, to a point. humans are a species predisposed to chronic stress (look up &#39;why zebras don&#39;t get ulcers&#39; for an elaboration), and it fucks us fundamentally. add in pollution, questionable dietary options, genotypes that can greatly increases the risk for certain cancers to develop, and inevitable sources of dna damage. without some intervention, even the best maintained cells will run down eventually.</p>

<p>lifestyle changes can do a lot, no doubt. but eventually only medical technology beyond what currently exists can mitigate these inevitabilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Learn what &quot;cancer&quot; <strong>is</strong> before drawing conclusions. It&#39;s not mutated cells; it&#39;s your body stuffing away metabolic waste and toxicity from eating incorrect food such as meat, grains, dairy and whatever mystery chemicals are in those shiny boxes that scream &quot;DIET! HEALTHY!&quot;</p>

<p>Nature can, to some extent, roll with dirty fuel. And it was necessary in order for humans to leave the tropics with its plentiful fruit, our &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; if you well. But that dirty fuel leaves byproducts, residue. Our bodies can only clean up so much of it before the kidneys, liver, bowels, sweat, and breath are overloaded and it starts to accumulate and break down organs -- which western medicine helpfully labels &quot;dis-eases&quot; and prescribes their expensive products to treat.</p>

<p>If all this is new to you, I highly recommend this book -- it&#39;ll help prevent and/or reverse very serious &quot;dis-eases&quot; that we&#39;re told &quot;can&#39;t be cured but only managed&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Detox-Miracle-Sourcebook-Complete-Regeneration/dp/1935826190">https://www.amazon.com/Detox-Miracle-Sourcebook-Complete-Regeneration/dp/1935826190</a></p>

<p>Stay away from the western medical sales funnels unless you&#39;re okay with being pharmaceutically enslaved. Stop outsourcing your health. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN BODY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your message completely, caring for one&#39;s body through mindfulness, healthy diet, and self awareness of what your body is &#39;telling&#39; you is one of the most important things someone can do. the way western society is structured, basically none of that is simple, easy, or encouraged. And I agree that the medical industry capitalizes off of that -- I think that running medicine as a business creates a horrible conflict of interest.</p>

<p>But damage to a cell&#39;s dna is inevitable -- that&#39;s why all cells have very effective, often redundant, ways to check for and correct these mistakes. The double helix and base pairing is just one of these. The fact that the vast majority of our dna is noncoding &#39;junk&#39; dna is another protective factor (when a mutation occurs, it&#39;s likely to happen somewhere it won&#39;t cause much influence). This is because sometimes, proteins make mistakes. </p>

<p>Free radicals are an unavoidable, sometimes desired byproduct of certain processes in the cell. There are proteins whose sole reason for existing is to neutralize these before they can do damage, but sometimes there is bad luck and they never get the chance. Sometimes during replication of dna, the wrong base pair gets inserted and goes unnoticed by the error checking systems just by chance alone.</p>

<p>Diet, stress, genetics, and other lifestyle factors can greatly influence the amount of these chances for something to go wrong, or the threshold for the number of things having gone wrong to develop into a cancer. And further, they can create an environment where cancerous cells can thrive.</p>

<p>So everything you&#39;re saying about the importance of diet, being responsible and taking a holistic approach to your own health, I agree with completely. But the fundamental cause of cancer, beyond what causes it to develop, is malfunctioning in the cell usually caused by accumulated mutations that just happened to occur in the worst place they could.</p>

<p>And random mutations are inevitable, they&#39;re what enabled ancient bacteria to evolve into all the different life that exists on earth today. The genome of any given cell in an organism likely differs from another slightly. Given enough time, some unlucky cells will develop issues and the body alone will not be able to fix this, because it is a problem it is not prepared to face. At that point only advanced medical intervention, or some kind of magic, could reverse the course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, let&#39;s kill the &quot;Cancer is mutated cells&quot; argument dead. It&#39;s metabolic waste -- free-radicals, in part -- that isn&#39;t being processed correctly. So therefore:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop inputting toxic waste as much as possible -- i.e., fix your diet -- and </p></li>
<li><p>Process and expel that toxic waste and efficiently as possible -- i.e., movement, light exercise (walking, yoga), and sweat</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now if you want to call correct diet and exercise &quot;magic&quot;... man okay. But NOWHERE in here is the &quot;advanced medical industry&quot; required.</p>

<p>Millions have died horrible deaths due to &quot;advanced medical intervention&quot; and the all-encompassing PR machine that prevents people from knowing the simple, inexpensive ways to prevent and reverse this. Have you seen what chemo does to a person? My god. And they PAY for it, $50k - $500k.. and more. </p>

<p>This is genocide. There will be mass, public trials mark my words. That is, if the people don&#39;t turn on you first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will break it down in a summarized fashion.These exercise come from Initiation into Hermetics. Franz Bardon. But they all stem from yoga, specifically raja yoga. Yoga of the mind. </p>

<p>Before you start any advanced mediation exercises you need to complete some prerequisites. This entails KNOWING THY SELF. If you know yourself nothing can tell you what you are and influence you in a negative way. For example when you start meddling with elements you will notice that your maturity or lack there of is portionable in your ability to control those elements. If you don&#39;t know yourself these elements will negatively influence you.  It is up to you to know what knowing yourself means. </p>

<p>First exercise: </p>

<p>relax somewhere where you won&#39;t be bothered. Now imagine something in your minds eye. imagine it so freaking well that you are seeing it as you would any object in real life. Do this for 10 minutes. Do this without letting any other thought or image pop into your head . It is essential you imagine this only this object. </p>

<p>second exercise: </p>

<p>relax somewhere where you won&#39;t be bothered. Imagine nothing. Have a vacant mind. However you must remain present and aware, all the while not thinking about anything. </p>

<p>These exercise train the mind to FOCUS. By focusing you are dialing in on very precise energies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I will give these a try. What did &quot;know thyself&quot; mean to you, and others? (So I can figure out what it means for me.)
Is this something about proving your strengths to yourself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing yourself to me means that you recognize your weaknesses and strengths and your willingness to improve them. Knowing yourself means that you have been battle tested. You have gone though some seriously tough events and you learned from them and made yourself stronger from it.  </p>

<p>The book breaks down your faults and attributes into certain elements. When you lack or have too much of a certain element in your personality you become unbalanced and this negatively influences your thought process. </p>

<p>When you truly know yourself you understand yourself so well that you can become become or achieve anything you want. Because you know how to tweak yourself to attain certain goals. </p>

<p>It takes introspection on a daily bases. Take note of all your faults. Fore example, say your standing in line in the grocery store. Your freaking out because the line is long yet you have no where you need to be after you leave the grocery store. Your breathing gets sporadic and you tense your shoulders and negative thoughts enter your mind about the old lady holding the line up. This would indicate to me that you don&#39;t know yourself. Once this event is over you would take note how this made you feel and how it negatively impacted your mental and physical health. Next time instead of freaking out you would totally relax yourself, breath correctly, relax your shoulders, be in the moment, enjoy the smell of the roses next to you. Think positively, in a way that improves your thought process and mood. My point is, not matter what position you are in you remain calm and aware and take advantage of opportunities around you that could benefit you. This is part of knowing yourself. You will understand a ton more when you practice it daily. </p>
