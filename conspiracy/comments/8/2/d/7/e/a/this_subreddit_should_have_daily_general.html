        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For anybodyelse who reads r/hiphopheads , every day the have a general discussion thread for chatting about anything. As a casual broswer and occasional posted in r/conspiracy, I think it would be really great to see something like that implemented here -- somewhere for discussing the rabbit holes people are going through on the daily basis. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t use reddit enough to make these threads myself, but I think this subreddit would really benefit from it and I hope others might take it upon themselves to start threads like this. Perhaps this could be the first of those threads. Here are some prompts to get us started:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What&#39;s your latest conspiracy obsession?</strong>
For me, I&#39;ve been watching The Code of the Pyramids on Netflix and am constantly having my mind blown. Highly recommend it for those interest in alternative takes on history. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>What was the conspiracy that first got you hooked?</strong>
It all goes back to Nessie - when I was in 5th grade I was obsessed. Then came UFOs - those are still a favorite. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>How have your conspiracy beliefs changed over time?</strong>
Loved the far-out nessie,bigfoot stuff as a kid, then  i went through a phase of being a hardcore skeptic, but these days, these strangest things seem possible. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>What&#39;s a conspiracy that you used to believe in, but now doubt?</strong>
I&#39;ll admit I got sucked into flat earth for a minute there, but knocked myself out of it with some physics lessons.</p></li>

<p>What kind of photo are you expecting? </p>

<p>The ISS is a humongous satellite but even it only appears as a point of light, unless you&#39;ve got an advanced camera set-up capable of seeing some detail. </p>

<p>You will never see most satellites. </p>

<p>No... This is dumb simple to figure out. The data we get from satellites can only come from a high altitude object moving very fast. </p>
