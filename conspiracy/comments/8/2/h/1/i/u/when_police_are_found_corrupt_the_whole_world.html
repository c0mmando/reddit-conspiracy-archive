    <div class="md"><p>Came across <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/segregation-invented/517158/">this fascinating article</a> yesterday about how there was a period of time between the Civil War and the 1890s when poor black and white Southerners were teaming up politicallly and winning some major policy victories for their shared benefit. So wealthy white people started spreading racially divisive propaganda, basically inventing the concepts of racial segregation and white supremacy, to get poor whites to team up with them against black people and against their own economic interests. I&#39;d never really realized before that it wasn&#39;t an immediate, natural progression from slavery to segregation and white supremacy, but that those concepts emerged later to stomp out class solidarity between black and white workers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uncle Tom was originally an icon for Black Americans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Henson">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Henson</a></p>

<p>It was taken over eventually and forced into a negative light but at the time praised by Douglass &quot;a flash to light a million camp fires in front of the embattled hosts of slavery&quot;. Of course there was backlash from a few opinions but to the man who&#39;s the leader of the abolitionist movement in the NW colonies it was genius. A man who was known for his ability to rouse a crowd. </p>

<p>The woman who wrote this novel also was credited by Abe Lincoln for having inspired the Civil War. Later political renditions were put out to distort the image by white southerners in order to stop the rallying cry of Freedom. &quot;American copyright law before 1856 did not give novel authors any control over derivative stage adaptations, so Stowe neither approved the adaptations nor profited from them.[12] Minstrel show retellings in particular, usually performed by white men in blackface, tended to be derisive and pro-slavery, transforming Uncle Tom from Christian martyr to a fool or an apologist for slavery&quot;</p>

<p>This is especially lame because Stowe actually used Tom&#39;s passivity to show the ferocity of three black woman who did escape slavery in the novel. It really is the first novel to feature a full robust black cast and should be on every American&#39;s education list but because of connotation it&#39;s &#39;controversial&#39;. lol.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the US it actually came about after Bacon&#39;s Rebellion, when a rich dude got pissed and was able to unite black slaves and scots/irish indentured servants to revolt.  </p>

<p>The British decided to keep their &quot;help&quot; separate by psychology.  Hence racism.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong though, the civil war, as with many wars, have a way of eliminating racism.  When someone saves your life, watches your back, tends to reduce the stereotypes you have about their skin color.</p>

<p>Media, like identity politics, needs to be implemented to keep the races separate.  One day blacks will realize that Dems, run mostly by Jews, are the same slave owners that used to keep them down through psychology.</p>

Then they released the dash cam.  He stopped/started the chase three times and clipped a cop with his car.  Amazingly people were still wondering why the cops didn&#39;t shoot out a tire/etc.anything else.  What they&#39;re not considering is, what is the adrenaline fueled maniac going to do at high speed with a flatted tire possible striking another vehicle in traffic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, subsidies were given to these companies because they had deep ties to D.C. In a free market, the economy always balances itself out. New would take the place of the failed old. But, the huge bankers, CEO&#39;s of GM, and the like had officials in their back pocket to save them from losing too much. Any time the gov&#39;t gets involved with the economy it offsets the free market and causes an imbalance somewhere. This imbalance will help out a few people, but eventually taxpayers end up footing the fucking bill. May they all get what they deserve, in this life or the next.</p>

<p>The Clintons were two of the most prominent and socially involved people in the world for 30 years.  They have &quot;connections&quot; to tens of thousands of people.  Of course hundreds or thousands of those people will have died over time, given simple mortality tables.  If you did a similar exercise for the Bush family -- list everyone with a tangential connection to them who died -- you&#39;d get a similar result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m seen it, and it&#39;s always back filled logic <em>assuming</em> the person died for some reason connected to the Clintons.</p>

<p>Like Seth Rich, who was shot walking through a dangerous neighborhood that had been suffering a string of armed robberies.  People decided he <em>must</em> have someone been killed by Clinton, so they invented that he was the DNC leaker despite it not making sense and their being no evidence.  That&#39;s what it always is, the facts being shifted around to match the theory.  There&#39;s always a reason the decedent &quot;had something on Clinton&quot; if you assume that going in.</p>

<p>Oh but politicians and governments are perfect saint. Why would they be politicians if they aren&#39;t selfless and only interested in serving the people. And even if there is a politician working for his own benefit he could not possibly group up with others to form a conspiracy because we have flawless control mechanism and media. It&#39;s just not possible to work for your own benefit if you have power. All of the people mentioned are naturally not interested in money and not brideable because they are saints working for the public good.</p>

<p>Well people either know that the system is rigged and have accepted a certain level of corruption as normal...  Or they&#39;ve fooled themselves into believing that crazy people have put millions of manhours of work into elaborate hoaxes.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that the American Spring needs to happen.  More and more &quot;normies&quot; are realizing they&#39;ve been lied to...  The vast majority have known for a very long time but they reject the truth for convenience, they just want to live their lives.  Pretty soon, it&#39;s going to reach a tipping point...  People are happy to remain ignorant so long as they believe what the lies conceal isn&#39;t &quot;that bad.&quot;  It&#39;s just greed, corruption, politicians getting rich...  But when the people are faced with the true horrors that have been concealed right under their very noses, they will have no choice but to act decisively.</p>
