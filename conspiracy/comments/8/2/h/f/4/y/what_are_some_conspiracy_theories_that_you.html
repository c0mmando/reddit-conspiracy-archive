<p>However -- you can prove them to yourself. And I would <em>eagerly race</em> to bet both my house and next paycheck, knowing that I would win on the following claims:</p>

<p>No one has died in any recent mass shootings or terror events including Parkland, Vegas, Pulse, San Bernardino, and about any others you could name. </p>

<p>Man has never walked and will never walk on the moon. </p>

<p>All 4 9/11 crash sites were faked and none involved Boeing passenger jets.</p>

<p>I read that hitting a building with a plane is really hard so they were probably modified military planes, but I believe that planes hit those buildings. </p>

<p>After the hit you can see the WTC is not really damaged but suddenly after hours in just seconds becomes dust.</p>

<p>This is important: it became dust, it practically disappear. </p>

<p>There were definitely explosives there.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is joke of a belief system, as I explained earlier.</p>

<p>Official heliocentrism is also a joke, and <a href="http://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">here is just one reason</a> why I say so.</p>

<p>There are other explanations which can explain all of the empirical phenomenon of this realm. </p>

<p>Check his post history, he is here to surreptitiously PM or insert into the post a John le bon link or video... well he probably is John le Bon. </p>

<p>Just know he is usually attacking or trolling, but never adds anything other than a link to his stuff. Look through his post history, he wants pageviews and your money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not really believe anything I hear anymore; I consider everything though. Everything is subjective nowadays and there are too many disinformation agents out there. Two things I take as gold is that their is something bigger out there connecting all life (not in any religious sense whatsoever) and that the people in power have designed a system to keep the wool over our eyes in order to run their agenda. </p>

<p>My opinion though, most conspiracy theories come from an inkling of truth at least.... </p>
