        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The life we know is absurd. There are so many contradictory things presented to us in a pathetic attempt, although bold, to stall or remove the human ability to observe and examine the universe and how we relate with it. Whoever is doing it is debatable but it doesn&#39;t matter. They have no power until we relinquish our minds to them, so don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Before watching internet tv to relax, remember who it is that brought it to you. All these mediocre shows that we&#39;ve seen before or aren&#39;t really interesting anymore.. the novelty is wearing off. The internet is being used as the main conditioning platform now. I&#39;m experiencing this as much as anyone else and it is challenging to break the habit. When I do though, and decide to meditate instead, I remember how my mind is infinitely more interesting and satisfying than dumb comedy shows/ documentaries. The meditation then leads to better overall decisions for my health which leads to more meditation etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like an addict, I eventually return to the internet/ tv and see if it will satisfy me. This then leads to worse decisions for my health and more internet etc. It&#39;s the death/ rebirth cycle as seen in buddhism and other religions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had fleeting moments of transcendence in my head that lead me to believe that we have the potential to surpass our current existence. You&#39;ve likely had similar things happen, in dreams or when going to sleep. It&#39;s likely our &quot;attachments&quot; that hold us back. Something always breaks the concentration like remembering who we are or what we did that day or whatever. There&#39;s a definite feeling of something more, something within reach.</p>

<p>As many of us know by now, the conditioning process uses chemicals in addition to the programming. Our pineal gland is being massacred and our bodily health is mediocre overall. We&#39;re largely malnourished and, although there are lot&#39;s of people going to the gym, we&#39;re largely weak willed. Some think they aren&#39;t weak by acting tough and hard on people, but to me someone who acts above others is a weak minded person. Some may disagree, but I&#39;m just stating what I see. All of this is evidence of tampering with human biology through the food, water, air etc.</p>

<p>Even with all the toxicity in society, we are still somewhat able to comprehend things that can&#39;t properly be put into words. As above so below they say. If this is true, then the ultimate form of the universe, or &quot;god&quot;, is likely similar to what we are. If that&#39;s true, then the universe has things like an &quot;immune system&quot; and protective actions to prevent disruption and ailment. As we see in our lives, immune systems work, but at times there is a lengthy recovery period when a virus comes in. To me that is the state we&#39;re in currently. There is some sort of virus that is wreaking havoc, but you can see at the same time that people are attempting to stop it like antibodies. Some people are infected, others are attempting to heal.</p>

<p>Ultimately, self awareness and meditation is the best way to heal from this. Awareness of your surroundings, your food/ water, your mental state and also discipline over bad habits is the key. It is very hard because those infected with the virus (or prolonged conditioning) not only don&#39;t necessarily want to be healed, but they want to infect you as well.</p>

<p>Our mental state is very important in this as well. Negative outlook weakens us further and makes us more susceptible to infection. This is also why everything that is presented to us has some sort of negative connotation to it. It doesn&#39;t matter what the connotation is or even what is presented, but what matters is the feeling you get inside. When I look for things on the internet, I often see things that people or bots say that makes me feel angry. Anger leads to wanting to satisfy an urge and this leads to the &quot;death spiral.&quot;</p>

<p>This ongoing cycle in our mind is what keeps us at a halt in any kind of human &quot;progress&quot; (although progress can mean many things). To me, it stops us from transcending past this petty and wasteful lifestyle to one where we can be aware of all of this on a collective level and therefore lead healthier lives and flourish on this amazing gift of a planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit I didn&#39;t fully read your post but it does seem to me that there is a concentrated effort to make us spiritually blind.</p>

<p>It might be an end in itself. </p>

<p>It might be a means to turn us into consumers and followers who don&#39;t second guess their role as a cog in the corporate machine we all live in. It might also be a side effect of that aim.</p>

<p>Whatever the reasons for it, in my life the effects of tv, porn, music and videogames (other things could.be added to this list) is definitely and undeniably a disconnection from the divine (or spirituality or whatever you choose to call it, personally I believe in one God).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree as well that there is an effort to take away our inborn spirituality, the evidence especially being the poisoning of our pineal gland, the epicenter of our spirituality. I think that we are beginning to adapt to the situation though, which may be good, maybe not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the absence of religion and spirituality, we have rampant nihilism and apathy. As a society we are deeply dissatisfied, heavily medicated, and without guidance. </p>

<p>Or worse, without our own conscious guidance we fall prey to the outside forces bombarding us constantly. Electronics, media, entertainment, etc. By pursuing pleasure and instant gratification, we lose out on real happiness and contentment.</p>

<p>Its funny in a tragic way. We seemed to have the recipes for a good life for ages in various religious texts, but we&#39;re so arrogant that we tossed them out, and created our own hideous franken-religion. </p>

<p>Instead of prayer, we meditate. Instead of gathering in churches and synagogues, we sit in isolation on social media, or gather to take part in misguided activism. Instead of serving our communities, we ask the government to do it for us. Instead of worship and hymns, we have music festivals and concerts. Instead of going to sermon, we are lectured by talking heads on the television and online.</p>

<p>This may read like an Im14anddeep rambling, but I&#39;ve been tossing it around for a while. While I personally rebelled from organized religion, it served many of our basic needs as humans. Comradery, feeling like part of a whole, localized welfare and services for those in need, and an exchange of ideas. It gave us a solid moral foundation. And in the absence of that, what do we have now?</p>

<p>This is not a call to return to some romanticized vision of the past. This is a call for us to seriously consider how we are going to address this existential void moving forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post, interesting read. Up until this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As many of us know by now, the conditioning process uses chemicals in addition to the programming.</p>

<p>Some may disagree, but I&#39;m just stating what I see. All of this is evidence of tampering with human biology through the food, water, air etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the air, the water and ground being poisoned. Yes. Intentional? Yes also. But in my view not by a govenment (the Dutch/ EU government in my case) but by companies polluting and destroying the earth we live in.</p>

<p>I do agree that TV/internet/apps/smartphones use loopholes in our psychology to trick us in coming back for more. Not because of the quality of the entertainment, but because of addictive mechanics to keep profiting from people using this technology.</p>

<p>Again, these are (in my humble view) independent individuals and companies using these loopholes to profit, not a bad government that has secret control over this or something (you did not say this, I know, but just to clarify my view on this). </p>

<p>As a frequent meditator I totally get your experiences. With a clear mind, the question: &quot;what does it all amount to?&quot; comes to mind. Why am I watching this show, competing for merit or hurting myself to fit into a society that is preoccupied by stuff that, deep down, means nothing to me. </p>

<p>We need to push for psychological independence. But take my amateur advice when I say that the fact that you seek this independence does not mean you are enslaved by some dark agent that prevents you from getting what you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I see a lot of people getting tripped up over who, exactly, is doing the oppressing.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, as I said in the earlier part, it doesn&#39;t matter who is doing it. We are all humans; government and corporate employees as well. The desire for profit is what is causing the damage. If the people who have a say in the company/ government that is polluting were more aware of themselves and the us, they may see that a healthier alternative (which I believe is available ie. renewable energy) would lead to a better state, not only for us but for them too.

<p>If you read up on confirmed conspiracies and the actions of both our government and the elites who control our government, it&#39;s very clear that they do in fact intend to enslave us.</p>

<p>And they&#39;re doing a pretty good job, hence why we need to ignore the noise and divisiveness, learn to be present, and do what is within our control to make the world better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good post, especially the info about meditation and negative outlook. But you seem a bit bent out of shape on the state of fictional media and music. Taking those things seriously and putting yourself on a pedestal because you watch and listen to what you might view as &quot;superior&quot; genres is a negative outlook. It&#39;s also one that is used as a marketing tactic as well. You are more &quot;intelligent&quot; or &quot;enlightened&quot; for watching this show or listening to this music.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s really just silly, and is all just entertainment. But making people believe such things about your product is a good way to make money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much yes. Another huge element is sugar. It is in everything. Start reading every ingredient label you pick up and ask yourself why there is 3 different kinds of corn syrup in your ketchup/ salad dressing/ mayo/ gravy. Things that aren&#39;t supposed to be sweet. Why? Because it&#39;s extremely addicting and it keeps you on an endless wheel of craving sugar/ tired -&gt; eat the sugar -&gt; blood sugar spike -&gt; insulin spike -&gt; crash -&gt; tired/ hungry/ ravenous for sugar . Forever! Our ancestors were lucky if they ate twice a day! We don&#39;t need to be eating every 3 hours and we certainly weren&#39;t designed to eat tablespoons of sugar each day. I could go on about this, but the point is easy to see once you pay attention. It&#39;s easy to keep society quiet and stupid when everyone is addicted to the garbage food advertised everywhere. And the companies aren&#39;t even trying to hide it (&quot;once you pop, you can&#39;t stop,&quot; &quot;bet you can&#39;t have just one,&quot; etc.) Food scientists designed these processed foods to be sweeter, saltier, crunchier, and more palatable than anything you can find in nature. Which is why most people will choose nasty McDonald&#39;s french fries over a fresh baked potato with grass fed butter and a touch of pink salt. </p>

<p>Studies have shown sugar is as, if not more addicitve than cocaine (will link studies when not on phone.) And in addition, the standard American diet is killing people in huge numbers -&gt; heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hell even Alzheimer&#39;s is thought to be &quot;type 3 diabetes&quot; caused by chronic hyperglycemia. And it is fucking ubiquitous. Fast food on every corner, corn syrup in everything, soda served in larger and larger quantities. The fast food ads are constant on TV. If you really want to break free this mental control, pay attention to what you&#39;re eating! Stop eating the chemicals, refined sugars and carbs, processed meats, and fast &quot;food.&quot; You&#39;ll be shocked at how tough it is at first (indicating a true physical addiction ) but how easy it becomes once you abstain from it. Meal prepping isn&#39;t hard, anyone can cook, and reducing carbs/ increasing fats allows your body and mind to run so much more smoothly. It&#39;s so freeing to never get hangry or have to eat every 3 hours.</p>
