I hate the idea that a few of my fellow Americans may have had something to do with it, but find a lot of validity in some of the documentaries that I’ve seen along with some of what I’ve read. I’ve also seen and read things that dispute some of the questions that have been put out there. Either way, I feel that there is more to the story than we know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from a long construction and some Demo history it was even daunting for me! It is ultimately what brought me to reddit...I had signed on with digg just as it was dying and I was encouraged to come here.</p>

<p>Low and behold as I was just coming to reddit site-wide they were <em>hammer banning</em> accounts for 9/11 talk. I didn&#39;t understand all the rules of reddit and was very limited on time so I lost two accounts and a couple years karma time(?) Anywhoo, I&#39;ve been here nearly eight years.</p>

<p>A New Pearl Harbor is good (5 hours!) if you take it like a mini series and discern the high points and low points for yourself, IMHO you&#39;ll come out pretty well rounded in the basics.</p>

<p>This is Danny Jowenko seeing WTC7 for the first time - Neils Harret is presenting this video to him and letting Danny walk thru it in <em>paces</em>. This video was the one that <em>sealed the deal</em> for me. On a sad note...Danny was killed in a very strange accident within a few months of this video.</p>

<p>Also, the Corbett Report is probably one of the best, factual sources on 9/11. Look up his 9/11 Suspects playlist and his 9/11 Trillions documentary. You won&#39;t be disappointed, I promise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its been settled. We all know 9/11 was done by MOSSAD agents posing as Art Students to help achieve full spectrum dominance written by a bunch of dual nationalist Israeli US citizens in PNAC. We know that (((Michael Chertoff))) helped draft the PATRIOT Act and he deported the Israeli MOSSAD agents that failed lie detector tests. We also know that (((Larry Silverstein))) bought the buildings despite it being filled with asbestos, and he got a huge insurance policy and made money off of the event. We also know Benjamin Netanyahu said that the 9/11 attacks have been very good for Israel. </p>

<p>9/11 has been settled. There is no more research to be done. We know for the most part who is behind it. We know the main country that benefitted from it. There’s no need to act like it’s some giant conspiracy any longer, because the truth is out there right in front of your face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh stop it. It has been settled. We know who did 9/11 and who benefitted from it. Maybe we don’t know every single person that was involved but we have a good idea. The Jewish mafia and the Jewish imperialists did 9/11 and that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Everything I listed above is absolutely true. You honestly sound like a shill or an apologist or something. </p>

<p>You said I sound like a “global warming cult member”. Like what the hell does that even mean. I don’t believe in global warming for the most part but I have no idea what you’re getting at.</p>

<p>But honestly to me you sound like a pussy. Like the type of person that would say “It’s the big bad Illuminati that’s behind all of the world’s ills. Not the Jewwwws.” 9/11 is as clear as day to anyone who’s done research on it. It’s as clear as day. Why is everyone such an idiot? Has the CIA really damaged our minds that much that people aren’t able to change their opinions once they see empirical evidence? Ughhh it’s so bad that there are so few people willing to admit obvious truths about 9/11 and the Holocaust </p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ See this shit/vitriol right here, this is what I&#39;m talking about, in regards to the AE911Truth crowd, in my other comment. That said... </p>

<p>... yes, Mossad had a major role in 9/11, imo. However, the main culprits/ring leaders where the Jesuits and Sovereign Military Order of Malta. </p>

<p>The latter groups control all levels of the CIA and the MIC. Look at all top brass... they are either SMOM, Jesuits, or Jesuit trained. The Zionist Khazars you speak of, work for Rome, whether wittingly or unwittingly, and ultimately the Holy Roman Empire benefited the most from post 9/11, imo. </p>

<p>The Holy Lands is controlled/owned by Rome, via King Felipe VI of Spain, and his Sovereign title of the King of Jerusalem. He outranks all Khazars in the Holy Lands. </p>

<p>I truly hope you dig deeper than just the simplistic views of AE911Truth, and the &quot;it was just the JEWS!!!&quot;, dis-info. The world is far more complex, than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please provide me proof that the Jesuits were involved in 9/11. Have a video? And yes, there has been a lot of Jewish infiltration into the Jesuits. And the Roman Catholic Church has been infiltrated by Jews. </p>

<p>Can you just explain how the Sovereign Military Order of Malta benefitted from 9/11? It’s sounds so absurd and so stupid. You just disregard the Iraq war and how that fits in perfectly with the Yinon plan and how the conflicts in Syria fit in perfectly with the clean break plan.</p>

<p>I’m the only one giving actual facts and actual names here. You just state. Oh the Jesuits did it. And then do t explain or provide a video explaining how. It’s such a bold claim, so where’s the evidence. And trust me I have an open mind, unlike you who probably believes 80 bazillion Jews died in the Holocaust </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a 9/11Truth mod and not subscribing to everything AE911Truth says speaks to the opposite. I down vote everything Judy Woods says because I feel I have done the research to be able to do so. Convincing evidence is typically received well. My mind has been opened by differing opinions posted on the sub. After 16 years it has evolved to fairly tight group of like minded people. While not popular, there are other 9/11 subs that better tolerate fringe research. No doubt Top Minds invaded the sub with the intent to muddy the waters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW I do the same wrt Judy Woods. After much research, I&#39;ve concluded she&#39;s a psyop, intended to give <em>some</em> explanation to why the buildings turned to dust without exposing the actual nuclear demolition. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t downvote her straightaway. I gave her a good hard look. And I also saw how her work was being used to discredit the nuclear demolition. A certain shill used to mockingly chant &quot;nukes and spacebeams, nukes and spacebeams&quot;, as if one has anything to do with the other.</p>

<p>Now, there have been &quot;Known Knowns and Unknown Knowns&quot; since the dawn of time, evidently. How do we ordinary citizens sort thru our Dear Leaders BS meters and the Scientists that they Trot Out to tell us which way is UP?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to support the current version of Dr. Judy Wood, perhaps the damned Deep State has beat her into submission? She toasted the helloutta people asking her for Help in California! I was never pleased with her snotty attitude BUTttttt...the <em>flip side</em> is just as bad when you look at other Hawkers, imho.</p>

<p>Materials sure acted strange on 9/11 so the discussion needs open minded people to consider <strong>Redundancy</strong> before they behave as bad actors, like Dr. Wood and the crew at a&amp;e9/11 beating us all into submission or killing one another via our keyboards! lol</p>

Some were less fortunate, for whatever reason(s) :(. I thank them, and they know who they are, if they are reading this. Cheers, mates!</p>

They suggest the sub&#39;s purpose is to &quot;discuss evidence&quot;, yet anything  critical of <em>their</em> version of &#39;the truth&#39; is considered off-topic and &quot;subject to removal&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;d argue that, if their version of truth apparently can&#39;t stand the light of critical scrutiny, then it may not be all that truthful anyway..</p>

<p>Can you just explain how the Sovereign Military Order of Malta benefitted from 9/11? It’s sounds so absurd and so stupid. You just disregard the Iraq war and how that fits in perfectly with the Yinon plan and how the conflicts in Syria fit in perfectly with the clean break plan.</p>

<p>I’m the only one giving actual facts and actual names here. You just state. Oh the Jesuits did it. And then do t explain or provide a video explaining how. It’s such a bold claim, so where’s the evidence. And trust me I have an open mind, unlike you who probably believes 80 bazillion Jews died in the Holocaust </p>
