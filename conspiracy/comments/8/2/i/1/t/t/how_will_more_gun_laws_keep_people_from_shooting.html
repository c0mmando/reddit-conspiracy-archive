    <div class="md"><p>Where is the logic behind that? Is it guns that cause mass shooting or the failure if society? We had just as many guns out capita in the 1960&#39;s and didn&#39;t have this problem. With that analogy it&#39;s clear that the problem is not the number of guns...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People weren&#39;t sporting AR15s in the 1960s. (At least not stateside!) The problem isn&#39;t the shotguns and bolt action rifles and .22 pistols people used to associate with the 2nd - it&#39;s this &quot;right&quot; to own extremely deadly firearms designed to kill lots and lots of people quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>Imagine there&#39;s a kid born this moment that&#39;s destined to be a school shooter. There&#39;s nothing that can be done, it&#39;s just fate - there&#39;ll always be people that try to do shit like that. The idea is, that psycho killer would be a lot less effective with a knife. So, hopefully, in 18 years, when he matures to his fateful end, he won&#39;t have access to a firearm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to chime in, I remember my dad telling me about going to multiple gun stores back in the 1970&#39;s. They have AUTOMATIC weaponry on hand and ready to sell it. </p>

<p>The one memory he shared with me was when he turned 19, in 1979. He went to a local gun shop and they had a M60 for sale. It was priced at $1,600. Keep in mind, this weapon is fully automatic. He also mentioned, they had AR15&#39;s and two fully automatic and with burst fire M16&#39;s.(How I wish I could have told him to buy the M60 knowing it&#39;s value of today.) The store was actually a sporting goods store, something similar to Dick&#39;s or Academy. </p>

<p>Back then, comparing the laws of then to now.... It is MUCH MUCH harder to gain access to a weapon similar. Back then it was a call to do a local background check, take 5 minutes of paperwork, and walk out the door with your new M60.  </p>

<p>Today, if you were lucky enough to come across an M60 that hasn&#39;t been modified to current laws. You&#39;d be paying anywhere from $50,000-$100,000 just for the gun. Then you&#39;d have to send your fingerprints to the ATF, sign a whole bunch of paperwork, and probably end up waiting well over a year just to hear back from the ATF.  Oh! And don&#39;t forget the tax stamp you&#39;re gonna be required to pay. 
And a local, state, and federal background check. </p>

<p>Even to buy an semi-automatic weapon, you&#39;re still gonna go through a local, state, and federal background check. </p>

<p>But the main thing I wanna point out is, if someone is a &quot;motivated&quot; individual. They&#39;re going to do whatever it is they&#39;re going to do. A good example of this is a man named Charles Whitman. He killed 16 people with a assortment of arms. He rained down fire with a bolt action rifle killing as many as 16 people. He also had a M1 carbine but at the range he was shooting it was ineffective. Only after CIVILIANS suppressed him giving the police a chance to assault the building he was in. </p>

<p>Charles Whitman showed what a motivated individual can do with a BOLT ACTION rifle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The AR was invented in the 50’s and has been popular with veterans and hunters alike since then. In fact, before 1986, many of them were full auto and sold pre-Brady Bill, which means no NICS background check. So, we had readily available full auto rifles in abundance since the 1920’s, and AR 15’s since the 50’s. Just an FYI there for ya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, or maybe society and culture was different 50 years ago. Maybe the parents had spine and disciplined their kids. Maybe guns are not the issue, rather a carefree attitude towards raising a child. Maybe it&#39;s the fact that the majority of the mass shooters come from broken homes that were manufactured by the welfare state. Maybe, just maybe, the problem isn&#39;t with guns at all - but with a kid&#39;s upbringing. </p>

<p>BS. Where do you think the guns sold on the street come from? If the general population is disarmed then the criminals will have a much much smaller supply to sell from on the streets. In any European country your average person (not least your average teen!) will have a very hard time trying to obtain any kind of weapon, even a simple handgun will not be easy to come by. </p>

<p>Not a problem. Disarm the population and within a relatively short period those unregistered weapons will be confiscated by cops one by one.</p>

<p>Your average rage-teen is not going to go obtain ARs (and other guns) illegally on the street, a much smaller chance anyway and the price will be much higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked and it&#39;s difficult to find stats. The law was essentially for show and unenforceable. So there was a big drop initially but once everyone realized you don&#39;t actually have to own a gun things went back to normal as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>But it still seems that just the fear or thought that every one is armed made people think twice before they broke the law.</p>

<p>Plus I guarantee that if gun violence went up 89% people would spam the shit out of it to show how bad guns are. Anyway good chat...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m quite far on the left side of the political spectrum but I&#39;m pretty sure that even if you somehow managed to get rid of all the guns in the world you wouldn&#39;t lower the crime rate. There would be school stabbings/bombings/poisonings instead of school shootings. We have to change the mindsets, and I&#39;m not convinced laws are a good way to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked and it&#39;s difficult to find stats. The law was essentially for show and unenforceable. So there was a big drop initially but once everyone realized you don&#39;t actually have to own a gun things went back to normal as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>But it still seems that just the fear or thought that every one is armed made people think twice before they broke the law.</p>

<p>Plus I guarantee that if gun violence went up 89% people would spam the shit out of it to show how bad guns are. Anyway good chat...</p>
