<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/03/opinion/when-a-school-board-victimizes-kids.html">NYT Opinion piece on the issue</a></p>

<p>From wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to reporting by radio show This American Life, which ran an episode in 2014 called &quot;A Not-So-Simple Majority&quot;, the Orthodox Jewish population and the remainder of the District had lived under a system of détente, where private Jewish schools, or yeshivas, of the Orthodox would not receive additional scrutiny in meeting state standards, if the Orthodox population would refrain from voting in school district elections. The Orthodox population broke the détente over special education needs, upset that special education children would not receive public funding at the private schools. In 2005 the Orthodox Jewish population of the district gained majority control of the school board. This new board began reducing the budget and lowering taxes. The communities using the public schools have opposed these actions.</p>

<p>In a 2007 magazine article Dr. Mitchell Schwartz, the superintendent of the district, said that growing Hasidic yeshivas resulted in private school enrollment within the district increasing by a 3 to 4 percent increment per year.</p>

<p>By 2010, due to lowered taxes and reduced budgets, the district&#39;s finances had decreased and services were reduced at the schools, forcing students to take five- and six-year graduation plans instead of four-year plans.</p>

<p>In July 2010 the School Board of the East Ramapo Central School District voted to sell its Hillcrest Elementary School—closed due to budget cuts—to Yeshiva Avir Yakov of New Square. In an official response to an investigation of the sale, New York State Education Commissioner David Steiner stated the East Ramapo board “abused its discretion by hastily approving the sale.” The 12 acre campus, assessed at $10.2 million (market value) by the Assessor’s Office of Clarkstown was given only a $3.2 million appraisal by the school board&#39;s own attorney, Albert D’Agostino. On June 8, 2011 the commissioner of the NY State Education Department halted the sale of the building stating the board failed its fiduciary responsibility to the district when it approved the $3.2 million deal. The sale eventually went through for $4.9 million.</p>

<p>In July, the new state Education Commissioner John King put a hold on the district&#39;s sale of Colton Elementary to Congregation Bais Malka/Hebrew Academy for Special Children with similar questions over the appraisal and bidding process as dogged the blocked sale of the Hillcrest school.</p>

<p>On August 31, 2011, New York State Office of the Comptroller released an audit of the Board, for the period July 1, 2008 to April 13, 2010. The report criticizes the district for a number of serious lapses including failing to put $2.4 million in professional services contracts out to bid, allowing three senior school board members to receive health care through the school district&#39;s insurance pool after they failed to make $15,672 in payments, and failing to maintain proper inventory controls over $2.4 million in textbooks purchased for students not attending public schools, as required under state law. Most unsettling, the audit found that District officials inaccurately projected a June 30, 2010 fund balance of $13 million when preparing District&#39;s 2010-11 austerity budget that was presented to the electorate and on which cutbacks and layoffs were based. In fact, the District&#39;s audited financial statement showed a June 30, 2010, fund balance of $17,793,047, substantially higher than public estimates. </p>

<p>The report states: &quot;The board, along with district officials, failed to fulfill its stewardship, oversight and leadership responsibilities when it failed to establish a proper control environment, implement its own adopted policy and establish policies and procedures required by sound business practices.&quot; The report concludes. &quot;The deficiencies exposed district funds and assets to abuse, waste and/or loss.&quot; The local paper headline was &quot;East Ramapo bungled millions,&quot; and in a scathing editorial, the paper called for a thorough investigation of the board.</p>

<p>During the year 2011, an article titled &quot;Regions Aging Schools Crumble as Finances Falter&quot; by Cathey O&#39;Donnell and Gary Stern, was featured in a local newspaper, The Journal News, which is well known throughout the Lower Hudson Valley of Westchester County, New York. The article was about several old school buildings within the region that were in a current state of disrepair, how much it would cost to fix them and which if any might need to be demolished. One of the school districts mentioned was East Ramapo.</p>

<p>The New York State Education Department (&quot;SED&quot;) has directed the District to post the following letter of non-compliance (Archive), sent to the District by SED on December 19, 2012.</p>

<p>In March 2013 the Associated Press reported that there is much tension in the school district, because the local school board is accused of favoring private schools at the expense of public schools.</p>

<p>In April 2014, the group Rockland Clergy for Social Justice, which includes clerics from Christian, Jewish, and Muslim groups, asked Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo to intervene in the district.</p>

<p>In September 2014, additional attention was brought as the aforementioned episode of This American Life was aired. It was subsequently reaired in June 2017. In November 2014 a state-appointed monitor charged with investigating the district delivered a sharply critical assessment. The monitor, Hank Greenberg, said the board showed favoritism to Jewish students who attend private Orthodox schools in the district, and cut services to the 9,000 district students, mostly black and Hispanic, who attend the district&#39;s public schools. Greenberg accused the board of fiscal mismanagement and a lack of transparency in its dealings. In violation of state laws, it held most of its meetings behind closed doors, only let residents speak at the end of meetings, typically late at night, and inappropriately called critics anti-Semites. Greenberg recommended that the state provide resources that would be delivered more fairly, but stopped short of calling for a state take-over of the district. On June 11, 2015, New York state Assembly members passed a bill that would create a state monitor to oversee the school district.</p>

<p>By 2016, the state legislature and the school board were negotiating a budget compromise, but conflicts continued into 2017.</p>

<p>In November 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the district in US District Court by parents of public school students, district residents, and the local chapter of the NAACP. The plaintiffs charged that by using at-large voting, it is impossible for minority candidates to win competitive elections in the district. The district president stated the district did not set the election rules and that the lawsuit would cost the district money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: There are groups of Orthadox Jews who are trying to overthrow the public school systems and destroy the quality of of education for the public, just so that they can save money on property taxes and other taxes. And anyone who tries to stop them or bring light to the issue is called anti-semetic and harrassed and attacked. </p>

<p>The This American Life episode is how I heard about it, and does a really good job about bring this to light and goes into a lot more detail. </p>

<p>Really worth a listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of problematic things going on in this post... According to their holy text, the Talmud, anyone who is not a Jew is not human. So what they are doing isn&#39;t wrong! They are only using what they see as animals. The same way a farmer used a sheep. It&#39;s their religion. Don&#39;t we have religious freedom in the US? It&#39;s pretty bigoted to think that they shouldn&#39;t be able to practice their religion as it has always traditionally been. These people have been persecuted for millennia because of people like you spreading this king of hate!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most commonly used word for a non-Jew is goy. The word &quot;goy&quot; means &quot;nation,&quot; and refers to the fact that goyim are members of other nations, that is, nations other than the Children of Israel.</p>

<p>There is nothing inherently insulting about the word &quot;goy.&quot; In fact, the Torah occasionally refers to the Jewish people using the term &quot;goy.&quot; Most notably, in Exodus 19:6, G-d says that the Children of Israel will be &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,&quot; that is, a goy kadosh. Because Jews have had so many bad experiences with anti-Semitic non-Jews over the centuries, the term &quot;goy&quot; has taken on some negative connotations, but in general the term is no more insulting than the word &quot;gentile.&quot;</p>

<p>The more insulting terms for non-Jews are shiksa (feminine) and shkutz (masculine). I gather that these words are derived from theHebrew root Shin-Qof-Tzadei, meaning loathsome or abomination. The word shiksa is most commonly used to refer to a non-Jewish woman who is dating or married to a Jewish man, which should give some indication of how strongly Jews are opposed to the idea of intermarriage. The term shkutz is most commonly used to refer to an anti-Semitic man. Both terms can be used in a less serious, more joking way, but in general they should be used with caution.</p>

<p>If you are offended to hear that Jewish culture has a negative term for non-Jews, I would recommend that you stop and think about the many negative terms and stereotypes that your culture has for Jews</p>

<p>Well sure, but differentiated from other nations is sort of a meaningless thing to say. Every nation is differentiated from other nations. That&#39;s kind of the point of having nations....</p>

<p>As to the matter of Jews being a &quot;holy nation&quot; however we would have to look at the Torah. Specifically check out Deuteronomy 10:17 which states &quot;For the Lord your G-d...shows no partiality&quot;. Sounds like we arent that special to me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I suppose it would depend on the Jewish person you were speaking to now wouldn&#39;t it? After all, Jewish people aren&#39;t the fucking Borg. We don&#39;t all think and feel the same way. There are of course Jews who think they are better than everyone else, but most ive met and spoken to dont think that way at all.</p>

<p>Where are you getting this garbage from? The Talmud is not considered a holy text, that would be the Pentatuch. Its a collection of rabbi&#39;s various interpretation of the scriptures (not all of which are considered to be holy). Also since you cant link any proof to back up your claim that the Talmud says that anyone who isnt Jewish is not human, I&#39;m going to assume you either made that up or read it on a website not dedicated to the actual study of Judaism, Jewish scripture, or the Talmud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the episode of &quot;This American Life&quot; was one sided and inaccurate. Another instance, they accuse the school board of forcing the closure of Colman School and its sale to a Jewish organization. The school was on the grounds of an Air Force housing development which shut down in the 90s. The lack of student body caused the school to close down several years before its sale. Wikipedia mostly just references other articles that get their information from TAL. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>maliciously destroyed the school system there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is that they didn&#39;t. If you read the article I linked, there was a lot of tension between the majority Orthodox community and the school board and neither side was completely innocent. The system wasn&#39;t &quot;destroyed&quot;, they function on average about the same as any other district with similar demographics. It&#39;s a perfectly average American public school system, but they have two advantages. One is that they have a much larger budget due to the fact that the majority of families don&#39;t send their kids to PS. Two is that when anything goes wrong, they have someone to blame it on: the local Jewish community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The episode was very balanced and was definitely not one sided. Did you listen to it?</p>

<p>And why does the school being on Air Force housing development have to do with anything? And the lack of student body was most likely because students were being forced out of the school because of the school board running them into the ground. </p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that you ignore most of the main points of the This American Life episode and of the information I already provided, and only focusing on very small things that are not relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By 2010, due to lowered taxes and reduced budgets, the district&#39;s finances had decreased and services were reduced at the schools, forcing students to take five- and six-year graduation plans instead of four-year plans.</p>

<p>In July 2010 the School Board of the East Ramapo Central School District voted to sell its Hillcrest Elementary School—closed due to budget cuts—to Yeshiva Avir Yakov of New Square. In an official response to an investigation of the sale, New York State Education Commissioner David Steiner stated the East Ramapo board “abused its discretion by hastily approving the sale.” The 12 acre campus, assessed at $10.2 million (market value) by the Assessor’s Office of Clarkstown was given only a $3.2 million appraisal by the school board&#39;s own attorney, Albert D’Agostino. On June 8, 2011 the commissioner of the NY State Education Department halted the sale of the building stating the board failed its fiduciary responsibility to the district when it approved the $3.2 million deal. The sale eventually went through for $4.9 million.</p>

<p>On August 31, 2011, New York State Office of the Comptroller released an audit of the Board, for the period July 1, 2008 to April 13, 2010. The report criticizes the district for a number of serious lapses including failing to put $2.4 million in professional services contracts out to bid, allowing three senior school board members to receive health care through the school district&#39;s insurance pool after they failed to make $15,672 in payments, and failing to maintain proper inventory controls over $2.4 million in textbooks purchased for students not attending public schools, as required under state law. Most unsettling, the audit found that District officials inaccurately projected a June 30, 2010 fund balance of $13 million when preparing District&#39;s 2010-11 austerity budget that was presented to the electorate and on which cutbacks and layoffs were based. In fact, the District&#39;s audited financial statement showed a June 30, 2010, fund balance of $17,793,047, substantially higher than public estimates.</p>

<p>In November 2014 a state-appointed monitor charged with investigating the district delivered a sharply critical assessment. The monitor, Hank Greenberg, said the board showed favoritism to Jewish students who attend private Orthodox schools in the district, and cut services to the 9,000 district students, mostly black and Hispanic, who attend the district&#39;s public schools. Greenberg accused the board of fiscal mismanagement and a lack of transparency in its dealings. In violation of state laws, it held most of its meetings behind closed doors, only let residents speak at the end of meetings, typically late at night, and inappropriately called critics anti-Semites. Greenberg recommended that the state provide resources that would be delivered more fairly, but stopped short of calling for a state take-over of the district. On June 11, 2015, New York state Assembly members passed a bill that would create a state monitor to oversee the school district.</p>

<p>In November 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the district in US District Court by parents of public school students, district residents, and the local chapter of the NAACP. The plaintiffs charged that by using at-large voting, it is impossible for minority candidates to win competitive elections in the district. The district president stated the district did not set the election rules and that the lawsuit would cost the district money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read the article I posted? It gives a much more balanced picture of what went down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why does the school being on Air Force housing development have to do with anything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the student body was predominately AF families. When the housing was shut down, the school lost most of its student body. Notably, TAM claimed that the school was forcibly shut down by the board. But the school was closed <em>before</em> there was an Orthodox majority on the board. No one was &quot;forced out&quot;. That was a trend that had been going down in the region for quite some time. Schools had lower and lower attendance every year, due to a larger and larger percentage of the region being Orthodox Jews. Many schools shut down and/or merged. It wasn&#39;t malicious, it was just the way of things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, the episode actually did make some very good points. There is a big issue in Ramapo County and a huge fight going on. But there are two sides in the fight and <em>both</em> are playing dirty. It&#39;s not the innocent poor students against the big evil Jews that it&#39;s portrayed as. See the article I linked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official government reports state that there are issues with the school district, that money is being mismanaged, and that there is corruption. I&#39;m not denying any of that. </p>

<p>The issue is that there is blame to go around on all sides. The school district is pretty average, but they hyped up the failures for TAM and blamed it on the board. TAM also got things wrong, like I said. You can look up Colton School yourself, it wasn&#39;t forced to close it closed to to falling enrollment like many other schools in the district. That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to say. </p>

<p>If someone really wanted to do an honest report, maybe they can find out why several schools claimed to be underfunded, yet put in hundreds of thousands of dollars for new sports facilities. Or the incident in which a Yeshiva teacher was blackmailed and falsely accused of molestation after not backing down from a situation.</p>

<p>Did I trigger you by revealing how you feel about out group members? </p>

<p>Lol not at all! To be honest you seem to be the one who is triggered as your half baked antisemitic bullshit is being torn apart by fact. But hey, if you want to look/be ignorant thats 100 percent your business. Its no skin off my nose if you look like a stupid bigot.</p>

<p>You can lie and deny till you die but we all know what goyim means.  </p>

<p>Lol again! You don&#39;t know a word of Hebrew or Yiddish yet you presume to know what &quot;goyim&quot; means? Again, maybe you should consider being quiet. Your ignorance is showing.</p>
