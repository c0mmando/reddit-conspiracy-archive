       Depends how much freedom you want on Reddit. Should subs be allowed to mock, criticize, insult, poke fun at, discuss or shit talk?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of those things are what got
       <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">
        /r/fatpeoplehate
       </a>
       banned, but
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       also does some of those things.
      </p>

       I personally think topmindsofreddit, fatpeoplehate, subredditdrama should all be allowed to exist. Its just the double standard that seems to be applied which is troubling imo.

       Fat people hate was banned. Why is a equally hate filled forum allowed to exist? All we want to see is some consistency in the enforcement of the tos..

       Okay again with the non response. Very emblematic of a person who is not going to actually engage. Why is every interaction you have on this forum negative and antagonistic? It can't just be a coincidence... You can't be against every conspiracy and spend so much time in a conspiracy forum....
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you prove you aren't a shill? Seriously? Why would you spend so much time talking down to conspiracy theorists isn't that draining with no compensation?

       You should really look into that users history. They have been going around spreading the anti Semitic four Chan meme "go fly a kike." It's truly disturbing that nothing has been done about their hate speech.. IDK it's a slippery slope but they are definitely using linguistic Creoles to spread Nazi dog whistles..

       I made a comment about how I wished TMOR users would contribute to their community instead of engage in vitriol, that sparked someone to message me. It led to a really great, open exchange. I do have the utmost respect for that user for both coming to me directly to challenge my assertion, and for being cordial.

       I truly think that sub is run by a small contingent of users who use the sub as a shield to conduct shady activity on Reddit. Many jump on the bandwagon and mock others, some genuinely seek to draw attention to logical flaws or ridiculous posts, and the truly malicious users can move freely amongst the noise.

       He wasn't a shill, just chose TMOR as his place for critical thinking over this sub. I understand his choice though I don't necessarily agree with it. He's fine by me though.

        I truly think that sub is run by a small contingent of users who use the sub as a shield to conduct shady activity on Reddit. Many jump on the bandwagon and mock others, some genuinely seek to draw attention to logical flaws or ridiculous posts, and the truly malicious users can move freely amongst the noise.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yup, this has been my impression, too. I don't think the sub is organic, although most of the users probably are. Mocking others is addictive and ego-boosting, so its easy to see why people participate in the sub.

       you don't have to mention the god emperor to know what you mean. just mentioning tmor like it's somehow relevant to conspiracy, or
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       conspiracy related is the problem with r/conspiracy. there is no more conspiracy. it's mostly the_dotard crossposts and trump and government cock gobbling.

       Why should they not link to a post here? If you post oyur stuff public then be Aware that it get's noticed in positive or in negative ways, depending on the bullshit factor it contains.

       But would it be ok if someone posted a link to an r/the_donald post in r/politics? Or vice versa? Thats clearly going to cause either sub to swarm to the given post in the other sub.

       Or like, if someone in a sports team subreddit linked to posts in a rival team's subreddit, it would be a dick move because they would do nothing but kill discussion that the organic users of that sub were seeking to have.

       Both Hillary and Trump are puppets on different hands of the same master. You're feeding into the division of this community when you talk like that. Will we ever be able to come together as Americans or will rural people always be retarded Trump voters to you? Because thats just not a healthy outlook.. Be kind. Be humorous. You are a reflection of your works. When you go around saying things that belittle people for their opinions it's just negative. You shouldn't be a negative person. It feeds into our already overly negative world.

       People who are incapable of producing their own ideas tend to spend their time assessing the worthiness of other people's thoughts. Such a condition has always existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ppv1s/well_this_is_hilarious/">
        deeply humiliated recently
       </a>
       so I guess the ones that survived the ridicule (i.e. who are the least capable of introspection and self-reform) have become even more hostile.

       Personally I don't mind them much. The truth fears no bad publicity, and I suspect many tmor lurkers end-up waking up and becoming honest participants here.

       Sorry to say, but that "Study about TMOR" is very probably a troll and completely fake. The guy edited his post history from "I'm in France" to "I'm in Sweden", you can read that in the replies to his original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either his article would already be out and references could be found on the net, or he is still working on it. However, no researcher would ever tell its subjects that he is studying them while studying them. So it should be considered as fake until someone proves it otherwise.

       Exactly... if his research wasn't finished as he claimed, and he told the participants they were under observation...

       That's a really dumb thing to do where, if found out, would invalidate a lot of data.  Or maybe, it's a part of the study.

       Im ok with them existing, but if reddit admins see such a problem with other subs "brigading", why is TMOR allowed to exist without the same threats to shut down the sub?

       As long as they keep their bullshit in their own little club house they shouldn't even be on our radar.. It's all kids stuff, anyway.  If you want to do to something about the brigades, you should be calling on admins to come down on their mods for how cross posting is handled over there.  They always link to us directly which makes it too easy to forget their golden rule.  I've gotten on phoenix about this and he pretty much just told me I'm full of shit because his people would never do such a thing.  Maybe the admins could convince him there's no harm in trying.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But according to Media Matters, some
        <strong>
         white nationalists online have begun painting Heyer’s death a heart attack
        </strong>
        to absolve Fields and portray her murder as a false flag.
       </p>
       <p>
        On September 5, the** fringe right-wing blog Occidental Dissent** published a post** claiming** Heyer’s mother “said in an NBC interview she died of a heart attack,” and went on to blame the supposed “heart attack” on her weight.
       </p>
       <p>
        “
        <strong>
         We can’t find any information about Heather Heyer’s injuries
        </strong>
        or an autopsy,” the blog’s notoriously racist writer Hunter Wallace claimed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Her mother didn't say otherwise. Some White Supremacists just made up that she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also lamented there was no medical report. Well, now there is.

       If you have a better angle showing Heather getting her chest crushed by the car, please post. Heather is not the girl in the teal tank top that was struck by the silver car. She was wearing a black dress with a braid standing beside where the Challenger impacted.

       Believe it or not, it matters to the investigation as to where she was and what caused her death. "The Nazi" can not be used on her death certificate."

       Doesn't matter what a random anon commented. We have the Chief Medical Examiner's report who determined it was from blunt force trauma.

       Doesn't matter if "She was knocked to the ground by protesters fleeing the crash," as there would be no crash to flee from if some Nazi scumfuck didn't drive his car into a group of people.

       First degree is premeditated.. I could easily see a second degree conviction of manslaughter. But first degree? That's going to be a difficult conviction.

       Are you familiar with the Florida judicial system? You do know this is exactly how Zimmerman got off? They couldn't pin it as premeditated... And you call yourself a conspiracy theorist.

       r/tmor must have little man syndrome....what's funny about them Is their whole ideology is doxxing and stalking users who disagree with them... and then come off as if they're

       All of you proved my entire point....the only reason I made the post about r/tmor was to defend the creator of r/conspiracyundone....she left the site for the exact reason all of you were up in arms....she was harassed, bullied and doxxed on a daily basis..
She was called a nazi and multiple other things just for expressing her views...
At no point did she ever post anything anti semitic or close to it but yet she was bullied to the point of leaving Reddit for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no value in trying to explain my actions as even the mods at that sub justified their actions by defending what their users did.

       “I dont dislike all jewish people, but“ you could have stopped right there and nothing would have changed. Do you lump people of other religions together? Is the religion you were born into a life sentence to that faith? Who are the jews you do like? Are they the good jews? What makes them likable?

       Part of the jewish faith (torah) teaches that non jews are not to be treated as humans, and are on the same level as cattle or livestock. If someone believe this, or that jewish people are superior to non jews, i dont like them. In the same sense, if a catholic or muslim believes that a gay person is less than them or less than human, theyre also a bad person imo and i dont like them either.

       My take on this is that if saying things about people’s physical appearance is a problem, whether it be race, gender, size, looks, then it should also be a problem to say things regarding a persons beliefs. I’m not religious, but for those that are, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone, go for it. I subscribe to certain conspiracies, for those that don’t, fine. I don’t believe ALL of them either. To be mocked for having a belief as I’ve seen TMOR do, isn’t acceptable and can cause as much harm to people as calling them fat etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem comes when we say censorship is bad, but then also want things censored. I don’t think there should be any safe spaces on the internet, but I don’t think people should be harassing each other either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying I have a solution, just that there definitely is a problem

       Do they even "brigade" ?  My understanding was they repost things people post in other subs and then proceed to make fun of them.

       Which certainly does beg the question of why it exists when other places like t_d are being attacked.

       I’ve never personally experienced it, but I lurk mainly. It could just be targeting a few individuals, or nothing at all. I think the sub as a whole is probably fine, with a few that paint it in a bad light for everyone else, as this place probably does.

       I don’t know what actions have ever been taken (by he admins) against TMOR users that have been accused of this, but I’ve seen and heard anecdotal reports of conspiracy users getting banned for less.

       I've been banned from 2 subs outright because of posting in t_d.  I've had it brought up at least 5-6 times by people instead of responding to something I've posted as a means to try to avoid interacting with me.

       I actually would agree with that person though. And i will explain to you why: An MSM story is retracable, and the journalist verifiable. This does not mean that any story is true or completely true. But it at least has some way to trace it back, whereas quotes of anonymous persons or unsourced arguments are not.

       Ok i see your point, thats fair. However, i dont believe that just because someone is on tv or writing for a newspaper that their word (without the sources being listed) has more credibility than any unsourced comment i see on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit comments should be fact checked with equal, or maybe slightlier higher scrutiny, than msm articles or televised reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i see your point, and if you go through my comment history to find the comment in question it may make more sense as to why i was shocked by the statement, given the context.

       Well the problem is that they can not really be checked with the same scrutiny as the stories can be checked but the people cannot.

       No worries. I think what youre looking for is "Well the problem is the stories can be checked with the same scrutiny, but the people cannot." Meaning that you can fact check a story easily whether its from msm or a comment, but you cant check the credentials of an online commenter the same way you can check the credentials of a msm reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       However in response Id argue that checking the credentials of the reporter or commenter would be secondary to verifying information in a story, report or comment.

       The difference is that, one of the two is atleast a plausible strawman and the other is not.

      <p>
       This is  a very interesting point that you make. I would argue that Cuomo actually isn't wrong in what he said and possessing stolen documents is in fact illegal. However the chance of you and me being procecuted for it is close to zero. But let's assume for a second that he is wrong in this case. Cuomo is not what I would call a journalist in the truest form. He is the host of a news show. He does not do the investigations, he simply reads his prompter. By journalism I usually mean those that do the investigations and write the reports and articles. Talk shows can be the basis or source of news but rarely are a form of journalism.

       Ah, feeding trolls is fun sometimes. Look at their reactions in here for example, basically "waah, don't try to stifle muh freedom, hypocrite". The hypocrisy of that is so monumental, it's hilarious. Even more delicious than tears, imagining how much they must make themselves cringe sometimes lol.

       You're giving yourself too much credit, kid. I can tell you're a youngin talking about Prom and bullshit like losing your virginity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't take you seriously or get hurt by your words, but I'll be happy to see you gone. Maybe you'll even be smart enough to make an alt next time....oooh, the evolution of a jerkoff.

       Got to earn some admiration, somehow.

       It's not going to be from real life activities, so admiration from other loser trolls on an internet forum will have to do.

       It must be very hard, I know. My words cut so deep that you just can't let it go, even after you said "later loser" like it was the end of things. You just can't stop yourself from going back to this thread and trying to get the last word in. Your heart beats faster in your chest, just like when you first got the ornamental katana hanging on your wall. Your hands shake from anger and excitement.

       You keep flopping between self-righteous rage and mockery, then you keep attempting to fit me into some sort of "SJW" box. It's rather strange, I have to admit. Especially considering that you claimed to be too mature for me several comments ago and you're still going strong.

       Has a use in regards to agendas of higher level mods. This kind of usefulness is comparable to kiting/pulling agro on an MMO in order to disrupt whatever's going on. (Usually trolling or screwing with rival guilds when they do a planned event or whatever.) In order to do that trick, you need a convenient spawn area to pull from. And that sub is it if you're farming lackeys.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main things though is to foment rivalry between multiple subs, or to trawl through a place to try and break up a consensus if it's not on par with what a power-mod prefers. (I wouldn't be surprised if some of these are also paid for as well. Either politicking or drawing more attention to a subject just before some book or movie gets promoted.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If it wasn't useful for something, then I'm sure it wouldn't be allowed given what the stated rules are.

       We have up and down buttons for that, and any sub where flat earth shit gets to the front page should be free to wallow in that garbage all they want.  Just like how the rest of us should be free fuck off to a sub more our speed.

       No worries. I think what youre looking for is "Well the problem is the stories can be checked with the same scrutiny, but the people cannot." Meaning that you can fact check a story easily whether its from msm or a comment, but you cant check the credentials of an online commenter the same way you can check the credentials of a msm reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       However in response Id argue that checking the credentials of the reporter or commenter would be secondary to verifying information in a story, report or comment.
