        Hillary was caught promising the elite that they could ignore her public statements because she was wholly owned by the globalist billionaires.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, Clinton was complicit in the obvious sabotage of Bernie Sanders campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary routinely and publicly refered to the lower classes as "deplorables.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wikileaks Podesta email dump further confirmed that globalist billionaires owned her and dictated foreign policy to her.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does any maintain a straight face and claim that Russian boogeymen stole the election?

       These are not trivial issues. Sanctions have been lifted, reports are coming out about meddling with our cabinet. Kushner and Trump are peddling access and profiting of the presidency. The Clinton's we're not great people but a Putin backed Trump is significantly worse. If any of you Trump supporters had bothered to read your history books, you would understand that the ex-head of the KGB used tryed and true tactics to undermine our democracy. THAT IS BIG FUCKING DEAL.

       Hillary is no saint. She also is no longer in power. Investigate the fuck out of her too, for all I care. I am significantly more concerned about the current puppet regime in POWER. Who at every turn seems to make, at best, ethically challenged choices and at worst illegal choices.

       Yes but like Sessions says when Trump demands him to reopen the case into Hillary, there is not enough evidence to do so. And she's been the target of endless investigations already.

       Do you honestly think Jeff Sessions, of all people, would not open an investigation into Hillary Clinton if he had the evidence to justify it? Or is it more likely that he has looked at all the evidence and decided it was not worth reopening. And again, I am more concerned with possible crimes committed by a sitting President, who has questionable connections.

       The point is that special counsels or investigations take a long time, and this one is actually moving at break neck speed compared to the rest.

      <p>
       There have been around 16 special counsels/investigations. White Water was just one of them.

       Have you been to law school? You just saw its only been half the time of the whitewater investigation. They have more people that are felons and cooperating that whitewater ever got. To set up a case, especially against a sitting president, it has to be air tight.  So when Mueller brings charges even the biggest skeptics can see the evicidence clearly. If all the collusion charges were shown to be correct and they had evidence would you still believe or no?

       Even if the guy's password is password (and it wasn't, he was using a Gmail account and Gmail doesn't allow you to use "password" as a password), it's still a crime to hack and steal the data.

       What actual election rigging did the DNC commit?  There's no proof that they altered votes or registrations, at least not in the DNC file dump.  Between the DNC file dump, the Podesta file dump, and what we've learned from other sources, here's what we know the DNC did.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Used the joint fundraising agreement towards almost solely the benefit of Hillary Clinton.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Used their contacts within the media to publish negative stories about Bernie Sanders, as well as negative stories about Sanders supporters.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Gave Hillary Clinton debate questions in advance.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Altered the debate schedule to favor Hillary Clinton.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Worked with state parties to move primary dates around to put Hillary supporting states' primaries early in the calendar to add to the narrative of her inevitability.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The pied-piper strategy (though that didn't have anything to do with Bernie Sanders or the primary).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       None of that is election rigging.  Most of it is, sadly and unfortunately, legal.  Imo it's a clear violation of Article V Section 4 of
       <a href="https://www.demrulz.org/wp-content/files/DNC_Charter__Bylaws_9.11.2009.pdf">
        The DNC's Charter and Bylaws
       </a>
       which states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee, 
particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the 
Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and 
campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the 
Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party 
Presidential nominating process.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Raising money and accepting donations from people who believed that the DNC was abiding by that charter while they were, in fact, not abiding by that charter, might be an example of fraud, but that's a civil case.  Corporations and non-profits (The DNC is registered as a non-profit) again, sadly and unfortunately, don't usually have people go to prison over fraud and/or violations of their charter and bylaws.

       DWS was fired. Brad Marshall was fired. Luis Miranda was fired. Amy Dacey was fired. Donna Brazille is gone. All the top leadership has been removed, and since Tom Perez was named chair, most of the middle leadership has been replaced too. The DNC is pretty much now either new people or elected officials from the bodies of the state chapters. The candidate they cheated in order to help lost.  She did not prosper.  The public has been made aware of what they did. As a result of what the DNC did, the DNC has pretty much lost most of their donation streams, at least of the small dollar variety, from the most enthusiastic, willing to help, section of their base. They're being sued in several courts for violating their charter &amp; bylaws while accepting donations under that charter.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what extent the DNC can be held accountable for their actions, they have been held accountable and they are being held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much more accountable do they need to be held?  What do you think should happen to hold the DNC more accountable before we even start to look at who committed the data thefts?

       To control us and keep us in living in fear.. It's a common trend to have a boogeyman it seems to distract us from what the deep state is actually doing. Also look into the uranium one deal Hilary was involved with.

       I don't exactly know what you mean, but I do think she is a boogeyman that has powerful connections and being used as a puppet to push their agendas. The fact the she is a high profile women seems indicate she is innocent and people gravitate towards here because of that. Globalist aren't as smart as they think, honestly to me it seems they are outdated by technology and their time is coming to an end.

       Are you so easily distracted that someone just mentioning Hillary as a topic of discussion is enough for you to completely lie about how they've presented the facts? Literally no one has said "don't look at Trump" when talking about Hillary except for the people coming into threads about Hillary stating that they find the news distracting. Self-fulfilling prophecy much?

       Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she's caught in the crosshairs at some point in this investigation.  Washington D.C. is an incredibly incestuous place - it's not like anyone is "associated with one person".  Something this sub tends to forget is that corruption hasn't cornered the market on just one political party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, there is good reason to be concerned with Russia, and anyone thinking we should buddy up with Putin/Russia has been drinking way too much Kool-Aid.

       She won't be.  I guarantee it 100%.  Not a single doubt about it.  Neither will Obama, McCain, or any of the other high level feds who played with Russia regularly.

      <p>
       This is all an elaborate shitshow to distract from the corruption we have baked in here at home.  If the cnn, fox, and nbc followers here applied even 10% of their "concern" about foreign bogeymen and applied it to our own politicians,
       <em>

       we could actually root out some corruption.

       Trump went into the real estate business with this man in 2006, a man who pleaded guilty in 1998 to a stock fraud scheme perpetuated by the Russian Mafia. Real estate is an often used form of money laundering. Guess what year Trump leaked his tax returns? 2005. Coincidence?

       You're minimizing a very real threat because it goes against your bias. All you'll do is downplay any evidence thrown at you and excuse Trump of wrongdoing by saying "all politicians do it." The investigation is valid, and Russia's information warfare is a serious threat.

       Minimizing a very real threat?  Jesus Christ, our government in D.C. is murdering millions of people all over the planet, overthrowing countries for their own greed, poisoning large swathes of the population, monitoring our every thought, action, and location, and you're gonna sit there and tell me that some potential money laundering setup from 15 years ago is the "real threat".

       Like that, right there. You're trying to minimize it. Russia's information warfare takes many different paths, and you're pretending that the MSM is just jumping from one to another at will making it up, instead of reporting the news that comes out about it.

       Fuck off imbecile.  Our government wages wars all over the world.  Not disputable.

       Well, we haven't had a significant confessions, email threads, or confirmed Russian hacking. What we have now is Russian social media posts which are irrelevant when compared to the CTR/ShareBlue shilling machine.

       Trump went into the real estate business with this man in 2006, a man who pleaded guilty in 1998 to a stock fraud scheme perpetuated by the Russian Mafia. Real estate is an often used form of money laundering. Guess what year Trump leaked his tax returns? 2005. Coincidence? Donald Jr said around 2011 that a disproportionate amount of their assets were in Russia. Coincidence? These are just the tips of the iceberg that is the Russian investigation. You're foolish to think it's some giant globalist conspiracy.

       It seems to be a pre amble for the coming war w Russia &amp; China. We're already at war w Russia, just in Syria. We here about it so much to get our ears peppered w how bad they are; making it easier to sell a war. There's much more to it for sure. Mostly ties to $$$ but it seems greasing us up is part of the grand plan.

       I don't exactly know what you mean, but I do think she is a boogeyman that has powerful connections and being used as a puppet to push their agendas. The fact the she is a high profile women seems indicate she is innocent and people gravitate towards here because of that. Globalist aren't as smart as they think, honestly to me it seems they are outdated by technology and their time is coming to an end.

       Are you so easily distracted that someone just mentioning Hillary as a topic of discussion is enough for you to completely lie about how they've presented the facts? Literally no one has said "don't look at Trump" when talking about Hillary except for the people coming into threads about Hillary stating that they find the news distracting. Self-fulfilling prophecy much?

       Just because you don't give a shit about 20 criminal indictments and Trumps entire cabinet either getting fired or resigning, doesn't mean the rest of the world doesn't think anything meaningful has happened since the beginning of this investigation.

       Hillary is no saint. She also is no longer in power. Investigate the fuck out of her too, for all I care. I am significantly more concerned about the current puppet regime in POWER. Who at every turn seems to make, at best, ethically challenged choices and at worst illegal choices.

       Like that, right there. You're trying to minimize it. Russia's information warfare takes many different paths, and you're pretending that the MSM is just jumping from one to another at will making it up, instead of reporting the news that comes out about it.

       You've quickly proven there is no use in arguing with you. I understand our government has flaws, and has done bad things before, but you're just a nut tbh lol. Really? A tyrannical fascist government? Monitoring our every thought and action? I'd love to see what you look like if you could post a picture.

       Is it over?  No?  Then you don't know what evidence there is, and you won't until it's over.  Why are you trying to get people to dismiss it when we don't even have the results?  The least you could do is wait and see.
