        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Going postal, in American English slang, means becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment.</p>

<p>The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1986 onward in which United States Postal Service (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or general public in acts of mass murder. Between 1970 and 1997, more than 40 people were killed by current or former employees in at least 20 incidents of workplace rage.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal</a></p>

<p>There were a rash of them between 1986 and 2006, then they pretty much stopped- with one outlier in 2017. </p>

<p>They certainly lack the emotional devastation of a mass school shooting. </p>

<p>Will &quot;Going Columbine,&quot; replace &quot;Going Postal?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/234488/number-of-amazon-employees/">Amazon.com has around 566,000</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s great pressure to get the mail out to the recipients. With the dropping profitability there&#39;s been a decline in the number of workers. This decline added pressure to the already over-worked employees. Back then was the start of the benefit cuts also. Throw in some crappy managers and inter-personal issues and blam, folks lost their shit.</p>

<p>I understand the same issues exist today but there&#39;s better training on recognizing folks who are starting to lose it. Plus the number of workers that were around back then has dropped due to either attrition or retirement. This means the new hires know what they are getting into with the new paradigm having existed for a while now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the weird, semi-governmental nature of the post office I&#39;m sure there were a lot of very bad management practices and a tendency to validate everything management did as good.  It wouldn&#39;t also surprise me if USPS management didn&#39;t use their police force (Postal Inspectors) as labor enforcers.</p>

<p>All that being said, I&#39;m continually amazed at how well something like the mail actually works in practice.  Lots of horror stories about lost mail, but the system works well for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No things are not more slow paced. Yes there is less first class mail, but we rush almost every day with increased parcels and third class mail. Also parcel pick ups and the routes are adjusted yearly so they are supposed to be an average of hours (but some are longer some are shorter). One of the big reasons for the decline are the counseling resources for postal workers and their families. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless they&#39;re treated better now than they were back then. The pay isn&#39;t worst out there and they get seniority and raises faster than most other comparable work. And most people these days just quit if a job gets as bad as what made people &quot;go postal&quot;. (To be honest there are worse places to work than the PO nowadays, but luckily nothing&#39;s happened so far.)</p>

<p>The school incidents that we hear about now are likely because the affected students lack the rights to just up and leave. They&#39;re forced into a situation where the pent up hostility just keeps building. Again high stress for whatever reason just like that which was causing workplace issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serial killers never seem to completely go away.  Wasn&#39;t there just one recently that was some landscaper?  I guess it was in Toronto, not the US, but not a huge cultural gap.  And then here was the Long Island serial killer not that long ago.</p>

<p>How many suicide cults were there?  Jonestown and Heaven&#39;s Gate are the only ones I can think of in the US, with ones in Japan and Switzerland but I don&#39;t know if you can count them if you&#39;re talking American media influencing domestic events.</p>

<p>Cults specifically haven&#39;t disappeared from the media, Scientology has been bigger in the media with Leah Remini and Paul Haggis&#39; publicity along with the book/documentary &quot;Going Clear&quot; but they&#39;re not a <em>suicide</em> cult.  And polygamous sects in Utah were a big deal for a while, but again not suicide cults.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Internet has made it harder for cults to recruit people.  Pre-internet, if you heard some spiel that was intriguing you might be inclined to get drawn in to find out more.  Now you&#39;d just look it up on Wikipedia or Google, decide its mostly BS and not get involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I think the internet made it easier because its easier to find vulnerable people.

    <div class="md"><p>While it may have made access to vulnerable populations somewhat easier, I&#39;m not sure those are necessarily high-value converts generally speaking.  Maybe if you&#39;re only looking to recruit stooges or cut-outs, sure, but generally speaking I would expect vulnerable populations to be poor recruits overall.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to recruit a college student with ennui and self-doubt, it&#39;s quite another to recruit someone suffering from major depression.  By definition they&#39;re low functioning and would probably be unreliable as general members.  Recruit them and you&#39;re just importing their problems.</p>

Convince a depressed person you have the answers to their problems and you&#39;re going to get a zealous convert, especially if they see improvement in their life.

Your bored college student isn&#39;t going to get far in a cult/extremist group before they realize something&#39;s not right and leave. Someone with real problems will be in pretty deep, if they even realize it at all; and by that point they&#39;d have trouble cutting ties or the group will make it impossible to leave (some claim this is why John Travolta won&#39;t leave Scientology even though it killed his son). </p>

<p>If there&#39;s tech out there that can target people via cellphone and either put voices in their heads or generate freqs that <em>make</em> people think there&#39;s voices, or otherwise agitate people, post offices would have been a good place to test the technology.  The buildings and employees are all federal.  Its kind of a depressing atmosphere already.  If &quot;they&quot; were experimenting with freqs that would agitate people to see who would pop, targeting postal personnel would present a fairly consistent &quot;lab setting&quot; across all areas of the US.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be interesting to see what prescription meds the postal shooters were taking.</p>
