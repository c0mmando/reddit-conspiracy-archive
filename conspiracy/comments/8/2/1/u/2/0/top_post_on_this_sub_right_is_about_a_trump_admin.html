Pharma companies do not need to be involved in MJ pricing.  Its dangerous to teach kids this is another “medicine” you can abuse with a a doc’s perscription.  Fuck the medical community.  Push for full legalization &amp; use if for whatever you want to use it for.  I’m a fucking adult.  If i want to get stoned from a plant i’m not going to a doctor for permission.  Push for full legalization with me or stay in the same basements with me to purchase this shit.  If you advocate for my cause it benefits all of us.  If i advocate for you i dont get shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical marijuana is important. I have epilepsy and when I was younger oil on my feet was the only thing that helped me, when I was having multiple seizures daily. People need to know it’s an option and one that works. Yes recreationally it’s all fine and great but medically it has so much purpose, and people need to know that and even more than that people need to know smoking it isn’t the only thing it is there for and can be used for. This is a sorry excuse to try and support trump and be pro weed at the same time. </p>

<p>Wow. They shouldn&#39;t care about recreational users to start with. Their health is more important than you or my entertainment. And you seem to not give a fuck about them or their health. So selfish and unaware. </p>

<p>Not true.  Medical was an attempt by big Pharma to get control of it because they know people would ask for perscriptions for recreational purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are way off. Big pharma has been fighting medical cannabis. They have only dipped their feet into it because they know they cant stop it at this point. Big pharma doesn&#39;t want a plant that can grow anywhere in the us to replace all of their synthetics. This why the Trump pharma exec said there is no such thing as medical cannabis. They want you on pills, like opiates. </p>

It’s time for the feds to get us out of the basements of our local MJ dealers so we can pay taxes on it in exchange for not having to worry about getting caught with it driving home from our dealers.</p>
