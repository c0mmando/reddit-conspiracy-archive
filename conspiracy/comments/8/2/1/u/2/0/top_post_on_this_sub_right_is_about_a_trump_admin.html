       I dont mind if people use MJ for medical purposes but it is a recreational substance first &amp; the medicinal MJ community is full of people that do not give a fuck about recreational users.  Pharma companies do not need to be involved in MJ pricing.  Its dangerous to teach kids this is another “medicine” you can abuse with a a doc’s perscription.  Fuck the medical community.  Push for full legalization &amp; use if for whatever you want to use it for.  I’m a fucking adult.  If i want to get stoned from a plant i’m not going to a doctor for permission.  Push for full legalization with me or stay in the same basements with me to purchase this shit.  If you advocate for my cause it benefits all of us.  If i advocate for you i dont get shit.

       Thats not enough anymore.  Some states have &amp; the MJ companies in those states cant use banks to run their multi-million dollar businesses because of the feds.  It’s time for the feds to get us out of the basements of our local MJ dealers so we can pay taxes on it in exchange for not having to worry about getting caught with it driving home from our dealers.

       Force the companies to stay all cash &amp; store it in warehouses around denver with ex-military private security companies transporting all the cash to the warehouses?  These companies need to use banks &amp; they cant as long it is against federal law.

       Well unfortunately they already got involved long ago &amp; there are some things we need them to do at this point.  Like allow it to be shipped across state lines.  Maybe Cali has strains i cant get in the southeast that i want to buy online or maybe they have better prices than my local store.

       Go tell that to Colorado &amp; Washington State.  you are delusional!  So you are telling me when most kids are introduced to it in high school they all like hey my glaucoma is acting up lets go get stoned after school to alleviate it.  Thats fucking crazy!  More people smoke recreationally than there are ppl that use it for medical purposes.  I’m not paying $100 to get diagnosed by a doc then go give the pharma guys a cut on top of that.  Only an actual loon would consider that!

       No.  I’m a fucking adult that isnt going to blow a doctor for a fake diagnosis just to get a perscription.  Literally everyone i get stoned with uses it recreationally.  I do not know any medical users.  Everyone smokes!  Stop pretending like there are more medical users than recreational.  You are a perfect example of what i was talking about when i posted this.  Medical MJ advocats are narcissists &amp; do not give a fuck about recreational users.

       I hat to break it to you and your teenage buddies. But there's many people out there who need to consume marijuana for its medical benefits. Asshats like you are why it's hard for he government to take them and their MMJ use seriously.

       Seeing as there's zero chance a state would legalize recreational before/not in conjunction with legalizing medicinal, I don't really see the point of this post. Nice attempt to cover for something absurd said by a Trump-appointed official though.

       Medical marijuana is important. I have epilepsy and when I was younger oil on my feet was the only thing that helped me, when I was having multiple seizures daily. People need to know it’s an option and one that works. Yes recreationally it’s all fine and great but medically it has so much purpose, and people need to know that and even more than that people need to know smoking it isn’t the only thing it is there for and can be used for. This is a sorry excuse to try and support trump and be pro weed at the same time.

       You are way off. Big pharma has been fighting medical cannabis. They have only dipped their feet into it because they know they cant stop it at this point. Big pharma doesn't want a plant that can grow anywhere in the us to replace all of their synthetics. This why the Trump pharma exec said there is no such thing as medical cannabis. They want you on pills, like opiates.

       Thats not enough anymore.  Some states have &amp; the MJ companies in those states cant use banks to run their multi-million dollar businesses because of the feds.  It’s time for the feds to get us out of the basements of our local MJ dealers so we can pay taxes on it in exchange for not having to worry about getting caught with it driving home from our dealers.
