       I have a lot of downtime at work, and I’d like a rabbit hole to go down. I’m okay for anything even if it is a little farfetched, but I’d like it to at least have a decent amount of supporting evidence.

       Depends on what is your current "craziest" accepted conspiracy.  For some, contaminated vaccines will melt brains.  For others, nothing short of matrix archons will do the trick.

       I guess a better way to describe it would be one that made you think “holy fuck my life is a lie” The whole election cycle really opened my eyes. It’s amazing what you can believe with rose goggles placed over your head.

       For financial control of the world Money Masters by Bill Still is good. (3ish hrs)
      </p>
      <p>
       For bloodlines who've ruled the world for thousands of years, Ring of Power is a nice 5 hour time suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       For "the entire western pharma/medical establishment is a murderous scam", Smoke Mirrors, and the Disappearance of Polio is good, along with Dr. Robert Willner Injects HIV into Himself.  They're on slightly different paths, but eventually arrive at the same basic conclusions, that the CDC and other health organizations are mostly fraudulent.  They're nice intros to their rabbit holes, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anti abrahamic religions,
       <em>
        On the Origins of the World
       </em>
       , from the Nag Hammadi library is a fun read.  (Spoiler:  "God" is the bad guy.). It also ties into archons, and other "supernatural" stuff)
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are some of my own favorites.  If any appeal to you, have fun.  Either way, have a good one.

       Titanic/Olympic is an awesome one from the old-school. There is an old British documentary about it that completely reshapes your understanding of the event (i.e. Insurance scam). Not a brain melting conspiracy, but when you see the footage of the Titanic wreckage with the remnants of the 'Olympic' lettering on the side of the ship, its an "oh shit" moment. I'll edit with a link if this topic is of interest to you.

       Yes please. I'm a firm believer in the Olympic Titanic event, for sure, but wasn't aware there was footage of those letters. I imagine some shit went down when they about to begin the project of scanning the ship with the deep-dive cameras.

       Certainly the most dumb conspiracy. Nevermind the fact the Titanic caused an unfathomable amount of bad press for White Star Line. The disaster also killed their senior Captain, and the President of the company almost wound up in the water with the 1500 people who died.

       The plan was for everyone to survive but their co-conspirator ship (The Californian) fucked it all up. Ismay and his company may not have profited off the sinking but it saved White Star Line from immediate death if they had to scrap the Olympic in a traditional way.

       If you watch the documentary you'd learn that the original plan was to have the Californian so close nearby that there would be no loss of life; hence why they were barely filling lifeboats or taking the sinking seriously at first... it was a plan that went awry when the Californian fell asleep at the wheel. Their senior captain had a pretty terrible record and was in a position to do their bidding. No matter how much bas press it got them; they saved money by scrapping the damaged Olympic.

       Yep, after you realize how the music/Hollywood scene is locked-down in terms of what gets promoted and what gets ignored, it makes all the more sense. I hate it too, because you don't fuck with music and the soul, and they did. The military complex connections of David Crosby and Jim Morrison are the tip of the ice berg.

       At first I was like this can be a coincidence and then I was like holy wow this is not even close to a coincidence. We already know MK Ultra was to try mind control stuff, and we also know that lsd was reared for mind control applications. We also know that the cia introduced heroin and other drugs to the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       So combining all of this it seems to me that the Cia used the counter culture, knowing the disgust of the war and everyone joining in the counter culture tried using lsd and other drugs to see if it were possible to control the masses?

       My opinion is this is very probably false, BTW. Also the Dutch guy (ISGP) has much better documentation on the issue but it was much more recent that I saw that one and it did not melt my brain because my brain was quite melted already when I found his page.

       Wow, this one particularly hits hard. My gf always says "How do we know people in the past actually did this stuff, or how do we know this actually happened?" and my answer is "There were books written by people from back then. Shitty to think that so much history is a lie.. One can only hope some aliens have actually paid attention to everything we've ever done and can show us one day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this is an easy theory to prove, as i'm sure if the holocaust progressed Hitler would rewrite Jewish history. Also ISIS has been doing this for the past few years, destroying temples and whatnot.

       How about the one where basically all the aliens are actually time-travelling multi-dimensional different versions of ourselves after anywhere from 100 to 10,000 years in the future, or maybe they are a distinct related species that evolved underground since some prehistoric catastrophe event.

       I think what really attracts me about this type of conspiracy is that everyone's related. We may still try to wipe each other out. But it makes me feel more like I'm in a Star Trek episode than a Zombie Apocalypse.

       For me, the moon landings. I grew up loving that stuff, eating up all stuff space.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I know it was all made up and easy to figure out how. I was not a easy sell at all, and still actively try to prove to myself that it was not faked. I enjoy the challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the why? I completely understand the reason to fake it all during the space race and propaganda wars. Dose not bother me one bit we faked it. And I understand why NASA still rides that train, imagine what would happen if that lack of confidence became nation/world wide.

       The Millennium Report: Collateral Damage: 9/11 and Covert Operations.

      <p>
       tldr; George Bush, CIA, and rogue splinter cells within US Intelligence who call themselves "the Vulcans", secretly orchestrated for decades the overthrow of the USSR by looting as much gold as possible to create a $500 BILLION slush fund War Chest to fund the real Cold War that finally caused the Soviets to implode.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the Conspiracists are wrong about why 9/11 happened. The real reason was to destroy WTC Bldg 7, which stored the bonds that backed the hundreds of billions hoarded by the Vulcans. No more bonds, no more paper trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vulcans started with seizing the Nazi's gold, then the Japanese, then the gold of every nation we invaded or "allied" with at gun point against the Soviets.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why Nixon abandoned the gold standard, to make it easier to hide gold to use as collateral for the bonds. The big banks and the Federal Reserve were all in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1991, the Vulcans bribed several top Russian Generals to stand down and not order military force to prevent rebelling countries from voluntarily withdrawing from the USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Maxwell was the main bribery bag man who handed billion dollar bribes to Russian Generals on his yacht.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maxwell's daughter was the Pimpess who worked for Jeffrey Epstein and who ran his harem of 12 year old pizzas. See now why Epstein is untouchable? It has nothing to do with him and everything to do with the Vulcans owing Maxwell a favor and protecting his daughter to prevent chatter about her father from digging up skeketons.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first found this document, it crashed my entire world view,
      </p>
      <p>
       This document is the Black Pill of Conspiracy Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it means nothing matters. We might as well be pod-batteries slumbering in The Matrix, because the Vulcans are so powerful and so untouchable that no actions from the Conspiracy Theory wing can change a damn thing. In fact, the more that is written about Conspiracy Theory only helps the Vulcans by burying the Truth in a swamp of disinfo and distraction. When you're worried about gay frogs, chemtrails and False-Flag-of-the-Week, presented in an Infotainment format by a rotating cast of actors who dranatize as Face and then Heel. As long as you're emotionally reacting to the Soap Opera of the Week, you won't even notice the shadow of the Vulcans and look up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vulcans simply cannot be stopped. They are so powerful that they don't even need to kill you. They have a hundred better ways to neutralize you, in ways you would never even suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I entered a new phase as a Conspiracy Theorist after reading that document. A phase of despair. The "Monster" really is too big for any one man to stop much less comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       What use are you if you can't even see what's really going on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, even if you could change anything by being more Woke than Thou or by sharing the knowledge with others, would you really want to? The Vulcans can have everyone you know murdered in "accidents" and make your life so bad that you really will shoot yourself 2 times in the back of the head in a Motel 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think you look like Alex Jones by helping to fight the Illuminati, but really you're just a forgettable bug splat on a wind shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the next phase is after the Vulcan Black pill. What can anyone do against invincible power like that? Perhaps the only thing anyone can do is kill as many Glow-in-the-Darks as possible and go out blazing.

       For that matter, what do you mean that the slush fund was used to fund the "real" cold war after the USSR was overthrown? After the soviet republics started breaking away and the eastern bloc had elections it was pretty much over for the USSR already.

       MKUltra where the CIA drugged and tortured people in an effort to unlock the secrets of mind control. Tuskegee syphilis experiments where they intentionally infected black men with syphilis to experiment on them without their consent. Operation Northwoods is pretty stunning, not so much because of the false flag terrorism suggested there in, but because we have hard proof that it was a real government plan.

       But you know what's been getting to me most of all lately? The thirteenth amendment includes a specific loophole to still allow slavery. For convicted criminals. This is why our prison incarceration rates are so fucked up, it's the cheapest manual labor in the USA, effectively slavery. Companies profit from prison space labor, not to mention the for-profit prisons with similar motivations, so the prisons are encouraged to get more prisoners. Combine this with the "war on drugs" where racial minorities and political dissidents have been targeted to be imprisoned on political crimes. They manufacture political prisoners to create slaves. This is one of the reasons there is resistance to ending cannabis prohibition, enslaving people over owning a plant will get you huge returns on investment. Slavery usually does.

       The plan was for everyone to survive but their co-conspirator ship (The Californian) fucked it all up. Ismay and his company may not have profited off the sinking but it saved White Star Line from immediate death if they had to scrap the Olympic in a traditional way.

       At first I was like this can be a coincidence and then I was like holy wow this is not even close to a coincidence. We already know MK Ultra was to try mind control stuff, and we also know that lsd was reared for mind control applications. We also know that the cia introduced heroin and other drugs to the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       So combining all of this it seems to me that the Cia used the counter culture, knowing the disgust of the war and everyone joining in the counter culture tried using lsd and other drugs to see if it were possible to control the masses?
