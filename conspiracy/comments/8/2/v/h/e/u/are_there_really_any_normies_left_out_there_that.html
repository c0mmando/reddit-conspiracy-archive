We are legally being poisoned by the food we eat and the water we drink. We have literally no privacy any more. The government can legally spy on you whenever they damn well please, and your freedom can be stripped away in an instant for activities deemed ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù be the elites who profit from your incarceration.</p>

<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that it‚Äôs very strange for me to think of anyone except the supremely ignorant that still believe in American exceptionalism and freedom.</p>

<p>Edit: I really appreciate you guys taking the time to provide your thoughts and insights. </p>

<p>I just found this song that really connected with me. I hope someone else enjoys it as much as I did.</p>

<p>Me and my friend were talking about this. You can‚Äôt just get in a boat and go somewhere any more. You can‚Äôt just go hiking in Hawaii and find a cool waterfall. You have to pay a toll and the waterfall has a guardrail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so true.  My and my ex went to vist Letchworth State Park here in NYS and it was a bizarre experience.  There was soooo many people around every where.  And rangers walking up and down with guns.  And the weirdest part of it all was there was tons of like... natives hanging out with prison tatoos and blowing blunt smoke in our face.  It was truly and mind warping, bizarre experience that screwed us both up.   There might be areas out in the middle of the forest that you can get away.  But I don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>Also the same with beaches.  There isn&#39;t a coastal area in America that isn&#39;t controlled and restricted and has a million rules.  I think I saw the last of these free beaches get bought up about 10 years ago in Bulgaria.  People used to pitch tents all summer on the beach and just live a free life there with their dogs.  Those days are gone.  Those beaches are owned and controlled now.  Sad.</p>

<p>I would argue that the ability to think critically is an integral component of the definition of intelligence. We forget that the population‚Äôs intelligence forms a bell curve and that half of the US‚Äô 320m people are below average intelligence, by definition.</p>

<p>For the rest, it comes down to coping mechanisms. You chose to vent here. Im in the middle of my crisis too. I&#39;m trying to figure out how I&#39;m going to live my life now knowing the realities of our world. Others have different coping mechanisms. Some chose to learn more and more because greater understanding gives them comfort. Others chose to ignore it and pretend it&#39;s all OK because that seems like the only way they can me normal and happy, but only they know what thoughts keep them up at night. Others chose to fight it and dedicate their life to battling it because, to them, this is their mission.</p>

<p>Everybody is driven by their own defense or coping mechanisms. Learn them and you will understand a lot about human behavior and predictability. </p>

I like to think that our spirits are all intertwined, kinda like we are all the same being. God is all of us put together.

Think of how long the masses have been completely fooled, and think of how so many of us are now &quot;on to them.&quot; Its really only because we have access to so much information, and that we can share that information with like-minded people, all via the internet.</p>

<p>This is why there is such a battle over the Internet right now, be it through subterfuge (Net Neutrality), paid shills and trolls (r/politics and r/tmor), or just straight up censorship (Google, Facebook). I really think we are winning and that they aren&#39;t quite sure what to do at this point. I chose to be optimistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>M8 not everyone is a pathetic commie that waits for gibs instead of forging their own destiny.. you could literally learn to day trade crypto and be making money in a few weeks but instead they have conditioned you to believe that everything is hopelss and you have no option except electing a politician into office that will extort rich people on your behalf. </p>

<p>Pathetic dude.</p>

<p>Anyone who makes money independently online is very thankful for the free market and the internet that connects it. The only gripe we have is that there is too much regulation and regulation breeds monopoly. </p>

<p>Seriously.. Marxx would not have even invented communism in this day and age. His point was that in the industrial era only a very small amount of people could get factory equipment or even farm equipment. That simply isnt the case now. You are staring into a means of production! If you learned some programming skills you could be making money online in your pajamas. When has a communist regime ever allowed their peasants to work from home in their pajamas doing exactly WHAT THEY WANT and not taking orders from anyone! <strong>That is the American dream and it&#39;s available to anyone that can buy a second hand computer for 20 to 50 bucks.</strong> </p>

<p>Also now we have 3D printers and hydroponic gardening. If you were really savvy you could even grow most of your food in an apartment. You can also make your own energy with nothing a but a large container full of waste and bacteria that produce methane or even algae reactors that store solar energy in HYDROCARBONS! You could be your own oil company. </p>

<p>But no. Here you are. Complaining on the internet that you have you dont have opportunities in life and you want to to change the whole system to serve your needs which are not trying to innovate or be creative and just sitting around and complaining! You&#39;ve been conditioned to be the useful idiot of some politician that doesnt want you to learn how to fish for yourself.. instead they want the job so badly of giving you fish they try to make you believe fishing is impossible. </p>

<p>All these problem you speak of need a decentralized private solution. Even homelessness needs one. Why is it that conservative christian churches are the only charitable organizations that provide shelter for and feed homeless in America?! Why do Leftists resist the idea of pooling their resources together online to create a social safety net at the community level? Is it because they have been brainwashed, maybe or is it because they are spiteful and jealous and would rather have 100 percent of 100k than 10 percent of a trillion? And they just want to see their falsely perceived oppressors get extorted, ie billionaires. It is the quintessential example of prejudice, and schadenfreude, like how the feminists seem to be taking pleasure from innocent men being accused of rape and sexual assault.</p>

<p>Here is a tucker carlson interview with such a feminist that seems happy that men are experiencing the adversity that women have experienced historically:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwuVpiHS8u0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwuVpiHS8u0</a></p>

<p>Dont you want to be part of a real solution!? Dont you want to empower yourself?! Do you really not have time to study a bit of computer programming? There is no limit to how much programming we need in the world btw. Don&#39;t you realize that the government is a very flimsy, corrupt, flawed, and unethical solution to your problems? Same with violence. </p>

<p>Dont you want a ROBUST decentralized private solution to your woes? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing delusional about what I said. You&#39;ll see in the future. Sooner or later there is going to be a group of people that prove that voluntarism can provide more for common people than any socialist could! Unlike communism it&#39;s still untested and communism has failed repeatedly! Some third world failed state doesn&#39;t count because we are talking about a decentralized anarchic system with a protocol for how we interact with eachother and form communities.. NAP covers it mostly but I&#39;m of the opinion we need to figure out a way for decentralized networks of trust around nuclear weapons and such things. That solution would be a lot more robust than depending on a bunch of corrupt statists that have knifes to eachother&#39;s throat. </p>

<p>Can you believe the big government types of people come here and post on a conspiracy sub? If you think there are people abusing their authority to fuck people over what in the world would make you want MORE AUTHORITY? I mean seriously what gives? It&#39;s like some kind of pathology, although I&#39;m not trying to be unsophisticated about my understanding of them.. Actually I wish i could understand them better. </p>

People on both sides are fighting over what the government should do for them - like William Wallace said in Braveheart, &quot;fighting over the scraps from Longshanks&#39; table&quot; -  when they should be vesting as little authority in the government as possible. </p>

<p>And instead of this sub being comprised of people who come here to question authority and all its actions, it&#39;s now chok full of lemmings who come here and defend the establishment and beg for it to have more authority over their lives. Sigh.</p>

<p>Wow could you have taken my words and twisted them ANY further? I said some people could learn to DAYTRADE crypto, not mine, which is done with specialized asic chips. There is a kind of day trading called &quot;scalping&quot; which is very easy and a retarded monkey could do it. Also i meant that ANYONE could learn to program with a second hand computer and monetize independendtly. They have web frameworks now where you can make really really slick custom websites by just basically copying and pasting. There are web developers that really just copy and paste all day and independently making money just means freelancing or coming up with other plans like advertising or creating content. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>learn a trade and go into business for themselves and prosper in honest work.</p>

<p>You dont think market speculators do honest work?! What about professional poker players? Gamesmanship is honest... what are you a dickless pussy? Let the best man win and all that.. the intelligent and better players get success and therefore laid which makes our species stronger!!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is shocking just how many people ridicule conspiracy theorists in r/conspiracy. This sub is now manipulated as much, or even more than the other top subscribed subs on Reddit. This is THE most popular sub that is &quot;supposed&quot; to support dissent, and non-compliance of tyrants and government as it currently represents. Its now r/edgypolitics. Just another sub used to push disinforming agendas, that are reinforced by &quot;politic-dividing&quot; shills, that spout that  there is a limit to what you should question. TPTB are trying to drown out the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because people go along with the con doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not aware of it. It&#39;s just easier to give in to the social pressures than it is to resist or fight back. Most people know that governments do horrible things, but most people are also afraid of being smeared as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;. </p>

<p>Think of popular media where you see shop keepers paying &quot;protection&quot; money to organized crime. It&#39;s not that they think it&#39;s a good idea to pay criminals, it&#39;s not that they think the criminals actually protect them somehow, it&#39;s just easier to go with the manipulations than to fight back. Similar idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s two general strains of thought.</p>

<p>On one side are the economic critics of government economic intervention who undervalue legitimate government regulation while underplaying the risks posed by the very rich and corporations.  Paradoxically they tend to support authoritarian policing and security measures, assuming these are mostly directed at others -- poor, minorities, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are those that overvalue government intervention in the economy and are probably too critical of market economies generally when they probably are mostly critical of the very rich and giant corporations.  While they&#39;re critical of authoritarian security measures, they also paradoxically fail to note that intervention is predicated on governmental authority as well as unplaying the necessity of policing to maintain some kind of control over an underclass prone to crime and destabilizing violence.</p>

<p>I think a lot of middle class people wind up trying to reconcile these perspectives and wind up convincing themselves both are right and that the outcome is pretty much normal and OK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are. People who are interested in, for lack of a better term, being woke, are going to find others like them. The longer you associate with those seeking awakening, the further you drift from those asleep. </p>

<p>There is a big class divide at play here, btw. The more wealth you have available for education and travelling, the more likely you are to develop a broader perspective and understand corruption. If you are trapped in debt and shit jobs, or come from a low income family, getting information is harder. Hell, some info is still very protected from otherwise informed people. </p>

<p>I am 22 and I did my degree in science. My partner is finishing hers in a liberal arts program. We are both in Canada. After 22 years of basically ignorance, <em>she</em> was the one to teach me the depths of depravity with which we have treated our natives. I never learned about the Oka crisis, or how the 6 nations were ruined, or how our constant prodding to &quot;help&quot; has destroyed native culture and created a society of suicidal teens and adults with nothing to do and nowhere to go. Its sick. I love Canada and the privilege we have here, but I am seething with rage at how even I was duped. Even then, she still taught me more about our society in a year than I learned in my whole life. </p>
