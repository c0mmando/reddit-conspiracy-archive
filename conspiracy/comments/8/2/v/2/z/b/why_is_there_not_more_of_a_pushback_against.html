<p>That&#39;s a fucked system right there. You can&#39;t look at it from any proper angle and say &quot;this is okay the way it is&quot;.</p>

(or some consciousness spark) will break off all the zombies from that grip. The sad part is this is spreading to the whole damn planet and with (secret) tech its going even faster!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not actually surprised its just that im just disappointed. And after making this post I kinda realized everybody knows it but they know they don&#39;t have a voice. Its all disappointing but I understand the system is like how it is because rich people will do anything they can to get more money. Or rather anyone would do anything for more money. They&#39;re not bad people for abusing loopholes and I wouldn&#39;t directly blame any one group of politicians but money is just too damn good of an incentive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And don&#39;t forget about consolidation in government.  Be wary of suggestions to &quot;regionalize&quot; local government or move decision making up to state level (or even worse, up to federal level).  They pitch this as an efficiency and a cost-savings.  But guess what, the further that decision making moves from your town, the less power the individual has.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I think consolidation of wealth, I think small businesses bought out by mega corps. It&#39;s hard to fight that in our current state of affairs. </p>

<p>Most small business owners pray they can keep afloat long enough to attract the attention of corporations. The only real drive for most people to even open up their own business these days is the idea of selling it for millions. </p>

<p>Why do you think banks are offering practically 0% APR on business loans? We are in an economic depression, the only way to profit is to sell out and contribute to the consolidation of wealth. Which inevitably means more money to the mega corps, which leads to more influence in congress, which is why they only pay 5% taxes now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those arguments that reminds me how much Clinton and Trump have a &quot;same team&quot; kinda deal belying their alleged rivalry. Under Clinton corporate consolidation would have continued unabated and openly (with tax money heading to slightly altered committments), while under Trump this is being done with increased speed under the guise of the false populist &quot;America First&quot; doctrine. </p>

<p>All the promoted differences and conflicts but essentially the same ultimate protection of the corporate coup and the interests of the 1%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I missing something? You pointed to <a href="http://federal-tax-rates.insidegov.com/l/30/1945">http://federal-tax-rates.insidegov.com/l/30/1945</a> , but this does <em>not</em> say that corporations paid 40% of taxes in 1945. It says the the highest marginal corporate tax rate was 40%. <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from">https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from</a> shows that for 2016 corporate income tax paid 9% of federal tax revenues. Income taxes represented 47% of federal tax revenues, with payroll taxes accounting for another 34%. <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/amount-revenue-source">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/amount-revenue-source</a> shows that up to 1943, corporate taxes were a bigger share of federal tax revenues than income taxes, and from 1944 on, income taxes have represented the larger share. I think I understand the argument you are making, but the sources I found actually support it, while your source does not.</p>
