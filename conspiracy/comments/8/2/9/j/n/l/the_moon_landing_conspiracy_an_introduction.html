        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Apollo missions are a conspiracy favorite.  After research and reflection, I remain undecided as to whether the moon landings were faked or not.  I don&#39;t believe we have enough information to decide either way.  However, I absolutely love thinking about the possibility of the moon landings being faked since it would be such an effective and widespread success on the part of NASA and the government.</p>

<p>I want to offer new-comers to the topic a few key resources that I have found helpful/fun to reflect on.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Bart Sibrel&#39;s video was the first thing I saw that made me question my unexamined belief in the moon landings.  Even though his &#39;smoking gun&#39; evidence in the last part hasn&#39;t proved all that effective in the long run, the video covers a number of theories and has eerie music to boot.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI_ZehPOMwI">Apollo 11 Press Conference</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The ancient Greeks had a word - <em>physiognomy</em> - meaning &quot;the assessment of character or personality from a person&#39;s outer appearance, especially the face.&quot; If every person was a competent physiognomer(?), would this press conference alone be sufficient evidence of a massive cover-up? The crucial question is asked at <a href="https://youtu.be/BI_ZehPOMwI?t=2834">47:16</a> - did you see the stars? Watch Neil and Michael Collins scramble to answer &quot;...<strong>NO</strong>&quot;.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lunar Photography</li>
</ul>

<p>There is so much debate about the photographs and videos (how do shadows work, can you see strings etc.) There isn&#39;t anything conclusive as far as I can tell, since we simply do not have enough information to determine, for example, whether the lunar lander actually <strong>IS</strong> a piece of trash or just <em>looks</em> like one. I personally enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVR2WTK20Ig">Marcus Allen&#39;s presentation</a> because he talks about the cameras and photography in general.  Digging around on his <a href="http://aulis.com/">website</a> always yields a new perspective to mull over.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">The Van Allen Belts</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is one, very specific objection to the Apollo missions, namely that the radiation surrounding Earth is lethal and cannot be passed without lead shielding or something else notably absent from NASA&#39;s designs.  First off, there is no question that the radiation belts were initially perceived to be a serious obstacle for manned space flights. <a href="http://moonfaker.com/images/misc/VanAllenBelts-SpaceWorld.pdf">Article 1</a> <a href="https://www.testofbelievers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/VanAllenBelts-SciAm-Mar1959.pdf">Article 2</a>. Van Allen himself expressed his doubts in <a href="http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/vanallen/id/4209/rec/8">this video from 1960</a>, where he refers to the possibility of sending humans into deep space as &#39;premature&#39;.  The question, then, is whether NASA truly solved the problem of radiation, which is another  debate.  I just don&#39;t believe anyone who claims that the radiation problem is non-existent when the literature clearly stated that it was a problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Esoteric/Occult Influences</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone loves a secret society and I&#39;m sorry to say that I do not belong to one. So I don&#39;t know how valid this area of inquiry truly is in the context of the moon landings.  However, the story of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vvbxgm/the-last-of-the-magicians">Jack Parsons</a> and his ties to Aleister Crowley and the occult are very interesting and have stimulated a good amount of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Strange-Angel-Otherworldly-Scientist-Whiteside/dp/0156031795">literature</a> on his other-worldliness.  The circumstances of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqlLGeNZtQ">Gus Grissom&#39;s death</a> can also provoke some scepticism along the lines of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower">whistleblower hypothesis.</a>  Take from it what you will.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kubrick and other anomalies</li>
</ul>

<p>The theory that Kubrick filmed the moon landings may have various sources, but the one I discovered was in the documentary called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1992167/">Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey</a>, where the technique of rear-screen projection is explained quite well.  Other anomalies include such things as the <a href="https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/rpif/videos/making-craters">Sea of Tranquility replica created in Arizona</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxHcC49wm1w">ambiguous moments</a> in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuMIspRzSw">media</a>. The ambiguity goes all the way down, in my opinion, so that distinguishing between a joke and a criticism becomes impossible.</p>

<p>I realize most of this might be old news for veteran theorists on the topic.  Even after all of my studying and thinking, I remain unconvinced that the moon landings were faked.  However, I don&#39;t believe in the &#39;official&#39; story either.  Both sides have evidence in their favor, and I find myself changing sides almost on a daily basis.  It might be the case that the answer is forever hidden from most of us in society, and that the truth belongs only to the elite governors of the human race.  In any case, I hope you find some of this useful in your own mind-adventures and philosophizing.  I also welcome any and all feedback.</p>

<p>Define significant. NASA limits lifetime exposure to radiation of 1 Sv (100 rads). Even if you were to get 100 rads in a single day you probably wouldn&#39;t die from it. It will increase your risk of getting cancer in your lifetime by a couple percentage points, but astronauts know the risk going in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a consideration I am sure many have already thought about.</p>

<p>As far as I know there are virtually no &quot;leakers&quot; or &quot;whistle-blowers&quot; for this particular scenario. Did they just do it better than they did JFK?</p>

<p>For JFK, we can guess there were maybe a few dozen co-conspirators - all seasoned operators? But for Moon Landing, there would have to have been hundreds of people exposed, few of them trained agents.</p>

<p>It would seem to me that after this much time, some of those supposed witnesses to the non-landing would have emerged. Just note that we are getting deathbed confessions for JFK.</p>

<p>How have they kept it secret this long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is at least an answer. Thank you. But still not convinced that there would have to be a hundred or more.</p>

<p>What about the signals that all spacecraft must carry and &quot;ping&quot; back to radio stations on earth. As I recall they did have to turn off commo for certain parts, but thats evidence that cannot be easily faked. There were listeners from all over I&#39;m sure.</p>

I can however provide enough inconsistencies that defy the official narrative and reality according to our only source on the subject, NASA.

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I have already given my honest opinion - that I cannot see enough evidence - circumstantial or direct - to roll the faked Moon Landing up to the level of a 9/11 or JFK.</p>

<p>However - I do think there is one aspect of all this that is very seriously weird. Why did the US/World switch from outer space exploration, which presumably started with the moon shots, to very tame orbital activities? </p>

<p>All of us alive in 1968 when we &quot;reached&quot; the moon thought that Mars would be a couple decades ahead. We were wrong. What stopped that trajectory. Money was claimed, but that cannot be true given the trillions of wealth floating through the deep state. Someones decided to stop it - find the reason and you will have an interesting conspiracy.</p>

<p>one thing that is undeniable is that things don&#39;t add up</p>

<p>Yes, and in multiple places, some related some not. But we cannot allow ourselves to be taken in by conspiracies that are carefully developed - like counterespionage - to devalue the real conspiracies by lumping them in a big messy almost-believable basket. That&#39;s what I fear on several of our current &quot;fringe conspiracies&quot; such as flat earth. This one as well.</p>

<p>By contrast, the 9-11 event should never have been considered as a conspiracy story. It should have been a special-prosecutor criminal case from Week 1, and the real perps should all be in jail right now. Instead, we allowed power to triumph over common sense and intelligence. Let&#39;s never make that mistake again.</p>

<p>Think what computers looked like in the 70&#39;s, think what cars were like, what telephones were like. Now, think about the phones and cars we have today and all the innovation in the last 50 years. Why hasn&#39;t our space technology advanced the same way? You think if we landed the first man on the moon in the 50&#39;s there would be public transit there by now!

<p>Yeah, space is hella sweet, but it&#39;s controlled by a tiny minority of powerful people.

And the special interest under consideration here is cosmology; a discipline that is intimately connected with how human beings find meaning in their lives.</p>

<p>Anyone who mounts the objection: &quot;Why bother with all this deception in the first place?&quot; doesn&#39;t understand the importance of cosmology and how controlling it is of immense tactical significance in political evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. So you&#39;re saying a hammering sound travelled through about 10 layers of fabric in the gloves, and then travelled in the air bladder, up to the microphone, clear as day?</p>

<p>Wow, you guys really believe some wacky stuff. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know fabric was capable of transmitting sound like that. Sure, when there&#39;s air on both sides of the fabric, it won&#39;t stop sound from passing through it. But in a vacuum, where there is no air for transmission, the fabric alone has to reproduce a tapping sound. I&#39;ve just never heard fabric itself make a  hard-tapping sound, have you?</p>

<p>Moving on. Check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/tTNnp1NMlVw?t=17">video</a>, there&#39;s a large wispy shadow that just doesn&#39;t belong. It looks like some sort of cord or harness goes by the light source from a far distance away.</p>

<p>Care to explain?</p>

<p>He&#39;s not saying they scrapped the materials to do it. He is saying they destroyed the technology.

<p>That&#39;s what &quot;it&#39;s a painful process to build&quot; means. It&#39;s a massive undertaking to (re)build the Saturn systems. Why the hell would you build a decades old system?  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the series of articles that made me a non-believer. I think we definitely do have enough evidence to determine conclusively that we did not go to the moon. </p>

<p>People (shills/idiots) love to talk about how we didn&#39;t have the technology to fake it in the 60s - which is exactly why all of the footage looks like bad 70s sci-fi and our current CGI tech is capable of creating <em>far</em> more realistic depictions of space travel for cinema.</p>

I&#39;ve seen some documentaries on the oddities of things like shadows (saying we never went to the moon), but its never been entirely convincing.

<p>I posted the longer clip as the other clips are shorter and remove context. Arguably, when he says they need to solve the problem he could be referring to the computers and technology rather than people, however, he is still saying it’s a problem. I’ve read the quotes from Van Allen that it wasn’t necessarily a problem for the astronauts but considering NASA are still planning for navigating through it surely it must pose some sort of problem?</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p>Just like getting off the ground is a problem they need to solve.</p>

<p>They do it. Quite regularly.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.</p>

<p>Being a problem =/= insurmountable boogeyman</p>

<p>It&#39;s launching humans hundreds to thousands miles off of the Earth.</p>

<p>Every single thing is a problem that needs to be properly solved.</p>

<p>NASA doesn&#39;t currently have the systems available to send astronauts on any extended, beyond LEO trip and re-building a 50 year old system and its associating support structure is ludicrous. Meanwhile research into cheaper, better, safer, faster, cleaner etc etc etc systems goes on.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;we don&#39;t have anything that can currently do X&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they never did. That&#39;s a tremendously ignorant inference made by people with very little understanding (and willingness to actually research) some very simple things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fair enough, and I did try to link to the longer version of the clip as the shorter clip on it&#39;s own without the context makes it seem like it&#39;s a problem NASA has never solved.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know enough about space to say if the Van Allen Belt is significant or not to a missions&#39; success, so what is the issue here? Can the astronauts easily survive going through it and it&#39;s just the technology that is at risk or is there still a significant risk for humans/animals going through it too?</p>

<p>It seems like with regards to NASA and conspiracy theories, either they cannot leave LEO or they have secret space programs that can traverse great distances (not saying I necessarily believe either) </p>

<p>The only thing I find a bit suspicious is a few of the astronauts talked about aliens/UFOs in space (I think Buzz Aldrin mentioned a monolith on Mars and Edgar Mitchell is a big &quot;disclosure&quot; advocate). Personally, I don&#39;t believe aliens exist and it&#39;s a ploy to try and get the public excited so NASA will be granted a bigger budget because public opinion will be fine with increasing the budget if they think it&#39;s likely to result in some sort of alien contact scenario as this has been the staple of huge blockbuster movies, TV shows and books since at least the 1950s.</p>

<p>The issue is  ignorance. People are so obsessed with making up points to support their NASA LIES narrative that they&#39;ll grasp at anything, regardless of the truth behind the system. In this case it&#39;s the belts. We&#39;ve got a brief clip of a dude saying &quot;hey this bit is a little trick&quot; ergo to them it&#39;s a gotcha moment. NASA lies radiation melts your brain etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nonsense.</p>

<p>It certainly needs to be done right. Best to aim for is shooting through one of the thinner areas very quickly. Like running over hot coals, you&#39;re sprinting over them, not taking a leisurely pace.</p>
