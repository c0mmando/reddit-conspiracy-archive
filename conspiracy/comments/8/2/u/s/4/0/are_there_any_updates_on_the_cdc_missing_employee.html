       I was surprised it was on the news at all since you'd think they would try to minimize media coverage on it. But even though they covered it, the general public didn't paid any attention to it and forgot about it either way. It's so crazy that people care more about  jennifer lawrence climbing over a chair while holding a wine glass than a person who randomly goes missing after working closely with diseases. They can invest in "theories" about a celebrity with a drinking problem, but not a care in the world about a missing man who could be spreading some life threatening disease... Weird times indeed.

       I would think that it would be bad PR. Any organization would prefer to not have any damaging information released, especially one who handles and oversees contagious viruses. It surprised me that they went out of their way to mention that he worked for cdc when most missing persons cases usually don't mention their profession. That's just my take on it, I am really just curious as to what happened to him.

       He was still a fucked up murderer, which was the point. Just because someone graduated Harvard doesn't make them a fuck up, in fact I'd argue they're more likely to feel like a fuck up if the rest if thier life doesn't measure up to the standard of a havard grad.

       No I get your point verily. 
And Dubya follows the same line of thinking and was just pushed the opposite direction.

       Generally speaking,  a 16 year old who had the potential to be accepted to Harvard isn't what one would consider a "fuckup."
The kid just had his potential differed elsewhere by higher powers and manipulation.

       but the CDC employee is not a fuck up. he was actively being promoted in his agency.

       he is/was an incredibly intelligent man who obviously worked hard and followed our social contract.
