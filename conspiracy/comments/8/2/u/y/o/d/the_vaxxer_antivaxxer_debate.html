       I think the term anti vaxxer is a misnomer. It’s not that people are against vaccines, it’s more like they are pro-quality control.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s wrong with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you got medical people and CDC people and Democrat and Republican politicians talking about mercury or sterilization agents or whatever in the vaccines, at the very least you should look into it. I’m not saying it’s true or not. I’m saying it deserves honest investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re about to drink your soda, and your friend tells you your sister spit in it while you were in the bathroom, you going to think twice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don’t give a fuck one way or the other about the vaccine issue. I have no stake in the outcome and have pretty much washed my hands of your species, so do what you want. But it’s hilarious when vaccinated people think unvaccinated people are a threat. Well, your kids are vaccinated, what are you worried about?
      </p>
      <p>
       To all the parents who don’t vaccinate your kids: That’s your free will. Don’t listen to this mandate shit. But if your kid dies of something that could have been stopped with a vaccine, then hey live with it. You fucked up. One more dead kid, the world moves on. Walk it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for you pro vaccine nuts. If you give your kids a bunch of vaccines and your healthy kid becomes a drooling idiot fucked for life, then hey, congratulations on being a shitty parent and live with the fact you ruined your kids life. Pat yourself on the back and try to make the next one normal.

       I mostly agree with you. However, some kids are too young for certain vaccines, and can then be exposed to an unvaccinated kid. Just saying. I do agree that those in charge don't always have our best interests in mind. That much is certain, sadly.

       This isn't about food or water. You're the one who started talking about survival and you are also the kind of person who assumes that everyone else is unprepared except for yourself. I gave you not even a hint of information regarding how I live my life yet you assume so much. We live in the 21st century but if you want to live like you're still in the Stone age that's your prerogative.. but that doesn't mean you have to live in a life of fear like it seems you do. You are afraid of disaster and you are afraid of needing to rely on other people. I get that. But that has made you selfish and probably think that just because you don't need anyone else to survive they are screwed and you are not. You should not look down on people who use faucets or don't grow their own food. We have an economic system where as a society everyone works together to form a web of goods/services and are able to enjoy the fruits of everyone's labor. You will only get to enjoy the fruits of your labor because you prefer to cut yourself off from the modern day way of life. Why are you so afraid of catastrophe? Why do you feel the need to belittle others who like being part of an economic team and not run solo? What kind of disasters are you afraid of? I'm honestly asking you these questions with the hope that you will answer them because people like you boggle my mind.

       I’m not afraid of catastrophe. I just prefer to not be dependent on the system. I don’t look down on anyone, I just like to make the best choices for myself and my family that I can, just like anyone else.  I really didn’t think I was making an outlandish claim.

       That's one pessimistic way to see it. I'm against capitalism too btw but I get your point. There are many different economic models out there but everyone fending for themselves without any cooperation is not one of them. Even anarcho systems have cooperation where everyone isn't fending for themselves.

       That's a horrible argument because you can't scale modern day technology with past technology with regard to economic prosperity. Also you are the one that is misinformed because whenever someone says capitalism is bad you immediately tag about socialism. That is a false dichotomy. There are many other forms that exist.. It's not as simple as socialism and capitalism and nothing in between.

       Thats extremely vague and "scale modern day technology with past technology" is meaningless gibberish. The underlying principles are either applicable or not, and either beneficial or detrimental.

       If you bring up technology, be specific. Which technology makes specific moral principles incompatible with which economic systems?

       It's not meaningful gibberish just because you don't understand it. You can't say capitalism is the cause of our current prosperity because you're not taking into consideration technology in the equation. It's impossible to scale back today's tech to historical economies to make comparisons so your argument that capitalism is the reason we are so great today is fallacious. You don't know that and there is no way you can prove it. Just don't use that argument it's old and tired and not to mention ethnocentric. Not only that.. you are too argumentative and needing to be right to make this conversation worth both our times so we should just stop.

       Typical response when someone cant argue their point: "its not worth the time im done here". Horseshit.

       Technology does not change the fundamental nature of morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism, or more specifically, ethical competetion, is the reason shit gets done and advancements are made. Always has been and until we have Dyson Spheres and so much overabundance that everyone can have their own spaceship, all the food and medical care to be basically immortal, then you need advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
       What drives advancement? Competition or laziness? Answer that and youve figured it out.
But really, explain to me what technology really complicates it. I know the answer, but do you? Simple human slaves are the technology that drives nonadaptivity. Slaves run by authoritarian dictatorships and exploited by sell outs like Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook.

       I did argue my point you just fail to see it. Stop being so immature if you want to be taken seriously. I already know your case you don't need to keep repeating it. I believe your argument is fallacious and I explained why already. I already knew that you disagree with me you don't need to keep repeating it. You are arguing for the sake of arguing at this point.. this will keep going on in circles.

       Ah, the good ol' "herd immunity" lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Is Herd Immunity Real?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason for this is that naturally-acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. The vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity. But, there was one major problem – vaccine-induced immunity lasted for only a relatively short period, from 2 to 10 years at most, and then this applies only to humoral immunity. This is why they began, silently, to suggest boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they discovered an even greater problem, the boosters were lasting for only 2 years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those which they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95%. Yet, we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50% or less of the population having vaccine protection. That is, herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we examine the scientific literature, we find that for many of the vaccines protective immunity was 30 to 40%, meaning that 70% to 60% of the public has been without vaccine protection. Again, this would mean that with a 30% to 40% vaccine-effectiveness rate combined with the fact that most people lost their immune protection within 2 to 10 year of being vaccinated, most of us were without the magical 95% number needed for herd immunity. This is why vaccine defenders insist the vaccines have 95% effectiveness rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the mantra of herd immunity, these public-health officials would not be able to justify forced mass vaccinations. I usually give the physicians who question my statement that herd immunity is a myth a simple example. When I was a medical student almost 40 years ago, it was taught that the tetanus vaccine would last a lifetime. Then 30 years after it had been mandated, we discovered that its protection lasted no more than 10 years. Then, I ask my doubting physician if he or she has ever seen a case of tetanus? Most have not. I then tell them to look at the yearly data on tetanus infections – one sees no rise in tetanus cases. The same can be said for measles, mumps, and other childhood infections. It was, and still is, all a myth."

       <p>
        In summary, we have shown that the benefits of many current vaccines extend beyond the direct benefits to indirect benefits, i.e. through the herd effect extending beyond targeted groups to other populations at high risk for complications. Nevertheless, gaps in our knowledge exist about how best to achieve herd immunity. For example, it is unclear whether there are particular formulations that confer better herd immunity than others; a prime example is whether herd immunity achieved through live attenuated influenza vaccine is superior to that achieved with inactivated vaccine. Another area where gaps in our knowledge exist is the optimal use of new vaccines. For example, there are several candidate vaccines for dengue in clinical trials and strategies for how best to use them to establish herd immunity need to be developed.

       No, it's actually pretty bad in reality. If herd immunity actually worked, cases like this would not occur:
      </p>
      <p>
       "An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented vaccination level of 98 per cent. Nineteen (70 per cent) of the cases were students who had histories of measles vaccination at 12 months of age or older and are therefore considered vaccine failures. Persons who were unimmunized or immunized at less than 12 months of age had substantially higher attack rates compared to those immunized on or after 12 months of age. Vaccine failures among apparently adequately vaccinated individuals were sources of infection for at least 48 per cent of the cases in the outbreak. There was no evidence to suggest that waning immunity was a contributing factor among the vaccine failures. Close contact with cases of measles in the high school, source or provider of vaccine, sharing common activities or classes with cases, and verification of the vaccination history were not significant risk factors in the outbreak. The outbreak subsided spontaneously after four generations of illness in the school and demonstrates that when measles is introduced in a highly vaccinated population, vaccine failures may play some role in transmission but that such transmission is not usually sustained."

       That’s really not so bad. Yeah, the vaccines failed, but they still mitigated the spread of the outbreak. That vaccine was probably flawed and insufficiently researched, as many are when the primary motive is profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn’t mean “vaccination” is a bad thing, though it does make me curious about what “vaxxers” interpret “anti-vaxxers” motivation to be. Who stands to benefit from the anti-vax movement?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I agree that vaccines are insufficiently researched and in many cases dangerous. I think things like the flu vaccine may be especially harmful. But I also see that vaccinations are in some cases necessary to prevent major outbreaks of more deadly illnesses.

       If you take into account that vaccines actually shed the virus for sometimes months after vaccination, you could make the argument that the outbreak would never had happened in an unvaccinated school population.

       He never said tetanus is contagious. He is using the example of the tetanus vaccine and it's non-existant immunity as a comparative example to contagious disease vaccines. Both were said to give lifetime immunity, both were discovered to not give lifetime immunity and in fact gave waning immunity if any at all, and both tetanus and the contagious diseases being vaccinated for were in decline and basically non-existant in regards to mortality before the vaccines were introduced.

       Who cares if fewer people are being infected by a non-contagious disease that's typically the product of rusty nails and animal dung? How is that a conclusive sign of the ineffectiveness of the vaccine for the disease?
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if it were, what does that have to do with herd immunity in

       If the link seems 'obvious' to you, try actually spelling out the logic in explicit terms. A common trick of lesser conspiracy theorists is to bury their central premises. Sympathetic readers subconsciously fill in these deliberate blanks with vagaries and assume it all works out while critical readers have to do a
       <em>
        ton
       </em>
       of work just to attack the author's weakest points.

       How so? The tetanus vaccine is ineffective, and even if it were effective, tetanus was so rare it didn't need vaccination to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparitively, measles, mumps, rubella, etc. were on the decline and mortality rates fell drastically before the introduction of vaccines. Thus using ineffective vaccines for diseases that were not deadly or rampant to begin while providing less effective immunity than one would recieve by getting the diseases naturally makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two situations are very similar and the comparison is quite effective whether you want to see it or not.

       That article proved absolutely nothing. The author obviously missed these (as well as many other) cases where outbreaks occur in highly (&gt;95%) vaccinated populations, which should never happen if herd immunity actually worked.

       Actually it's the other way around, vaccines skip through testing, we are told they don't need to be tested because they "save lives".  Big Pharma know how dangerous they are, so refuse to make them unless they are exempted from having to pay out compensation for damages

       My biggest problem with vaccines is informed consent.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        informed consent
       </p>
       <p>
        permission granted in the knowledge of the possible consequences, typically that which is given by a patient to a doctor for treatment with full knowledge of the possible risks and benefits.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mandatory vaccines do not allow for informed consent. If you decide to read up on vaccines and refuse based upon reformed consent, you risk a variety of state enforced repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your child will not be able to attend school. You risk losing your child to CPS and your child may be taken from you and vaccinated against your will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the vaccine makers are not liable for damages so it does not factor into their decision to push vaccines onto our children.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vaccine Court (subsidized by tax payers) has paid out over $3 billion in damages to children harmed by their vaccines.

       Anti-vaccine is a term to turn everything black and white, and shut down the argument.  As Big Pharma know if the real argument is allowed to play out, they lose, as vaccines seriously need fixing.  Problem is, they profit more when they make people sick with vaccines, creating new lifetime customers, so it is not in their interest to fix vaccines.

       Here's the question I have with vaccines. What is causing the explosion of autoimmune diseases?  With all the research and the supposedly best of medical care, shouldn't our population be getting healthier instead of sicker? I raised dogs for awhile and I saw first hand what happened after generations of dogs were vaccinated. This is just now happening in humans. Animals have 4 or 5 generations in just a few years. It takes decades in humans. We are now on our 4th generation of vaccinated humans.  The health problems are exploding. Baby boomers will be dying younger than our parents and grandparents. They are also struggling with health issues. Something isn't right and we had better figure it out before it's to late.

        In summary, we have shown that the benefits of many current vaccines extend beyond the direct benefits to indirect benefits, i.e. through the herd effect extending beyond targeted groups to other populations at high risk for complications. Nevertheless, gaps in our knowledge exist about how best to achieve herd immunity. For example, it is unclear whether there are particular formulations that confer better herd immunity than others; a prime example is whether herd immunity achieved through live attenuated influenza vaccine is superior to that achieved with inactivated vaccine. Another area where gaps in our knowledge exist is the optimal use of new vaccines. For example, there are several candidate vaccines for dengue in clinical trials and strategies for how best to use them to establish herd immunity need to be developed.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then, I ask my doubting physician if he or she has ever seen a case of tetanus? Most have not. I then tell them to look at the yearly data on tetanus infections – one sees no rise in tetanus cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        The same can be said for measles, mumps, and other childhood infections.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We're talking about herd immunity, yes? Somebody needs to tell this guy that Tetanus
       <em>
        isn't contagious.
       </em>

       I don’t live in fear. I live not dependent on water coming from the faucet. I live without needing food from the grocery. 
Good luck responding accordingly.

       He never said tetanus is contagious. He is using the example of the tetanus vaccine and it's non-existant immunity as a comparative example to contagious disease vaccines. Both were said to give lifetime immunity, both were discovered to not give lifetime immunity and in fact gave waning immunity if any at all, and both tetanus and the contagious diseases being vaccinated for were in decline and basically non-existant in regards to mortality before the vaccines were introduced.
