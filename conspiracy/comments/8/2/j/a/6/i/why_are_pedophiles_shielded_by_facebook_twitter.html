<ul>
<li><p>We all know that patriots like Craig Sawyer are getting blue check marks removed from Twitter. We know that Liz Cronkin and others have have had similar problems.</p></li>
<li><p>We all know that Facebook just tested the water on Pedo grooming the other day. Facebook has a very Pedo friendly outlook apparently.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that there were thousands of softcore Pedo videos on Youtube that were finally taken down after outrage about &quot;elsagate&quot;. Youtube is a haven for soft core pedo friendly.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that videos about whistle-blowers regarding Pedophilia are regularly censored across most major social media networks.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that the entire mainstream media was able to &quot;debunk&quot; the entire Pizzagate scandal in only 3 days and regularly attacks people who talk about Pedophilia in the government and media.</p></li>
<li><p>2017 was a record breaking year for Pedo/Human Trafficking busts, yet the MSM spends almost no time covering it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s almost like all of these groups are occupied by Pedophiles that know they are about to burn. They all seem to think by relentlessly attacking Trump, causing distractions and chaos that they will somehow avoid the hammer from dropping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair..It&#39;s not hard to &#39;make someone&#39; a pedophile. Drug em some way and bring a kid in. Take one picture and you have them for life. Eassssssy. Like you don&#39;t even have to be a pedophile to see how &#39;making someone&#39; a pedophile gives you complete control. The ultimate safety net is if the people making the decisions at the top aren&#39;t pedophiles but everyone who works for them is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bet the only “drug” required is power and money, my friend.  You know how people talk about porn addiction, how someone may start out watching soft core porn and eventually they have to keep going more extreme until they can only get off to like “obese amputee scat porn” or something weird like that?</p>

<p>Ok, imagine you are one of the elite. You have Harvey and the rest of Hollywood who can provide any little wannabe star you want, you have enough money to buy the most beautiful prostitutes and escorts in the world, you have regular beautiful women (or men, whatever you are into) lining up because you are rich and powerful...  and then one day, one of your groups says, “you can have all the beautiful people you want as easily as you wish, but the Shaun football player from her hick town had that for free first, but <em>I know a place where you can get something no one else can</em>...” next thing you know you are on a plane to Epstein Island with a beautiful girl you keep telling yourself is just “a young looking 18.”</p>

<p>Just like the Nazi SS May have struggled with the first innocent people they killed, but after that, it was just another day of murder.  Humans are monsters too, and the scary part is that every human has the capacity for evil, not just psychopaths.</p>

<p>I went to on mention that if the goal is to make you shit your pants and think, they should make a real gritty, non bs flick like eyes wide shut.. except like.. throw kids in there somewhere, or have it centered around them.</p>

<p>I can see a film like that causing buzz and controversy like the blair witch project did back in the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most pedophiles in powerful positions don&#39;t <em>start</em> as pedophiles but are lured into blackmail scenarios with underaged teen prostitutes in a bid to control them.  They&#39;re told the truth after, shown the video, and from that point on are under the absolute control of whoever controls the archive.</p>

<p>Within this group there are genuine pedophiles as well.  &quot;True believes,&quot; so to speak.  Whether they run the show or whether they are just a faction within it, who knows.  I would guess the former, but I don&#39;t think they hold so strict to their beliefs as to be impractical.</p>

<p>Some of them also enjoy the thrill of risk and leave hints about their activities in their work.  I believe it makes them feel untouchable since they know the group exerts enough control over the media that they will never truly be investigated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, but also...</p>

<p>Highly intelligent psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. They often are also very charismatic and manipulative. Perfect recipe for positions of authority, especially politics. I would also say that many child abusers are probably psychopaths, not necessarily attracted to children, but children just happen to be the most vulnerable, and that&#39;s attractive to the psychopath.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this theory, which I find extremely interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kakistocracy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“One of the reasons for the intimate association of the power elite with child abuse is that they might use it to maintain their, somewhat hidden, ‘kakistocracy’: government by the worst and most evil people: a highly capable brand of psychopaths if you like.</p>

<p>Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally deep and pervasive understanding leads to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what that the kakistocracy needs: it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse. By abusing children you “give” them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child’s world changes from a world of opportunities, to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats and in doing so giving their autonomy away for life. And they might even carry it over to their children: stultifying their growth towards autonomy. Aristocrats and priests must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with a normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning, and completely ruthless psychopaths. Only a small fraction of the population (say 1%) is psychopath and as such has the benefit of an absence of empathy and a conscience: psychopaths are able to exploit others as if they were tools. Yet the vast majority of them are not particularly evil: they can be ruthless, daring, and callous, but they find mostly norm-abiding ways to be psychopathic: they might be mountaineers, military, ER-doctors, car or insurance salesmen, real-estate brokers, or white-collar criminals. But most are definitely not the high functioning individuals that compare with how the power elite sees themselves, and would accept as their peers. So how do you recruit suitable psychopaths in your midst if they do not advertise themselves as such?</p>

<p>Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completly ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they prove themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while, they become fully accepted a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain the system that gave them so many opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).</p>

<p>I think that what I have sketched above is a useful framework to understand the dynamics of elite child abuse networks. It is never an incident, it is “just” the kakistocracy maintaining and reinvigorating itself: business as usual. But the few moments the abuse networks become exposed it provides and ideal opportunity to glimpse the kakistocracy at work (and frantically protecting itself).”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you think about it, the people who run the system ultimately treat you like you&#39;re a child who does not have a relevant opinion, while they play at being Mommy and Daddy telling you what to do and think.. they control the education system, they control money, they manipulate people out of an authentic existence by subjugating people via money.. it&#39;s entirely about thwarting your ability to have you voice realistically realised.. they revel in treating you like children, and ultimately of course since these systems start at a young age, they are experts in managing and controlling children and creating outcomes that suit them.  So I will go with yes, but I would temper that remark with, they are people who want to interact with people with childish minds so they don&#39;t have to express themselves to people in equivalent relationships.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Youtube is a haven for soft core pedo friendly.&quot; ?
You mean the girls that are doing gymnastics or dancing and uploading it to youtube ?
So you think they shouldn&#39;t be allowed to just enjoy themselves and have fun? 
I dont think these videos should be deleted. I do think tho that there should be an age restriction. For example, adults are not allowed to watch video made by kids.  But then again how will u define it ?
I love watching kids youtubes sometimes. For example that one kid that gets overly excited when he gets/buys a new hot wheels. His pure excitement reactions are just golden.
U need to keep in mind that these platforms are trying to maintain freedom of speech while also maintaining a family friendly environment. And that that balance is not as easy as you might think.
Softcore pedo videos are not limited to the internet. You can see something sexual in any situation. Go to a public swimming pool : oh no kids in bikini. Go to a gym school performance, oh no all these kids in bad poses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.....I believe that Most, if not All, are participating Members of Satanic Cults, relying on Pedophilia and the Sacrificing of Children.  They don&#39;t want that to Go Away....it&#39;s a way of Life to them.  A Religion!  The fact that this has been going on for so long and no one knew or if they did, they looked the other way.  No one Challenged them.  And there are Millions of them!  So Creepy!</p>
