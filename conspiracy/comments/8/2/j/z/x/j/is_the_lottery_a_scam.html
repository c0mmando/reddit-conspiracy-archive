<p>That how I see it too. You are paying for the emotion/excitement of thinking you may win; and that&#39;s fine, people pay for others to elicit emotions all the time (indeed the lottery is a form of entertainment/showbusiness).</p>

<p>But still remains this objection: just hope you might find a suitcase of cash behind the next tree. It is much more likely to happen than actually winning the lottery. And it&#39;s free.</p>

<p>OP <a href="/u/Poon-">/u/Poon-</a> per your question, I had come across <a href="http://www.gematrinator.com/memes/images/WanczykLottery.jpg">this image</a> from Gematrinator. So not pay attention to this if you&#39;re not into (or don&#39;t believe) in understanding the central planners through the numbers/names they use.</p>

<p>Personally I think it is most obviously rigged, and that one doesn&#39;t need esoteric indications that it is. Just two things: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_opportunity_theory">crime opportunity theory</a> (why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> it be rigged?), and the realization that everything to see on TV, hear on the radio and read in the newspaper is fake and scripted (and that surely includes the lottery).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All tax should work that way, if you think about it. We are taxes so the government can afford to do stuff for us. Yet we don&#39;t vote on things like that. We only get to vote on the people that will decide those things.

    <div class="md"><p>Japan kinda does this already.</p>

<p>“Furosato Nozei” is a system that allows taxpayers to ‘donate’ their municipal tax for the following tax year, sending it to any other prefectural tax district instead of the one where they reside currently.</p>

<p>In return, districts offer incentives, usually local goods. In other words, you get free stuff (really good stuff too) just for paying the next tax bill early.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a friend of a friend that won £500,000 and they sent someone to talk to him about his options. They asked if he agreed to publicity (they actually advised him against it in his case as he was really poor on benefits and lots of people around him would potentially harass him for money). He agreed to invest it and get a monthly check into his bank or something along those lines. Most people don&#39;t even know he won anything outside of his family and close friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The number combinations are generated based on unsold tickets. Lottery winners are frauds. Sometimes lottery mafia rewards one of their own with a win. If you remember there were several major criminal cases against lottery workers winning the lottery. If lottery numbers are random and generated live, then why jail lottery workers that won the lottery? 
 People that can remote view or have &quot;psychic&quot; abilities can test this for shits and giggles. Write down numbers you believe are going to win, don&#39;t buy the ticket. Do that until you can correctly predict the outcome at least 5 draws. Then do it again, but this time get the ticket. When you don&#39;t win, go back and look at the previous winning numbers and analyze the pattern. You&#39;ll see how the pattern changed with you buying the ticket that was &quot;supposed to win&quot;. It&#39;s pretty fun.
 Even if you don&#39;t have any abilities but are good at analysis can do the same thing. You can easily find a pattern by looking at past winning numbers. Generate 5-10 combinations of numbers prior to every draw. When you establish the right pattern, get a ticket. Pattern will change.   </p>
