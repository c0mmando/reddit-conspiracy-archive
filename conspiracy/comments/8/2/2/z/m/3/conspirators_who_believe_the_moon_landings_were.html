<p>Or, more accurately, they question what evidence any of us have to corroborate the claims given to us by the authorities and the telescreen (which is controlled by the authorities).</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the &#39;allegory of the cave&#39; attributed to Plato?</p>

<p>If so, ask yourself what evidence you have personally verified -- that is, <strong>empirical evidence</strong> -- which leads you to conclude there is a place a long way away with <em>one sixth of the gravity</em> we experience here on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we made it to the moon and back like six times in the 70’s. But now we can’t get past low earth orbit, with our private companies and technological advancements. Literally how the fuck is that possible?</p>

<p>What other technological advancement in our history have gone BACKWARDS. Especially technology that is funded by billions of dollars annually. As of today, NASA can only travel around 1/100th of the distanced they travelled in the 70’s. That isn’t fishy to anyone else?</p>

<p>The thing with doubting NASA, space ex, anything space relating really, is that after accepting they are lying to you, it generally leads to wanting to find the “why”. And finding the why is where Flat Earth rears it’s head and all credibility is generally lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would it be easier?</p>

<p>I imagine it would be expensive to keep up that fakery. </p>

<p>A plane can&#39;t fly forever or that fast and needs fuel. Holograms are still being r&amp;d and would need lots of energy as well.</p>

<p>Faking all of the data/experiments, faking the daily video blogs, paying off all the astronauts, international cooperation of the cover-up.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t see how it would be cheaper.</p>

<p>Again, why would they fake it?  What&#39;s the motive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes its for PR and to embezzle money, you ever heard of the trillions missing from the DoD books? That&#39;s probably easier than embezzling on the books through contracts I would agree. Why didn&#39;t you just use the annual budgets from the past few years of 18-19B and divide by 365? You get 50 mln+, not that the trivial daily budget amount really matters outside its a lot of money. You can do a lot with 18B+ don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But see, there is a problem with that too. </p>

<p>1) the space station orbits at 17,000 mph.</p>

<p>2) enthusiasts at different points of the globe can daily track it orbit</p>

<p>3) it is impossible for a plane or drone to fly that fast for such a sustained time to mask the fake in such a way that at anytime a land based telescope is able to look up and see a facinilenof the space station.</p>

<p>4) the space station rotates and can be imagined from multiple vantage points rendering a 3d object that looks like the ISS not a modified U2 spy plane.</p>

<p>5) For a drone to mimic the size and speed of the space station under the appropriate magnification it would have to be tiny making the endurance and speed requirements even hard to fulfill.</p>

<p>6) Such a drone would also generate a sonic boom and if traveling at such a speed heat up.</p>

<p>7) The ISS isn’t the only man made structure that can. Be tracked from earth. People documented pictures of space shuttle docking. Also people can get pictures of the x37 and the Chinese manned space space station... all these would have to be similiarly faked with the same or even greater challenges as I described above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they wouldn’t be able to keep up, there would be the hand off points where you would see 2 craft. Also different angles of viewing go vecyou dufferent ankles of the space station which looks like a space station. Also how do you simulate space craft docking or eliminate noise? Finally this would only work for viewers in the direct line if the craft, for viewers if center it would appear to be in a laterally shifted orbit. Not to mention civilian air trafficker control do t note these flying guys. Finally even if it can be a bit slower in your proposal it’s still not going to be fast enough. It’s just very unlikely that this is a U2 mock up of the space station.</p>

<p>Also the same video was likely used because it’s one of the best ones. But don’t take my word for it. I am sure you have friends with a DSLR, go outside and try to zoom in on it using the camera lens. You don’t need to rely on YouTube videos, look for yourself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t own a dslr but my university did have a small observatory and now I went in uni on open telescope night a few times and one time they did the ISS.</p>

<p>Testing the math for all this I learned in high school, that’s how I kniw it exists. Most of this was covered in physics class... it’s basic Newtonian physics. I sent you some PDFs describing the math of how this all works. None of it isn’t terribly complex or a mystery.</p>

<p>If you are going to yell that the sky is falling, might as well do some basic maths first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed, you know it exists and you don&#39;t consider the possibility it couldn&#39;t do you? I am open to the possibility of it being real or fake, and I lean towards fake. The beauty of math is it&#39;s a formal language based on axioms, it can prove a lot of things that don&#39;t exist or have yet to be proven to exist. Math is not reality, it is an attempt to describe reality. The sky isn&#39;t falling at all, there is no alarmist theme to what I am saying, it may be interpreted like that by you because it challenges your world view, but I&#39;m not worried about it, the ISS is rather irrelevant to one&#39;s daily life wouldn&#39;t you agree? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked at it, I did the math, I am encouraging you to do the same. If you look at it and thinks its a spy plane and can show how a plane could fly to mimic such an orbit and why you no one has seen this planes change place... they sure, come here with the proof, it would be compelling...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you edit that extra sentence in the beginning of your last comment? Worried your not coming off as convincing enough? Who are you trying to impress? I stated from the beginning I have an open mind about it and am willing to consider the entire gamut of possibilities, I encourage you to do the same. I really feel no obligation to prove anything to you or whoever &quot;us&quot; is, I might come back with some more information or theorizing, or I might not. For now though I am somewhat entertained by this discourse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did it immediately after I posted, I always look at it an proof it and then edit as needed because at first blush between autocorrect, typos, and structure its not always very good at making my point. </p>

<p>As for entertained, isn&#39;t that what reddit is? We have established you are not here for logic, or discourse... you are here because you get a dopamine release from making up fanciful, simplistic explanations for mundane facts and realities. </p>

<p>Its more exciting for you to exist in a world where Nasa is a trillion dollar hoax, and secret planes fly routes to mimic satellites and space stations, etc. </p>

<p>Its sad and small compared to the world opened up by math and sicence... the beauty of the world codified and dissected and understood. To understand the world in which we exist in a systematic manner, to be aware of our tine place in space and time as part of a vast and near infinite universe... to be able to understand what is too small to see, to model and predict what we find to have preceded us by billions of years and trillions of miles... that is exciting and beautiful but unsettling because of our tiny and small insignificance in the scheme of the universe...</p>

<p>You choose a small, and limited and arbitrary existence.  That is on you...  I don&#39;t much care... I have given you the tools to see a greater, more complex, more beautiful world... but you can choose youtube videos and grainy photo comparisons, its up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For someone who obviously considers themselves highly logical its ironic you are so quick to resort to lame ad hominem. I think you would rather try to pigeon hole me into the type of caricature you can easily dismiss than actually consider the legitimacy of a philosophical standpoint that is at odds to yours. I believe we live on a spiritual plane that is of infinite wonder and possibility right here and now where we are, I don&#39;t need a bunch of fantastical musing of other worldly things to feel that, although I used to hold a perspective very similar to yours so I understand where you are coming from. I like to keep an open mind on all things, try as a thought experiment considering my viewpoint and explore from there, it could end up being a fruitful experience.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess, don’t you look up and hope maybe if space flight keeps getting cheaper, just maybe one day you might be able to look down onto earth from orbit and see your own planet below you in all her breathtaking beauty? I can’t say I personally have high hopes for ever walking on another planet, but science has opened windows in our universe into the tiny, the remote, the huge, the distant, the extraterrestrial... </p>

<p>If space X ever gets the bfr flying and you get a chance, would you not be truly excited to experience earth in this unique way?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure man, I used to think when I was very young about these type of dreams, and if the opportunity presented itself I would take it in a heartbeat. Over time as I have explored different rabbit holes of information and perspectives and have come to hold a much different world view. I am open to being wrong, I have been wrong countless times and am likely to be wrong more in the future, but at this point, as preposterous as it seems, I believe it is much more likely the earth is flat and space as it is described in the standard cosmological model is false. That doesn&#39;t mean the math and the model is not pretty consistent within itself, it means that reality doesn&#39;t actually line up with the model. If you don&#39;t agree with me its all good, that&#39;s just the nature of free will, you have the freedom to think and believe what you choose. I used to think flat earth was retarded before I spent hundreds of hours studying the history and observations and the arguments, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look into the retroreflectors the signals received back are extremely weak, they shoot a 4 mile wide beam at the moon and &quot;Out of 10<sup>17</sup> photons aimed at the reflector, only one is received back on Earth every few seconds, even under good conditions.&quot; (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment</a>).

    <div class="md"><p>it all can be faked and be real at the same time. we have no way of knowing.  i wish some physicist would chime in on the van allen radiation belts.  i think they are too strong to traverse without shielding. twice. how is buzz aldrin still alive?  i didnt do any research on it yet, so...  also all the bubbles and snorkeling astronauts (freemasons)... the female astronauts with the obviously hair-sprayed hair jobs.
i feel its all a huge masonic money-grab. a long con psyop started by jules verne, h.g. wells, (both freemasons) and maintained by the entertainment indusrty.</p>

<p>You think they have the technology to fake the ISS, but not actually make it?</p>

<p>What story is that? Why would they ever announce plans or build the ISS if it wasn&#39;t real, knowing they would have to fake it 24/7. What do they have to gain by faking the ISS?</p>
