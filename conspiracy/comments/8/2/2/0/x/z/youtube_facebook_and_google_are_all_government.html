<p>This comment was made by another <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user, <a href="/u/AngryD09">/u/AngryD09</a></p>

<p>Sums up my thoughts about the entire issue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My new canned response whenever this topic comes up:</p>

<p>YouTube, Facebook and Google are all government supported monopolies providing platforms for mass communication that no other company can provide because of the fact they are all government sponsored monopolies. In case of an emergency or some other tumultuous event, they provide critical communication services that cannot be found anywhere else. Their status as &quot;private companies&quot; is a sham perpetrated to allow themselves and the government to circumvent all kinds of restrictions and regulations that would otherwise be placed on the platforms and associated technologies were they properly classified as government sponsored monopolies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>these are facts. I agree with the OP. yes by definition they are not &quot;monopolies&quot; yet that is only based on the legal definition of &quot;monopolies&quot; sure other search engines, video, and social media platforms exist. But those alternatives are not going to be able to provide the exposure that our beloved government sponsored monopolies can. Bandwidth costs bankroll. What we need is more p2p platforms that share bandwidth of the users instead of paying out the ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah there people. Op, thanks for the implied compliment, I think there is something to what I said...maybe...check this comment thread and the associated post because the guy I&#39;m responding to and another user some pretty valid points:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/81ylpf/comment/dv6pg6j">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/81ylpf/comment/dv6pg6j</a></p>

<p>I still have a lot of questions like what about the need for mass communication in a n emergency situation? Do these companies potentially qualify as public utilities? Would a phone company be able to cut your access to making calls if you were say putting out robo-calls for a political campaign? If these companies aren&#39;t turning a profit and are only propped up by subsidies, then shouldn&#39;t any potential start-up be eligible for the subsidies? If these companies are only really getting subsidies because the government can use them to buy into our &quot;advertiser preferences&quot; using ad companies as fronts and thus by-passing rules and regulations regarding the monitoring of private citizens, search warrants, anti-terror laws, the Constitution and so on, then how does that change the ballgame? </p>

<p>That&#39;s just off the top of my head. It looks to be a very complex issue. Our legal framework was made to be amended and evolve with society. These companies set new precedents and the laws have not yet caught up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You are trying to rationalize things that need no rationalizing.&quot;</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m the one that&#39;s been making the point that Op cited above in just about every post about this issue for the last week and more. Since Op decided to pick it up, I just wanted to step in and say exactly what I just did, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>&quot;We are basically living in 1984 and waking up to a tyrannical government.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes sir, I&#39;m in near total agreement. Hence my contention that the laws need to catch up. Even if one could get funding at this point to take it to court, you&#39;d get shut down. The laws need changing if u want any traction from a legal sense I think. Otherwise a boycott is the best chance anyone has unless a big scandal breaks.</p>

<p>Agreed. That&#39;s why I said I&#39;m pretty sure the laws need changing if anyone wants any sort of chance at proving they are an illegal monopoly in the stricted sense of the definition. Trying to prove they are actually a government platform for mass surveillance and trampling the Constitution will probably not turn out well for anyone at this point, but then I&#39;m kind of a pessimist. I don&#39;t like it, but not much more can be done by little old me other than throwing around a few ideas. Just trying to keep my head above water at this point in my life.</p>

Maybe consider there are bigger grievances worth fighting against. Otherwise, I&#39;m not real sure what you are trying to say, but you don&#39;t know me let alone the challenges I face day to day.
