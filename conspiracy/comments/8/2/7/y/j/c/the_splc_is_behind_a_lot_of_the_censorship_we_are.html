       That's the biggest problem I have with cultural Marxists- they think they can have their cake and eat it too.  Holes or inconsistencies in their arguments get glossed (I was going to say rationalized, but they don't do rationality) over because "muh feelings" or "muh opressions"

       Israel is very different than the us. It is small, a historic holy site and constantly attacked. Their border wall stops bombs, not just brown people. I don't think religion should exist so I'm pretty against it but comparing it to the US is kinda ridiculous.

       I support people to live as they choose. But I do see the movement to have gays marry is an odd movement to fit people who are not Christian to be forced into a Christian relationship archetype. It's deeper than just the right to marry one not. Every relationship regardless of marriage should be recognized as equal by tax and moral code.

       Christians might have invented the ceremony that most of us identify with today when we think of marriage, but the concept of marriage itself predates christianity by thousands of years. Considering this, as well as the fact that marriage itself falls under the jurisdiction of the state, and it seems clear that the church has no business trying to claim ownership over the entire institution of marriage in this country.

       In out culture what do people think when you say marriage? A church? White? Basically the Christian version. Yes it predates but to the masses the Christian story of Adam and Eve is at the core of every wedding. It's simple social analysis.

       It depends. What do you mean by no reason? A guard has no reason to kill an intruder but he might still shoot. Police kill people for no reason and are not punished. I can kill someone with my car for no reason and it might be fine if they were at fault.

       Theft, rape, littering, abandoning children, to name a few. Morality is very simple. And very uniform across cultures. It's when people try to throw in tea ceremony morality that the waters are muddied by the relativists. I agree that cultures will have different minutia of options on fork placement and courting rituals, but the big things are always the same.

       How is killing incarcerated people vs not ever killing any incarerated people a slight difference? Is this moral to you? If this is moral does that mean if you get raped you can rape someone else or is it just tit for tat on murderers?

       Morally, in an arab country, I can beat my wife and thats accepted. Morally, in a first world country, I can simply make fun of a woman and that isn't accepted. How are these slight differences?

       Fair enough, biblical morality is not the norm but a. it ain't great, b. most Christians espouse very dubious moral values that are not directly related to the faith, they pick and choose but still prefer not to take any personal responsibility. So it is shit, but most Christians don't follow them in so far as they even can be well-defined and instead follow shit beliefs that then hide behind Christianity. 100% applies to other faiths, while Abrahamic faiths are the most egregious plus a little scientology.

       The group that has held and continues to hold the most power in the United States is a privileged class. What you're slowly starting to see is other people becoming equals, and apparently a lack of privilege is terrifying. Imagine in a century where things are almost equal.

       By that logic, no one ever censors anything. "The Nazis didn't censor anyone; people were free to go to dozens of other countries and say what they were trying to say."
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean I'm saying the censorship by a corporation rises to the same level as censorship by a government â€” it doesn't â€” but it's censorship nonetheless.

       By your logic, no company can ever enforce their own community guidelines ever again or risk being attacked for censorship. The truth is YT isn't censoring anyone. There are a metric fuckton of right-wing and conspiracy related channels on YT right now that aren't being frozen or banned or anything, why? If YT was trying to censor right-wing or conspiracy-related channels then why are they leaving 99% of them untouched?

       Legally, and maybe ethically, they can enforce it however they want, but that does not make them immune from criticism. (It's funny how strict you are in your definition of "censorship," yet so loose in that of "attack".)

       No, that's not the truth. Censorship means blocking the dissemination of certain information, which they are demonstrably doing.

       I'm not sure what their reasoning is, and they haven't really divulged it. It seems they're more interested in specific topics rather than conspiracy theories in general, but we don't know if they're done yet.

       If you could demonstrate that they're not doing it because it violates their community guidelines then maybe I could support the criticism, but that hasn't been demonstrated at all. In fact, YT seems to be pretty reasonable about reviewing how their community guidelines are enforced. I'm sure with as many videos as they have to review in a day mistakes are made but they seem willing to fix those mistakes when brought to their attention.

        Mike Cernovich, the right-wing agitator and conspiracy theorist, said Wednesday that his channel, which has more than 66,000 subscribers, had been given a strike.
        <strong>
         (Mr. Cernovich said Saturday that YouTube had reversed the strike and that the video that had been banned was again available on the site.)
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Infowars, the conspiracy theory outlet headed by Alex Jones, said Tuesday that it had received a second strike in two weeks, both for videos about the Parkland shooting.
        <strong>
         (Infowars, which has more than 2.2 million YouTube subscribers, later said the second strike had been removed.)
