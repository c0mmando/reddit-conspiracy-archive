<p>Christians might have invented the ceremony that most of us identify with today when we think of marriage, but the concept of marriage itself predates christianity by thousands of years. Considering this, as well as the fact that marriage itself falls under the jurisdiction of the state, and it seems clear that the church has no business trying to claim ownership over the entire institution of marriage in this country. </p>

<p>The US has the death sentence when other first world countries don&#39;t. We also have abortion.</p>

<p>Like it or not almost every culture on earth rapes animals for food. Other than that, rape was very culturally accepted in Hollywood up until recently.</p>

<p>Theft can mean taxes to some, to others like poorer americans stealing is morally justified becuase its a victimless crime and keeps you fed.</p>

<p>Littering depends on what is dumped, we allow waste to be dumped into rivers and cigarettes to be discarded where ever.</p>

<p>Japanese kids stay home past their 30&#39;s where as American kids are abandoned at 18 for the most part.</p>

<p>See how all these things are relative to the place you are raised and the time we live in?</p>

<p>You have always been allowed to marry, and there have been numerous governmental benefits bestowed upon this previously group of privileged snowflakes. Allowing more people to marry does not diminish your rights.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, biblical morality is not the norm but a. it ain&#39;t great, b. most Christians espouse very dubious moral values that are not directly related to the faith, they pick and choose but still prefer not to take any personal responsibility. So it is shit, but most Christians don&#39;t follow them in so far as they even can be well-defined and instead follow shit beliefs that then hide behind Christianity. 100% applies to other faiths, while Abrahamic faiths are the most egregious plus a little scientology.</p>

<p>The group that has held and continues to hold the most power in the United States is a privileged class. What you&#39;re slowly starting to see is other people becoming equals, and apparently a lack of privilege is terrifying. Imagine in a century where things are almost equal. <em>Terror</em>.</p>

<p>Legally, and maybe ethically, they can enforce it however they want, but that does not make them immune from criticism. (It&#39;s funny how strict you are in your definition of &quot;censorship,&quot; yet so loose in that of &quot;attack&quot;.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what their reasoning is, and they haven&#39;t really divulged it. It seems they&#39;re more interested in specific topics rather than conspiracy theories in general, but we don&#39;t know if they&#39;re done yet. </p>

<p>If you could demonstrate that they&#39;re not doing it because it violates their community guidelines then maybe I could support the criticism, but that hasn&#39;t been demonstrated at all. In fact, YT seems to be pretty reasonable about reviewing how their community guidelines are enforced.
