<p>submitted 7 minutes ago by snagamarazzer</p>

<p>Other fucking cultures.. even the fucking Amish.. that clip the other day, where they all pitched in and helped their buddy build, what would have been a very expensive barn.. That shit got whipped off in a day.</p>

<p>Now you tell me.. if he didn&#39;t have all that, lol.. &quot;help&quot; from his buddies.. That&#39;d be just like you.. trying to &quot;go it alone&quot; at the game of life. Pay for that fuckin barn eh. It&#39;d take you 10 years.. now all he has to do is pay for the wood and shit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fuckin think so.. You tell me, that the way we&#39;re rolling now, as a white guy, in our north american society.. is the best way.. where, lol.. you fucking despise the cunt in traffic cause he&#39;s holding you up.. Meanwhile if you&#39;d relax and take your time and go hey.. how are you doing? That mother fucker could help you build your barn on the weekend.</p>

<p>Now extrapolate that.. guys around here, who know welding, plumbing.. fixing shit.. All that shit is going to waste, fighting each other.</p>

<p>Extrapolate that.. this other mother fucker in some what the fuck shit country.. he&#39;s just like you. But for some reason.. you all fuckin hate each other.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where the problem is.. religion. Those muslim guys.. that&#39;s complicated.. meanwhile, you being a white guy.. they don&#39;t fuckin like even me saying fuck.. I don&#39;t know how you can fix that.</p>

<p>But what I do know is shit like roofing, plumbing.. wood.. shit like that.. put your religious shit aside.. we&#39;ll go.. ok, I&#39;ll believe in your god once I see the mother fucker.. but until then you go.. ok your barn here, we can fix your shit on the weekend, for free labour. Materials.. what&#39;s wood.. trees.. what&#39;s metal. mined shit. Do you know a guy who can go mine shit.. what&#39;s metal, that&#39;s mining shit right.</p>

<p>Well, you go deep down the rabbit hole enough.. I know a guy who can go mine shit.. etc.. And watch.. that fuckin whole fuckin barn is free. lol. Peace-out. lol. Mother-fuckers.. lol ;-)</p>

<p>And, lol.. you know what happens after that.. oh.. all of a sudden, lol.. later on.. oh it&#39;s YOU, that needs a free barn eh.. ok.. now it&#39;s your turn to get helped. That&#39;s ok, because we owe you a favour for helping us for free on your weekend in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, we could change the world, its just going to be a whole lot of work, fighting the whole way I&#39;m sure, and most people aren&#39;t even knowledgeable about anything anymore to just start something like that. It would def prob be a one step forward two steps back kinda deal for a while and yes it would be incredibly difficult to actually get people to work let alone work together. I have lived all up and down the east coast, from tip to tip and from major metro areas to central Appalachia where you don&#39;t even have a single neighbor for miles. OP is totally right and you are too but that being said we can all start changing in our own lives and project that outwards...spread love, knowledge, do whats right even when you don&#39;t want to, reach out to your neighbors and then that eventually will spread to the community. Not everyone is on board at first but I&#39;m telling you once it starts to catch fire, its spreads and theres no stopping it. The system is broke and while we can&#39;t &quot;fix&quot; it per say we know the broken parts. Destroy the system with their own rules. Im not going be giving any ideas out on a public forum but I&#39;m sure smart individuals can do a google search, even though google sucks, or even think about it a little bit and come up with some ideas. Build your communities and fellow man up and you&#39;ll notice a change in everyones lives. Its amazing to live in a community that has actually realized this compared to the places where everyone is just &quot;trying to make a o of it on their own&quot; or have really all but given up and given in to the whole bullshit of it all bc they are scared of what happens when they step out of line. Thats just it, be smart, don&#39;t &quot;step out of line&quot;, use the line to your advantage. Fuck them. This is a war as far as I&#39;m concerned. The people who run the world may be doing it from the shadows for the most part, but we know how they have accomplished this and we know how they use things against us. Break the system. Overload it and boggle it down while building yourself, your family, your neighbors, your community and your fellow human being up. People who dont agree or like the idea of change is either because they are in on the game or bc they are scared people who have been shaped to think they ARE helpless and will lose everything and ultimately for nothing if they try to be a part some sort of &quot;change.&quot; Show them they don&#39;t have to be and fuck the former group of people who got us here to begin with. Theres nothing left to lose lol our futures were sold out a long, long time ago. the jokes on us </p>

<p>I say - who cares?
If they are happy and healthy and the building doesnt fall down why would anyone comes to inspect it? 
If the building does fall down they will call their neighbors to come help them rebuild. And if someone gets hurt in the fall they will pray to god a d god will help their kids get healthy.</p>

<p>&quot;What I saw was just shocking to me,” Monica Bien, who signed up for Nextdoor after moving to Oakland in 2014, said of the comments on the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bc an Internet forum or social media is not community lol of course people are just bitching. Its a whole lot of people who use a internet site to complain and bitch instead of actually doing something. The people who are doing &quot;things&quot; for their communities aren&#39;t spending time ranting on line and doing nothing..so ultimately you end up with giant echo-chambers that is somehow contorted into, &quot;Well, look at these people. They tried. It failed. Your idea of building a community back up just won&#39;t work bc people will only complain about nonsense online instead of coming out of their homes and putting screens down.&quot; Don&#39;t let things like this fool you into the same way of thinking. Every story has two sides and anyone posting in this sub knows theres many reasons grass roots efforts and sometimes something that was either a bad idea from the start fails or something that maybe could&#39;ve been a decent idea was highjacked to make appear as something it isn&#39;t either so it fails or are designed to fail from the very start. Its being done systematically to discourage you and everyone else who is sick of this fucked up shit continuing in our homes and lives and communities. Don&#39;t buy into it. </p>

Same clothes, etc. They have no reason not to trust each other. And if someone goes against the group, they get kicked out before their cancer spreads. </p>

<p>The Amish help each other because they are invested in each other. If Uncle Zeb&#39;s house collapses, the rest of the community will have to help him build it and they will have to help him until things get back to normal. Uncle Zeb also helped them build all their houses and did other stuff along the way for them, so they kind of owe it to him.</p>

<p>Now, some of the commie sympathizers here are going to say &quot;well, this is why socialism is good&quot;. Well, the reason this whole thing works is because it happened naturally and everyone in the community is doing their part to make it work. IRL, people aren&#39;t going to be willing to share their house, car and time with other people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ummm I have lived in areas where theres whole counties of mostly amish residents. These people care about everyone. They may be weary of new people going into their community and families because they are close knit and they do rely on each other. Community is important to them and keeping community together is imperative for them. They help and provide and donate and give their blood and sweat to their entire communities, not just the amish families. They see it as their duty in life to be like this, not to judge people based on their &quot;sins&quot; or because they look, live and think differently than them. Yeah, they may not allow you to marry into their families without putting up a fight but if thats the case, it says something about that person and the reasons these people are so skeptical of them. Its not racist or bigoted. Its their families and they want people who hold the same values and shared goals and someone they know will put in just as much effort towards keeping the community a sustainable community. I think we could all learn a lot from that way of life honestly. Im not down for everything, don&#39;t get me wrong, bc I&#39;m not religious like them but I wouldn&#39;t let that stop me or them from working together with each other for a better world for everyone. Its really stupid not to work together with our fellow man because this is just something we all are going to lose.</p>
