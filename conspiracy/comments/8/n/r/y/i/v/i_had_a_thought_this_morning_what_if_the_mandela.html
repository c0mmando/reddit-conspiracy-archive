<p>I’ve seen world geographical changes. </p>

<p>Shill:  yes bit unless you commit them to memory it’s easy to forget. </p>

<p>I’m a professor of teacher at a university and have a PHD (or some degree can’t remember)</p>

<p>Shill:  ok so you say that but can you prove you’re a professor </p>

<p>So you are questioning my credentials </p>

<p>Shill: well you could be expanding on the truth. But I think you’ll find it’s always been there </p>

<p>So on and so on. </p>

<p>No answer no debate just lawyer like questions at every turn. So instead of arguing. Why not one day ask any of us to enlighten you on this fascinating topic ? No ? Because you’re not interested in being enlightened. So fine expect crap to get thrown back your way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed it’s unprovable. So why do so many waste time stating the obvious ? links to Wikipedia and the such. I know what shill means it means someone who comes in with a pretext of another agenda with no interest in actually conversing with the subject.  Ie if I wanted to cover up a conspiracy I would pay people to be online and make sure they did everything to derail and debunk all conversations regarding said conspiracy. And that’s exactly what we experience. </p>

<p>Those of us that have been effected of course went to memory first. Not one of us jumped up and said oh we are in a multi verse or simulation. I saw things change in a matter of days like it was shouting at me for some reason. I didn’t ask for this to happen. I didn’t force it or look into it and thought it sounded cool.  I saw a clip of the a team van change from black to the one with a grey top in the same clip within three days. And i was looking for that damn van. </p>

<p>A friend sent me the clip I was relieved to see the all black van and thought, well maybe it wasn’t in all the episodes, and maybe the grey one was there and I missed it. Both me and a friend saw it. I then showed another friend the same clip three days later and the all black van had a grey top now. I was dumbstruck. My friend who saw it as well had a sleepless night and was quite frankly scared. It’s mind blowing and it altered my whole reality. No one but no one can tell me it’s my memory because I’ve already been through that one. So what’s the point ? Why don’t shills go tell people they  didn’t really see ghosts ? It’s the same principle. Yet the good Samaritans they are decide to repeat the same thing tune and time again that it’s our memory.</p>

<p>It’s not just memory either. How about the new discovery of zealandia ? You heard of zealandia ? Nope nor had I. Nor those two ridges coming out the top of New Zealand. And I was looking in that area at volcanoes including vinatu only two weeks ago. And because of the ME I try and memorise where things are. And nope those two ridges are new to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve experienced several changes in human anatomy (after nursing school, lol!)  like bone plates behind our eye sockets, pelvis is shaped differently, and we no longer have floating ribs. Globally there are a ton that I have experienced and a few of them are New Zealand&#39;s orientation to Australia; South America and Africa are depicted much closer together; the fact that globes and world maps no longer show the northern polar ice cap; Kazakhstan never existed for me until 2 years ago. I am on my phone so I don&#39;t have my list or my reference/residue materials so that&#39;s not all of them just the main ones I can think of right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised you&#39;d say that if you did go to nursing school, because I trained in medical practice (which has much more vigorous anatomy requirements) and the proposed changes to anatomy I&#39;ve heard on the subject do in fact reek of poorly learned anatomy. The more vigorous arguments I&#39;ve seen on the subject come from people who have zero anatomical education at all and propose changes that one way or the other lack a context that makes sense. If you change one thing about anatomy, there are several others that would likely also have to happen. For example the pelvis shape changes would imply a change in load bearing which would require additional changes that are never mentioned. Also we do have &quot;floating ribs&quot; still. </p>

<p>The problem with the mandela effect is it is a non-falsifiable theory, where any skepticism is met with &quot;Oh but something something, your timeline, my timeline&quot;. This precludes any open possibility to discuss the rationality, or rather, irrationality of some of the proposed changes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about the concept of the mandela effect, and it&#39;s something I read about occasionally, but more often than not the proposed changes are clearly something that has a very easily misrecalled aspect that many people are making mistakes over. Normally one would double check, and go &quot;oh, oops&quot;, but instead people over the internet are noticing that this common mistake is made by others, and are determined somehow the entire space-time continuum has changed instead of them being wrong. </p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised that as someone who claims to have studied nursing, you have forgotten the vast collection of evidence related to the subjectivity of memory, misrecollection and the incidence of false or wrongly associated memory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last sentence is exactly why I tend to disbelieve anyone who claims &quot;anatomy changed, I was a (insert medical training here)&quot;--because those same people then either dismiss or discredit the (seriously LARGE) amount of evidence pointing out how memory rewrites itself constantly, how bad knowledge can propagate and how (in general) faulty memories can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is as well that anatomy especially is massively complex and is a lifelong process of learning and relearning and revising knowledge. Anyone who has studied anatomy will also know that misremembering the shape, location or some other aspect of the body is quite common, and it&#39;s the reason you need to keep on top of your knowledge.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always initially skeptical when I hear those claims myself, though being in the situation I am I realise rationally that there must be people around who also have such training. It really boggles my mind however how some people might believe there was a point in their studies that their knowledge of the human body became &quot;utterly complete and photographically perfect for all time&quot; where any error must be the fact of a temporal anomaly instead of a really mundane error that they will have made before in their studies in the past. Indeed also saying &quot;I once studied&quot; instead of saying &quot;I am studying&quot; makes it increasingly likely that this is the case, as anyone who has studied human physiology will tell you, that you forget so much when it&#39;s not in the next examination anymore. </p>

What is it about the ME that people feel the need to come on and argue with people all the time ? It’s a serious question because if there was some good reason I’d understand. Maybe it’s too much for people to see ? Are people afraid of the outcome if too many people see it ? I could post that if just had group sex with a leprechaun and a unicorn and no one would say a thing. I’d probably be asked how big a leprechauns dick was but that’s probably about it. Yet I post that there were four three in the car with jfk I get called laughable, just wrong, I missed it because I wasn’t paying attention, there were always six here’s a link to Wikipedia (love that one). </p>

<p>We see nonsense posts in the ME forum diluting from any real ones. I was seeing some recently and wondered what had happened. When a big change or popular change happens the rubbish posts come out. And sure enough it seems for a bunch of people fruit loops has changed to froot loops (changed for me several months ago mind you) </p>

<p>It’s a serious question. Let’s hypothesise it’s real. What reason would there be to keep it under wraps ? Let’s not do the whole it’s your memory thing let’s just pretend for a second it was real. </p>

<p>Is there any good telling people who see things change that it’s their memory ? Are the shills being good Samaritans and acting for the best interests of people who have had their minds blown and come here looking for answers. ?</p>

<p>I’m aware you’re not a shill. But what would your take be on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to believe in all of those fake events.  Just over a year ago.  It&#39;s really a matter of combining a bunch of things found while down the rabbit hole.  Once I started seeing people doing weird blood rituals (spirit cooking) and seeing how they are tied to Hollywood, music, politics (Mariana Avramovic) etc I started to have a &quot;chicken or egg&quot; question.  Do people that are rich just naturally get board and start doing weird occult rituals and drinking blood?  Or do these rituals have something to do with being rich an famous?</p>

<p>If you study out the Masons and the Vatican/Jesuits it&#39;s pretty clear they all worship the &quot;light bearer&quot; who is Lucifer.  If you study the New Age stuff many times their &quot;spirit guides&quot; will try to convince them Lucifer is God.  When you look at Alien abduction accounts there are account of how using the name &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; caused them to end.</p>

<p>It became clear to me the spiritual realm is real.  I still wan&#39;st sold on God until the outer space hoax hit me.  Moon landing hoax, ISS hoax, then the shape of the earth hoax.  I remembered my older brother showing me verses in the Bible when I was a kid that eluded to the earth being a plain and not a sphere.  This caused me to start praying to God for the first time in my life.  Not like you do when you are a child asking him to show or give you something but for real like knowing for sure he was there. </p>

<p>From there crazy stuff started happening.  I started researching all the different religions.  It became clear that King James Bible beveling Christians are the most derided group throughout history.  The Vatican burned them, they are mocked today.  This entire world is against them and it&#39;s because they have the truth.  I know this because I started reading it and everything that I had questions about from my research into the occult was answered.  Everything about the shape of the earth and outer space.  Why they would fake it.  Who runs this world.  Everything is in there.  There is also this bit about what we need to do to get saved and received the Holy Spirit.  So I did that as well and boom, born again!  It&#39;s real man, just like that star wars quote.  The Holy Spirit, the Devil,Jesus Christ/God it&#39;s real, all of it!</p>

<p>All you need to do to be saved is repent and believe the gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>That means there is nothing you can do to save yourself.  Jesus Christ paid what you owe with his blood.  God himself in the flesh died for you so you don&#39;t have to spend an eternity in a lake of fire.  No water baptism, no donating to charity, no going to a place called Church, no nothing saves you but the blood atonement of Jesus Christ which you get by believing in the above gospel.</p>

<p>So after I repented, believed the above gospel and called out to God admitting all of this in prayer my life changed in such a supernatural way.  It&#39;s all real.  I can only bear witness for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are some things that have been sanctified out of me since that day (not all at once).  Note that none of this is me doing it but the Holy Spirit because I know my old self and my old self wouldn&#39;t be able to do any of this.</p>

<p>Stopped watching porn.
Stopped masturbating.
Stopped smoking pot.
Stooped drinking alcohol.
Stopped swearing.
My love TV/Movies movies has left me but I do still enjoy trying to pick up on the subliminal programming.
My love for video games has significantly diminished.  This one is unreal because video games were my favorite thing in the word.
My feelings of patriotism went away.
My anger and hate went away.
Newfound craving to read and study the King James Bible.
I&#39;m now able to understand the scriptures, without the Holy Ghost teaching you (subconsciously) they don&#39;t make all that much sense.
Prayers are now answered regularly.
I told my story to a friend from highschool (my pot dealer) and he got saved the next day.
Love increased.
Marriage saved.
Probably more i&#39;m not thinking of.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give two rips about this world anymore because now I realize this life is all about reconciling ourselves to God through Jesus Christ.  All I want to do is tell everyone about Jesus Christ and that he&#39;s real.  This isn&#39;t just some lifestyle it&#39;s the truth and Lucifer is real and he means business.  Hell is real and it&#39;s not a never ending party, it&#39;s eternal torment.  Lots of very nice, good, well meaning people (by human standards) will be in hell because of his deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell that to any alcoholic, pot head, who watches porn (all of them), video gamer.  Things that aren&#39;t possible are supernatural.  You will have to wait for the catching away of the saints (aka rapture) for the next overt act of God.  This is why we receive grace through faith in this dispensation.  They will lie to cover up with perhaps:</p>

<p>Aliens took them!</p>

<p>New age event happened!</p>

<p>It was project Blue Beam!</p>

<p>Secret energy weapon depopulation agenda activated!</p>

<p>God is real but he took the bad people!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even going to bother going over prayers answered because you will deny them if you can&#39;t admit the list of stuff above isn&#39;t in the realm of reality for a person to turn around.</p>

<p>The plea of a man burning in hell asking for someone to warn his brothers:</p>

<p>Luk 16:27  Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&#39;s house: 
Luk 16:28  For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
Luk 16:29  Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
Luk 16:30  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. 
Luk 16:31  And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All those things you quit are all things I&#39;ve considered trying to stop as well. I never get very far due to procrastination. I wasn&#39;t raised religious and am not currently, but ever since I was a kid I&#39;ve had the innate feeling of knowing that those gives are just inherently wrong. Sure I still masturbate every day and watch porn but I know it&#39;s not the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The only reason I&#39;m opening up to you is that I started pot this year (not recreationally, only for sleeping as it&#39;s been the only thing to cure my insomnia). But when I do pot, something happens to my lust. All of a sudden these bizarre extreme sexual fetishes overwhelm me as if they are natural. And the little voice in my head makes me lust for awful things and tell me to say Hail Satan. All from just doing pot, I had never previously been interested in any of that stuff.</p>

<p>So in my mind I kind of believe now that the Devil is real and trying to take my soul. It probably had my soul already. </p>

<p>But before I can study the Bible I want to know WHY there is this battle between good and evil and why God can&#39;t just step in and get rid of the Devil instead of only being accessible to the most pious people who meticulously lead a clean life and study the Bible. Why doesn&#39;t God step in for people who&#39;s souls are being taken by the Devil? Why is God waiting so long for his grand plan and letting so many people be taken by the Devil? Why are all these occult elites and politicians going through with all their evil deeds if they know they are going to go to hell at the end of it? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been approached by complete strangers who have urged me to turn to God, it&#39;s like they can see the Devil in me or something. I don&#39;t know why they are attracted to pushing Christianity on me in particular. I would try to give God a go but I need my questions answered first or at least show me a sign that he really exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man,</p>

<p>About the pot thing.  All drugs that alter the mind are actually Sorcery (pharmakeia).  The devil controls Hollywood and wants people to believe Sorcery is throwing fireballs and Necromancy is summoning a zombie.  It&#39;s not like that.  Sorcery is opening up your mind for devils (demons) to come into you and start interacting with the world around you.  Necromancy is attempting to communicate with dead people which actually can&#39;t be done in this time period.  Anyone who does that is talking to a devil (demon) that is representing whatever relative they want.  There are devils that have been with you your entire life (familiar spirits) and know everything about you.  They could tell you stuff you think is impossible for anyone but someone very close to you to know.  They might even pretend to be your &quot;higher self&quot; they know that much about you.  That&#39;s how they deceive.</p>

<p>So when you smoke pot, you open yourself up to these unclean spirits. </p>

<p>Eph 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

<p>These principalities and powers are the unclean spirits, fallen angels, devils (demons), and the Devil/Satan/Lucifer himself.  They are unseen spiritual entities that can influence you.  You have three places a thought can come from.  Yourself, God, a devil (or the Devil).  Without being under the blood of Jesus Christ it&#39;s very hard to discern where these thoughts come from and you will simply think they are your own.  That&#39;s why you notice these things when you smoke.  Here is an interesting site I found that goes over these in more detail based on Witchcraft doctrine.  Notice the power that is associated with weed (Jah) is also the God of the Rastafarians.  Marley has many songs about Jah who is the god (small g) of Marijuana: <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1050.html">http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1050.html</a></p>

<p>As for the exact nature of God&#39;s overall plan I think it&#39;s quite impossible to understand it in our current state.  What I do know is what&#39;s happening now was not how it was suppose to be.  He created a perfect world and created humans as immortal living souls that were in his image.  I personally think he allowed us to fall so that we knew what we had.  If you were born into perfection, how would you know what perfection was?  How could you appreciate it?  This trial we are going through will allow us to truly appreciate perfection when it returns and give God all he glory he deserves.</p>

<p>Most of the Elite that are running the world is completely deceived by Lucifer.  He has them either thinking he&#39;s the true god because he does have the ability to give them things here.  So anyone looking for direct evidence of god will find when they sacrifice a child to Lucifer they gain temporal power where as the true God does not do that kind of thing.  His servants are humble and never in places of power.  You will never find a true saved Christian on national television for instance.  You can just know all of those guys are false wolves preaching a false gospel.  The other option is some elite do know God is real but they are in open rebellion against him with Lucifer.  They know that they can&#39;t get to heaven but are trying to attain immortality so that they can live forever here on Earth.  This is why they are trying to move toward the singularity to download their consciousness into machines.  Then there is the 3rd option which is that many elite may not even be human.  Angels can look exactly like humans and you could never tell them apart.  Fallen angels would have the same ability.  So how many elite are actually fallen angels just having their way with humanity?  Only God knows.  I think this is where the &quot;lizard people&quot; type conspiracy comes from.  They are on to something but not the truth.</p>

<p>God will send his children to people seeking the truth.  That&#39;s probably why you have had so many seemingly random interactions with strangers who are Christian.  Members of the body of Christ who go witnessing simply pray that God leads them and go out and walk around spreading the gospel.  The Holy Ghost is working in your life.</p>

<p>Lastly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>only being accessible to the most pious people who meticulously lead a clean life and study the Bible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This right here is the biggest misconception of all.  God saves sinners just as they are.  There is no clean life involved.  God cleans up a person&#39;s life AFTER they get saved and that&#39;s only if hey yield to the Holy Spirit&#39;s convictions.  It&#39;s very possible to be a saved Christian with an unclean life.  Their life will tend to spiral out of control as God will chastise them but if they are not reading the Bible and realize what is happening they will start blaming him and the Bible teaches God will even kill them off.  He doesn&#39;t do that to unsaved people because they are still technically children of the Devil.  He only does that to his own Children who he &quot;takes to the woodshed&quot; so to speak.</p>

<p>The following is a comprehensive salvation message I&#39;ve prepared for people like you.  Please read it and do what it says, you can be saved and become a child of God in the next 10 minutes if you so find yourself able to truly believe what I tell you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Every single one of us are sinners and all good we do is nothing to God:</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>Repenting is just changing your mind about what you think of yourself, what you think of sin, what you think about God.</p>

<p>2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>

<p>The law existed to expose what sin was and to show us that none of us can keep it.</p>

<p>Rom 3:20  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>

<p>Jas 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is the Word of God who is God who came in the flesh:</p>

<p>Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.  Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>

<p>Joh 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ has the fulness of the Godhead bodily (Godhead is the real word, not the Catholic trinity)</p>

<p>Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.  Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ the man is the son of God but his deity side is God the Father. He was both man and God.</p>

<p>Joh_10:30  I and my Father are one.</p>

<p>This is hard for us to understand but it is a GREAT MYSTERY. Nobody understands how God works or how he can be Jesus and the Father and the Holy Ghost and all that. Don&#39;t get caught up in it. He is God and he is the only God. Anyone claiming to understand exactly how it works is deceived or lying.</p>

<p>1Ti_3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>

<p>All you need to do to be saved is repent and believe the Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>The wages for sin is death but Jesus died for us and was resurrected to pay the price we owe:</p>

<p>Rom_6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ died the most horrible death you can imagine. He did this for YOU personally. He did all the work for you. His blood washes you clean. There is nothing you can do to save yourself. You can only be saved by believing the above gospel. Once you are saved you have Jesus Christ&#39;s perfect righteousness:</p>

<p>Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>

<p>Simply cry out to the Lord in the best way you know how telling him you understand all of this and you know what he did for you.  Ask him to save you and if you are repentant and truly believe the gospel in your heart he will.  Then he will send you the Holy Spirit!!!!</p>

<p>Rom_10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>

<p>Once you are saved, you cannot lose your salvation in this dispensation. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise:</p>

<p>Eph_4:30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>

<p>God spiritually circumcises your soul from your flesh so when your flesh sins, it no longer pollutes your soul:</p>

<p>Col 2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: Col 2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man. I don&#39;t know how to truly believe even if I tried. I&#39;m so used to worry and anxiety and people deceiving me. As a result it&#39;s hard to open myself even when I know it&#39;s inherently right. I haven&#39;t even read the Bible before. I did start it once and got up to the Moses part, but I read it like a story book, which is probably not right. </p>

<p>One of the people who approached me on the street (they weren&#39;t a preacher or anything, they were delivering mail) said specifically that God had told him to speak to me. Then he said a prayer and asked God to show me something. He said I should get a feeling of something. But nothing happened. Maybe I&#39;m too controlled by Satan.</p>

<p>If God would just send a sign I would believe without a doubt. Why can&#39;t he read my thoughts and show me such a sign? Such as a voice in my head assuring me that he exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like that guy may have been a Charismatic.  That isn&#39;t really how God works in this dispensation.  He will just send someone to give you the Gospel truth which is different than any other religion and all false forms of Christianity.  The truth is God himself humbled himself, became a man and voluntarily died to pay for your transgression against him and all he requires is repentance and belief in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as the final blood sacrifice for your sins.  No other belief system in the world other than true Bible believing Christianity says that God himself paid it all because he knew we couldn&#39;t do it.  Everyone else is trying to make it on their own righteousness which will not be enough.  Everyone likes to compare themselves to other humans and never to a perfect holy God.  God requires perfection and we just can&#39;t meet the cut.  He has to give us his own perfection with a spiritual transaction that happens when you repent and believe the gospel.</p>

<p>As for your question about a sign:</p>

<p>1Co_1:22  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>

<p>The deal is God gave sings to Israel all throughout history but they rejected him all along the way.  It&#39;s crazy when you think about it.  He was with them in a pillar of fire.  They witnessed what he did in Egypt.  They witnessed the defeat of the Giants.  It didn&#39;t matter.  They ended up breaking his laws and rejecting God.  Some Romans and the Jewish priests even had evidence Jesus Christ resurrected but they paid to have it covered up.  As humans we will do whatever we can to deny the truth.</p>

<p>God will not give us a sign.  It&#39;s the dispensation of Grace right now.  It&#39;s honestly the best time to be alive.  We have God&#39;s merciful grace and the shed blood of Jesus Christ that we get for simply believing the gospel.</p>

<p>I would suggest you simply start praying to God and ask him to show you the truth.  Don&#39;t ask for signs, they aren&#39;t for us Gentiles.  There are many worldly conspiracies you can research that heavily point to the existence of Lucifer (the great deceiver).  This kind of sums it all up in one short video:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I&#39;m going to get a KJV Bible though, I looked at one in a shop and it appears to be in the original text of olde English which will be difficult to understand. Is this the right one to read or is there like a revised version in modern English? </p>

<p>Also, can I still be interested in New Age stuff like healing crystals and the Zodiac? I will stay away from psychics and tarot etc but crystals seem innocuous enough right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, as long as it&#39;s: &quot;The Authorized King James Bible&quot;</p>

<p>Just keep reading even if you don&#39;t understand.  I recommend reading in this order first</p>

<p>John
Romans - Philemon</p>

<p>The Bible is about past, present, and future.  John will give you a good idea of Jesus and his ministry but realize that his preaching was directed at Jews and his gospel is the Kingdom Gospel which is a future thing.</p>

<p>Romans-Philemon is doctrine for the Church age, the dispensation of Grace.  Paul is our Apostle and he has the &quot;Gospel of the uncircumcision&quot; which is for us today and is what I presented to you above.  It&#39;s important to rightly divide the word of truth into dispensations, covenants, and context (2 Tim 2:15).</p>

<p>Once you finish Romans - Philemon go ahead and start at Genesis and go cover to cover but quickly skim genealogies, detailed instructions on how to build the temple, numbering Israel and very dry things like that.  As as unsaved person that will cause you to stop reading for sure.</p>

<p>You will not be able to truly understand the Bible until you accept Jesus Christ as your savior by repenting and believing the gospel.  Once you get the Holy Spirit inside you he will teach you the scriptures.  It&#39;s like reading in darkness vs light.  It&#39;s impossible to explain but the KJV Scriptures is a spiritual book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, can I still be interested in New Age stuff like healing crystals and the Zodiac? I will stay away from psychics and tarot etc but crystals seem innocuous enough right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would recommend you do not do these things.  They attract unclean spirits.  All the instructions int he new age for how to avoid them actually attracts them.  They just represent themselves are good things:</p>

<p>2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>

<p>The Scriptures specifically teach against doing any of these things.  It&#39;s all child&#39;s play compared to the Holy Spirit which is the real deal.  Once you get him indwelling in you, you will understand what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I&#39;ll get a hardcopy of the KJV. I have it on my Kindle but I suppose that Kindles weren&#39;t the way that God intended people to read the Bible. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a pity about the crystals and stuff. I am only drawn to those things because I have serious mental illness and barely keep myself together. I&#39;ve tried everything. Even natural herbs and supplements etc, not just conventional meds.

<p>Yeah you pretty much called it there.  If you come to accept the gospel you will have your mind renewed:</p>

<p>Rom_12:2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>

<p>1Co 2:16  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. </p>

<p>Eph 4:23  And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; </p>

<p>2Co_5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. There&#39;s just one small hiccup. I am gay.</p>

<p>Now, from what I&#39;ve surmised, your community thinks homosexuality is a curse from Satan. Even in young kids who identify as gay or boys who want to dress like girls etc; Satan has cursed them. It&#39;s Satan&#39;s way of disrespecting natural life on Earth and giving spite to God. And so is, obviously, anal sex. </p>

<p>I have been around the block but am no whore and have no intention of becoming one. I just want to find a boyfriend similar to me (WOKE, for starters) to marry and settle down with and be in love. And obviously in our love for each other, we would have sex. </p>

<p>But if this is some sort of perverse defiance to God, and makes it impossible for me to gain the Holy Spirit, then you need to tell me now. </p>

<p>Contrary to what some Christians believe, one can&#39;t just become straight and &quot;not be gay&quot; by willing it. Believe me, I tried when I first discovered I was gay when I was 14. It broke me and I ended up failing school, because of the associated bullying and guilt I felt. </p>

<p>Since becoming an adult and finding my own way in the world, obviously since then I&#39;ve embraced it. But I am not like most gays. I&#39;m just a guy who happens to be attracted to other guys, period. There is no way you&#39;d see me waving a rainbow flag. I don&#39;t believe in the &quot;Pride&quot; agenda. I think it&#39;s an agenda to trick society into accepting more perverse standards and groom children from an early age so that by the time they&#39;re an adult, all this perverse stuff is normal to them.</p>

<p>But anyway, I&#39;m gay. What is going to happen if I read the Bible and choose God? Do I still get to live my dream of settling down with a like-minded soulmate, or are you going to tell me that homosexuality is inherently wrong no matter what and I have to live alone a celibate for the rest of my life?</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>So homosexuality is a sin.  Any and all sin makes us guilty before God and deserving of an eternal lake of fire (even just one white lie).</p>

<p>Jesus talking: Luk_5:32  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance</p>

<p>Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why Jesus Christ died.  He died because we are ALL lost sinners in need of Jesus Christ&#39;s righteousness to be saved.</p>

<p>So first, no homosexuality does not prevent you from being saved by the grace of God.  Not at all.  That&#39;s why he died for us.  Since my &quot;old man&quot; (what we call the person we were before being born again) was not a homosexual I can&#39;t speak directly to it but I was a lustful sex addict who watched porn and everything else.  It&#39;s really not that different.  I would talk to my friends about porn and we would joke about it.  It was no big deal and really porn is no big deal to the world.  So as a lost man the idea of me giving up porn would seem kind of crazy.  However once I realized God was real and that he died for my sins and I repented and believed the gospel things started to change.  Remember that bit about a new mind?</p>

<p>Rom_12:2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>

<p>After you get saved your thinking will change.  To you now as a lost man it&#39;s impossible to imagine not wanting your dream life with another man.  If you realize this is sinful (just like porn/lust was to me) then when you get saved the Holy Spirit will start working with you on it.  It&#39;s nothing that will require your own effort.  The Holy Spirit does all the work.  So does the idea that the Holy Ghost might change your hopes and dreams make you not want to be saved?  I hope not!  The key here is God know exactly who you are and he will save you just as you are.</p>

<p>Mat_16:26  For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>

<p>Nothing in this world is worth missing out on salvation.  You will be a new creature.  Just know that homosexuality is a sin.  A lie is a sin, a lustful thought about someone you aren&#39;t married to is a sin.  We ALL sin every day even after being saved.  Once you are saved you will NOT lose your salvation if you fall back into some sin.  The Holy Spirit will work with you on it and if need be God will chasten you.  At that point, you will welcome it because you will not be the same person.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very hard to explain but the just is salvation through Jesus Christ is greater than all the riches in he world.  Greater than any dream.  Getting over the &quot;fear of the world&quot; is a big part of being saved.  &quot;What will people think of me, will they mock?&quot;  &quot;Will I loose my friends?&quot;  &quot;Will my family disown me?&quot; all these are thoughts you must contend with.  Absolutely nothing this world offers can compare to a quickened spirit via Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Eph_2:1  And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;</p>

<p>Eph_2:5  Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)</p>

<p>Col_2:13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</p>

<p>1Pe_3:18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would i be a maroon for not knowing that?</p>

<p>*(oh yeah whats a maroon?)</p>

<p>Not everyone plays fps games. 
I have zero interest in the game itself. I was just curious what era its set in.</p>

<p>And just so you know.....this is not a gamer subreddit. Sure it might be the topic of a guys post and i admitted ignorance by saying.....what era is it set in?</p>

<p>And yet you attack me with a maroon comment?
Just answer the question. No need to call me a maroon.</p>

<p>As for history i have 23 yrs in the military and i would gladly go toe to toe with average american *(not a history professor) on u.s. and/or world history trivia\debate/discussion whatever.</p>

<p>I might be a moron for many other reasons. But it has nothing to do with bfv and my lack of knowledge or your video game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big case against the Mandela effect is that if somethings not really hard wired into your brain it can be changed. With the berenstain bears you are more likely to believe which ever version you heard first. There is very little chance that any kid who watched that show would remember exactly how it was spelled and if someone wrote a letter to you about it using stein instead of stain you would most likely just accept that it&#39;s stein and associate all your childhood memories of the show with stein. They human brain is odd and very flawed.</p>

<p>People who talk about the Mandela effect seem to fill in your vague memories before telling you that they are different, whereas if they never told you the false memory you would never have it in the first place.</p>

It&#39;s an interesting idea, but I can&#39;t imagine how it could possibly be the case with regards to the Berenstain Bears. It&#39;s ridiculous to consider what effort would be required to change all those old books everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had come up with an alternate theory to this that was not popular at all with the Mandela Effect sub (there&#39;s a few of them).</p>

<p>Most of the people who claim to experience this, almost act like they&#39;re some sort of special lot, or that they are being &quot;awakened&quot;, weird new age shit like that.</p>

<p>The first time I learned about the Mandela Effect was back in 2013, when I learned about the Berenstain Bears spelling. It seemed even more believable after a post by some grad level physicist working on his PhD wrote this : </p>

<p><a href="http://www.woodbetween.world/2012/08/the-berenstein-bears-we-are-living-in.html">http://www.woodbetween.world/2012/08/the-berenstein-bears-we-are-living-in.html</a></p>

<p>It was a complete shock to me, I was also extremely vulnerable to this idea, since in 2012 I had experienced a near death experience...</p>

<p>So I actually wondered if we were in an alternate universe. I was completely mind fucked. Which leads me to believe that people who legit believe this garbage were vulnerable as well.</p>

<p>They were targeted.</p>

<p>By demons.</p>

<p>The &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; is demonic.</p>

<p>(Interesting fact, the word &quot;Mandala&quot;, is a hindu word that represents a geometric figure, which represents the universe. Yeah I know not the same as the name Mandela but close)</p>

<p>I began seeing 11:11 and 12:34 almost twice daily, too close to be coincidence. I figured this whole new age shit was bullshit so one day I called out to go that if this was evil, to make it go away. And I confessed my sins and made a pact to try to live a cleaner life.</p>

<p>Immediately after that day, the time synchs stopped. A few other negative shit stopped as well.</p>

<p>The Mandela Effect is a form of demonic deception going after those weak minded, to try to lead them astray. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a few synchronicities and the explanations I saw never clicked with me. Just seemed like utter bullshit since it was never anything of any use to me beyond telling me what time it was. There was a last name that I kept seeing and it pissed me off because it did have meaning to me. Doesn&#39;t really seem like this is something good if you see something enough time that it pisses you off, ya know?</p>

<p>And this is coming from somebody that thinks religion and new age are a load of shit. Whatever it was I made the decision to ignore it. It&#39;s stopped for the time being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mandela effect is massively kept under wraps. It’s amazing the lefty’s the cover up goes. And no it’s nothing to do with TPTB. South America has moved 1300 east   No one can do that.  There are literally animals popping into existence it’s quite amazing.  But shills are about in force on this.  </p>

<p>The mandela effect is proof to many of us that have seen it of a simulation. Other shave different theories. CERN tried to claim the mandela effect but it’s nonsense. </p>
