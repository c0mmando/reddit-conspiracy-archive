       I just decided to try a little test. I posted a reply to a thread in ask science. I then went to the thread in a browser through a proxy, and my comment didnt show up. I know you can be shadow banned, but this is a sub that I never really post in, I think? I know Im shadow banned from r/science, but I dont really care, as that is the most cancerous, bullshit, propaganda sub I have ever seen. Almost every post on there is pure propaganda. I can understand why they would ban me, but shadowban? Its just dirty. I would call people out for using bullshit studies, made by non scientific organizations or scientists who would work very hard to make sure they had a certian result. Its like cummunist science or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is really crazy, but I kind of get the feeling that there is an organized effort to suppress certian ideas. Ecspecially on default subs. What are your thoughts on this r/conspiracy? We know they manipulate upvotes from time to time, to keep certian information off the front page. We know they shadowban people on subs, and or site wide, but this is suppose to be for spam/and or bots, am I correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im definitly not a bot, and im definitly not a spammer. It really kind of pisses me off that I would spend 10 minutes typing out a reply, and nobody would ever see it, because reddit deems my ideas dangerous, or politically incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of experiences do you people have, when dealing with the shady social engineering of huge media companies like conde' nast? How far does the manipulation go?

       This isn't entirely true. Mods can set up automod to automatically remove posts by certain users, effectively a shadowban.

       I'm pretty sure this isn't true. We have one and only one account that's "shadowbanned" on this sub: TotesMessengerBot. Automod removes its comments automatically, and also removes comments from accounts less than 60 days old.
       <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8nrvtu/the_new_york_times_and_the_murder_that_wasnt_the/">
        This post
       </a>
       has TotesMessenger and several young accounts auto-removed, and none of them show up as [removed] when I'm logged out; they just aren't there. You can check ceddit to confirm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The [removed] only shows up if someone replies to the comment before it's removed, and it needs to keep its place in the comment tree. Otherwise, reddit doesn't display it at all for regular users. But since AutoMod removes the comment immediately, it almost never happens that such a comment ever gets a reply at all.

       Even within the mod team, there's some disagreement over what we should do. The argument for approving Totes comments is that it lets users know the thread is potentially being brigaded. The argument against is that leaving it up will almost surely cause forum sliding to for everyone to talk about the brigade rather than the content of the post, essentially making the brigade more effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to side more with the latter argument.

       Yeah, they do, but at least intuitively if there's a comment right in the thread saying it's linked from TMOR, more people are going to talk about it. My experience also seems to bear that out, but I admit that could be confirmation bias.

        I know Im shadow banned from r/science, but I dont really care, as that is the most cancerous, bullshit, propaganda sub I have ever seen. Almost every post on there is pure propaganda. I can understand why they would ban me, but shadowban? Its just dirty. I would call people out for using bullshit studies, made by non scientific organizations or scientists who would work very hard to make sure they had a certian result. Its like cummunist science or something.

        It is really crazy, but I kind of get the feeling that there is an organized effort to suppress certian ideas. Ecspecially on default subs. What are your thoughts on this r/conspiracy? We know they manipulate upvotes from time to time, to keep certian information off the front page. We know they shadowban people on subs, and or site wide, but this is suppose to be for spam/and or bots, am I correct?

       Given that you complain about "cummunist science" I think you are a good candidate for spam.

       For one, I highly doubt that every post is askscience is "approved" by moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two, you can say what you want about my attitude, the truth is the truth, and I do try to be nice to people, even those who disagree with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three, the post was visible to me, but not to the rest of reddit. I didnt get some message saying my post broke the rules or some shit like every other sub, instead I was "shadow banned". It was done in a way to hide the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forth, what I mean by communist scince, is the fact that the sub is using principles of social engineering, to pit certian ideas in peoples heads. It tries to make people think that scientist think like that. It tries to put forward the idea of there being a correct way to think. It tries to sling shit on people who are critical thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why are you even here? You obviously dont care about conspiracies. If you have any doubt about the obvious social engineering and censorship that takes place on this site, then you are far from a conspiracy theorist. I would call you a shill, but at this point, not only do I not really know, but its pretty obvious to everyone what is going on.

       None of their posts are showing up on my front page, absolutely none. I am actually banned from posting on r/news for calling out propaganda. Worldnews is turning in r news but i can still comment just fine but sometimes when i comment on either I either get no replies or only downvotes, when i did used to get some sort of engagement.

       oh it gets better. on news mods labelled me a russian troll and will not even discuss lifting the commenting ban. Everytime i raise the issue they just block me from contacting them for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       One time i posted 'fake news' on one of those russian troll farms influenced election news stories and it was like a bot and shill attack i have never seen before. Within minutes i was downvoted into double digits. and a whole ton of comments on that single line, calling me a troll, how i am wrong, how i am just an idiot etc. I have never had that before. It was blatantly obvious. I got half the downvotes back I am guessing the accounts delete after a while. But anyway, shit happens.

       the temp accounts get deleted after a while, and after a few weeks my karma goes up by some number. scrolling through history i started to notice that my comments would go from massively downvoted to slightly downvoted (the legit users who joined in or just shilol accounts who stay permanently on reddit idk, but the karma goes up after a few weeks. It has stopped happening now, mainly because i stopped participating. But Also they did change up the tactics). Last year, when I would comment that goes against the narrative I would get instantly -9 downvotes far too regularly. Now(this year) it ramps up a bit, instead of all at once, downvotes would increase more realistically, but once again, after a few weeks some of the downvotes would disappear, not all but a considerable amount. So like comments with -23 would be -9 or -11 something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a simple psychological tactic, where its easier to downvote a comment already receiving hate. So a lot of real people would join in, regardless of what i commented.

       There may have been a few, but you are lying. Most of the comments Ive made were an attempt to contribute. I did troll them sometimes, when theu would get stuff wrong, or it was propagandaish.

       Not only that but I try to argue against antisemitism, and racism in threads im conspiracy. I try to get people in the_donald to not be so hateful towards their counterparts, explaining that most people honestly try to do the right thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit isnt targeting me because i am hateful, but because they dont want me to spread ideas that i believe to be correct. It is an attempt to social engineer society. They dont want people who are awake and see the truth. They wont predictible slaves. They want people who will react to triggers they can use to keep people inside the left-right duopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people identify as right and left, they will give people usless bullshit to fight over, while ignoring real problems like campaign finance, and rule of law not applying to people who are commiting treason by infiltrating our political institutions.

       like you said though. Don't accuse me of lying when you just say stuff that isn't true. You're not shadowbanned, you couldn't follow the rules and you had comments removed. The comment that was removed in

       Dude, for the last time, Im talking about /askscience. I dont know if I am in /science or not. I wasnt even downvoting you, but if you wanna be a little bitch about it then fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you have a better explaination then say it. I checked it literally seconds after I posted it. It was automated. Also, what rule did I break? Saying there was two genders? I didnt mean anything by it, and it was obvious by reading the post. It didnt even cross my mind. Im using the word like I and everyone always has. Im not gonna study some fucking gender studies so I can use words the way they think I should. Not to mention its a science sub, with a question about biology. Wtf am I suppose to say? Am i suppose to say they are two sexes? The english language doesnt belong to spoiled kids who sleep to 12 o'clock, and bitch about how evil the world is, because their parents didnt tell them life is hard. You dont get a 100,000/dollar per year job just because you wanna live in the city. They are wrong not us. If those subs have a rule that you arent allowed to say they are two genders or somenother basic fact, then its just a way for them to silence dissent. Dont believe me? Look at youtube. They put in all kinds of shit to combat hate speech, and litterally didnt even wait a month before they started either demonitizing or banning things to do with, conspiracies, government corruption, guns, or alternative ideas racist or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your only apparent purpose here is to disrupt the thread. You have nothing to add. Everything that you have posted so far is either a lie, or some attempt to say I did something I didnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone else reading go look at the comment in my profile, if you want to know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a shill, then you should reconsider your life. You are a piece of shit if you try to sway public opinion for money. There are tens of thousands of people being tortured in military prisons because the American people dont get information they need to make good decisions. The info is out there, but companies like google, and reddit try to hide them.

       for starters.  i write about it a lot over at steemit, search for mindhawk.
      </p>
      <p>
       i did a test, i picked out 10 accounts who were posting in various threads and people who said stuff i liked and that i thought there was no way could be written by a cop/shill, and i wrote them each individual messages, and i heard back from 0 of them after a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is across the board, look at my posteing history and see how many unresponded comments i have.  i have a few free days while i wait for something, so i wondered what would happen if i posted a lot.  still hardly any responses and more than half are obvious trolls just spouting negativity and personal attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       i fear but cannot prove that once you are flagged as someone who is a 9/11 truth or pgate or even r/conspiracy person, there is a mechanic that impedes your communications on this site.  Either your stuff doesn't go through or you don't get resposnes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is wierd here, and what you are describing fits what i have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't that be the hugest scandal when it became clear that your messages were actually blocked, without notice, when the site owners decideed they don't like you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is what's happening though.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if you learned one day that several thousands messages to you or of yours had been blocked by facebrk twiter or redit?
      </p>
      <p>
       How mad would you be?

       Good info, and thanks. I know the amount of fuckery exploded right before the election. Ive been on reddit for over 5 years, and ive never seen it like this. I would say it was just times changing, but it seems way to coordinaited. There is an information war between the people who want free information, and civil rights and liberties, vs those who seek to social engineer society for a scientific autocracy. (Basically what hitler, and the nazis were trying to do)

        Even within the mod team, there's some disagreement over what we should do. The argument for approving Totes comments is that it lets users know the thread is potentially being brigaded. The argument against is that leaving it up will almost surely cause forum sliding to for everyone to talk about the brigade rather than the content of the post, essentially making the brigade more effective.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don't users complain about being brigaded anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, there doesn't seem to be any difference if totes is up or not.

        I tend to side more with the latter argument.

       Well same, I just doubt it matters.

       So you're not shadowbanned from
       <a href="/r/science">
        /r/science
       </a>
       like you said though. Don't accuse me of lying when you just say stuff that isn't true. You're not shadowbanned, you couldn't follow the rules and you had comments removed. The comment that was removed in
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       is again, rulebreaking, mentioning that you're just speculating which isn't what they want there. You're not being censored, and don't you call me a liar because you can't understand how reddit works.

       Are you seriously calling me a shill because you can't tell that your rulebreaking comments in
       <a href="/r/askscience">
        /r/askscience
       </a>
       are getting removed, while the non rulebreaking ones are staying up, and you think you're secretly banned from the sub? If you can't be bothered to read the rules or even just ask the mods directly, I don't know that I can be of any help to you.
