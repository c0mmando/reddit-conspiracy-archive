       Hello r/conspiracy,
      </p>
      <p>
       Long time, first time....
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been thinking about Occam's razor and my general feeling is that it prevents people from building conspiracy theories, but in the same I wonder if there are cases where the conspiracy theory is a lot simpler that the official story. Do you know such cases? Did you ever changed your mind because you found the another story to make fewer assumptions? Do you have any examples?

       How would Occam's Razor have uncovered Watergate or Iran-Contra?

       How did Occam's Razor get the 2001 Anthrax Attacks wrong so many times?

      <p>
       How would Occam's Razor explain this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The first Anthrax was sent to Gloria Irish's husband in Florida.
       <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=gloria_irish_1">
        Gloria Irish was the (alleged) 9/11 hijackers'
        <em>
         real estate agent.
        </em>
       </a>
       None of the Anthrax suspects could have known this.  The FBI calls it a "strange coincidence."  What say Occam?

       I don't know what you are on about.
       <br/>
       Occam's Razor is not supposed to
       <em>
        uncover
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        explain
       </em>
       or solve anything.

      <p>
       It's just a reasoning principle to help guide choose from multiple possible answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to apply it to any of your cases, you need to list all assumptions and see to what answers they are pointing too, then choose the answer that makes fewer assumptions.

       Occam's Razor takes the "simplest explanation" but is always subjective:  it is used by people who presume there are no conspiracies to take events at "face value."
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet "Occam's Razor coincidences" like Gloria Irish do not add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there should be a rule that where a "coincidence" exists, Occam's Razor should not be attempted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in cases like Watergate, Occam's Razor was not applied.  The simplest explanation would have been that "a break-in is just a break-in."  If we're taking the Official Story at face value.

       Occam's Razor
       <em>
        should be
       </em>
       used by conspiracy theorists.  Because the simplest explanation of WTC7 is that free-fall collapse is not natural.

       As an example... to believe Iraq had WMD, you had to assume that Iraq was clever enough to hide an active WMD program despite over a decade of international inspections. You had to assume that the "undeniable evidence" the US suddenly found was kept secret by the US for a decade because "reasons". You had to assume that Saddam Hussein was suicidal. You had to assume that the US did not have an ulterior motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       To believe Iraq did not have WMD, all you had to do was assume the US was lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Iraqi WMD, Occam's Razor lead us to believe that Iraq sis not have WMD... and that was the correct conclusion.

       Exactly. The problem with only taking the route of fewest assumptions, is that the veracity of those assumptions are not taken into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the WTC building 7 is a great example. Is it more likely a fire took it down? Sure, one could assume that fires bring down more buildings than planted explosives, but you would be disregarding some pretty significant structural engineering anomalies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been of the idea for a while now that Occam's Razor is often applied to shut down "conspiracies."
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, Slippery Slope is not a logical fallacy, because often times people aren't honest in their intentions when debating (many are not even honest with themselves). This comes up in the gun control debate, when often times the person arguing for a few more restrictions would like for guns to be banned outright.

       Occam's Razor is the basis for my critical thinking when trying to discern the logical explanation to conspiracies, the best conspiracies are the ones where Occam's Razor proves the conspiracy theory more rational than the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example using Occam's Razor which is more likely?
      </p>
      <p>
       A) On 9/11, 19 terrorists hijacked 4 planes, flew 3 into their desired targets perfectly (without pilot experience) destroying 3 buildings in NYC and one side of the Pentagon on the same day the air force was running drills on an almost identical scenario so couldn't tell the training blips on radar from the real hijacked aircraft, and even when they had confirmed the real targets with air control were told to stand down, and all of the ground to air defense systems around the pentagon failed. All the gold under the twin towers evaporated, and Lucky Larry had just taken out an insurance policy and 99yr lease weeks prior.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) WTC Buildings 1, 2 &amp; 7 were condemned buildings long before 9/11 and would have cost billions to demolish due to the asbestos on EVERY floor, some wealthy and powerful men not wanting to lose money came up with a plan to actually make a huge profit from a horrible situation. A long term lease of 99yrs is given to Larry Silverstein (despite another bidder offering more money for a 100yr lease), a huge insurance policy is put in place, all the gold is removed and the buildings are brought down, claim the insurance and cash in the gold then sue the city for more.

       Quite the contrary.
       <br/>
       Occam's Razor is you how you build the conspiracy theory.
       <br/>
       People like to ignore facts of the matter then claim they were shaved off by Occam's Razor.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, was Roseanne was completely unaware she was making a racist joke or more likely she she knew and did it deliberately? It is far more likely that it was deliberate. You have to pretend that Roseanne is a clueless idiot, ignoring facts of the matter, in order to Occam's Razor any thoughtful analysis away and ah say she's just racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so now why would someone who just had new life breathed into their career toss it away like that? Either it was the plan the entire time or someone made her an offer she couldn't refuse.

       You are correct. Occam's Razor is not intended to shave off facts. It is suggesting that you should shave off hypothetical answers that make more assumptions and prefer the ones that make fewer.

       I do not know anything about Roseanne and her jokes, so I don't what's fact and what's assumption in your comment. In any case, I will try to formalize a bit what you're saying. Please correct me if I misunderstood you.

       I think its also interesting that
       <strong>
        4c
       </strong>
       has changed alot in the past 25 yrs
      </p>
      <p>
       *(when X was a popular tv actress in the early 90's) the internet didnt really exist in its current form and the social justice warriors hadn't taken Over the thought process of most of americans via *(facebook/twitter etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       If she made a similar joke 25 yrs ago - it would have been all over the enquirer magazine and the globe newspaper - but it is very unlikely she would have lost her career due to a bad joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember war has a tragic toll - when The social justice warriors took on this crusade to ensure everyone is treated equally and fairly - what it really means is we have created a world where comedians *(and everyone else) will be bland stale jokers because they have to walk on egg shells to ensure they dont offend anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cannot make any jokes because of fear  it might offfend someone - then we have lost our freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just going back to the joke she made she said the lady*(vj) looked like a character from planet of the apes. That is a movie. With characters in masks and makeup - not apes and not monkeys. I am not trying to defend roseanne. I dont give a fuck. But the media/internet changed what she said and took it out of context and villainized her for it.

       Occam's razor is a very good tool, but rarely wielded like it should.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule is simple: The simplest explanation that fits ALL the evidence is most likely to be the right one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still people get it wrong all the time. Mostly because they don't use all the evidence.

       That's not even a correct description of Occam's Razor.

      <p>
       It is not about "simplicity" - it is about "assumptions".
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a complicated theory that makes no assumptions, and a simple theory that makes lots of assumptions, and they both fit the available evidence, Occam's Razor points us to the complicated theory that makes no assumptions.

       Having evidence would mean it is not an assumption.

       Having no evidence would mean you are basing a decision/factor on an assumption

       Occam's razor is that the simpler explanation is better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Occam's razor this one: is the government and media more likely to tell you the truth, or lie?  Do large journalist organizations report the truth, or have a political agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       How would one apply Occam's razor to the documented history of false flag attacks used to start wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in consequence, we see two issues here: 1 is that Occam's Razor can be applied to support conspiracy type of thinking, and 2 is that Occam's razor is not an infallible framework of analysis.

       False. Occam's Razor is that the theory that makes the least assumptions is better.
      </p>
      <p>
       An assumption is something we take as being true, without proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have two theories - a complicated one that has proof for all its claims, and a simple one that does not have proof for all its claims, Occam's Razor tells you to favour the complicated but proven theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem (as is evidenced by this thread) is most people have no idea what Occam's Razor actually is.

       To believe Iraq had WMD you had to believe that Iraq had fooled international weapons inspectors for over a decade. To believe Iraq did not have WMD all you had to do was believe a nation known for lying about its enemies to justify attacks on them, was doing it again.

       Well Iraq under Saddam was a brutal regime that lied plenty.

       It's unfortunate for them that the one thing they didn't have was a proper weapons program, but Saddam's pride and duplicity didn't allow him to admit it and made the inspections look ridiculous.
