On the other hand, this sub consistently degrades Judaism as a cult that controls the world and exists solely as these evil entities. I ask that as a community, we focus on conspiracies that have basis in logic and not prejudice. Conspiracy theorists will continue to exist on the fringe if this overt hatred continues, and legitimate ideas will be discredited with ad hominem attacks. To respect the ideologies of other humans and maintain any sort of credibility, this nonsense must stop.</p>

<p>There is nothing you can do about it. We both know that common people, everywhere, including Jews, are the same all over the world. In this sub when you see &quot;Jews&quot; it is a reference to the government and/or to the military or the politicians or rich folks who fuck things up (George Soros).  It is just a short form common reference and not al wide scale attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is an easy defense to hurtful generalizations. It is like using “Muslims” to refer to all terrorists. This is not true and we all know it is not true, but it still harms the overall image of Islamic people. Maybe this sub needs to adjust it’s usage of the word Jew.</p>

<p>You need to stop trying to implement &quot;political correctness&quot; here. Jews have been doing evil shit for <em>centuries</em>. They have been kicked out of 110 countries. They <em>own</em> Hollywood. They <em>own</em> the Banks - who are screwing over the public. We are going to continue to give the Jews what they deserve. If you don&#39;t like it then switch subs.</p>

<p>If the show fits.... Jews get picked on because they do shitty things. Jews aren&#39;t &quot;special&quot; despite the fact that they act as if they were. They treat Palestinian people like dirt, or worse and we aren&#39;t allowed to criticize them for it? Or if we do then we get labelled as an anti-Semite? No no. Jews get what they deserve. They are not above criticism. There is no &quot;Anti-Semitism&quot; on this sub. There is just people calling the Jews out on their shit.</p>

<p>Israel is evil.  It&#39;s European backers are evil.  Judaism is evil.  All of it&#39;s bastard offshoot religions are evil.  And I&#39;m not being even slightly hyperbolic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How in the hell are you pro Israel?</p>

<p>That’s like saying you’re pro terrorism. Or pro sniping unarmed protesters. “Hey, I support right wing fascist dictators and subjugating groups of people I don’t agree with.” </p>

<p>What else are you in favor of? Herpes? Giving AIDS to puppies? Comcast? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I have said in response to others, I advocate an objective view of the State of Israel. Some policies are great, and the social climate within Israel speaks to this, while others are objectionable. The objectionable policies are of equal if not greater importance, and I would love for future administrations to reevaluate current positions.</p>
