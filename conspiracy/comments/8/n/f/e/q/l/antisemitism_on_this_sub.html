       As a skeptic in general I feel that this sub is a great place for discourse. On the other hand, this sub consistently degrades Judaism as a cult that controls the world and exists solely as these evil entities. I ask that as a community, we focus on conspiracies that have basis in logic and not prejudice. Conspiracy theorists will continue to exist on the fringe if this overt hatred continues, and legitimate ideas will be discredited with ad hominem attacks. To respect the ideologies of other humans and maintain any sort of credibility, this nonsense must stop.

       That is fair. But many of these attacks are on an entire group of people, not their ideas. Using Jews as scapegoats for a New World Order theory undermines any evidence presented. All I ask is that we question the ideology, not the people themselves.

       There is nothing you can do about it. We both know that common people, everywhere, including Jews, are the same all over the world. In this sub when you see "Jews" it is a reference to the government and/or to the military or the politicians or rich folks who fuck things up (George Soros).  It is just a short form common reference and not al wide scale attack.

       That is an easy defense to hurtful generalizations. It is like using “Muslims” to refer to all terrorists. This is not true and we all know it is not true, but it still harms the overall image of Islamic people. Maybe this sub needs to adjust it’s usage of the word Jew.

       You need to stop trying to implement "political correctness" here. Jews have been doing evil shit for
       <em>
        centuries
       </em>
       . They have been kicked out of 110 countries. They
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       Hollywood. They
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       the Banks - who are screwing over the public. We are going to continue to give the Jews what they deserve. If you don't like it then switch subs.

       If the show fits.... Jews get picked on because they do shitty things. Jews aren't "special" despite the fact that they act as if they were. They treat Palestinian people like dirt, or worse and we aren't allowed to criticize them for it? Or if we do then we get labelled as an anti-Semite? No no. Jews get what they deserve. They are not above criticism. There is no "Anti-Semitism" on this sub. There is just people calling the Jews out on their shit.

       There are a lot of racist and truly anti-semitic shitheads on this sub that don't get called out as often as they should, but I think people often confuse criticism of Israel in general as anti-semitism. Unfortunately, discussion of Israel related conspiracy theories tends to devolve into anti-semitic ranting and while I can understand the anger it generates for some, there is no need to start blaming all Jewish people.

       As I have said in response to others, I advocate an objective view of the State of Israel. Some policies are great, and the social climate within Israel speaks to this, while others are objectionable. The objectionable policies are of equal if not greater importance, and I would love for future administrations to reevaluate current positions.

       True. But I have seen commenters on this sub refer to Jews as Low-lifes, and citing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as a legitimate source. Criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitic, but blaming your woes on the Jewish people sure is.

       A lot of people around the world have a negative view of the United States' actions around the globe.  Is it the American people where this is directed or the country's leadership?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think when people "blame the Jews", it's directed towards the actions of those in charge, not towards the every day citizen, even though people try to paint such that way under the guise of anti-semitic victimhood.

       I try to use the term "Zionists", "Talmudic Jews" "Israelis (as in the Israeli government) or 'Khazar's", because frankly, these people are not "Jewish", at least not in biblical terms, and arguably in historic/genetic terms.
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=synagogue+of+satan&amp;amp;qs_version=KJV">
        They are the synagogue of satan that Jesus spoke about in Revelation
       </a>
       . Are there decent people who also identify as "Jewish"? Sure. But the sad truth is that most "Jews" and their actions are the primary problem in the world today. Not to say that there aren't people who claim to be "Christian" or "Muslim" etc etc that are willing accomplices to these devils.
