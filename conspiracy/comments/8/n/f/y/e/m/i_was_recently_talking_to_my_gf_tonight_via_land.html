        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I mentioned how the government is up to something and I mentioned key phrases / sentences such as...&quot;why do they feel the need to spy on us&quot;? &quot; this is fishy&quot; They seem to be paranoid of some type of REVOLUTION &quot;. &quot; The government is up to something&quot;. Just then I began to hear repeated clicking on the other end of the phone. My GF could still here me but she too could hear clicking. Moments later the phone disconnects. I call her back and state to her how I thought this was odd. She agreed. Without telling her what I was going to do next, I proceeded to repeat certain KEY words that I had already said to her. Clicking on the phone once again appeared and moments later phone gets cut off. I think there are words that get flagged depending on what they are. More than likely, it is done by an automated system the NSA has worked out. I did not attempt a 3rd time as she had to go to bed. But I will play with it sometime tomorrow. Quite scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned how russia is being used as a scare tactic. A paper dragon And that a day prior a propaganda article was floating around MSM on HOW to protect yourself from the russians with you home computer. Then today I see the FBI has this bullshit program that they want everyone to randomly use within their home and they need the public to restart their routers. (Utter Bullshit might I add) Then I began to mention how Russia has made comments regarding a world wide bank collapse and it was barley touched on via internet. Then two days later Italy came out with the same warning. Then we suddenly had another &quot;school shooting&quot;. I think there is a financial bank dilemma that might hit and they are scared of people to have guns bc they are scared quite possibly, of a revolution once the banks are exposed. That is why I think the government wants to monitor the American people so closely. At that point the clicking started and moments after the phone went dead.</p>

The NSA is probably listening bro, dont say nothing about the plot to destabilize the power grid on tor with the famous hacker 4chan.

I&#39;m impartial here, no opinion either way. I believe that OP heart clicking, I hear sometimes noises when my landline is getting disturbed. It&#39;s still happening. So what disturbed the call exactly at the keywords?
All sorts of interference can still make clicks, so why not an unofficial flag-device? I am asking for more clarification. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, im not expert - but I&#39;ve worked in telecoms in the past and you can verify this by googling.</p>

<p>Currently what would be a standard phone service is a mix of analogue and digital, analogue on the copper to the exchange (can be different) then converted to digital and transmitted to a exchange close to the destination, back to analogue and down the copper.</p>

<p>The analogue portion  is where you&#39;d usually hear crackling or clicking, it can be caused by physical damage, water, electronic interference - all sorts.</p>

<p>A lot of phone services are pure digital now though and you don&#39;t use your old copper line. Digital signal interference would usually cause delayed response, perhaps missed words (dropping data) etc.</p>

<p>Now pretty simply it&#39;s much easier to duplicate a digital signal without any interaction with the original. Analogue you required to physically tap into the point to point to connection, but with digital it&#39;s just data which can be saved, audited or sent multiple times to where ever.</p>

<p>Simple example is when you call a call centre and they record all your calls... Supervisors can listen in real time, and often do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not impossible, but just not worthwhile. How many of your targets will notice? How many of them will be alarmed enough to take this to the police or the internet for that matter, how many of them will be believed? And if they&#39;re being believed, how many will care enough to cause anything significant to come of this?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never done conference calls, but I would imagine if you and I had a conversation and we added another caller that there is a potential for clicks in the signal when the third line cuts in an out. If the third line is a silent recorder, the only noise you should hear is clicks when the hypothetical spy-line activates or leaves the conversation.</p>

<p>When the choice is between designing a program that piggybacks on existing conference call technology or designing proprietary systems that do the same thing, simply slightly better so as to get rid of those clicks, it just doesn&#39;t seem worth the expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several years ago, my SO had an issue with their business. They import a specific product from S. Korea that happens to look similar to a missile (its used in construction). Anyway, one of his shipments got held up at the port when he first started selling these in his business. At the same time, the bank locked down his accounts and our phones started doing that clicking with every call. Once the shipment was released and he had to jump through a bunch of hoops to do that, prove who he was. This kept happening for about 6 months until someone at the port told him to get this type of approved ID that requires you to give your fingerprints (its basically like a TSA pre check ID for port access and international shipments) then all the sudden the checks were clearing into his bank with no issues and the clicking on phone calls stopped entirely. I definitely believe the clicking is something and they do monitor calls as a result of this experience we had. </p>

<p>Also, when the bank had held up the check deposits, they never let us know why or what we could do to speed up the process. They just said it takes months to clear, which was total nonsense. Since he got the ID, we have never had that issue again. </p>

<p>Also (just remembered this) a few years after 911, my friend and I experienced the clicking and then disconnect when we were joking about bombs. After the first time, we tried it out with key words and it happened again. The phone call also started sounding weird and scratchy. It was a late night phone call, so we sort of chalked it up to that somehow, because it seemed too crazy to think the govt was listening in on our stupid phone calls. </p>

<p>So fucking creepy and wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the feeling TPTB are worried about some sort of revolution. Protests are not being reported, here in the UK it won’t take much to get people out protesting, we are being squeezed to be work slaves, everyone’s feeling it. We are constantly fined and taxed it’s getting a bit ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Update as I am back to work. Clicking occurs once again when I mention key words. Only then. I waited this time for about 15 minutes before I started talking about specific things. Clicking occurred immediately after. Phone did NOT disconnect however. Once again, this is a outgoing landline phone going to a cell. For the people that have overly criticized, why do you come to such a subreddit to break people down? Seems odd to me. There is a magic card subreddit I believe you people may have more in common with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah! My grandpa was an ex-pat in AlKhobar for about 30 years. 
One day we were on the phone (landline) chatting about life and we heard a noticible &quot;click&quot; and then both of us could hear what sounded like a room full of men speaking Arabic. They couldn&#39;t hear us, but we heard them....</p>

<p>Grandpa said we&#39;d talk later... To this day, I&#39;ve been telling people that my phones were trapped from childhood but no one believes me. </p>
