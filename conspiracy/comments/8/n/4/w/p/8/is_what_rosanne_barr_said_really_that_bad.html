        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How is it racist to say some shit about an individual person? If it&#39;s not saying shit about the race, culture or people generally.</p>

<p>Seen a few threads on the front page from various subs and the top comments annoyed me. Have seen some real wet lettuces but they are next level.</p>

<p>That&#39;s before even knowing what she said or knowing who the person she said it to was. Then I checked. 1. Valerie Jarret looks white as fuck. That was surprising. One of the comments said something about a Black &amp; Muslim hybrid. So seeing a women that looks the same colour as Rosanne Barr was kind of disappointing. 2. She looks exactly like Helen Bowen Carter&#39;s Ari in Tin Burton&#39;s 2001 Planet of the Apes. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it. Google them both. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not saying all Muslims or Black people look like apes. Which, would obviously be racist and from the outcry i&#39;d imagine she said something along those lines. That individual human being looks like a Tim Burton monkey. </p>

<p>Another thing. I moved from Manchester to Wales when I was 9 years old. My school in Manchester was 80% Muslim. 10% white and 10% black. Some of my best friends were Muslim and I swear to God, 9 years old bruh, my Muslim best friends had side burns and a moustache. And they weren&#39;t even boys.</p>

<p>I have one very good Muslim-ish friend now in Wales and dude he is a fucking werewolf. </p>

<p>Anyone that says people from Middle East etc. Aren&#39;t hairier than their white brothers and sisters is wrong. Surely it can&#39;t be racist if it&#39;s just a true statement? </p>

<p>Is saying that a white guy with a moustache looks like a paedophile racist? No. Of course not. He does. </p>

<p>Valerie Jarrett + my good hairy friend = Ari from Planet of the Apes. That has absolutely nothing to do with her race. </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Jarrett to call her a fat white Asian looking bitch or something and every just get on with their day? What I mean by that is if someone gives you a jab just return it? </p>

<p>This will probs offend some people but please just go fuck yourself. I mean that in the nicest way possible.</p>

<p>There is no point to this post other than to kind of defend Rosanne Barr and just the ability to talk shit for the sake of humour.  And to say that the sensitivity on the front page literally makes me want to kill myself. </p>

<p>Oh, and someone said something about her calling George Soros a Nazi. He looks like the head of Hydra and that&#39;s before knowing he&#39;s actually evil. </p>

<p>This is going to get removed isn&#39;t it...</p>

<p>It&#39;s like that Logan Paul thing. What he did aside I saw a YouTuber called the Geordie dickhead  or something. From Newcastle and he legit started to cry on screen. That nearly made me sick. Because Logan Paul filmed a dead guy. Like the issue isn&#39;t that there&#39;s a fucking suicide forest in Japan!? </p>

<p>The other peoples annoying reactions to things annoy me so much more than the actual situation. </p>

<p>I was a kid in the 90&#39;s so don&#39;t really remember society. Was it noticeably less queer? 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s? Or have people always been sensitive with talking shit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding your edit: there have been multiple (and I mean, <strong>multiple</strong>) posts on the sub in the last few days/weeks expressly talking about and criticizing how the sub has devolved into news posts / political debate instead of focusing on actual conspiracies. So I&#39;d say yes, we should try to stick to conspiracies in a sub about that expressly. Though, I do see where you&#39;re coming from.    </p>

<p>As for the post itself, there&#39;s really not a lot to explain. Saying a black person is ape-like... Considering the country&#39;s history, it&#39;s incredibly offensive to say the least. And as a public figure, with millions of followers and a show on TV where she&#39;s reaching extremely big audiences, she kind of had to know it was going to backfire on her incredibly. But then again, as they say, racists ain&#39;t the brightest kinds of people...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah alright. For the record when I Googled Jarret all her pics made her look white. Guess it was just the lighting. The image another user posted deffo makes her look black and sooo much more like Ari from Planet of the Apes. At first I was kind of like am i reaching? But nah mate. It&#39;s uncanny.</p>

<p>Does it not make it any less racist when the person in question does indeed look like a Planet of the Apes ape?</p>

<p>Call me racist but there&#39;s a reason Tim Burton chose Michael Clarke Duncan to play Attar? Picture him hairy and on all fours. Beating his chest, shouting deep as fuck and running toward you. You woukd shit yourself. </p>

<p>Bruh, gorillas are sick! How is that offensive? And that guy was a monster God rest his soul. Its like im saying he looks exactly like a gorilla but he definitely looks more like a gorilla than I do. Tim Burton thought so anyway. I tried. He was having none of it. I think that was kind of racist to be honest. Why did the white guys have to be stupid orangutans and chimpanzees? </p>

<p>You think I&#39;d get offended if you called me a polar bear because I&#39;m a monster and white? No bro. Would I think you are calling all white people polar bears? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Mate I&#39;ve grown up to Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy. Wu tang clan, Tribe Called Quest other 90&#39;s hip-hop and cannot imagine a world without them. If It wasn&#39;t for Hollywood movies and Youtube. I wouldn&#39;t even know what racism was. Im not joking when I say it literally doesn&#39;t exist here amongst my generation. </p>

<p>When I say a human being looks like something. Its because that person does. It has nothing to do with their race other than the fact that having a certain colour skin might put them closer to the colour of the thing they look like. But for you to see that as a generic racist remark surely that means you think that all the people of that particular race look the same. In my mind they do not. I actually don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s like thinking all white people look the same it&#39;s just stupid. There&#39;s some weasle, squirrell, rabbit looking white dudes but we don&#39;t all look like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, you&#39;re taking this out of context, applying your personal experiences/situation in irrelevant ways, and giving very strange arguments. I don&#39;t care about the PotA movie&#39;s casting choices. Roseanne said a black women looked like the child of a muslim and an ape. It was a fucking insensitive and stupid thing to say, online of all places, and she got exactly what she deserved for it. There&#39;s been numerous further explanations on why this is bad, on the multitude of popular posts that popped up today all over Reddit (there have been at least 4 on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> alone), so you can go there to see exactly what other people think - that might help you understand. Though as I said in my first post, I get the feeling you posted here out of fundamental disagreement with the other subs&#39; views on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok ok. I suppose. Why is what she said any worse than what comedians say all day every day. Why is it any worse saying it on Twitter?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just on the same level as comedians talking shit about people who annoy them? If it&#39;s all wrong then it should all be shut down. That&#39;s fucking stupid, obviously. </p>

<p>And to be honest you are right. Like I said the other people in the other subs annoy me. And I also like to see upvoats immediately turn to downvoats. Ive never even seen Roseanne. I was arguing about the reaction on the front page more than anything else and don&#39;t like going too hard in other subs because I don&#39;t want to get banned. </p>

<p>The fact that she used muslim brotherhood in the context of an insult is why it is racist. It has nothing to do with the words you use but the meaning of what you are saying. She was meaning to degrade her by comparing her to an ape and a race she isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Actually, I don&#39;t think the racist connotation even crossed her mind, and she had no idea what the shitstorm would be like.</p>

<p>She&#39;s just that stupid.</p>

<p>She&#39;s a Trump supporter, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say he had to make anything up. Only that, for posting in a sub about conspiracies, he should try and make his post about a conspiracy instead of a rant... Also, you might disagree with me, but many users have been complaining about the type of posts being submitted here, especially those regarding news or politics without any relation to conspiracy - they derail and dillute actual good quality conspiracy posts.        </p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s entitled to their own opinions, though - make a post about whatever you want and have the community decide whether it&#39;s worthy of being here. Seeing as this post sits at 0 a day after submission, I&#39;d say many people agree with me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about Rosanne or what she said on Twitter. I just jumped into this thread and say that question. 
&quot;Is calling a black person racist?&quot; He asked twice like he&#39;s expecting a yes or no answer. It&#39;s not black and white. Conversation is all about context.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t justify anything about what Rosanne said or make any sort of comment on what she said and what I think about that comment.</p>

<p>I replied to a question that says. &quot; Is calling a black person a monkey racist?&quot; Which I said. Not always. depends on the context. You asked &quot;What context would calling a black person a monkey be okay?&quot; So I made up a situation to show it&#39;s not always black and white. </p>

<p>You ask &quot;Do you think referring to a black person as an ape in this context is racist? &quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure, I looked at the link you sent. Idk who VJ is or what is going on. That&#39;s why I came in this thread to see wtf people are taking about. I dont have a Twitter. I get by now whoever VJ is obviously is a black person. But I don&#39;t know what Rosanne was thinking when she said it. Did she say it cause she&#39;s black or did she say it because she&#39;s stupid and didn&#39;t think about her words carefully and just wanted to insult someone? I have no fucking idea. Either way insulting someone on theirs looks is a dumb move, especially where everyone can see it and use your words against you in whatever context they want.</p>

<p>Do we need to know what she was thinking to know it was racist? it seems like you are trying to justify racism because we will never be able to know what is in someones head, we cast conclusions based on someones actions, in this case calling a black woman an ape. You seem afraid of calling it out for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it would be up to Mike, if he felt it was racist or not.</p>

<p>There is a difference between referring to a group of people or to a single person. </p>

<p>If an individual is offended, does that automatically offend the entire group?</p>

<p>When I worked structural steel there was a guy that could just scramble around the iron anywhere he wanted to be.  We started calling him &#39;spidy&#39;, short for Spider-Man.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t mind one bit, he rather took it as a badge of honor,  in a way. (You would have to know Ironworkers)</p>

<p>I worked with a guy, who happened to be very dark, his nickname was  &#39;spade&#39;..</p>

<p>Did all shovels just get offended? Or all very black men who are named spade just get torqued up? That was the name he himself used when he introduced himself to me. I loved the guy, one hard working man with an awesome sense of humor. We were friends for quite awhile.  </p>

<p>Did that offend hard working men? Or those with a sense of humor? </p>

<p>My wife tells a pretty cool story,  an experience she shared with a longtime friend.
Wife needed new cornea,  had the surgery,  Alfreda drove.
When Dr removed the bandage and asked if she could see ok, wife looked around the room and then looked at Alfreda and totally jerked almost out of her chair and says loudly &#39;you&#39;re black!&#39;..</p>

<p>Alfreda,  being the awesome soul that she is, played right along, &#39; I been meanin to mention that &#39;....</p>

<p>To hear the two of them, together, describing the Drs. facial expressions, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s funniest,  what they describe or them doing the describing.</p>

<p>And, how about my grown daughters calling their babies monkeys. Is that wrong?  Who should be more offended, all babies or all monkeys?</p>

<p>How about their friend who also calls her little baby monkey?  Their friend just happens to be black but she&#39;s a very good mom and is loved by a lot of people. </p>

<p>So, should all women that have babies be offended if I call her a good mom, or just the mom&#39;s that have a very rough go at life and don&#39;t feel that they themselves are good moms?</p>

<p>This whole racial thing is stupid. There is no &#39;race&#39; better than another one. We are all the same,  just wear different color clothes....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you call all black people niggers, it’s racist.</p>

<p>If you call one black person a nigger, it’s a personal insult.</p>

<p>I think you are on a fishing expedition to slap a racist label on me because that’s what the left does but you don’t know a fucking thing about me.</p>

<p>I linked the Chris Rock video because Chris describes the difference between a black person and a nigger.</p>

<p>Is Chris Rock a racist?</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer, you slapped that label on yourself. Please try calling a black person the n word in real life and tell us how your &quot;personal insult&quot; worked out for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is trying to label you as a racist. You trying to bait others into insulting you?</p>

<p>Also as for what Chris Rock says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>n a 2005 60 Minutes interview, Rock said: “By the way, I’ve never done that joke again, ever, and I probably never will. ‘Cos some people that were racist thought they had license to say nigger. So, I’m done with that routine.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my issues with that word as well. Well not issues. </p>

<p>My black friends would greet me with &quot;What up my nigga&quot; and I grew up to black entertainers on Youtube who use it alot. For a white kid in my generation in Wales it&#39;s hard to really understand and feel the deal with it. Even Tyler the creator and other young black guys seem to not care as much as the older guys. </p>

<p>In the same way I can&#39;t understand how it feels to be black in America. You can&#39;t understand what&#39;s it&#39;s like to hear a word 50 times a day and never in a insulting way. Then be told you can&#39;t say it.</p>

<p>To quote Dave Chappelle or Kat Williams when they say &quot;nigga, please.&quot; In response to some dumb shit. I can think of no greater response to something dumb. </p>

<p>What&#39;s that term for swear words? The sound they make as they roll of the tongue. Fuck, cunt, bitch, nigga. Etc. There&#39;s a reason they are so satisfying to say. Regardless of the meaning.</p>

<p>Likewise, I imagine it would be funny to call a white-female-conservative-racist-old-Christian-female bitch, a nigger as angrily as possible. Just to see her shock. DumbCunt.exe would for sure crash &amp; freeze and need a reboot. They&#39;d be no black people involved in that so would that be racist?</p>

<p>Obviously, these thoughts come from a whole lot of white privilege so I apologies if it offends.</p>

<p>&quot;I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I&#39;m fine, I&#39;m worried about all the people out there who don&#39;t have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense -- the person who&#39;s walking down the street minding their own business, and they see somebody cling to their purse or run across the street,&quot; Jarrett continued. &quot;Or every black parent I know who has a boy, who has to sit down and have a conversation, &#39;the talk,&#39; as we call it. And as you say, those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.&quot;</p>

<p>Jarrett was also asked whether she felt that the president has set a tone that makes people feel more empowered to express the kind of sentiment that Barr did.</p>

<p>&quot;Tone does start at the top,&quot; she responded, &quot;and we like to look up to our President and feel as though he reflects the values of our country. But I also think that every individual citizen has a responsibility too, and it&#39;s up to all of us to push back. Our government is only going to be as good as we make it be.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Win what? Is that what you are trying to do? &quot;Win conversations?&quot;</p>

<p>My friend, I&#39;m just having conversations about this. If I&#39;m proven wrong about something, I don&#39;t mind admitting it. It&#39;s called being an adult and having adult conversations. </p>

<p>And I do think it&#39;s interesting how you thought me and that other guy were trying to label and assume something about you, and now you are trying to make assumptions about me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not outraged by this. It&#39;s really not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, but I do think racism needs to be called out and discouraged. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who Valerie Jarrett is, but she was calm and collected in the interview. She would have looked bad otherwise if a senior adviser to the previous presidency had a freak out on twitter or in a interview.</p>

<p>But, she obviously did see something was wrong with what was said, and said that ABC made the right call in cancelling the show because of her tweets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because people thought racism and discrimination was on the decline, but now there are more and more people being openly racist and discriminatory towards others.</p>

<p>I think we can both agree that racism and discrimination is bad, and one way to combat bigotry and discriminatory actions is for society to speak out against it and say no, this is not ok.</p>

<p>You also have to understand that racial tensions between blacks and minorities with whites have always been a struggle since the very begginings of our nation. </p>

<p>There are people who are still alive when segregation was legal, and when blacks had to drink from different fountains or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aAhGGY6Dec">couldn&#39;t sit at dining counters and were beat up for it.</a></p>

<p>Basing this on like Game of Thrones and medieval shit and pirates. </p>

<p>He is your Captain Or King so to speak. And y&#39;all should trust and follow him. Otherwise it&#39;s mutiny and rebellion. Like you wanna do that? Rally up a force, go take control. Then command how you want to. Otherwise, shut fuck up.</p>

<p>The English Royal family is stupid to me because they dont rule. Its just for show. I honestly would prefer a Queen or King to rule the country. A person who loves their people and who&#39;s people love them. Someone who wants each and every soul to grow. Old Kingdom Egypt the way Hancock describes it was like that.</p>

<p>King Arthur kind of deal, like he had advisers but he probably didnt listen to them. All these conservative politicians with their law degrees are out for themselves and their own parties. fuck them all.</p>

<p>This democracy and all these parties with their own agendas. There&#39;s too many hands stiring the pot and too many snakes in the grass. </p>

<p>Honestly, think they&#39;d be a better world if everyone decided on a guy or gal that they can trust to steer the ship then just let them steer it. </p>

<p>I guess, obvs, Trump isn&#39;t your king so I&#39;m just chatting shit. It seems like most things he does to annoy you people are things he did on Twitter. Which is weird. </p>

Now Fox News can discuss Roseanne&#39;s cancellation all day, and keep its viewers angry and in the dark about the hurricane debacle. In the end it seems to have backfired on her double, her only true mistake was jumping on his train rather than stick to her own true form of expression.

<p>Was the silverback looking dude black? If so, would it still be in poor taste for YOU as a black man to give him shit? Like, I&#39;d have a thought other black guys as kids in America don&#39;t think about being racist to each other when you give each other shit for the Lols in High school, right? </p>

<p>As another black kid, when you see a kid in school that kinda looks like a silverback. You aren&#39;t thinking it&#39;s because he&#39;s black, right? </p>

<p>Guess my highschools were different from yours, I dunno. But everyone got shit. Everyone. No one one off limits. Teachers , students, parents. Race was literally irrelevant. If you look like something, you getting shit. When you got shit thrown at you, you just threw it back to the next guy or gal.</p>

<p>Even then there was a difference between just talking shit for the Lols and being offensive, bullying or really upsetting someone. There was where im from anyway.</p>

<p>Jesus. Just woffle-ing on at this point...</p>

<p>Do you say nigga as a black guy? With an a. the same way Chappelle, Wu-Tang etc. use it? That being </p>

<ol>
<li><p>That it is just 4 or 5 letter words to put before and after a phrase. I&#39;ll use cunt or bitch like that. &quot;What up, cunt?&quot;.  Or &quot;yo, cunt!!&quot;. &quot;Cunt, what!?&quot; &quot;Bitch, what!?&quot; And &quot;nigga, what!?&quot; All mean the same thing. </p></li>
<li><p>Saying something like &quot;That&#39;s my nigga!&quot; Or &quot;what up nigga!&quot; Or something similar. I&#39;ve heard that on YouTube and been personally called it by my black friends. The word is used to describe someone that you love.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How could that ever be racist!? It&#39;s offensive to use a word to describe and greet your closest friends. That makes sense to who!?</p>

<p>Purely from a sound point of view and the way it rolls off the tongue. &quot;Fu&quot;, &quot;Cu&quot;,&quot;Bi&quot;, &quot;Ni&quot; etc. &quot;Ni&quot; sounds the best. There&#39;s reason y&#39;all use it so much. The context obviously and the meaning behind the word but also because &quot;nigga&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot; sound fucking great to say.</p>

<p>The only time like the &quot;er&quot; version from a white racist comes about today. Is when someone is taking the piss and imitating white racists. Usually from the South. Like to ironically say &quot;Go back to Africa Niggerrr&quot; in your best Southern, redneck American accent it isn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t be a dig to black guys. </p>

<p>That&#39;s literally taking the piss out that mentally because to most of the world, especially in my generation, its fucking crazy and almost comical that people used to say that. Like In Gangs of New York for example. They actually had Irish accents. Which makes it even crazier and funnier. An Irish guy in New York telling a African-American to get out. LOL. </p>

<p>Every single person on this planet resembles or has mannerisms that resemble something else. If they didn&#39;t they&#39;d be no talking shit because they&#39;d be nothing to say. &quot;She or he looks like....&quot; Everyone looks like something. If that person was painted a different colour. Their mannerisms or body shape would still look like that thing. To call racism on behalf of your entire race just makes you a bitch. If you changed the colour of Valerie Jarrett She&#39;d still have a weird fucking face. </p>

<p>Really hope I haven&#39;t offended you, Bro! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah alright. For the record when I Googled Jarret all her pics made her look white. Guess it was just the lighting. The image another user posted deffo makes her look black and sooo much more like Ari from Planet of the Apes. At first I was kind of like am i reaching? But nah mate. It&#39;s uncanny.</p>

<p>Does it not make it any less racist when the person in question does indeed look like a Planet of the Apes ape?</p>

<p>Call me racist but there&#39;s a reason Tim Burton chose Michael Clarke Duncan to play Attar? Picture him hairy and on all fours. Beating his chest, shouting deep as fuck and running toward you. You woukd shit yourself. </p>

<p>Bruh, gorillas are sick! How is that offensive? And that guy was a monster God rest his soul. Its like im saying he looks exactly like a gorilla but he definitely looks more like a gorilla than I do. Tim Burton thought so anyway. I tried. He was having none of it. I think that was kind of racist to be honest. Why did the white guys have to be stupid orangutans and chimpanzees? </p>

<p>You think I&#39;d get offended if you called me a polar bear because I&#39;m a monster and white? No bro. Would I think you are calling all white people polar bears? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Mate I&#39;ve grown up to Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy. Wu tang clan, Tribe Called Quest other 90&#39;s hip-hop and cannot imagine a world without them. If It wasn&#39;t for Hollywood movies and Youtube. I wouldn&#39;t even know what racism was. Im not joking when I say it literally doesn&#39;t exist here amongst my generation. </p>

<p>When I say a human being looks like something. Its because that person does. It has nothing to do with their race other than the fact that having a certain colour skin might put them closer to the colour of the thing they look like. But for you to see that as a generic racist remark surely that means you think that all the people of that particular race look the same. In my mind they do not. I actually don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s like thinking all white people look the same it&#39;s just stupid. There&#39;s some weasle, squirrell, rabbit looking white dudes but we don&#39;t all look like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, you&#39;re taking this out of context, applying your personal experiences/situation in irrelevant ways, and giving very strange arguments. I don&#39;t care about the PotA movie&#39;s casting choices. Roseanne said a black women looked like the child of a muslim and an ape. It was a fucking insensitive and stupid thing to say, online of all places, and she got exactly what she deserved for it. There&#39;s been numerous further explanations on why this is bad, on the multitude of popular posts that popped up today all over Reddit (there have been at least 4 on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> alone), so you can go there to see exactly what other people think - that might help you understand. Though as I said in my first post, I get the feeling you posted here out of fundamental disagreement with the other subs&#39; views on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t justify anything about what Rosanne said or make any sort of comment on what she said and what I think about that comment.</p>

<p>I replied to a question that says. &quot; Is calling a black person a monkey racist?&quot; Which I said. Not always. depends on the context. You asked &quot;What context would calling a black person a monkey be okay?&quot; So I made up a situation to show it&#39;s not always black and white. </p>

<p>You ask &quot;Do you think referring to a black person as an ape in this context is racist? &quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure, I looked at the link you sent. Idk who VJ is or what is going on. That&#39;s why I came in this thread to see wtf people are taking about. I dont have a Twitter. I get by now whoever VJ is obviously is a black person. But I don&#39;t know what Rosanne was thinking when she said it. Did she say it cause she&#39;s black or did she say it because she&#39;s stupid and didn&#39;t think about her words carefully and just wanted to insult someone? I have no fucking idea. Either way insulting someone on theirs looks is a dumb move, especially where everyone can see it and use your words against you in whatever context they want.</p>
