<p>Calling that Jarrett lady &#39;African American&#39; is kind of ridiculous. Her ethnic heritage is all over the place.</p>

<p>Maybe Roseanne wasn&#39;t being racist, and just made a shitty joke at her co-worker&#39;s expense?</p>

<p>Do you genuinely think it was a nuanced tweet, where she was expecting people to follow the muslim brotherhood claim with a deep dive into the understanding of the subtle and little known lore behind the films series..? </p>

<p>Because as someone whose only seen the films and read the book and seen the TV series, to my memory, they&#39;re just apes. Not hybrids. Certainly the recent run of films they&#39;re apes and monkeys. </p>

<p>And she didn&#39;t compare it to an individual character, as you&#39;ve repeated claimed. </p>

<p>Have you actually seen the tweet? I can link you to it -- here it is -- </p>

<p>I try to be polite to others. Golden rule.  Pretty basic. But Roseanne is a comedian and for many many centuries we in the West have let comics (fools) push the envelope.

<p>Seriously, I think black people are aware that many of the look more like apes than other ethnicities.  No need to talk about it, but by turning a tweet into such a big deal more blacks may have been insulted than if Roseanne were allowed to delete and apologize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all, it is a complete hit job anyone who looks at the apes from the movie would have to admit she bears a resemblance to just about any of the female ones, but it is being INTENTIONALLY misinterpreted to where they want people to think she said</p>

<p>&quot;black people are monkeys&quot;</p>

<p>And secondly, Soros is an ultra billionaire who is known to throw his money around for political influence(and many conspiracy theorists think is part of the NWO), a semi popular celebrity with a large following calling him out for helping the Nazis (something he admitted to in an interview and said he didnt feel bad about)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As one of the sheep who immediately took a stance without realizing that there was slightly more to her comparison between the monkeys in that movie and a brown lady, I feel confident saying it wouldn&#39;t take an ultra billionaire manipulating the media/ABC for any of this to go down. It&#39;s a better story if those of us who often never read beyond the headline aren&#39;t aware of the undeniable resemblance, and besides, in the mainstream political atmosphere nobody wants to be the one pointing that out. Firing her makes plenty of sense without soros&#39; loose change, the way I see it.</p>

<p>And for the record, it&#39;s still a pretty racist thing to say. You can&#39;t just compare people of color to apes and say it&#39;s okay because the implications don&#39;t go beyond a visual resemblance to characters in that movie. The insult she laid out had serious baggage. </p>

<p>This is Orwellian though.</p>

<p>I get what you mean and I know you &quot;cant&quot; but if simply saying &quot;ha this one person looks like a character from this movie about humanoid apes&quot;</p>

<p>Is enough to ignite a firestorm of retribution involving your show getting cancelled, and your reruns taken off the air.</p>

<p>That isnt a proper response to at worst the lowest lowest tiers of racism.</p>

<p>Like where do we draw the line between be nice to people of color, and &quot;if you say the wrong thing we will fuck your life up&quot;</p>

<p>Like for example in Sweden, you can be fined thousands of dollars for pointing out the rape statistics have sky rocketed since they let in a few hundred thousand muslim migrants.</p>

<p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201802061061402260-sweden-muslims-free-speech/">https://sputniknews.com/europe/201802061061402260-sweden-muslims-free-speech/</a></p>

<p>This is a FACTUAL statement there is a non-negligible portion of muslims who view rape as an acceptable act.</p>

<p>But the citizens are no longer allowed to point out the truth.</p>

<p>Im going off the rails here but I hope you see what Im getting about I dont give a fuck about Roseanne but &quot;Racism&quot; is becoming a tool against us</p>

You should get your facts straight. Barr was obviously denigrating her based on her complexion and association with Obama. I guess you approve of her statements that imply Jarrett was the offspring of a subhuman primate and terrorist. </p>

How do you know this? You are 100% assuming this and you called an Iranian &quot;black&quot; to fit your narrative. But I need to get facts straight. Typical SJW.</p>

Nobody gives a shit about her soros tweets or any of the other nonsense shes talked about on twitter. But everyone did care about this tweet and it was a national story.

I get ABC&#39;s dilemma. But there&#39;s a real frustration with the double standards conservatives and liberals are supposed to live by. I think that&#39;s where this anger stems from.

    <div class="md"><p>Because everybody says something stupid eventually. Everybody has said something that doesn&#39;t come out right, or doesnt really reflect what they believe deep down. Now, once you post it on Twitter you can get fired right away. So, in my opinion the risks out weigh the rewards. It is usually offensive jokes from the Right that get people fired like Nick Dipaulo and Roseanne. Joking about a Black person looking like a monkey is just a really bad joke. A few words on Twitter that may not reflect your true beliefs can define your career now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s a rude, crude, tough and bitchy old babe and she&#39;s was one long before she was as old as she is now. That&#39;s her stand-up persona and her &quot;shtick&quot;.</p>

<p>What I find interesting and curious about all this was the ratings her show was getting. She&#39;s had the first show to come along that&#39;s beat-out Big Bang Theory in prime time by a wide margin and with a far more common and down to earth perspective and spin on our times that clearly had a far greater public appeal. </p>

<p>Now you&#39;d think that ABC would have bent over backwards rather than flush a show with ratings like that down the toilet. </p>

<p>In the past they (ABC) would have done just about anything and everything to salvage a show with those kinds of ratings when someone in it did or said something reprehensible in public. </p>

<p>Apologies galore, fines, suspensions, even writing some characters out of the series etc. etc. </p>

<p>Today they just give it the axe and leave Roseanne with no way to make amends except to see her work be banished from memory including the cancellation of all the reruns of her original show which is also a part to television history that&#39;s being censored even though there&#39;s nothing in any of those shows that warrants that.</p>

<p>Pretty heavy handed treatment and collective punishment for everyone else involved her present show or the show&#39;s audience who may well have been willing to forgive and forget if she made some genuine effort to apologise for going too far over the line on this one.</p>

<p>Michael Richards, aka &quot;Kramer&quot; from Seinfeld put on a far worse public display of racially motivated fury that garnered a lot of unwanted attention and got him into a lot of hot water just six years ago, but you can still see him in the Seinfeld reruns that haven&#39;t been banned over his presence in them over that unseemly performance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s your opinion. Most of the people who are defending her are for reasons much further than nostalgia of old rosanne show. </p>

<p>In any case, she&#39;s the entire appeal of the show, nobody really cares if the others get recasted imo barring john goodman</p>

<p>john goodman is probably the biggest actor in the show now both in relevance and payscale so it probably hinges on him the most.</p>

<p>Maybe theyll do a spinoff with everyone but rosanne and call it Dan</p>

Don’t really get why you’re choosing this hill to die on, but it should be pretty telling that even the right wing conspiracy mill news empire is abandoning her.
