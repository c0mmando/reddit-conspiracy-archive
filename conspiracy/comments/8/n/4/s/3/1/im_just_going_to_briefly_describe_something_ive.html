<p>Unless these entities provide real scientific knowledge that we can test you can never judge if what they are saying is true. </p>

<p>And surprise surprise, these entities never give that kind of information. It&#39;s always some spiritual mumbo jumbo or &quot;historical&quot; data that is impossible to check.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t call them tricksters for nothing. 
While I&#39;m open that there has been genuine contact in the past I tend to think that who or whatever that is still contacting us today is probably not interested in the betterment of mankind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been thinking about this lately. Ever since reading about the story between Atlantis and Mu/Lemuria. Now my custom crackpot theory is The first few human races had telepathy and since the destruction of the 2nd moon caused by Atlantis is what ended humans to have that power. </p>

<p>Another conspiracy Ive thought about is how TPB is suppresing out natutal ability of telepathy such as having a world wide supressing beacon from the pyramids, eiffel tower, statue of liberty, the obselik towers in DC and London, still figuring out other buildings around the world that could link to it and connect the dots of this world wide supression barrier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what you&#39;re talking about is channeling, OP.</p>

<p>you&#39;re right, it is possible to engage in communication with these beings. This is not a new thing; people have been doing this for a very long time. These beings may currently masquerade as aliens, but they are demons, and their desire is to manipulate us.</p>

<p>often when these beings communicate, they will appear to be revealing deep wisdom, and in some cases they will even extend offers of supernatural power. Many modern day scientific breakthroughs can be traced to such instances of spirit contact, and I can only imagine that many historical discoveries are the same. I understand it might sound tempting to communicate with these beings. But please be aware: in 100% of cases, when you make yourself available to these communications, you also render yourself more vulnerable to being influenced and affected by these beings, which is extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>these beings may seem benevolent or helpful, and many people will tell you they are good. However, their desire is that you would do their bidding, which is evil. They will attempt to deceive you, or to tempt you to do their bidding by rewarding you. This is why people will say good things about them. But if they have power over you, they will also exercise this power. They will punish you if you resist them, and they will discourage you from rebelling against them by inflicting negative consequences on you. They will make these consequences appear to originate from another source - for example, from something that is helpful, so that you are further deceived. They are masters at manipulating. They know exactly what they are doing.</p>

<p>these beings will allow you to believe you understand them, and that you have the upper hand over them, so that you will feel safe and continue to subject yourself to them. But you will not outsmart them. You will not outmaneuver them no matter what. They will mess you up. Indeed, you might have no idea what they are even doing while this is happening. You might just think you have wisdom and powers, and that everything is fine. But they will mess you up.</p>

<p>pretty much every guru and every teacher who is popular right now is in this position, where they are deceived by these beings and doing the bidding of these beings. These teachers will promote spirit contact, encouraging that their listeners explore the phenomenon, promising that whoever does it will receive power and wisdom. They will promote messages of goodness while they say these things; they will point fingers at the bad guys and condemn them. They will encourage you to wake up; they will teach you how to wake up and broaden your consciousness with the aid of spiritual powers. All of this is manipulation, and it is working. As a result, a larger and larger proportion of listeners are finding themselves directly subject to the will of demons, and a larger and larger chunk of the common person&#39;s worldview comes directly from the information provided by demons.</p>

<p>do you think it is alarming that state propaganda will deceive a person? Do you think it is alarming that state propaganda will portray an illegitimate worldview to a person, and facilitate the inappropriate conduct of a person? Then you should also be very alarmed by what these channeled beings are doing.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to get on board: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7n66qn/do_you_believe_religion_is_a_scam/drzi718/">Jesus Christ is the truth.</a> What I am saying is verifiable. Everything that would provoke you to disagreement is capable of being addressed, and you don&#39;t have to be confused about it at all. Nobody understands what is what, but honest evaluation will corroborate what I am saying. I promise this is true. We are in the end game right now. It is very important that you pay close attention to Jesus Christ, especially before your ability to do it is further compromised and it becomes much more difficult and unlikely that you will do it. Please hear what I am saying.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7n66qn/do_you_believe_religion_is_a_scam/drzi718/">here&#39;s a neat documentary on spirit channeling,</a> it has a lot of interviews with people who have done it. It&#39;s been a while since I saw it. I&#39;m sure it has a Christian slant but either way it&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>thanks for reading. Be safe.</p>
