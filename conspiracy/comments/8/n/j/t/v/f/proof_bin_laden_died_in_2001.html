2000 to September 2001: Reports Emerge of bin Laden Dying From Kidney Disease</p>

<p>In March 2000 the Chicago Tribune reports that an Afghan witness and &quot;Western intelligence official&quot; say bin Laden is suffering from severe kidney and liver failure. Link: <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-25/news/0003250085_1_laden-bin-religious-militia">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-25/news/0003250085_1_laden-bin-religious-militia</a></p>

<p>This story was also picked up by CBS News in 2000, who outright lead with the title that &quot;Bin Laden Reported to be Dying&quot; from &quot;kidney disease.&quot;

<p>In July 2001, the South Asia Analysis Group reports: &quot;Bin Laden, who suffers from renal deficiency, has been periodically undergoing dialysis in a Peshawar military hospital with the knowledge and approval of the Inter-Services Intelligence, (ISI) if not of Gen.Pervez Musharraf himself.&quot; Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper266.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper266.html</a>
September to November 2001: bin Laden is Trapped in Afghanistan, Unable to Receive Kidney Treatments</p>

<p>In September 2001, PBS&#39; Frontline interviews the former general counsel for the CIA, mentioning reports from 1998 that the DEA found out Osama bin Laden was undergoing kidney dialysis with a doctor in Peshwar. They mention further that the DEA wanted to poison bin Laden through his dialysis machine, but the CIA allegedy rejected this due to the ban on assassinations.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/terrorism/interviews/smith.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/terrorism/interviews/smith.html</a> In November 2001, The Guardian is reporting that French intelligence officials say bin Laden was flown to Dubai for kidney treatment in July of 2001, where he also met with several CIA agents and the head of Saudi intelligence. This story is also picked up by several French newspapers. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism</a> In his first interview since 9/11, in November 2001 bin Laden talks to a Pakistani newspaper and claims that his &quot;kidneys are all right&quot; and denies visiting a hospital in Dubai the previous year (note that he may have visited one in Pakistan). In the same interview he also asserts, clearly lying, that he has &quot;nuclear weapons.&quot; Link: <a href="http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2">http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2</a></p>

<p>December 2001: bin Laden is Dead, Buried in Afghanistan In December of 2001, the New York Times reports on &quot;high-level murmurings that bin Laden is dead.&quot; Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html</a> That same day,citing a Taliban source, Fox News reports that bin Laden has died due to an &quot;untreated lung complication&quot; from kidney disease. About 30 &quot;close associates&quot; reportedly attended bin Laden&#39;s funeral in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. A source concludes that the U.S. government and other forces are in a &quot;mad search operation&quot; but will never be able to locate the now-dead bin Laden, buried in an unmarked location. Link: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/12/26/report-bin-laden-already-dead/">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/12/26/report-bin-laden-already-dead/</a></p>

<p>Late December 2001 to March 2002: bin Laden&#39;s &quot;Death Video&quot; is Released In late December of 2001, after reports of bin Laden&#39;s funeral, a new video appears of a gaunt, sickly Osama bin Laden. The London Telegraph reports, verbatim: &quot;The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa&#39;eda leader was already dead.&quot; One aid further concludes that the video was created earlier in the event bin Laden is dead, who by December of 2001 was so heavily surrounded he would have been unable to escape to obtain kidney dialysis. Link: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html</a> </p>

<p>At this time CBS news also runs a story on bin Laden receiving kidney disease treatments in Pakistan the week before 9/11. Link:Osama bin Laden Near Death in 2002 (from Dan Rather CBS); US Government bin Laden LIE In January of 2002, The Guardian reports that the president of Pakistan speculates that bin Laden is now dead of untreated kidney disease based on video and photographs of a gaunt-looking bin Laden. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman</a> </p>

<p>In January of 2002, based on his analysis of video and photographs of bin Laden from December 2001, CNN&#39;s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that bin Laden seems to be having renal failure. He notes kidney dialysis is expensive, and suggests bin Laden would need help in obtaining medical treatment. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/</a> </p>

<p>In March 2002, the BBC reports on an interview with bin Laden&#39;s wife, who speaks of bin Laden in the past tense, notes his failing kidney and frequent use of pills and other medicines. She says she has not seen her husband since September 2001, but holds out hope that he is still alive: &quot;I feel deep inside me that he is still alive.&quot; She also notes that bin Laden&#39;s wish was to die in Afghanistan and nowhere else: &quot;He never spoke to me about his intention to leave Afghanistan and always wished to die there. He told me once that if he ever left Afghanistan, it would be to meet his Creator.&quot; She also says that bin Laden &quot;always suffered from kidney and stomach pains and that he &quot;told me once that he was going to Pakistan for treatment.&quot; Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm</a> </p>

<p>In March and April of 2002, U.S. officials downplay the threat of bin Laden, with Rumsfeld even saying the bin Laden threat has been &quot;neutralized.&quot; Even Bush, called out for rarely mentioning bin Laden in 2002, admits: &quot;We haven&#39;t heard from him [bin Laden] in a long time... I don&#39;t know where he is. I really just don&#39;t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.&quot; Link: Bush: Truly not concerned about bin Laden (short version) In May 2002, ABC News reports on a new spliced-together tape from unknown time periods in which bin Laden appears &quot;about the same&quot; (that is, sickly-looking) as in the tape from December 2011. ABC News also says they have &quot;learned intelligence reports indicate bin Laden had received a kidney transplant in Pakistan,&quot; but do not know when.

<p>July 2002: FBI Chief Says bin Laden is Most Likely Dead; Nothing from bin Laden Since December 2001 In July 2002, the BBC reveals a bombshell: the FBI&#39;s counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson says bin Laden is &#39;&quot;probably dead.&quot; Conveniently, bin Laden&#39;s followers&#39; claim that bin Laden will &quot;not make more video statements until his group launches another attack on the United States.&quot; Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm</a> </p>

<p>In July 2002, CNN reports that bin Laden&#39;s close bodyguards were captured in February of 2002, but not bin Laden. The article also quotes mentions some high-level officials: &quot;Some high-level U.S. officials are already convinced by such evidence that bin Laden, who has not been seen or heard from in months, is dead.&quot; Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/">http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/</a> </p>

<p>In July 2002, Time Magazine reports that &quot;intelligence officials are not certain whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead&quot; but that &quot;they have found a tantalizing document that suggests he was living at least as recently as the last days of December [of 2001].&quot; Link: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html</a> In July 2002, The New York Times runs another article on how Osama bin Laden is likely dead. The author notes how unusual it would be for bin Laden, known for his constant desire for media attention, would be silent for over half a year. Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html</a></p>

<p>October 2002: Intelligence Officials Confirm bin Laden is Dead; bin Laden&#39;s Will is Released Also in October 2002 the D.C.-based news service The World Tribune, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reports that the United States and Israel have concluded that bin Laden died in Afghanistan in December 2001. They note that additional bin Laden messages are &quot;probably fabrications,&quot; and that bin Laden&#39;s heir has been chosen. Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html</a> </p>

<p>The president of Afghanistan also concludes that bin Laden is probably dead: &quot;The more we don&#39;t hear of him, and the more time passes, there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere.&quot; Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/</a> In October 2002 CNN reports that U.S. intelligence officials have obtained Osama bin Laden&#39;s will, which is dated December 14, 2001 (approximately the same date as has been reported bin Laden&#39;s funeral in Tora Bora by Fox News and other outlets). CNN also reports that there has been no evidence of bin Laden since December of 2001. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/</a></p>

<p>2002 Onwards: Efforts to Target bin Laden are Closed Down; bin Laden = &quot;Elvis&quot; In 2004, the LA Times quotes Donald Rumsfeld (who mixes up Hussein with bin Laden) as admitting: &quot;We&#39;ve not seen him [bin Laden] on a video since 2001.&quot; Link: <a href="http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/binladen/death/rumsfeld-says-no-clues-to-bin-laden-since-2001.txt">http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/binladen/death/rumsfeld-says-no-clues-to-bin-laden-since-2001.txt</a> </p>

<p>In 2006 the New York Times reports the CIA had officially closed down the unit focused on capturing bin Laden the previous year. Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?ex=1309665600&amp;amp;en=3779ed9b98bb9d22&amp;amp;ei=5088&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?ex=1309665600&amp;amp;en=3779ed9b98bb9d22&amp;amp;ei=5088&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss</a> </p>

<p>In 2006, U.S. and Pakistani officials say they have not received any information about bin Laden in years: &quot;no tips from informants, no snippets from electronic intercepts, no points on any satellite image.&quot; The article rehashes the December 2001 video of bin Laden as the most recent evidence (other than a second-hand claim from 2003) of bin Laden&#39;s existence. Some commandos are now giving Osama bin Laden the codename &quot;Elvis.&quot; Link: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice none of the links offer quotes for which death was <em>confirmed</em>.  There is no <em>proof</em> being offered up at all.  Just a general speculation that he <em>may</em> have passed away due to illness.  Or is so ill, he&#39;s been relegated to a non-immediate/incapacitated threat.  </p>

<p>Interesting food for thought, but no evidence he actually died in the early 2000s.  Just an assumption that was being made at the time which may not have been true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bin Laden was a big name around that time, therefore being the best scapegoat to pin as the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the 9/11 false flag. </p>

<p>It is important to note that Bin Laden was never indited, and proof of his &quot;death&quot; in 2011 was some dude sitting in a house in Afghanistan watching the news. No tangible proof was ever given. </p>

<p>There was also very <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/20/families-suspect-seal-team-6-crash-was-inside-job-/">suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of members of Seal Team 6</a>.</p>

<p>There are many more &quot;plotholes&quot; if you will, such as completely botched translations and Osama magically appearing younger and younger as the years progressed. Corbett did an episode on this; I&#39;ll see if I can find it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible the  pseudo-osama (in the video decried as propaganda by bush) was another of their assets; planted there to do whatever before ultimately being tied up in the raid by his handlers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps 18 months gives someone sufficient time to cover tracks prior to the election?  Like if someone talked and said &quot;No way that was bin Laden&quot; the administration has 18 months to deal with them and cover it up without doing damage to the 2012 campaign.  </p>

<p>I am reasonably certain the men actually involved in the mission and the &quot;burial at sea&quot; (give me a goddang break, who believed that?) really believe they killed bin Laden and buried him at sea.</p>

At any slight dip in approval or doubt in &quot;The mission&quot;, suddenly there&#39;s a new Bin Laden video to spook the public with. Nevermind that Bin Laden was not showing signs of aging from renal impairment, nor that they all looked like they came from the same stock of 98-&#39;01 videos. Nor, for that matter, that this big bad terrorist seemed interest in showing any physical visual proof he was still alive, be it newspaper headlines or whatever else have you. That&#39;s not even getting into the terror alert color levels...

    <div class="md"><p>Most definitely. Also, gotta kill the guys who fake killed Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Seriously though, the majority (if not all) of Seal Team 6 were killed in a helicopter crash just 3 months after their involvement in the mission that purportedly resulted in Bin Laden&#39;s death. The crash was caused by local insurgents shooting down the chopper. </p>

<p>I heard from a second hand source (so take this next part with a grain of salt) of someone from Afghanistan who knew the area in which the incident happened, and expressed doubt that the insurgents there would have the money for (or access to) weapons capable of shooting down a military helicopter.</p>

The UBL raid was made entirely of senior members of red squadron where as extortion 17 was made up of members of gold squadron.

<p>25 Navy Seals from Seal Team 6 died in the helicopter crash, none of whom were involved with the Bin Laden raid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;d speculate:  </p>

<p>1) In the entire world, there were probably 5-10 people who really and truly knew if UBL was dead. So George Bush couldn&#39;t claim &quot;victory&quot; over UBL because there wasn&#39;t a certainty that he was truly dead. Even UBL&#39;s own wives weren&#39;t sure if he was alive or dead. UBL was in Afghanistan, he didn&#39;t have the luxury of picking up a cel phone and making a call.  </p>

<p>2) After nearly ten years of this, it became clear that the rumors were true: By 2011, the US government was 99.9&amp;#37; certain that UBL was dead.   </p>

<p>At that point, they had the freedom to &quot;go kill him.&quot;  </p>

<p>Keep in mind, it&#39;s very possible that even Seal Team Six doesn&#39;t know that UBL was already dead. They went to Pakistan and killed some dude; the dude that they killed may have simply been a random Pakistani who happened to resemble UBL. It&#39;s not like they had a conversation with the dude, they just flew out there, killed him, and took off with the body. UBL doesn&#39;t carry a driver&#39;s license, and nobody has a sample of his DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is pointing at Obama as having some nefarious hidden agenda with this. May 2011 was not an election year, and campaigning had barely started. Romney’s campaign didn’t start until June 2011 and he won the nomination on Aug 28, 2012 so there was A LOT of campaigning to do.</p>

<p>I think the most likely scenario, if it’s true Bin Laden was dead ahead of time, is that they needed to stop pretending in order to ‘de escalate’/ shift the war with the added bonus of vilifying Pakistan. In order to do so they needed to publicly and finally ‘kill off’ Bon Laden. If they didn’t kill him off then you would always have people asking why they gave up and what happened, it would just be a mess.</p>

<p>Of course I’m speculating and can’t know for sure, BUT immediately throwing Obama under the bus because it was an election year is pretty kooky.</p>

It was time to do away with the old white-robed camel jockey version of &quot;terrorism&quot; and replace it with the new, slick, vicious, well-funded, technologically-adept, globally dispatched &amp; networked version.<br/>
And, as usual, they probably made sure the charade served multiple purposes. In this case, they gave an impression of progress in the &quot;war on terror&quot; and strength &amp; competence in the White House.  They also began to use the media to paint the region as harborers of terrorists; as knowingly providing safe-haven for bin Laden. This was likely used to as pressure/leverage to accomplish something that was never reported on.<br/>
And, of curse, as usual, it was likely something else going on that they were diverting attention away from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s so wrong about that?   </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m not entirely sure I agree with the idea that the writers of these movies deliberately &quot;plant&quot; these ideas. In fact I don&#39;t agree with that. It&#39;s more reasonable to assume there are some among them who read as we do, think as we do, and mirror what they see in their stories, consciously or just perceptively.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not proof or &quot;evidence&quot; for bin Laden having been little more than an actor or puppet, but the portrayal of the Mandarin is a pretty good estimation of what otherwise appears to be the case, as OP&#39;s post suggests.  </p>

<p>How is it that the military and the CIA and whoever else was supposedly looking for Enemy #1 &quot;couldn&#39;t find&quot; the guy for years, but a CNN reporter can schedule an interview with the man himself? He was never a danger to anyone, and nobody looked to find him. Troops were sent to comb the desert, and whatever else they were sent there for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Bin Laden&#39;s network not keep any record / any hard evidence of his death to counter the U.S. narrative?  If the U.S. faked everything to drum up support and confidence, Al Qaeda, or whatever network was supporting Bin Laden at the time of the death would have to be the stupidest people to ever walk the earth to not keep record and hard evidence of his passing.  </p>

<p>This would have been the biggest slam dunk in the history of counter intelligence.  The U.S. would have been exposed to an irreparable state in much of the world&#39;s eye.  Yet, they have nothing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I remember all this happening live. It was pretty much assumed by most people that he had died.. aside from the countless rumors and many statements by high-ranking officials, there&#39;s the fact that the guy <em>loved</em> to put out videos of himself frequently, but after the reports of his death, he vanished from the face of the earth. No more videos were ever released, no more info about his movements and activity, not a trace of this very high profile person was ever seen again. </p>

<p>At least, not until that ridiculous show that Obama and the Seals put on for us. I felt like I was in the twilight zone.. really, no one else remembers that he&#39;s <em>Very</em> likely been dead for years now? Damned mass amnesia that settles in, so things can make sense to Average Joe. </p>

<p>The completely nonsensical &quot;burial at sea,&quot; with the accompanying utter lack of proof, was the kicker for me. That and the fact that the supposed picture of him dead was a very blatant photoshop, they blended a photo of him alive with a photo of some other corpse. So easy to tell when you look at them side by side.</p>

<p>If it weren&#39;t for the blatant BS, I might have been able to convince myself, too, that I guess he <em>didn&#39;t</em> die in 2001. But they couldn&#39;t even do a thoroughly convincing job of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.</p>

<p>These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.</p>

<p>Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.</p>

<p>The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.</p>

<p>The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.</p>

<p>The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.</p>

<p>NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.</p>

<p>The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.</p>

<p>This has been a public service announcement by: the Friends of the FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, SEC, MSM, White House, NIST, and the 9/11 Commission. Because Ignorance is Strength.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facts back you up, like OP did here. Even skeptics were swayed upon entering. Gatekeepers will shut you down on Reddit but that&#39;s illusory. On a personal, micro, level people are much more receptive given proper intelligence and data. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that wild an idea rich people work together to maintain wealth/power; and in being rich and having access to all life&#39;s pleasure become hedonistic and morally perverted. </p>

<p>You just gotta ease them into it. 9/11 is a good place to start if they don&#39;t have a knee-jerk emotional response (even if they do it&#39;s an injustice to the families to not find the truth)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that scenario is very likely. The raid and &#39;death&#39; of bin Laden was an attempt to take some of the wind out of the sails of Al Qaeda.  With bin Laden dead, AQ could no longer claim he was in charge and no longer use his escape as proof of their success.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sources? I tried to find stuff to back up the helicopters but all I found so far was that none of the seal team 6 members that died were part of red squadron, which was on the ground in the raid. </p>

<p>Only thing countering this is a statement from a lawyer representing 3 families from extortion 17, saying that there were 3(?) men part of the raid. </p>

<p>Any info about these other crashes or suspicious deaths?</p>
