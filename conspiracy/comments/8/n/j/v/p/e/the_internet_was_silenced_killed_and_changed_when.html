<p>Now bigdong69 is called fred starch and 1337xx5n1p37s is called john townsend. It becomes personal and ruins the fun of the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically there&#39;s a whole industry of people out there programming things like end bosses, getting paid for making things that &quot;aren&#39;t real&quot;, even though the software that comprises the end boss has to be stored in something physical, something real.</p>

<p>Are movies &quot;real&quot;? Certainly the events depicted therein likely did not happen, but the movies still exist. </p>

<p>The words someone says to me online, are they real? What if they were said to me in person? What&#39;s the difference really? They are the thoughts/feelings/opinions/etc. of a person somewhere being made manifest on some kind of physical media. Just because they&#39;re abstract doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not &quot;real&quot;.</p>

<p>Just define &quot;real&quot; as you understand it, this whole thing can be sorted with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, that clears things up a bit. But I mean, business is conducted over the internet. I&#39;ve ordered things from Amazon, applied for jobs online, made plans via e-mail etc. So some aspects of things that go on on the internet affect real life. The internet is affecting both of us enough that we&#39;re taking actions in real life to reply to one another.</p>

<p>I guess you&#39;re mostly talking about things like news, blogs, reddit posts, twitter, and other kinds of online informations that far too many people take too seriously? I think you and I agree on that point; in that way the internet is not especially real.</p>
