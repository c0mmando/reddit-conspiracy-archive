       Reddit and its' ilk are fine for posting a message and seeing some replies. True conversation can only happen at real time.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the chatrooms died, they killed the ability to converse and share ideas effectively.

       Many of us still chat and share ideas.  We were on IRC before AOL/MSN chat existed and still are today, plus you can use a unique pseudonym for each server, unlike something like Discord

       I would say it died when people were convinced it was okay to give out your real name and personal information to the earliest social media sites. When I was a child everyone was told to never give out any information about yourself to people you didn't know especially online. That common sense principle has been lost.

       This is an excellent point. Anonymity works. As soon as people lost that, all the words on the internet became personal. Before, it was just bigdong69 calling 1337xx5n1p37s a homo. It was just two names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now bigdong69 is called fred starch and 1337xx5n1p37s is called john townsend. It becomes personal and ruins the fun of the internet.

       To be fair though, I was a teenager when AOL took over the world and creepers in the chat rooms were a constant menace.

       So basically there's a whole industry of people out there programming things like end bosses, getting paid for making things that "aren't real", even though the software that comprises the end boss has to be stored in something physical, something real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are movies "real"? Certainly the events depicted therein likely did not happen, but the movies still exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The words someone says to me online, are they real? What if they were said to me in person? What's the difference really? They are the thoughts/feelings/opinions/etc. of a person somewhere being made manifest on some kind of physical media. Just because they're abstract doesn't mean it's not "real".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just define "real" as you understand it, this whole thing can be sorted with that.

       If you start to define what is 'real' you do end up going down that philosophical rabbit hole.

       I don't think what somebody says on the internet should matter at all. It never did in the days of anonymity.

       You can wax philosophical about defining real, but to leave something ambiguous when you're using it as though it means something concrete is only going to cause confusion about your meaning. So either you mean something specific when you say the internet is not "real" or you aren't even sure what you mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying things on the internet don't matter, well they have the potential to matter as much as the things that are printed in newspapers, or appear on the TV. Arguably they matter as much as one chooses to let them, but it won't make them disappear.

       Alright, that clears things up a bit. But I mean, business is conducted over the internet. I've ordered things from Amazon, applied for jobs online, made plans via e-mail etc. So some aspects of things that go on on the internet affect real life. The internet is affecting both of us enough that we're taking actions in real life to reply to one another.

       I guess you're mostly talking about things like news, blogs, reddit posts, twitter, and other kinds of online informations that far too many people take too seriously? I think you and I agree on that point; in that way the internet is not especially real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate you taking the time to help me understand.

       The old-style chat rooms were full of ignorant deviant children.
It's the same exact thing that twitter is now.

      <p>
       Anybody who tried to have a decent intelligent conversation in a chat room were drowned out by infantile children telling dick jokes.

       The same exact thing that happens on a daily basis on twitter now.

       I disagree, sort of. Yeah, there was a lot of dick and gay jokes, which was ace if that's what you wanted (something you can't find nowadays. I don't count twitter because it's just a website of drive-by, one-off shitposts. It doesn't ebb and flow with the tide of conversation.
