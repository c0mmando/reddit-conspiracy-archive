    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect you to take the Bible literally, as I myself am not a Christian. But can you tell me what you know about Satan in the Garden of Eden? Did you know that the Hebrew word for serpent is Nachash? Many Hewbrew and Christian scholars maintain that the word Nachash originally meant &quot;Upright shining one&quot;. To go even further, an upright shining being that practices divination. So here we have a highly intelligent, upright talking being that is serpentine in appearance. Now can you tell me what the punishment for the serpent was? It was cursed and forced to crawl on its belly for the rest of its day. Don&#39;t snakes already crawl on their bellies? Nearly every Christian scholar believes the serpent in the Garden of Eden originally had legs. Now is it possible the the theory of &quot;reptilians&quot; or &quot;lizard-men&quot; goes back a lot further than we originally thought? </p>

<p>I believe that <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W8k_-zfUyVg/S9efZ6cPIYI/AAAAAAAACGA/EH1SkSu1oxk/s1600/Crumb-Genesis+%28snake%29.jpg">Satan in the garden of Eden was a reptilian</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The triune brain is a model of the evolution of the vertebrate forebrain and behavior, proposed by the American physician and neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean. MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book The Triune Brain in Evolution.[1] The triune brain consists of the reptilian complex, the paleomammalian complex (limbic system), and the neomammalian complex (neocortex), viewed as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. However, this hypothesis is no longer espoused by the majority of comparative neuroscientists in the post-2000 era.[2] The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through Carl Sagan&#39;s Pulitzer prize winning 1977 book The Dragons of Eden. The theory has been embraced by some psychiatrists and at least one leading affective neuroscience researcher.[3]</p>

<p><strong>Reptilian complex</strong><br/>
The reptilian complex, also known as the R-complex or &quot;reptilian brain&quot; was the name MacLean gave to the basal ganglia, structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the idea that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species-typical instinctual behaviours involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that David Icke had a psychotic break with reality in 1991. Well, actually that bit isn&#39;t my opinion, it&#39;s a fact. </p>

<p>He recovered from that spell of mental ill-health, but has made a terrible (and not uncommon) mistake about that experience. </p>

<p>He should have shrugged his shoulders and accepted that he thought odd things were happening to him because he was going through a nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>But what he did instead was insist that the weird things that happened to him were objectively real, and came to believe that rather than going through a breakdown, he had made a breakthrough.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some poisonous sneer. Anyone with experience of these things (first-hand or at close quarters) will concede that some people do not return to &quot;normality&quot; when they return to mental health.</p>

<p>As I say, I think David Icke is in good mental health these days. It&#39;s just that post-1991 he believes any old gubbins. If it can be summed up as &quot;a conspiracy,&quot; Icke will jump into bed with it and start making mad passionate love.</p>

<p>As such, he can be an interesting chap to look in on, now and again, because he turns up some fascinatingly obscure and esoteric stuff. But his opinions on what he turns up are usually dubious to a greater or lesser degree.</p>

<p>As for whether any of his opinions are legit, I don&#39;t know. Most, I think, are not. And my suspicion is that anything he got right would be because he had accidentally read the right book or absorbed the right info. He doesn&#39;t seem to be discerning enough to distinguish a sound theory from a dud. </p>

<p>Everything&#39;s at the same level with him, if something is not 100% true in his mind then he thinks it&#39;s a sinister deception that he can expose. So it&#39;s win-win for him, because he can drag any subject he likes into his ten-hour PowerPoint presentations at Wembley Stadium.</p>

<p>I think he&#39;d probably be fun to have a beer and a smoke with. When he&#39;s not holding forth about his latest favourite theory, he seems quite dry and witty. </p>

<p>His son obviously adores him, and as far as I am concerned that is testament enough to the fact that Icke is a decent person in himself. That&#39;s all that really matters. Icke talks about love, and he practises what he preaches in his private life.</p>

<p>Everyone focuses on the reptilian aspect of David&#39;s cosmology when it really isn&#39;t that important. Watching the interview with Zulu historian Credo Mutwa is recommended whether you thinks it&#39;s a hoax or not.</p>

<p>People focus too much on specific things to pick on when it comes to David such as the repitilian thing, and his awakening. Your only lucky your life is not in public when you entertain such beliefs. The normies lust to mock you at every turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect you to take the Bible literally, as I myself am not a Christian. But can you tell me what you know about Satan in the Garden of Eden? Did you know that the Hebrew word for serpent is Nachash? Many Hewbrew and Christian scholars maintain that the word Nachash originally meant &quot;Upright shining one&quot;. To go even further, an upright shining being that practices divination. So here we have a highly intelligent, upright talking being that is serpentine in appearance. Now can you tell me what the punishment for the serpent was? It was cursed and forced to crawl on its belly for the rest of its day. Don&#39;t snakes already crawl on their bellies? Nearly every Christian scholar believes the serpent in the Garden of Eden originally had legs. Now is it possible the the theory of &quot;reptilians&quot; or &quot;lizard-men&quot; goes back a lot further than we originally thought? </p>

<p>I believe that <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W8k_-zfUyVg/S9efZ6cPIYI/AAAAAAAACGA/EH1SkSu1oxk/s1600/Crumb-Genesis+%28snake%29.jpg">Satan in the garden of Eden was a reptilian</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Icke was asked directly about the reptilian nonsense once, and he confirmed that he believes in <strong><em>literal reptilian humaniods</em></strong>. It&#39;s a reasonable <strong><em>metaphor</em></strong> for the attributes you listed, but he clearly <strong><em>denied</em></strong> that he was using it that way.</p>
