        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;m gonna try to keep this as short as I can for now as I&#39;m on mobile,but it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been mulling around with in my head lately about the beginnings of religions and the conspiracy behind how it became used for manipulation through fear.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the basic jist of my theory, and it starts out back when man was still struggling as hunter/gatherers and before the domestication of dogs and other animals. These ancient people&#39;s roamed around in packs following behind herds of whatever large prey animals were native to the area in order to obtain their food. You know what other animals followed behind these same herds of large prey? Yep, wolves.</p>

<p>The wolves, being large opportunistic predators of course would occasionally pick off a person or two when it was the easiest meal. Humans being pretty intelligent realized this, and to keep their camps from being attacked at night while they slept and we&#39;re most vulnerable, they started leaving whatever meat that they could spare on the outer edges of their camps to subdue the beasts so they could rest.</p>

<p>This goes on and on over many generations. Slowly the wolves and humans relationship grew to the point that the wolves became domesticated, and the humans now kept the wolves in camp to serve as protection. Humans being creatures of habit however kept on putting food out at night because it had been inscribed into their brains over many generations that the only way that you can be safe to sleep at night is if you leave food out to appease the beasts of the dark.</p>

<p>Many many more generations pass and the original context of why they did this faded. In order to justify these actions people start making up their own stories of why they do it, because &quot;well my dad taught me to do it, and his dad taught him&quot; wasn&#39;t good enough. And so they made up stories of the &quot;angry gods&quot; that would come and kill them if they didn&#39;t leave food and drink for them at an altar every night. Setting the stage for people in power to realize that they could use these stories in order to scare and manipulate people to do what they want and turn into what religion has become today.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the basics of it for now, at least until I have some time to get the details all wrote down and organized.</p>

I would put forth that the smartest man knew no one would doubt that the offerings were working, so he took advantage of the situation and kept the offerings for himself.

You are absolutely correct is that they like to pervert knowledge to control us.  Old trick, just happens to work.  I also like wolves.  The idea that we used to leave food for predators leading to sacrifice...very interesting.  Thank you for sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it more likely that any &quot;sacred&quot; imagery created or godheads worshipped stemmed from genuine experiences of &quot;spiritual revelation&quot; if you will, and attempts to describe the world glimpsed are reflected in religious imagery.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you will find it interesting.  It&#39;s an insanely ethical religion.  It&#39;s also the roots of Christianity-- the Jews got captured and taken to Babylon where they encountered Zoroastrian thought.  It converted them from having the Mosaic fire-and-brimstone god who was personal to the Jews into having a god who was God of Creation.</p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s the &quot;ethical layer&quot; of Abrahamic religions.  And compared to other religions it was incredibly uncorrupted.</p>

<p>Usually the &quot;bad points&quot; people name about religions-- all the shaming, heretic burning, etc, these are put in place later by power people who usurp someone else&#39;s creation (not dissimilar to how the comic book industry was taken over by people with a different goal than &quot;creating comics&quot;).  </p>

<p>It&#39;s helpful to go back to the core of religions before someone decided to make it a part of their power struggle.  Humans tend to do that, but they do it with <em>everything.</em>  The core religions-- even if you go to core Greek or Norse mythology, is always incredibly just and ethical.</p>

<p>Also, have a look at the new startup American religions, like Mormonism, Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, etc... they never &quot;start up&quot; by appealing to people&#39;s bad natures.  They always appeal to hope or freedom or love and turn exclusive and bitter (for want of a better word) later when the &quot;marketers&quot; and &quot;businessmen&quot; and &quot;governments&quot; enter the fray.    </p>

<p>It&#39;s exactly like a business cycle actually-- the entrepreneur starts something, then he sells stock, and then a generation later the purpose of the business is to sell stock, not to produce the product any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a religious person nor could I ever be, but I find human psychology very interesting so I always like to read as much as I can about the things that influence people to do what they do so I&#39;ve looked into alot of the more recent religions that are still around. I&#39;ve just recently started looking deeper into the psychology that may have existed in early humans brains to see where these areas could lead my brain to function how it does today. </p>

<p>No...just no. Leaving fucking food lying about your camp is a great way invite predators. There&#39;s a reason when you go camping in bear country you take your food away from camp and put it up in a tree. </p>

<p>The domestication of the wolf was probably relatively quick, as both man and wolf were pack hunters and adapted well to mutual cooperation. It&#39;s not uncommon today for wolves, if taken from birth, to imprint upon and accept a person or people as their own.</p>

<p>So your argument against my idea that early humans would leave food at the outer edges of their camps, is that humans still leave their food at the outer edge of their camps.. strong start..</p>

<p>&quot;The domestication of the wolf was probably relatively quick, as both man and wolf were pack hunters and adapted well to mutual cooperation.&quot; </p>

<p>The origins of the domestication of canines is debatable at best, but the general consensus based on current evidence puts it somewhere around 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. Modern humans showed up around 2 million years ago, so I guess that really depends on your idea of relatively quick.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not uncommon today for wolves, if taken from birth, to imprint upon and accept a person or people as their own.&quot;</p>

<p>Ever heard of genetic memory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...?</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about leaving food literally outside the periphery of the camp for predators to eat.  As if they&#39;re going to be like &quot;Welp...I&#39;m full from all these scraps...guess I&#39;ll leave those pink squirmy defenseless things alone. &quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking taking the food a good 50 yards away and securing it up in a tree.  If a predator catches a wiff and comes looking for it, he&#39;s not going to be stumbling around in the middle of your camp licking his chops...he&#39;s going to be 50 yards away giving you a chance to assess the situation.</p>

<p>These are NOT the same things. Don&#39;t take my word...go talk to anyone who&#39;s been camping out in the wilderness for any period of time. Or...put your money where you mouth is. I invite you to go set up camp in the middle of Alaska or Montana, leave your food next to your tent, and see what happens.</p>

<p>LMAO modern humans did not show up 2 million years ago. The genus Homo is most likely that old, but Sapiens are not.  Newest archaeological evidence puts modern humans emerging around 500,000 years. That&#39;s even recently been pushed back from 350,000 years. </p>

<p>Genetic memory in animals is literally instinct...I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to swing at here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about a 20 foot by 20 foot concrete slab campsite in a national park,  and I do set up camp sites quite often when hunting. I meant camps in the sense of &quot;oh we&quot;ll set up camp over in that ravine for the night, or on top of that hill&quot;  of course I didn&#39;t mean have a blood orgy in the middle of your tents then fall asleep on top of it. I was actually implying further away than 50 yards.</p>

<p>Yeah homo sapien isn&#39;t 2 million years old, I was referring to homo erectus who were the first known Hunter/ gatherers to set up &quot;modern&quot; societies.</p>

<p>Genetic memory reference too the fact that if wolves evolved side by side hunting near and then with humans that, yeah if you take a baby wolf and raise it with humans it will adapt very quickly. As one would expect a previously domesticated species to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve had a lot of fun thinking about your theory, and I&#39;ll grant that it&#39;s a viable and interesting one.  </p>

<p>I think the largest &quot;hole&quot; in the theory is that mankind basically exists in a state of extreme poverty under natural conditions-- meaning that, a tribe would have a great deal of difficulty putting out any quantity of food any time the hunting was bad.  The tribe would starve.</p>

<p>And the more aboriginal a people is, the more likely they are to use &quot;all parts of the animals.&quot;  For instance, American Indians wasted NOTHING-- because nothing could really afford to be wasted.  And even more prosperous cultures, they have all kinds of traditional foods made of weird things whose clear purpose is to use everything they possibly can.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll counterpoint myself with the fact that the ancient Greeks used to burn as sacrifices bones and fat.  The bones were unusable, and olive oil supplied plenty of fat so that animal fat could be spared (in Greek mythology, Prometheus tricked the gods into accepting the &quot;worthless&quot; sacrifices).</p>

<p>So that would be consistent with your theory.  But as far as I know, the Greeks are an extreme outlier-- I believe other sacrificial religions burned the choice bits, which could only happen after the people were already quite prosperous.</p>

<p>Here is a short article on research done by Cambridge and Exeter universities, and they have pretty good proof for early humans being directly responsible for the extinction of many species.</p>

<p>As for native americans not wasting anything, that simply isn&#39;t true. Some tribes maybe didn&#39;t, but there are plenty of tribes that did leave food offerings for spirits. I suggest looking into the ritual of the Spirit Plate. Essentially anytime a meal was prepared they would make a plate for the spirits and leave the nicest piece of meat, largest ear of corn, basically the best of the best, out for the spirits. This then in some tribes transformed into the act of smoke sacrifice, where they would take the nicest, juiciest, most delicious piece of meat and literally just throw it in their fire to appease the spirits. So it would seem, at least in certain areas, that there was certainly an abundance of food and quite alot of waste taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check into it-- but I assumed we were talking early early on for the genesis of these ideas on the poverty angle-- like actually before anything we would identify with as &quot;culture&quot; (I think I&#39;ve read dog domestication goes back 50-75k years?).</p>

<p>Your examples above would be, I think, later than the Younger Dryas because that&#39;s when people began farming and farming brought surpluses pretty fast as indicated by the population explosion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing offhand that religion in humans pre-dates that (even some great apes bury their dead with food or implements for the afterlife) and arose REALLY early-- like off our timescales, really.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll definitely check out Clan of the Cave Bear as I have not read it, thank you for the suggestion.</p>

<p>As for the Native Americans starting to use every part of an animal, I think alot of that started after Europeans arrived and during the times when Europeans were killing every living animal that they could in Native American territories in order to force them out to make their own settlements. Though as you pointed out I&#39;m sure it is very possible that in the earliest days of these tribes they may have had to live similarly. </p>

<p>This all does occur on a timescale that is simply unimaginable so of course  it is very hard to find any real valuable information to use for examples as it would have been long before recorded history. I was just trying to give at least somewhat credible examples, as talking about anything that occurred more than a few thousand years ago becomes purely speculation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one of the fundamental laws of the science of domestication is that both the the domesticator and the domesticate get domesticated genetically via the process of domestication.  It&#39;s true for domesticated plants too.  It&#39;s worthwhile taking a class on this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wolves and humans have a similar social order so it was quite easy for both of them to merge into a cooperative &#39;venture&#39; together... some think that is why humans have a reduced sense of smell compared to other animals, early dogs were way better... and that is also why dogs are less intelligent than wolves...</p>

<p>I will though respectfully disagree on the leaving out of meat at night. I&#39;ve been in a lot of backwater places and that&#39;s a big no-no, it attracts all the predators you don&#39;t want, along with vermin.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that if you leave meat directly right beside you, that yes something is going to come eat it, right beside you.. but in excavations of numerous &quot;religious&quot; sites that they found direct evidence and writings of people leaving foods and drinks at altars (whether in home or in a temple) for &quot;gods&quot; I don&#39;t really think that it is disputable that leaving food out for whatever they were leaving it out for happened in the early days of polytheism, or whatever other early religions inspired said circumstances of leaving foods on altars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I very much appreciate your thought of dogs being less intelligent than wolves due to humans interactions. But from what I have looked at in terms of domesticated dog species it seems more likely that in-breeding was more to blame for that than anything (which is also human caused) because there are plenty of &quot;wild dog&quot; species much more intelligent in how they survive than wolves </p>
