   r/conspiracy: I'm amazed by the mystery of Cattle Mutilation. This sh*t is actually real! and no logical theory i've heard, can explain it. I think researching it may be avoided by some, from fear of being linked to the UFO Community theory, which gets a huge amount of interest. It's a vast mystery, any thoughts? | /r/Conspiracy Archive

       They probably are about as surprised as the average person but aren't able to conclude a definitive explanation despite investigating every bit now physical evidence left behind. Unexplained circumstances aren't automatically classified as "committed by super-intelligent inhumans". Just like the pilots in that UFO video know what they saw, but don't know the pilots identity or intentions.

       every law enforcement officer and veterinarian involved in the investigation has alluded to agreeing with the 'alien theory'. despite your not being a fan b/c it's an 'easy solution', Occam's Razor would say that this is the best explaination for what happened to midwest cattle ranchers in the late 70s &amp; into the 80s.

       Well if you can prove that the organs were removed in a way that our current technology does not allow and no animal has ever been able to do, what does that leave you with. I don't think anyone is saying it was definitely aliens but maybe "I guess that is as possible as anything else we can think of."

       Yeah ive come across her name before. Do you have any links to documentaries you would recommend? The topic seems to be overwhelmed with documentaries trying and prove the alien theory but not many that look at it with the perspective of things like a possible government project.

       Linda Moulton Howe has been researching this for many, many years.  She talks about it on occasion on her Earthfiles youtube channel.
I've heard a couple of theories about why this occurs: certain ETs require the biological stuff they take from the cattle; apparently it's their food.  The other theory I heard was that it's being done by the military and/or 'Deep State' to strike fear into into people.
I mean, how the hell do you explain a cow, missing most of it's parts, that's found in a field of completely undisturbed grass?

       That podcast episode talks about government involvement but from the perspective of them monitoring certain severe cattle diseases which are kept secret from the public to prevent panic, but theres a few things the theory cant explain, every theory ive heard has some aspect of a 'plot hole' so to speak

       My hypothesis:
      </p>
      <p>
       They always remove the same list of odd tissues because they're tracking accumulation of specific things in the biological samples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever they're testing for accumulates in different types of tissues at different concentrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cows are a great tool to assess the environment; they spend all day eating vegetation in the area and any environmental pollutants that might be present (radiation,  assorted heavy metals, chemical pollutants,  biological contaminants) build up in their tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take consistent samples every time (50g of cheek muscle,  left eyeball,  100g of cored-out anus,  etc.) from every cow you abduct,  you can test those tissues for the specific amounts of things you're keeping track of and build a dynamic picture of how contaminants or nutrients or whatever are moving through the ecosystem when anything is altered in the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alien or human,  they're sampling for environmental assay purposes.

       Forget where I saw/read about it, but it was an argument that the mutilations were a result of radiation and or chemical testing. That the parts of the body removed, would have contact with ground more frequently or with other animals that may have had high exposures.

       I've heard of this in western Nebraska from a very sober cowboy. Dead cows in the middle of nowhere, far from any road, organs removed, precise cuts like it was done with a laser.  Made no sense at all. Driving up through the panhandle was somehow the creepiest experience in my life, which is weird because it's just rolling grassland.  Had that feeling of being watched x 1000.  I've been in jungles and remote areas alone at night, creepy noises keeping me awake, but this was the worst, just driving down a country road in the afternoon.  Couldn't wait to get out of there.

       I live pretty rurally and people think weird shit about these areas. “Watched x1000,” yeah, by bugs and rodents and prairie dogs avoiding the very rare predator. I know ranchers in New Mexico who have never seen a weird light in the sky in their lives. Life is pretty normal.

       Certain areas in the countryside seem to carry a much stronger feeling of being watched than others for some reason. I've been to some of the most densely populated cities in the world and haven't felt as watched as on some of those country roads.

       I read an interesting book written by a guy named Gabe Valdez who spent like 20-30 years as a New Mexico State Trooper.  He has done an extensive investigation on the subject just in the Dulce area and says it's the US govt is doing it to monitor the health of animals in areas where nuclear tests were performed many years ago.  I'm not convinced at his explanation though, because these cows have been found all over the world.

        Mind Control, World Control - The Encyclopedia of Mind Control by Jim Keith
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A short and non-definitive digression into a related 
phenomenon: cattle mutilations. These are the thousands of 
mysterious cases of cattle that since the late 1960s have been 
found dissected, sometimes in a surgical fashion, and which are 
usually linked in the media to flying saucer intervention. A case 
could be made for the "mutes" being an issue of mind control in 
themselves, but put that aside. There is a large body of evidence 
suggesting that the mutilations are of a far more terrestrial 
nature than tabloid TV will allow us to imagine. 
For starters,
        <strong>
         UFOs are almost never seen in the vicinity of 
cattle mutilation
        </strong>
        , that is, using the strict definition of 
unidentified flying OBJECTS.
        <strong>
         What are seen are usually 
unidentified lights and, when a craft is seen, it is usually a black 
unmarked helicopter
        </strong>
        . There is no limit to the rabidity of some 
UFO buffs, and so the black choppers are sometimes mentioned 
as being shape-shifting extraterrestrial craft, when in fact there 
is no evidence whatsoever to suggest this. Why not, instead, go 
out on a limb and simply imagine that they are black 
helicopters?
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Other evidence suggests that men, not alien monsters, are 
doing the mutilations. Toxicology tests sometimes show the 
presence of nicotine in the bovine carcasses, and nicotine is a 
commonly used ingredient in tranquilizer dart drugs. The 
animals are sometimes found to have been marked with 
fluorescent paint, presumably for identification in the dark. 
Also, often seen in the vicinity of mutilations are truck-trailer 
rigs, large enough for transporting small helicopters. At least 
one probable staging area for the mutilation episodes has been 
identified in Colorado, as noted in my book Black Helicopters II: 
The Endgame Strategy.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Why would humans be interested in mutilating cattle? The 
most probable answer was provided by G.C. Errianne, a private 
investigator who looked into the matter. Erriane indicated that 
covert government testing was done using cattle due to the 
similarity of the membrane of the eye with "a certain ethnic 
group." Further investigation showed that the U.S. government 
had been involved in testing biowarfare weapons specifically 
targeted to at least two ethnicities.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as government manipulation involving humans, one of 
the "premier" abduction cases that seems to have set the stage 
for many that followed was that of Betty and Barney Hill. In 
1961 the Hills were motoring in Groveton, New Hampshire, 
when a flying disk craft approached and hovered at a distance. 
The Hills fled in their car but later, because of nightmares, 
consulted a psychiatrist and were hypnotized. Six months of 
therapy seemed to reveal an abduction and physical examination 
by humanoids in the disk craft.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nature of the abduction itself was quite strange, with the 
inhabitants of the saucer craft being described by Betty Hill 
under hypnosis as wearing uniforms and billed caps ("similar to 
Air Force," she said during hypnotic regression).
        <strong>
         Barney Hill 
thought that one of the supposed aliens looked like a "military 
pilot," and amended that: "He looks like a German Nazi. He's a 
Nazi..." Hill said, "I thought of the Navy and the submarine
        </strong>
        , and 
I thought the men that moved back were just dressed in blue 
denims. But this other man was dressed in a black shiny coat, 
with a cap on."
       </p>
       <p>
        If the government was involved in the abduction, what might 
have brought the Hills to their attention was the fact that they 
were an interracial couple, and held organizational positions in a 
number of civil rights groups. This was at a time when such 
groups were under close scrutiny by the government, and it may 
have suited military psy-ops to either examine the Hills 
hypnotically, or even implant bugging devices for surveillance. 
The Hills were also close friends with Major James McDonald, 
reportedly working in intelligence at Pease Air Force Base.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He also says some things about Moulton Howe:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After Bennewitz, the web of disinformation continued to 
spread. In 1983 Linda Moulton Howe, a well-known UFO 
researcher who oddly seems unable to entertain any other idea 
than that UFOs are from outer space, was working on an HBO 
documentary on UFOs. According to Moore, "when the 
filmmaker [Howe] appeared on the scene, and it looked as if 
Paul's story might become part of the script, the 
counterintelligence people simply extended their 
disinformation activities accordingly."
       </p>
       <p>
        Howe met Richard Doty at Kirtland Air Force Base in a 
building posted as an Air Force Office of Special Investigations 
office. Once inside, Howe was taken to a room to speak with 
Doty. Howe believed that they were going to discuss a UFO 
sighting that had taken place at Ellsworth Air Force base, but 
Doty began talking about her UFO documentary, leading her to 
believe that she had been closely monitored during the film's 
production. Doty told her that her research, and in particular an 
earlier documentary titled Strange Harvest, had upset people, 
with the implication that they were ranking military people. 
Doty also told her that his superiors had asked him to show her 
the contents of a plain brown envelope, which he removed from 
a desk drawer. Although she was allowed to read the contents of 
the envelope, she was not permitted to take notes. 
Inside the envelope was a document titled "Briefing Paper for 
the President of the United States of America About 
Unidentified Aerial Vehicles," or very similar words. The 
"Briefing Paper" described incidents of flying saucer crashes in 
Aztec, New Mexico; Kingman, Arizona; Mexico; and two in 
Roswell, New Mexico.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the briefing, two species of extraterrestrials had 
established contact with the U.S. government. One species was 
the well-known Greys, while the other was not described. The 
document mentioned that extraterrestrials had been responsible 
for creating Jesus Christ as a means for influencing human 
behavior.
       </p>
       <p>
        The madness would spread. The UFO field would soon 
collide with the political conspiracy research field and with the 
underground patriot movement, and men like Bill Cooper, John 
Lear, and others would be proclaiming that the secretive men 
who ruled the world were not men at all. What was done to 
Bennewitz and Howe on an individual case basis, was soon being 
done to the American public on a much wider scale — and is still 
being done by disinformation agents and the gullible souls who 
believe them.

       I work in health care, I don't think it's prion tracking because of the long period between exposure and onset of symptoms. They specifically target cattle because they graze and they're more sensitive to it. It's tracking radioactive waste/byproducts in the food chain.

       Mutilated cattle tend to be found most frequently in areas with a history of radiation testing.  They also tend to have their soft tissue removed at a high rate.  The best explanation for the phenomenon that I've ever heard was that cattle mutilations were done periodically to test the potential effects of any residual radiation near test sites.

       william cooper said it was military experiments, I think this is by far the most plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you were on some military base and charged with testing some or another laser, you would send out some special forces unit to find some cow to test it on, take pictures, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       it would be a training exercise for the troops and a media control exercise/experiment for psy ops.

       a lot of us military research, or private research, is off books, top secret etc etc.

       testing on animals probably has regulations, and animal rights people are not going to stand for cows being cut in half with lasers for science

       im not saying this is a regular thing or there would be more mutilations, i'm saying that it is something i can imagine in some case being done.

       I looked in to this a long while back and the conclusion I came to is the "surgical" cut down the belly was likely due to the corpse expanding with gases and splitting it open, the missing organs are probably taken by animals, birds and insects because an open cow in a field is a buffet to wildlife.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a couple of animals with perfect lines down their belly exposing their insides including a sheep, a cow a goat and a whale on the beach. It's always in hot weather/seasons (look for cattle mutilations in winter) so I'm guessing they die from natural causes, the body starts to break down under the sun, gasses build up internally bloating the animal until the skin tears. (Most farm animals have a natural straight seam running down their bellies, it's where tripe cuts come from).
      </p>
      <p>
       Would be happy to be proven wrong but to my knowledge it's the best explanation we have so far.
