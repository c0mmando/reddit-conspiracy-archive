    <div class="md"><p>Also, if you keep digging, certain videos are utterly jammed with commercial ads of one kind or another. And they are consistently positioned at points where the interview is touching on an important issue, sometimes down to the second, when the person is in the middle of a sentence or explanation and it&#39;s cut for a video game ad or something.</p>
