<p>Trump is the perfect choice for this. He is <em>great</em> at media manipulation but has absolutely no clue about global strategy or any other serious political issues for that matter. He&#39;s in it for himself and his buddies, all the while thinking he&#39;s King and can do no wrong. </p>

<p>Believe me, if this wasn&#39;t what TPTB wanted, Trump would be on a slab with a bullet in his head right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a trend and trend trajectory, since 9/11. Since Bush, Bush was bad, Obama was worse and Trump is even more terrible?  It&#39;s been the same foreign policy since Bush.  Each followed the same steps.  Probably the same domestic policies too.  </p>

<p>&quot;The Democratic and Republican parties collaborate toward this same goal, using Congress as a stage, where they carry on a theater of divisiveness, providing the appearance of a democratic decision-making process.</p>

<p>While the two party lines have many differences, in order to keep the two cults separated, they in fact share basic essentials in common. They both sustain the myth that state policy is a response to public sentiment, and they blame the other cult for providing support for the ‘bad’ policies. In fact US policy is made outside of government, by financial elites, and the state aims to control public sentiment, not respond to it.</p>

<p>We see this same multi-cult dynamic operating in the US, in the divisiveness between liberals and conservatives. Liberals are kept in the fold by stories of conservative folly, and conservatives are kept in the fold by stories of liberal folly. In a propaganda-only system of control, there would be one party line for everyone. In this multi-cult system, there are two party lines, which we might characterize as CNN vs. FOX. </p>

<p>Thus is maintained the Matrix, the story we are told about US benevolence, the existence of democracy, the sacredness of market forces, and all the rest. With control of major media in just a few hands, the party line can be always maintained, and current (or past) events can be interpreted within that framework. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why did the face in the Oval Office change but the policies remain the same? Critics tend to focus on Obama himself, a leader who perhaps has shifted with politics to take a harder line. But Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon has a more pessimistic answer: Obama couldn’t have changed policies much even if he tried.</p>

<p>Though it’s a bedrock American principle that citizens can steer their own government by electing new officials, Glennon suggests that in practice, much of our government no longer works that way. In a new book, “National Security and Double Government,” he catalogs the ways that the defense and national security apparatus is effectively self-governing, with virtually no accountability, transparency, or checks and balances of any kind. He uses the term “double government”: There’s the one we elect, and then there’s the one behind it, steering huge swaths of policy almost unchecked. Elected officials end up serving as mere cover for the real decisions made by the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Glennon cites the example of Obama and his team being shocked and angry to discover upon taking office that the military gave them only two options for the war in Afghanistan: The United States could add more troops, or the United States could add a lot more troops. Hemmed in, Obama added 30,000 more troops.</p>

<p>In fact, he is the quintessential insider: He was legal counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a consultant to various congressional committees, as well as to the State Department. “National Security and Double Government” comes favorably blurbed by former members of the Defense Department, State Department, White House, and even the CIA. And he’s not a conspiracy theorist: Rather, he sees the problem as one of “smart, hard-working, public-spirited people acting in good faith who are responding to systemic incentives”—without any meaningful oversight to rein them in. <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/10/18/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL/story.html">https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/10/18/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL/story.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong> asserted that &quot;We are now forming a Republican form of government. Real liberty is not found in the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments. If we incline too much to democracy we shall soon shoot into a monarchy, or some other form of a dictatorship</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> declared: &quot;A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong> had similar concerns of a democracy when he warned that “Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>John Adams</strong>, our second president, wrote: “Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>James Madison</strong>, the father of the Constitution wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10 that pure democracies “have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Constitution itself, in Article IV, Section 4</strong>, declares: &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a <strong>Republican Form of Government.”</strong>Obviously the Framers were not speaking of a political party, as no political parties existed at that time</p>

Where&#39;s the jackpot that Donald Rumsfeld promised me?  The defeat of Al-Qaeda and ISIS? Well, didn&#39;t Putin wipe out the terrorist and rebel groups in Syria, rebels supported by the Americans that attacked us on 9/11?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;appropriate&quot;, I could say America deserves what it gets. But it was gonna come to the US. It&#39;s not been going well for the US.  Like the US planners were short sighted.  The New American Century - how exactly?  how to make America Great Again in this new 21st century?  Well, America has tried, bombed and or destroyed countries listed earlier.  You can only bomb and war with so many nations. But the world is watching America through the lens of the internet.  Who else can we bomb? It&#39;s limited options for the US.  The US went on the offensive or defensive whatever you call it after September 11.  </p>

<p>Either way, America has no choice but to retreat!  Check out this amazing study, 200 plus years of data so it&#39;s 100&amp;#37; SURE:  <a href="http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showthread.php?t=288699">http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showthread.php?t=288699</a></p>

My turn to go grasshopper off now and learn from people who know stuff haha-almost every day, there&#39;s someone here with a new idea who has a lot of material that causes me to read,listen and contemplate their post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going to war against people who are, militarily, equivalent to sand farmers is not “standing up for yourself”. It’s being globalist attack dogs. The United States has been pushed around by the UN, NATO, EU, China, Israel and our neighbors for nearly 2 decades allowing trade deficits, giving financial and military aid, fighting their wars and protecting their borders, for what? We’re not getting paid for it. Meanwhile we export jobs, and our economy atrophys and unemployment skyrockets. This is what I mean by “getting pushed around”. We’re not doing that anymore, literally Americans First. Like Trump said, not Americans Alone. </p>

<p>The fact that it’s working is either an indication that it’s really not all that hard to do and the last few presidents are either idiots or willfully draining the US’s power, or that Trump isn’t as much of an idiot as you think it is. I personally don’t care which, because I’m not stupid enough to think we’re going to go to war with France or Candada.</p>

<p>What is happening now is he is already elected. He was given permission to rule by consent, now he&#39;s doing whatever he and his buddies want to do. What are <em>you</em> going to do about it? That&#39;s right, nothing. You can vote for a different candidate next election, but what difference will that make? The only way to fix this is by rejecting the 2-party trap and voting independent. Get the fucking dems and repubs out of it completely and see how things improve for the people...</p>
