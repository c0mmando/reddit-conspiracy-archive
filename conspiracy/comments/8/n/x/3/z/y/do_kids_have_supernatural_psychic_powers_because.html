    <div class="md"><p>The range would be within whichever lottery you choose. Any admixture of adults and kids will do, as long as the number of psychics is equal to the amount of numbers to be chosen. With enough feedback, we would be able to collectively disprove any purer pineal gland psychic theories in short order, the shrimps.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, good question. I don&#39;t believe in psychic powers, but just thought it would be a good experiment to prove it, as that&#39;s what brought up the subject to begin with while having dinner. Mind you, they didn&#39;t pick all of the numbers. Anyway, some people clearly have better insight and intuition than others, but the question is wide open as to whether this is due to some biological advantage (like your age or DNA), or is it simply that pollution (eg, constant bombardment with noise and electromagnetic waves, chemicals in food and water and air, pharmaceuticals, social indoctrination) which corrupts and suppresses our some more supernatural programming? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ve heard stories of young children having memories from a previous life (reincarnation). But as they get older, the memories fade. Also, stories about young children seeing ghosts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never experienced this, I&#39;m just saying I&#39;ve heard stories. So maybe it is due to a purer pineal gland. </p>

<p>Idk about all of that and without going into too much detail and making myself look like a damn fool , I will say our personal intuitions can be honed and used in our everyday lives , </p>

<p>example I was thinking about an old acquaintance I hadn’t seen or thought about in years and out of the blue he contacted me within 5 to 10 minutes </p>

<p>Instinct and gut feelings   Listen to your gut feeling more trust your instincts </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure about the pineal gland, as I don&#39;t experience myself as glands, but as consciousness. If I think back, I was having a lot of interesting OOBEs when I was pre-school that stopped the more I had to engage other areas of my mind (education) and life became more complicated.</p>

<p>Later on in life when I got into meditation, visualization, yoga and dedicated myself to the arts for a living, and life became simpler that part of me started to open up again. OOBE&#39;s, past-life memories, experiences of lives actually being simultaneous (like the soul experiences all the lives at once, not in order), and being able to visualize things and events and have them come knocking on my door (figuratively, but sometimes literally) with no other effort than the visualizing.</p>

<p>Then life got very complicated and stressful again, and all that has seemed to shut down. Basically, my mind is tied up in day to day responsibilities that leave no time for my mind to breathe, drift, and get loose like it was before schooling, and during that time as an adult when life was simple and all about adventures in consciousness and creativity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Near the beginning of this life, I experienced   the feelings of it being a blessing not unlike haing a second chance. I recall feeling and understanding doing wisdom stored within me beyond the years of my life at the time. </p>

<p>I cant recall ever having vivid memories of my past life. But there were emotions and feeling-based or intuition based understandings of what felt like a bunch of stored emotional experiences from my past life. </p>

<p>Almost like a bunch of lessons and the knowledge of how, when, and where to apply them. Like my past life left behind a wealth of those experiences and lessons drawn from them for me in this life to start off with.</p>

<p>I remember feeling somehow that this great gift I was blessed with at the beginning of this life came at the expense of a less than noble previous life. The beginning of my life felt pre ordained to be better than I was previously and feel an absolute dedication to applying those lessons forward through this life. </p>

<p>Life makes it hard in a lot of ways to stay on a path of being and feeling like a good person. I still dont feel like I accomplished so far what I set out to do with this particular go round. My soul whispers to me though and allows me to feel some peace in that I&#39;m doing better this time than last.</p>

<p>TLDR:
I was born into this life with hardcoded wisdom, No memories of past life just residual feelings and morals.</p>
