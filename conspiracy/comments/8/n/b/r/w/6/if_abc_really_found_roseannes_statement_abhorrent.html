       Shouldn't values be somewhat consistent? If Paula Deen was straight-up dropping N-bombs on social media and only got two years, does that mean Roseanne can expect to be on Hulu in like a year or how does that work?

       People wouldn't have cared as much if she didn't have a current show. And she only has a show because ABC wanted to cash in on some of her BS. They were aware of Deen's incident before and cast her anyway. Shouldn't we eventually get smart and criticize the kingmakers' actions instead of exclusively the idiot kings?

       In 2 years if Roseanne can keep from saying racist crap she’ll be back on tv as well. Comparing a recent happening to one with 2 years of space in it is not a fair comparison.

       I'm saying ABC has fickle values that stretch and retract with profitability. We should hold them just as accountable for putting her there in the first place. Shouldn't you punish a parent that hands a toddler a pistol? Does it make it any better at all that their filming and planning to put it on youtube?

       It’s not just ABC. All business entities have had and will have “fickle values that stretch and retract with profitability” That’s capitalism. To single out ABC for that is quite misinformed.

       Roseanne probably will be fine in 2 years. I wouldn't even be surprised if she ended up on dancing with the stars 2. I bet tiger woods could too. Nobody even gives a shot about Chris Brown anymore. But when a celebrity fucks up publically, the companies who prop them up are gonna drop them. It's a PR move and ABC didnt have a choice here.

       Really? Jesus. The only thing worse that comes to mind (but having lower inherent standards because they're not a broadcast network) is the NRA hiring Oliver North. Straight up treason. Should have rotted in a prison the rest of his life. No, let's make him our spokesperson. All the evils that are preached about guns and drugs and terrorists and this motherfucker was dick-deep in all three. He must have had dirt on some serious people locked away very safely.

       Did social media even exist when Paula Dean allegedly dropped an n bomb?  Iirc Paula got heat for throwing a party with a southern plantation theme and then former employees came forward and claimed she used the n word in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paula Dean got railroaded and I was glad she got a chance to attempt to rehabilitate her public persona but judging by how people including the OP is willing to accuse Paula of going on Twitter and being a raging racist she will never make a comeback.  It's sad how the racist tag once applied can affect your life forever.  She went from having one of the most popular cooking shows to doing a web series.

       The detailed section at the bottom doesn't mention anything about social media. I also never said Twitter - read it again. I was assuming from that quote that it was semi-private FB posts or something. I've seen people get casual on those. Please also quote for me the part where I said "raging racist". It's like everyone's playing a game of telephone between their eyes (or ears) and their brain where all kinds of exaggerations are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read her deposition. She tries to dance and brings up this ridiculous story about using it in reference to a black bank robber. But then she admits to using it at other times but is very vague about it and won't really give specifics. Is she a hardcore racist? Like a died in the wool Hulk Hogan, thought it out and genuinely believe in lesser races racist? I really don't think so. I just think it would catch up to you eventually.

       Didn't you right this sentence?  You are using IF to build a conditional statement to compare past to Future.  Comrade if your goal is express a hypothetical past compared to a possible future  you have to say WHAT IF.

       In communication their is a burden on the speaker to convey their ideas.  If you are misunderstood because you assumed the reader would infer the hypothetical nature of your statement when you didn't express the statement was hypothetical in the first place then that is your mistake.

       I believe Roseanne knew exactly that the outcome of those tweets would be. ABC has hinted that next season wouldn't be as political and she wasn't having any of it. Knowing that broadcast tv and cable are on the down slide for years, she would be able to start something else on a streaming platform and be able to have full creative freedom without filling Disney's pockets anymore.

       I worried about that appearance before posting, but as this is related to a person with a lot of visibility who says a lot of conspiracy-minded things, I thought it was important. What she says and does reflects on us since similar things are said here. It's the unfortunate and shitty way guilt by association works. Through a prejudicial process not dissimilar from racism.

       Corporations censoring one racist while corporations usually more extreme racists is absolutely a good topic for this community. There's a hypocrisy there and I think it's entirely appropriate to discuss their secret motives that cause them to treat racists differently depending on other political factors.

       So, she hasn't been charged or arrested, but it's perfectly OK for her and her team and employees to lose their jobs and their livelihoods just because ABC execs decided to fire her and her whole team based on an innocuous tweet that is protected under the First Amendment of th US Constitution?  Bullshit.

       Paula Deen admitted that she was old and raised in a racist environment under Jim Crow while lamenting that era in court. She didn’t stand up for the past or make excuses. Meanwhile, Roseanne made a contemptible racist comment a few days ago. Those are completely different things.

       Corporations usually ignore or reward racism. Especially the "lighter" kinds, especially if it doesn't involve cursing or direct violence. Them shutting down a popular show isn't really about the offensive tweet. There's more to it without a doubt. They're leaving money on the table to censor her, corporations don't do that unless they think it's worth the cost.

       Really? Jesus. The only thing worse that comes to mind (but having lower inherent standards because they're not a broadcast network) is the NRA hiring Oliver North. Straight up treason. Should have rotted in a prison the rest of his life. No, let's make him our spokesperson. All the evils that are preached about guns and drugs and terrorists and this motherfucker was dick-deep in all three. He must have had dirt on some serious people locked away very safely.
