       I think its much more likely that commercial flights into "space" will never be a thing. And if they are, any curvature observed will be the result of curved windows that distort the perspective of the viewer.

       I'm saying that if commercial "space" flights were going to be the norm, it would have happened long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the earth is not a globe and commercial flights at those altitudes would raise too many questions and doubts in the general public for TPTB to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now people in commercial flights swear they see curvature while on a plane, but again, it is just the curvature of the fuselage and its windows that distort the perspective of the viewer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that they could rig up some universal studios type of simulation, but I think too many people would be able to see through it tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is now, TPTB are able to maintain their deception over the masses for the simple fact that the masses don't have easily available access to those altitudes, and for the most part, rely on what TPTB give them for information/science on the subject. I doubt very much that TPTB will give that power up. They might pretend to be working towards it, but something will stop their "progression" towards their "goal".

       I admit that "flat" isn't a perfect description. But "flat" is a far more accurate description of the earth than "spherical" or "globe".

       To be short. Atmospheric conditions, physical obstructions, change in elevation from point A to B, and limitations on the tools that are used to enhance visual range. And I really don't understand the value of that question, as the shape of the earth does not dictate the capabilities of such a tool. No telescope, camera, binoculars, or eye etc etc, has an "unlimited" visual range.

       I am not convinced by this space money argument. In the USA, the NASA budget is around 0.5% of governement spending per year. Surely they could come up with a simpler scheme to squirrel away such a relatively tiny amount? e.g. one that doesn't involve a global conspiracy with extremely serious consequences. Additionally, what was the motivation for the conspiracy prior to space exploration?

       The reason I ask is that I have personally seen France from a top the white cliffs of Dover in the UK. I did this with my naked eyes and with binoculars, so I know for certain that I can at least see things 20 miles into the distance. From the beach, on the same day with the same weather conditions however, France is not visible with the naked eye or with binoculars. Why would a change in elevation of 110m over a flat earth, reduce my visibility of a whole coastline to zero? What causes this binary between visible and not visible? Why isn't the coastline just fainter or smaller, and why does using binoculars make no difference to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a separate point, that I hope you will indulge me with, is there any evidence to suggest that the earth is definitely flat as opposed to being a cuboid, a pyramid or any other polyhedron?

       If you call ~73 billion dollars over the course of ~60 years ( and that is just reported NASA spending AND those numbers don't account for inflation) a relatively tiny amount, I'm uneasy to think what you would consider a large amount.

       As for the motivation prior to space exploration, I believe it has been a multi generational long con. People have been exploring the stars for generations before flight. And if you dig into this more you will see an overabundance of secret societies in our current space program, as well as in early days of star gazing.

       Personally I think the primary motivation is to draw men away from God and His Word. To manipulate the truth to help "lead the sheep astray" so to speak. Imagine the world view of people changing if tomorrow it was announced that the earth was in fact flat, there was a dome like structure surrounding us and everyone was going to get a free ride to witness it for themselves. You can throw out all these false doctrines like evolution and atheism, because surly an environment like that would have had to been created, and the idea of God creating man in His image might just be a bit more palatable to non believers. In short, the Globe earth lie is the linchpin that ties TPTB entire control system together. Without it, they would not be able to convince the masses that God does not exist. They would be unable to keep mans faith in their false doctrines, nor would they be able to focus mans worship on themselves.

        The reason I ask is that I have personally seen France from a top the white cliffs of Dover in the UK. I did this with my naked eyes and with binoculars, so I know for certain that I can at least see things 20 miles into the distance. From the beach, on the same day with the same weather conditions however, France is not visible with the naked eye or with binoculars. Why would a change in elevation of 110m over a flat earth, reduce my visibility of a whole coastline to zero? What causes this binary between visible and not visible? Why isn't the coastline just fainter or smaller, and why does using binoculars make no difference to this?
       </p>

      <p>
       Increasing ones elevation is going to give them a wider field of view. And The closer you are to sea level, the denser the atmosphere will be. I can't tell you exactly why you saw what you saw on that day because I don't have enough information , but I can tell you that at higher elevations you can see further distances than at sea level because you have a "birds eye view". But if the earth was in fact a globe, the higher you got from its surface the more you would be able to see the curve, to the point where building and mountains noticeably curve with the terrain. This does not happen. Earths horizon stays at the eye level of the observer no matter how high they go. That fact alone suggests that the world is a plane as opposed to a globe and possibly that it is infinite.

        As a separate point, that I hope you will indulge me with, is there any evidence to suggest that the earth is definitely flat as opposed to being a cuboid, a pyramid or any other polyhedron?

       Not that I am aware of. But honestly, I would have an easier time believing that he earth was a huge cube shape object which we inhabit one side of, easier than i can imagine that we live on a spinning ball.

       Ever been to Disney World? There is a ride called Soarin' where they seat you in this row of chairs in front of an imax sized video screen. The row of chairs is lifted up into the air while the video shows footage from a plane flying fast over various things. It really feels for the most part like you are flying and seeing those things. They even blow gusts of air on you and move the row of chairs this way and that to simulate banking turns.
      </p>

       Point is, that technology is already pretty much mundane.

       No, it doesn't "feel like you are flying". Whatever else may or may not be true, that ride is NOT anything close to the "technology" that would be required to fake a trip to outer space. That ride is exactly what it appears to be--a ride over an IMAX screen.

       This is so true.  Joe Rogan went gay for this on one episode, the one on California adventure..and I was sitting there thinking ... The fuck?? It's a sub par ride that seems like a cheap state Fair gimmick.. like the Alie. Space ship that spins you to the wall.

       It will be a while before commercial space flights are cheap and practical, so we have quite a while to wait before the average person can take such a flight regularly. And if you're rich, then you must be in on the conspiracy.

       Which brings be to my second point: you're assuming that the flat earth debate is based in any kind of rational thought. It's not. Some people need to believe the earth is flat. They get something else from it, not just trying to explain what they see around them. Some people have spiritual reasons for thinking it's flat (some Bible, or Koran quotes), others need to feel special for having been able to "see the truth while all the other sheep were still asleep" or some other nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, until and unless you can address that fundamental, non-rational need, you'll never be able to convince a flat earth proponent that the earth is round. They have to believe the earth is flat or else this god is wrong or they're not special or whatever else they get from it.

       Not all skeptics of mainstream cosmology are incapable of critical thinking. Many of us are able to entertain alternative conclusions based on what appears to be misinterpretations of flawed evidence relating to various components within the fields of astrophysics, quantum and relativistic mechanics, especially  the magnetodielectric field.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of disinformation which intends to discredit these free thinkers as consoiritards, but mountains if anomalies and contradicting evidence, introducing imaginary forces and matter which cannot be observed just to make their antiquated models comply with the measurements, and a fundamental misunderstanding of the universal forms responsible for all plasma phenomenon, which can be tested in macro in a laboratory setting, and known to scale overnmanyvorders of magnitude, lead us to a cult of academics who refuse to renounce their work and that of their predecessors, on the grounds that we have much more information available now to start over and develop a model which is accurate and simple in its mechanism, as opposed to the cult of bumping particles which impedes our true understanding of cosmic mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plasma cosmology, electric universe, and proper explainations of what magnetism is (do you know that no popular scientific resource has ever defined what a field is, nor what magnetism is?). Light is not a wave, or a particle. It is unmanifest. It is a coaxial dielectric pulse purtubation in a medium (light is not a particle, and to suggest it is is an absurdity, similarly so, the electron). What we call magnetic attraction is simply dielectric acceleration, and magnetic repulsion is more accurately the only mode of magnetism, as it is responsible for giving volume (space) to all matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how pop scientists commonly claim that atoms are 99.9999% empty space? This is ludicrous. Surrounding the nucleus is magnetism, which produces it's volume. There is no empty space. Similarly, gravity is not a unique field variant, it is simply decoherent dielectric inertia and acceleration. If a magnet is a coherent point source, commensurable field pertubation, with high energy potential to void the magnetic space between other magnetic objects, then gravity is incoherent form of the same. It behaves ide focally except for its energy potential. like the difference between a laser, and a low energy light bulb.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find more about this by searching for Ken Wheeler, or Theoria Apophasis, who literally wrote the book on magnetism. He has plenty of instructional and educational videos explaining cosmic mechanics in terms of a unified field, with several modalities expressed in that field (an aether of sorts, which totally rejects classical and quantum bumping particle nonsense)
      </p>
      <p>
       thunderbolts.info
Plasma-universe.com
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more resources available for this often disregarded area of study, which simply accounts for the influence of magnetism and electricity on huge cosmic scales, as mainstream astrology fails to consider the obvious effect of a field modality stronger by many orders of magnitude than gravity alone. The predictions solve galactic rotation by doing away with dark matter, it brings into question the illogical big bang hypothesis, and continually makes accurate predictions which the mainstream academics are left confused and unprepared with each mysterious discovery they announce.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for flat earth, I can't prove either way definitively the shape of the earth, but do not have strong opinions either way. It is useless to shut off a route of investigation simply because your peers have ridiculed an idea. All the claims may be incorrect, facetious, or downright dumb. But attacking these guys who really arenseeking the truth is not productive, and they do have many novel ideas which may not be considered if one assumes that all historic scientific investigation is settled, with no room for revision, as is the case in most academic settings, where any claims contrary to historical concensus (which was formed when we did not have access to such a vast amount of information as we do now), risk ostracism and inevitibly professional ruin.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must all not fear that long held beliefs which we may never even consider to be fallible, were produced decades ago using basic instruments to form conclusions which may be refined or even discarded in favour of new evidence. Scientific literature is constantly evolving, and has generally been withheld for only those specified in their areas of knowledge, possibly incapable of integrating experience and knowledge from other fields to really form a more accurate model of our universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peer review is evil, as it is the main gate keeper, and academic specialisation hinders broad conceptualising of complex system, let alone discussion of such as anybody daring to question the accuracy of older works are ridiculed. All their jobs rely on continued funding for their "standard models after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of developing our physical models by considering their true constituents (ultimately, a field with only 4 primary features, impedence, capacitance, permiability, permittivity) and instead of a zoo of unicorn particles we understood that all plasma phenomenon in the cosmos are simply a fractally scalar magnetodielectric field in which waves of varying frequency and amplitude propagate according to plasma dynamics and pressure mediation. Giving rise to ALL phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space has no properties, it cannot bend and warp under the influence of mass. This is absurd, and Einstein reified a privation. (That of magnetism). So he could port creationism to the scientific domain and dress it as science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly light is not a particle. Nor is it any physical thing at all. A wave is a propagation through a medium. Thus light must be travelling through an aether of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on. Please reply if you are interested or confused. I understand if you find it difficult to just discard all your prior understanding, but honestly many of these novel concepts are much more sane, in that they do not rely on mathematical simulations and frivolous axioms to develop a solid, predictive, and bulletproof model. There is still work to be done, but I urge you to read the supporting material for a greater understanding. Thunderbolts have a fantastic YouTube channel where they publish their yearly lectures, and Ken wheeler is honestly the smartest guy I have ever seen. You would do well to learn from these guys, if at all interested to know how the celebrated pioneers of electrodynamics and hardcore monistic cosmology .

       I'm happy to concede that there may be issues with the current descriptions and interpretations of science, and I'm equally happy to admit that we should expect current scientific ideas to change as time goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, flat earth arguments are riddled with simple errors and gross misrepresentations of the arguments they are trying to refute. This dishonest argument is what I take issue with, and it is a hallmark of an irrational mode of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguments like "people on the bottom of a globe should fall off" and "airplanes should fly off into space" are so grossly misrepresenting the opposing side that it's laughable. It shows a level of ignorance that is inexcusable. I'd be fine with people asking questions, or wanting clarification, but all too often I see the argument as "I don't understand it, therefore it must be wrong".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, acting as a perfect counter point, we can look at your post. Whether or not I agree with what you've proposed, you have some understanding of what you're arguing against, and can clearly articulate where your ideas and the opposing ideas differ. You can present tests that can be done to see which model would be better, and can cite places where some of these tests have been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earth proponents rarely, if ever, come close to the thoroughness, articulate nature or respect for disagreement that you've show in your post. There is a BIG difference between people seeking truth and people feeding delusion, and I think your reply is the best example I could hope for to illustrate it.

       Awe each have a varying capacity to learn and understand the mainstream concensus, to carry out our own research, to critically evaluate evidence and conclusions, and to integrate new knowledge to build up our own personal models of cosmic mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generalising all flat earth earthers as simply incapable is petty and not conducive to education or wisdom. We all must begin somewhere, and although many researchers (in bot popular scientific concencus and fringe theoretical) can be gullable or simply rebellious without truly understanding the systems they are criticising, there are many who are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth culture teaches skepticism, and those who can utilise that as a tool to refine their own knowledge, without using blind faith in often maliciously false information can succumb themcto greater ignorance. It is not productive to ridicule these people as they certainly have an interest in truth seeking, and simply need guidance to achieve valuable wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that popular cosmology is flawed in many ways. We use quantum and relativistic systems to make simulations and predictions, and their accuracy in that regard does not in any way translate to their physical validity. Descriptions are not explainations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, mainstream academics do not know beyond approximations how the cosmos functions. And by disregarding what are considered to be fringe concepts, to save from embarrassment, is inhibiting our research. Particle physics is only useful at certain scales as an approximation, and ideas like wave particle duality, dark matter, photons, electrons, universal expansion, are artefacts of critical fundamental flaws in our models.

       Waves are not tangible. They refer to a propagation of energy through a medium, a wave pertubation. Since light is not a force carrying particle, the only logical conclusion is that light energy travels in coaxial transverse pulses through an aetheric medium. It has no speed, only a rate of induction as determined by the properties of the material it is being conducted

       Ken is the only person ever to have comprehensively explained how and what a magnetic object is. Including the metaphysical (fields are not physical) mechanics of field pressure mediation by which they manifest materially. Magnetism gives vine to matter, and what we refer to as magnetic attraction is simply dielectric acceleration, again due to pressure mediation the space between the magnetised objects is cancelled out.

       The EU guys look at the cosmological side of things. Using plasma physics to model a universe where electrical interactions in the galactic, and solar systems are responsible for its structure and organisation. There is so much important information available on their YouTube videos, especially in their conference series'. Well worth exploring for an electrical engineers perspective of astrophysics, as most astrophysicits erroneously disregard the effect of charge gradients in space, attribution it all to gravity, which in reality is only incoherent dielectric acceleration (think laser Vs light bulb)

       They say "generates the same energy densities as the sunâ€™s photosphere and nuclear bombs" but the photosphere, at 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure isn't exactly that dense.  As to their comparison to nuclear bombs, well I would like to see how they came up with that.

Why does weight change with latitude
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you know why they measure gold by mass and not weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       mass is constant, weight is due to gravitational force which can change negligibly with altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       The centrifugal force at the equator is making it weigh less there where it is spinning the fastest and weigh more at the poles where it is spinning slower.

       That guy showed how flawed the experiment was within the first 3 mins of the video. Dude literally puts the same item on the same scale which never changed locations and got multiple results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that variations in air pressure, imperfect/faulty tools (the scale), deception, or all of the above are a far better explanation of the changes in weight supposedly caused by the centrifugal force of the supposed spin of the supposed globe earth.

       My favorite proof is just gravity alone. Object the size of the earth are forced into a round shape cause gravity at all sides is pushing on it.  So once objects in space get past a certain size they literraly round themselves out. It's really fascinating.

       Flat earth is about time loops. I believe America has been looped this whole time with save points. Think about a pepperoni pizza. That's the loop and smaller loops that represent pockets saved in time. If they are quarantining the whole earth right now with time pockets and loops technically ibis 2d or flat because its being digitized on an atomic level.

       Ever been to Disney World? There is a ride called Soarin' where they seat you in this row of chairs in front of an imax sized video screen. The row of chairs is lifted up into the air while the video shows footage from a plane flying fast over various things. It really feels for the most part like you are flying and seeing those things. They even blow gusts of air on you and move the row of chairs this way and that to simulate banking turns.
