        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p> 
There has been a very visible and sizeable push to pigeon hole skeptics into literal cults. </p>

<p>The most obvious modern example of these is the LARP/PSYOP known as &quot;Q Anon&quot;. If you are out of the loop on who/what Q is, I suggest finding a primer elsewhere, I&#39;m just here to talj about the &quot;Qult&quot; surrounding him.</p>

<p>These following bullet points are common characteristics shared between all cults: (I found these on: <a href="http://www.csj.org/infoserv_cult101/checklis.htm">http://www.csj.org/infoserv_cult101/checklis.htm</a></p>

<p>Any edits/comments I have made will be in [brackets] since they used (parenthesis) in some.</p>

<p>-The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.</p>

<p>‪ -Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished. [Downvotes/Bans]</p>

<p>‪ -Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, and debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s). [The &quot;study sessions&quot; the members have where they have to look at long infographics with lots of data and study each group, person, and event or else you aren&#39;t &quot;a real follower&quot;.]</p>

<p>‪ -The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example, members must get permission to date, change jobs, marryï¿½or leaders prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, whether or not to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth). [I&#39;ve seen many a thread where users ask how to think or see events. There&#39;s even a hierarchy on who is more right/can be trusted with interpretations]</p>

<p>‪ -The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members (for example, the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar or the group and/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity). [the Qult claims they are saving the world from a pedo mafia that somehow ends up being everyone but them]</p>

<p>‪ -The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society. [The high usage of the term normie on their subs should be very telling]</p>

<p>‪ -The leader is not accountable to any authorities (unlike, for example, teachers, military commanders or ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream religious denominations). [Trump is GOD EMPEROR! He is accountable to no one but God and Q is in the same boat]</p>

<p>‪ -The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members&#39; participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group (for example, lying to family or friends, or collecting money for bogus charities). [I give them credit for this one as they don&#39;t seem to be doing any of these things yet]</p>

<p>‪ -The leadership induces feelings of shame and/or guilt iin order to influence and/or control members. Often, this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion. [&quot;Real&quot; believers never question Q. The higher ups run alts to shame others into a deep devotion or accuse them of not really believing.]</p>

<p>‪ -Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group. [I&#39;ve seen too many posts about members losing relationships with their familily/friends because they try to get them to join the cult.]</p>

<p>-The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members. [&quot;Redpilling&quot; is really trying to lure gullible folks into joining them]</p>

<p>‪ -The group is preoccupied with making money. [Live streams, Amazon merch, pushong certain cryptos, there are many ways these folks are raising money for the cause.]</p>

<p>‪ -Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities. [They are on a Mormom-esque level of having to recruiters go out and preach their gospel]</p>

<p>‪ -Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members. [This is why they use codespeak like normie and woke to be able to distinguish themselves from others and discouraging interactions with those they claim aren&#39;t worthy]</p>

<p>‪ -The most loyal members (the &quot;true believers&quot;) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave (or even consider leaving) the group. [Some of their harcore base spends so much time posting and propaganda posting all damn day]</p>

<p>Please be aware that &quot;Q&quot; hits all of these points and targets those cults target. The elderly, gullible, easily persuaded, emotionally unstable, submissive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is a hyper Christian and that verse is a popular one. Its barely even a coincidence that Pence would reference the same verse months later. </p>

<p>There was no deal made with North Korea. Trump hasn&#39;t met with Kim yet. Even though Q pretends they already hashed out a deal. </p>

<p>Q talks about military planes and shit like that all the time. Also no a coincidence. </p>

<p>Gmail comms can mean anything. Oh somebody sent an email and that&#39;s proof Q knew about it? Uhh cool. </p>

<p>Protests started in Armenia in March. Q just mentioned the country. He didnt predict anything. All he does is throw out references to current events and if anything happens, you think he predicted it. If nothing happens, you forget he ever said it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how this stuff works. Q has referenced hundreds of people places and things over the course of 1300 comments. So if anything happens, you can basically tie it back to say &quot;hey Q talked about this 2 months ago! He knew all allong.&quot;</p>

<p>Mueller pushed back sentencing on Flynn because he wants to get more out of him. If Mueller was rescinding the indictment then he would. He wouldn&#39;t just give him more time. </p>

<p>Look dad, one day will you figure out you&#39;ve been had. One day Trump will leave office and the evil cabal will still be there. At some point Mueller will wrap up his investigation and you&#39;ll see they were not working together. I&#39;ll bet you 50,000 dollars that neither Obama or Hillary will be in jail by the time Trump leaves office. Wanna take me up on that?</p>

<p>The tippy top thing wasnt anything either. 2 months before Trump said tippy top (a phrase hes used many times in the past) an anon asked him to get Trump to say it. 2 months later Q is like &quot;yo sid you catch the speech today.&quot; That&#39;s not even a coincidence. I could predict what Trump is going to say with a time table of two months. He uses the same phrases over and over. </p>

<p>CBTS_Stream has always been a honeypot for fags and the place was overran by shills and bad actors while the place was left unmodded leading to a bunch of cucks doxxing people, remember that?</p>

I’m not going to even go into the other claims you make, because hardly any of them apply to what Q is doing.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing that Facebook isn&#39;t complete shit but there&#39;s a huge difference between <em>choosing</em> not to participate in it and <em>a country banning it for a month</em> under the guise of closing fake accounts.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t wanna use it, fine. But to sit there and say Papua New Guinea&#39;s government is good for banning it for a month (i.e. you couldn&#39;t even access it if you wanted to) is ludicrous.</p>

<p>How do you fell when Iran bans any social media during protest? Different scenarios, but same concept. If you support censorship on any left you&#39;re not better than the Antifa fucks who are running rampant today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This Q,(Yes, upper case), Q is the equivalent of the number eight.</p>

<p>Number eight represents new beginning, anti-christ. In numerology, 8 is the number of building, and in some theories, also the number of destruction.</p>

<p>Very fitting, simbology and anagrams are what rule our reality.</p>

<p>This Qteam (do you see it yet?) and Trump &quot;cleansing&quot; is very real, those who didn&#39;t got aboard of the change are getting swiped and there is more involved here than it seems, it has to do with very important people going to Antarctica around the last American elections, the thing is that it is not (as always) towards the betterment and empowerment of humanity, but to further enslave us, it is the old boogeyman trick to &quot;unite&quot; fronts, those in that sub are nothing more than religious fanatics, and most likely not real people or at least not people with a familiy a job and a life.</p>

<p>While we are distracted with Trump, the BRICS are doing their moves, very slowly and carefully, pay attention.</p>

He he has posted that daily prayers are said to JFK, not God, daily.  Called trump and the military our savior. Please check these facts. The there is a guy on YouTube with the na.me SebAsTiAN C, whose capital letters spell SATAN C, makes these satanic trump Q videos, scary shit.  His first video was made at the Oct 28, 2017 right when Q started posting.  He purposely made a fake name for the video so it wouldn&#39;t be picked up on, then changed it July of this year cause YouTube let&#39;s you change the title, but the time can not be changed.  So it was changed to 29 trumped trouble in Washington Q CLEARANCE INITIATED.  it&#39;s freaking creepy portraying trump like Jesus stepping on the serpent, with a satanic voice and a picture of trump saying &quot;DO YOU BELIEVE IN ME NOW&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>You people are shills or just plain ignorant with no real brain power all Q does is ask questions you look for the answers u may not like the answers you find but the TRUTH is just that the truth your leftwing philosophy is terrible to human kind censorship and violence is used by the left instead of honest debate I been following Q since Oct 2017 and everything he has posted has been proven to be the truth it doesn&#39;t take a Einstein to see that the MSM is lying to you on a daily basis and not reporting the truth they are selling a narrative that just because it&#39;s what you WANT to hear DOES not make it the truth. When they start arresting your SO CALLED HEROES you will be left with a choice awaken yo REALITY or take to the streets and riot and whine cry like you all have been doing since the election  that was rigged by MSM DNC Obama administration everyday more and more comes out THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING BEWTEEN RUSSIA AND TRUMP after 19 months of there was something one of the sniveling subhuman Democrats would have leaked it like they leak everything if it steers the narrative their way.
The only purpose of Q is to prepare the people to understand what is about to happen believe it or not it will happen and what the evil people that have sold out the country want is for you leftist to take to the streets and start a civil war to keep their corruption from being exposed and most of you will blindly follow without even asking the simplest of questions WHY? you wont win and you cant stop it we are go9ng thru a soft military coup to save our democracy from EVIL and corruption your movement has been hijacked by EVIL PEOPLE using YOU to do their bidding without YOU knowing their plan 
Open a pacer.gov account and see the 50k indictments that Huber has across the country they are not about Trump and collusion they are about Human trafficking pure evil with your heroes at the top running the show CLintobs Obama Clinton foundation even the Bush&#39;s new world new order all the same SOLD OUT TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER which is China Russia . Who in their right mind would give URANIUM to what the Democrats call OUR BIGGEST ENEMY Russia to make missile out of it to point at us ??? Who would China for years to steal our technology ??
Another great example Trump is not doing anything look at his policies for 19 months all he has DONE is UNDO what Obama did and the economy is booming so ask yourself WHY did Obama and democrats/Republicans do what they did for 8 years the only logical answer is their either stupid or they did it on purpose to destroy USA our home both sides left and right the future home of our children enslaved by communism and socialism gutted from the inside out without firing a shot. No one can in all honesty say that the Clinton foundation was nothing but a bribing mailbox and if u people are so blinded by the media programming to think for yourselfs you are going to be in for  HUGE AWAKENING </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t wanna use it, fine. But to sit there and say Papua New Guinea&#39;s government is good for banning it for a month (i.e. you couldn&#39;t even access it if you wanted to) is ludicrous.</p>

<p>How do you fell when Iran bans any social media during protest? Different scenarios, but same concept. If you support censorship on any left you&#39;re not better than the Antifa fucks who are running rampant today.</p>
