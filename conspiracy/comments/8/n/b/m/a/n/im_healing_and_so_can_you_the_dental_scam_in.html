       Modern Dentistry is a scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, it is almost a needed service, how ever, the products used are completly harmful to the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good to get regular dental cleanings (every 3 months) but in all honesty if you follow a few simple tricks below your mouth and gums will start healing (i promise)
      </p>
      <p>
       now because of the medical cartel in america, this kind of natural information is naturally suppressed by these money hungry power hungry corporations that only care about squeezing money off us from insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me first start by saying
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL DENTAL FILLINGS FOR CAVITIES ARE TOXIC
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the caps (plastic which is then "sealed") silver amalgram (metals mixed together in a slurry including mercury)
      </p>
      <p>
       the only true metals that wont hurt you are silver and gold (its a reason why they are precious)
      </p>
      <p>
       no one has $2,000 per tooth for a pure gold filling however.
      </p>
      <p>
       so lets talk natural remedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       first off, ditch the older electric sonicare tooth brushes, they harbor mold like a mofo (unless you regulary take it apart and clean it)
      </p>
      <p>
       let me explain some basics to you
      </p>
      <p>
       bacteria exists. both good and bad. your mouth has many types of bacteria within it (tons, because its your mouth)
      </p>
      <p>
       when you eat a starchy, sugary, toxic diet, you will be fueling these bad bacteria that thrive on an acidic and unbalanced PH mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       heres what you can do
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         extra virgin coconut oil for mouth oil pulls. this draws the bacteria out of your gums and also dissolves the plaque at your gum line so you can break through the bio film of the bactera colonies within your gums
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         alkalize your mouth!! pay the damn money and get a good small bottle of alkalizing mouth wash . this will allow your mouth to reach a natural PH balance. I use Uncle harrys natural products, its called miracle mouth wash and even has silver in it. you can swallow remnants no problem and it doesnt have the neuro toxin of fluoride. this stuff will burn your mouth but its the good burn of alkaizing an acidic mouth thus bringing healing potential
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         activated charcoal tooth paste. we dont need to brush twice a day but it helps. i use activated charcoal tooth paste which allows it to cut through the plaque. you wanna go in small circles all across the bottom of your teeth while hitting/massaging the gums
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         massaging the gums with your tooth brush allows the gums to release and let surface the toxins within the gum line.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         floss. this is a no brainer but helps prevent plaque build up (which should not really be an issue anyway if you use the virgin coconut oil to do mouth pulls)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       most of this stuff can be bought online! uncleharrys.com has good stuff too. Also, avoid fluoride, avoid that stuff like the plague.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will bio-accumulate within the pineal gland and calicify your natural connection to divine source itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly. Quit eating bull shit toxic foods. Most of the US food supply is loaded with bull shit. Less ingredeints the better. Avoid artifical colors, flavors, weird sounding chemical names, K.I.S.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will notice your mouth start to heal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what guys. I was told my gum receeding was "probably genetic"
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess who has new healthy gum tissue growing back on my lower teeth and my mouth feels far better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't listen to fear and baseless advice rooted in fear just because a medical cartel is too busy sucking you of money. Take your power. Own your power. And heal your body on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need to put ourselves into debt just to heal or get costly procedures. Our immune system works so well and we act like we always need outside help when we are our own saviours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unplug from the criminal medical cartel and take your health into your own hands!!!
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Look into Natural Iosol Iodine
       </li>
       <li>
        Look into castor oil
       </li>
       <li>
        Look into collodial silver
       </li>
       <li>
        Homeopathic medicines works (little spendy but worth it!)
       </li>
       <li>
        the more natural the better. Mother Gaia provides us with every healing remedy we need
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I can provide additional tips if you need it. List your medical concerns and lets heal each other naturally and easy using 10$-100$ supplies instead of thousands in medical debt just to "target symptoms"
      </p>
      <p>
       Target the root cause and YOU WILL HEAL
      </p>
      <p>
       We are divine powerful temples of light housing a consciousness of divine source. Tap into your healing and release the toxins and invaders within your body. This is your right. Take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much love and light to all of you
      </p>
      <p>

       Couldn't agree more. Also get chewable oral probiotics. Probiotics with beneficial mouth bacteria. Chew one after brushing your teeth so beneficial bacteria can grow back. It will help with sinus and throat issues as well.

       Also Sea salt rinses and brushing with sea salt water does wonders to teeth and gums. All my issues went away and its been almost 2 years and the dentist said I'm good and dont need cleanings (at the very least I found an honest dentist who is also pro DIY alternative options)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are scam dentists out there who will lie and do shit to you that you dont need just to get the money
      </p>
      <p>
       I use pink himalayan salt but other celtic and Utah Redmond salt are also excellent options.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do is mix in the sea salt, activated charcoal, and I have some mineral drops (liquid bottle of essential minerals) I throw into a jar mixed with coconut oil, spearmint oil, and a bit of baking soda for the alkalinity and wash twice a day

       I get these. By far the best rated oral probiotic on amazon and there regular probiotics are good too. It's the only kind I've tried so there could be better or cheaper ones out there too.

       Would you be so kind and provide a source demonstrating that the metals used for tooth fillings are toxic, at the dosage used for tooth fillings?

       Also, your personal anecdote is a strong confirmation bias for your beliefs. It doesn't mean that confirmation bias == false premise, but i would use that anecdote as a justification to seek evidence, not as evidence itself, if i were you. But i suppose you already
       <em>
        did

       your homework and found a respectable study supporting your claims?

       Of course you may and i will politely answer. My problem with your findings is their lack of source, and your unwillingness to go further than "google it" to provide me with a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that i am a skeptic, however, so if you seek to convince non-skeptics to trust your findings, you should stop wasting time with me, as i have stated to be a skeptic.

       Yet again, you are on a conspiracy subreddit, which probably hoards a good distribution of skeptics, so you may not be at the good place to preach to

       My goal right now is to heal this subreddit full of people who make sourceless claims, and to learn how to do it with all due respect to the people who may not yet realise that backing up one's claim is one of the core principles of demystifying conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, teach me how i can convince you to provide me with a source for your initial claim. We both know it's as easy as 2 clicks, and i believe we both work for the same cause, which is to break the conspiracy paradigm and unleash the truth.

       I'm on both sides of this argument because I try to find balance between ideas like the body being able to heal itself and finding documentable evidence for claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem we have now is when people rely too heavily on "scientific" studies that are either untrue, funded by corporations with a specific agenda, or are only there to confirm/deny an existing idea with little to no basis in fact or reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to say is,
       <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/editor-in-chief-of-worlds-best-known-medical-journal-half-of-all-the-literature-is-false/5451305">
        a huge number of peer-reviewed journals
       </a>
       are flat out false. These are coming from the world's top credible schools/journals and yet people look towards them as gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a
       <strong>
        <em>
         huge
        </em>
       </strong>
       global problem of looking towards "science" as gospel (almost no different than religious folk look towards their respective authority). We're now living in a global society dominated by "scientism" and it's causing more harm then good because now you have so many individuals who cry, "where's the proof?!" and seek out documented evidence of their position.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a dangerous, slippery slope we're on and it needs to be corrected. So in the meantime, it's honestly best to do your own research, conduct your own experiments if possible, and check out as many sources for claims as possible; regardless of where that information is obtained - be it a random conspiracy website or scientific journal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please understand that I'm not discrediting the
       <em>
        scientific method
       </em>
       at all. It's still valid, alive, and well. What I'm questioning is taking scientific institutions and their claim of authority over science as fact/gospel and not seeking out any alternatives.

       We are both on the same page. There is a clear distinction between "X may be a fact" and "X
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a fact". If you make a claim, have the decency to back it, otherwise literally just reformulate your claim as to not imply it is absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there are always two sides of the same medal; those who blindly believe any source, as long as it is written by someone with a piece of paper proving they have
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       knowledge, not necessarily in the subject of their paper (this is what we both define as "scientism") and those who fall into the trap of believing any source is bad, and who fully support preachers who have no source, simply
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       they have no source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these subgroups have the problem of not using critical thinking, which is a learnable skill, not some kind of "intelligence treshold".

       May I ask, is being a skeptic a bad thing? I consider questionning everything a healthy routine for the mind.

       Is that your comment? Because it sounds a lot like astroturfing.

       To answer your initial question, being a skeptic is not a bad thing (I'm one too). But usually when someone throws around their skeptic badge so mightily, it's because they are pretending. Just like you're pretending right now. You're pretending like you don't know how to search Google for something the OP has pointed out. Instead, you sit here fishing for sources from the OP, so that you can attack whatever source he comes back with, and if you can't attack the source you will find a way to attack the author or cry about how the journal is pay to play or complain about P-values or whatever it is. Meanwhile, OP is finding a better way to live his life, and sharing his findings. Maybe you should do the same.

       99% of all people asking for a source on this subreddit are going to attack it on sight and are specifically asking for a source to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an excellent reason to doubt my motives,  even though i already stated them. My point was to expose the fact that backing up your claim is crucial in a conspiracy context, and since we're in a conspiracy subreddit, well...
      </p>

       You believe what you want of my motives, because as long as OP doesn't provide a source, you'll never know what my reaction will be, or would have been.

       I've done my own research and concluded that fillings are safe based on your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say fillings are not safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You read my simple question, then put something in quotes that, not only did I never say, I never remotely implied, in fact you don't even say what "the narrative" is supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you either can't read or just make stuff up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you say something is not safe it's should be safe to assume that it is.

       you can bicker more and not even bother to read the source i would provide you. go on, do some work. The time you wasted talking shit could have been spent looking more into this yet here we are... ignorance is bliss

       except here's how the real world works:
      </p>
      <p>
       person makes a claim...person then has to back up that claim with evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       no one is screaming anything, in the 15 responses you've given as to why you won't give sources....you could have just given sources.

       So here's what it is: you're talking out of your ass and have no sources. Your claim is bullshit because you cannot back it up with any evidence.

       All the sources are from dental associations. The same dental associations who still say fluoride is healthy for you. You can't use people who have an extreme bias and an entire industry to protect as a valid source. No amount of mercury in the body is safe. Not to mention the fact that c. albicans fungus(which causes oral thrush and is very common in the oral cavity) methylates metal mercury into methyl mercury which is hundreds of times more toxic. Saccharomyces cerevisiae(brewers yeast) also methylates elemental mercury, so anytime someone drinks beer with fillings they are exposed to extremely toxic methyl mercury.

       So clearly some amount is safe , the amount thats totally moot

       I guess I should have said any amount has a detrimental effect as opposed to safe. But yes you're right that in tiny amounts it will not make any noticeable difference. But at the basic level, even one molecule of mercury will have a negative effect on any human cell it comes in contact with. 
Not all yeast. As far as I know just two species of fungus/yeast are known to do this. Having oral thrush and amalgam fillings would be incredibly bad for somebody but I suppose it is not directly the fillings fault for that.

       I mean... isn't a man-made lab by definition a part of mother nature? And I'm definitely taking some antibiotics when I have a nasty infection. Don't be so skeptical about good things my dude, there is corruption in the pharmaceutical industry but certainly you can see the good too.

       Perhaps it can be argued the way businesses compete with each other (including in the biopharmaceutics world) is an evolutionary mechanism at work which works efficiently, as defined by the laws of mother nature. It is not inherently evil, but it may be the most efficient (but perhaps brutal for some) route towards the future of humanity, whatever that may be.

       What part of "Mother Nature" makes you think 'she' will provide every advantage to humans as a species that we could need? Bro nature hates us at worst and is indifferent at best. For literally all of human history it has been us fighting nature tooth and nail to survive. Nature is a force and it couldn't give less of a fuck whether we're healthy or dying. Your natural remedies argument is bullshit, do you know where we get pharmaceuticals from? They're all derived from plants, just the components of "natural remedies" that we took and concentrated into purer forms.

       I would say it took about 6 uses before I got used to this toothpaste. Let me tell you - no one will regret this switch. Providing the right environment for your mouth allows you mouth to heal. Yes heal. Have a cavity? Providing the right environment will allow your teeth to regenerate, naturally. Sounds outlandish but I can say I will never go back.

       Isn’t baking soda a processed product made by chemical engineers?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can it be organic and gmo? It’s not a product that is grown in a field, it’s made in a vat from Trona ore and it all comes from the same source in Wyoming, right?
And it’s processed with salt, ammonia and carbon dioxide.

       I often hear people suggest using baking soda and hydrogen peroxide for whiteneing, but I've no idea if it actually works.

       Buy opalescensce 30%. Its like $30 on amazon for like 6 months supply and will whiten your teeth super fast. Buy a $1 custom moldable mouth guard to use. The dentist will give you the exact same stuff and charge you $200 for professional whitening.

       You hit a lot of points and I concur, but I also have no cavities/fillings. I don't think the sonicare is an issue with proper cleaning but I also don't advise buying one unless you get a deal. My dad is a dentist and I try to show him studies all of the time and he is neither for or against what you said. I think he just reiterates what is said at annual dental meetings. I'm sure there are dentists in places like Colorado, and California that practice these methods. In all honesty it comes down to the state you live in and your client base. The residents where I live are mostly old and retired so they think differently. Sometimes you have to adapt to their thinking.

       Will your teeth really heal on their own? Lake, obviously not a huge crater cavity, but if it’s one just starting to form? Also, I read an article on him plaque is actually a good thing, it’s what filled in cavities in the old days before dentists

       My gums have went to shit in the last 6 moths. It started with slight bleeding when flossing to waking up with blood dried to my teeth. The reason is when I sleep I breath through my mouth and wake up with a bone dry mouth.

       I tried nasal strips and head gear to keep my mouth shut but it's been little help.

       So how does anything you said to do repair cavities, decay, or broken teeth? Seems like a preventative regiment but will do nothing to replace the need for fillings.

       well it really depends
      </p>
      <p>
       you get into trouble when the rot hits the nerve within the tooth
      </p>
      <p>
       if the tooth is really really painful then it may be a loss
      </p>
      <p>
       but you can reverse things and prevent further decay by keeping a balanced ph in the mouth
      </p>
      <p>
       oral probitiocs may help as well
      </p>
      <p>
       but iltimately, keep the mouth clean and watch acidic candies and sodas, or at least brush at night etc so it isnt sitting there

       most stores and health stores will have it
      </p>
      <p>
       its good to make sure its extra virgin coconut oil because most coconut oil isnt even made from coconuts
      </p>
      <p>
       its a little spendier but will last you a long time and is actually good for your body too (with foods or just eating a spoon a day or so)

       Not necessarily. You can go from a cavity to needing a root canal (or worse, an extraction) without experiencing any pain.

       It should be noted the ADA isn’t a government body. They’re a marketing group. A very scammy marketing group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their biggest sponsors are Colgate and Invisalign, so damn straight you need their products. Dentists have an average of a half million dollars in debt before they even get their own practice, so they need to sell a fuck ton of tooth paste and braces to pay that off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dentists legit plan out their weeks needing a quota of cleanings and cavities to break even. They have financial incentive to be more aggressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way the ADA exists is by holding meetings at warm cities which allow dentists to write off a nice vacation.

       Hey bro, if you have cavities you need to A. Get it fixed asap or B. Live in a way that it will not worsen because then it will require medical attention and cost even more than originally. (Unless of course you use the hill billy dental method of pulling the tooth out yourself and hope it doesn’t become infected) your teeth will not naturally repair themselves.

       There haven't been a ton of big studies done on it yet, but you might want to take a look at
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198813/#sec4title">
        this NIH article about it
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Four researchers in their study involving 60 adolescents of age 16–18 years with plaque induced gingivitis, observed statistically significant reduction of plaque and gingival indices upon oil pulling using coconut oil. Subjects performed oil pulling in early morning at empty stomach in addition to their routine oral hygiene measures such as brushing and flossing. They were assessed after 4 h after performing oil pulling. Modified Gingival Index and plaque index by Sillness and Loe were measured at baseline and on days 1, 7, 15 and 30. Steady decline in indices was found from day seven. Plaque and gingival indices significantly decreased after 30 days of oil pulling. The study observed 50% decreases in gingival and plaque indices after four weeks which is comparatively similar to results produced by chlorhexidine. They concluded that oil pulling with coconut oil is helpful in decreasing plaque formation and plaque induced gingivitis.

       It did nothing for my gums or breath that a normal salt water rinse can't do, nor did I get any of the other BS "benefits" that you read about when you look into oil pulling.
      </p>
      <p>
       My verdict is that it's mostly BS except for softening plaque.

       You have to use a certain oil... Using some random oil and not doing it properly isn't going to work and just because some site called nutritionfacts claimed is is bullshit doesn't really mean much.

       Just add a few drops of tea tree oil to your paste. I went 25 years with no cavities or cleanings. Finally decided to go in and the dentist was like...”what did you do?” My teeth were cavity free.

       When I see something that is perhaps real, but then have to reread a sentence to make sure it really did just claim that modern dentistry destroys our connection to some divine source... I'm not going to be pursuing your train of thought any longer.

       It is because you have been misinformed.  And thousands of years of our history has been erased.  And you come across like a jerk for dismissing what OP is saying just because you "think" it is silly.  You can research about pineal glands and their importance to our connection to our higher dimensional selves in every single culture.

       I and countless others know the power of meditation.  To feel the vibrational force of Existence course through every atom of your Being.  Research astral projection.  Research Buddhist monks.  This is knowledge that everyone used to have and accepted as truth yet today it has all but been erased.   Although Eastern civilizations are still more aware.  America was built on deceit and lies.  And the powers that be have been feeding us fluoride in our water and in other ways to shut us off from Source.  Deep down there is a part of you that remembers this.

       I have no problem with people having their own believes and meditation is a great thing but as to the other part. i know you are joking.. ... but ill go with it and say okay, FLUORIDE BEING THE PROBLEM! Then isn’t Africa enlightened because they do not have the fluoride? You said specifically america. Or do the powers feed them in other ways. Maybe i do not see it because wakanda is real

       I think you dont see it because you don't want to.  People who live in poverty and despair are not going to have high vibrations and will be lost too.  Fluoride is not the only way to keep us down.  Do you not see how much hatred and segregation there is?  Its not a fluoride conspiracy.  That's just one agent in a host of thousands.  There is no need for the powers that be to control Africa as much as America.  America is a rich nation with a lot of success and happiness.  This is a different playing field.

       can you elaborate on what you mean by start to heal? What besides your receding gums are you talking about and what kind of time frame are you talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, wrt activated charcoal toothpaste, have you noticed any damage to your teeth or enamel? I got it into my head to use charcoal and used it for about a week before I freaked myself out by searching for whether it would damage my teeth or not. I couldn’t find a consensus, but most people seem to think you should only use it 2x per week or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t notice anything out of ordinary in the couple weeks I used it. I was just experimenting to see if it would have an effect on my pineal gland or intuition but admittedly didn’t try anything else you mentioned.

       I have achieved stellar gum growth within literally about 4-5 days. that quick
      </p>
      <p>
       your teeth are fine mate, just dont scrub away too hard and do small circle motions among the gum line.
      </p>
      <p>
       activated charcoal seems to be the ideal choice but its your call, and yeah you dont have to brush that often especially if you eat a clean diet. at the least ill swish with the magic mouth wash and do an oil pull

       (Sorry for long comment) Im kinda of confused here guys. I was on board with it being a scam because it does cost crazy amounts. But when medical supplies in the us are so expensive and dental school alone costs $350,000-$400,000 what do you expect? I took this as fillings are toxic (which I’m not sure if it is or isn’t , but certainly the whole industry isn’t trying to kill us) then a great list of how to have great dental hygiene. Was this post saying go to natural remedies to have great hygiene, or using natural remedies to fix all dental problems? Because if you have had terrible dental hygiene racking up medical issues, you can’t just use natural remedies to fix most of the problems. You WILL need medical attention. As for ops gums, it is great op took it upon him/herself to fix it and have great results! But I don’t see the scam with dentists there. The point of having great hygiene beforehand as op described is so you don’t have to use the dentist for anything other than a check up in the first place. I don’t see the conspiracy so please correct me on what I’m missing. I think this is a great post, and reminder, for taking better care of your mouth, I will be checking out the products op talked about!

       I just realized this post is not a conspiracy towards dental being a scam or fillings being bad for you. But this is a conspiracy that and dentists are soul sucking voodoo doctors and fillings are their tool. I feel stupid for caring, but for real guys! Just listen to the taking good care of your mouth part and get your past dental problems fixed BY A DENTIST. It improves quality of life and the sooner you fix it the less it will cost. And who knows, if this post is right about taking good care of your mouth you will not only avoid dental bills but also gain your inner light temple or whatever.

       like the fact that over 90% of composite fillings are literal neuro toxins that will leach into your body over time?

       You do realize since posting this my gums have healed up around my teeth? My sensititivites are gone, and the plaque is dissolving? You say fact based medicine, well last I checked we don't need a dentist office to take care of our mouths. Hows your mouth feeling? Bet you disregarded this whole thread mean while you will be at the dentist office in a few months for a teeth cleaning. Typical ignorance

       Well it doesn't help much that they don't brush or take care of their teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you follow a good hygeine routine, if you're constantly eating starches and soft foods as well as acidic foods, it will destroy the equilibrium in the mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are billions of types of bacteria in the mouth. If things get out of balance and the mouth turns acidic, it makes it easier for harmful bacteria to thrive and go into your gums and produce plaque.

       No there isn’t. Fluoride is literally a necessary structural component for the mineral structures of your teeth. It has to be replenished either by a fluoride mouthwash or fluoride toothpaste as it like anything is slowly eroded away over time.

       Which is composed of fluoride. It can’t regenerate the enamel but it can repair what has been temporarily weakened before permanent damage is done. One of the most basic rules of medicine is that everything is a toxin, it’s the dosage that matters.

       True, dosage matters. There's tons of fluoride for example in a lot of tea. But the average diet in developed countries provides more than enough fluoride for an adult. There is no need for additional fluoride in the water or toothpaste unless that person has an individual condition that requires it.

       No there’s a reason I said fluoride toothpaste or fluoride mouthwash. It has to be applied and left undisturbed for a period of time. That’s half the point of brushing your teeth is to have some downtime after where your teeth can remineralize.

       Fluoride works by converting the outer layer of tooth enamel made of hydroxylapatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, to fluoroapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F. The latter chemical is less soluble in acidic solutions. The three most commonly added fluoride chemicals are sodium fluoride (NaF), fluorosilicic acid ((H3O)2SiF6), and sodium fluorosilicate (Na2[SiF6]).

       Science is ever evolving. It’s iterative, very rarely in the modern day is previous science found completely wrong, it’s just become more precise over time. It’s experiment and evidence based not faith based. You shouldn’t place your faith in it, you should learn and study the science and understand it. Also this is basic dental hygiene with simple minerals and compounds that you can easily see and deconstruct in a lab. This isn’t string theory we are talking about.

       Seriously, this guy is telling people to not use the dentist and “heal” your problems that wont fix themselves like a cavity that needs a filling (yes he says that in the comments). He also says the dentists are using toxic things to destroy our being of light or whatever. I hope no one takes this seriously, but i saw a guy asking op for advice with his unfilled cavities.

       Don't waste your money on alkalised rinse.  Buy baking soda for a few pennies and use that for  your mouth rinse. You can brush with it too, just  like everyone did before fluoride toothpaste (by the way,  the only type of fluoride that works is stannous fluoride, if you aren't using that, you're not even trying)

       This post missed the true danger, root canals.  An easy way to think of a root canal is taking a dead part of your body and keeping it there.  Sounds like a terrible idea.  Don't take my word for it though, a quick search will blow your mind.

       This. I've always been told (by the dentist, by the TV ads, by everyone) to brush my teeth 3 times a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I brush my teeth only once a day, before going to bed, mostly out of laziness. My teeth are fine. And they are fine because I eliminated from my diet all the junk food (soda, cakes, biscuits, candies, chocolate, sauces, fast food, you name it).
      </p>

       A good diet is key to good dental health, and good overall physical health.

       I had a broken tooth and putting off going to the dentist. I woke up one morning in pain, my gums and cheek swelled up so I called the dentist to get in for an emergency visit but was informed he was on vacation for another week. I remembered colloidal silver was anti-bacterial, viral, etc. so I started rinsing with it every couple hours and took probably twice the suggested amount. The pain went away within a few a hours and the swelling went down in a few days. I put off going to the dentist and haven't had any reoccurring issues in the last year. The weird thing besides the silver working so fast is that my gums grew into the broken side of my tooth. I'm not saying this is a permanent fix by any means but now I'm curious to see how long it will last before I have problems again. I'm living proof that the colloidal silver will clear up some nasty infections.

       Being older, I have several that are amalgam from 30-40 years ago. One in front is something different, white. Amalgam is extremely durable, but I image there are equally long-lasting alternatives now.

       very observant behaviour. May I ask why you feel the need to stalk my account postings?
      </p>
      <p>
       may I ask why you feel the need to start things?
      </p>
      <p>
       may I ask why you feel the need to not critically think about any of this whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny that you did not respond to my other comment, regarding blaming others for your own problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, read this
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.alternet.org/personal-health/when-its-time-fill-your-cavities-all-options-are-toxic">
        https://www.alternet.org/personal-health/when-its-time-fill-your-cavities-all-options-are-toxic
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, since I doubt you read my other link and only care about starting shit with people, this is for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       "When we understand how fear is created in the body, it is helpful in releasing the grip of anxiety and fear patterns. People that are triggered into fears and mental anxiety may impulsively turn to blame shifting or the projection of their fears onto others. When people are in deep pain and they are suffering, many times they will move unacceptable impulses in themselves and place them onto someone else"
      </p>
      <p>

        https://eraoflight.com/2018/05/31/denial-and-blame-shifters/#more-68935
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, all you do is attack others while provide 0 substance. I'm convinced you're not here to foster discussion but instead create disharmony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read those 2 links then get back to me with an actual discussion. Until then, I know what your motives are and I can see right through them :)

       im leaving these comments here to show others how blatantly hypocritical you are and how you cant even bother to have a discussion when a source is linked
      </p>
      <p>
       its almost like youre not here for actual discussion and instead shit everywhere you go just to foster division. Let me ask what country you live in because im already 99% sure i know who you work for.

       JFC you sent me like 15 messages, dude chill out. I'm so sorry that my lunch break didn't fit into your schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, you provided one source....what about all the other claims you're making? Got anything to back up any of those homeopathic remedies? Or how about the thousands of dollars in debt figure? I just got 7 fillings and a cleaning: my total cost was &lt;$100
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, you can call me a denier all you want, but if you go back and reread...I didn't deny any of your claims until about the 4th time I asked for sources and you wouldn't provide any

       When your dentist finds a cavity, besides the immediate fear of the drill or the painful pinch of the novocaine injection, the choice of filling material can also raise anxieties. And it's not easy—you either opt for plastic composite resins, which use dangerous plasticizers like bisphenol A, or metal amalgam fillings containing mercury, which needs little introduction as a toxic heavy metal. Both types of fillings bring with them concerns about long-term health effects and both show risks and benefits in terms of their durability and other factors affecting long-term oral health

       What kind of water pick do you use? I have been looking around online at different stuff and just got some oral probiotics last night.

       Not too sure what a water pick is, seems I will have to do some research into it :) thanks for the suggestion

       I'm trying to source a similar cleaning system from Holland into the United States but it may be a hassle..

      <p>
       So far just working on cleaning and balancing my mouth until I too can get one sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the systems combine water air and a cleaning agent to do the cleaning which would be ideal. Such a sham such machines are hardly known as well as hard to source..
