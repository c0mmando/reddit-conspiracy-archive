    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you hanvt read the articles about VPNfilter. </p>

<p>When you reboot your router, the virus gets &quot;reset&quot; to first-start condition. It then connects to the failsafe website, which is the site the FBI took off the internet .  </p>

<p>VPNFilter is a neat piece of technology. It loads plugins from the failsafe site, to connect to the bot network proper.
If we want to play conspiracy, after a reboot FBI failsafe site could then load up their own virus plugins for use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you&#39;re not getting it. Imagine a road with signs to &quot;desert oasis!&quot; People drive by the highway and see it. They get to the first sign and then get told to go to the next sign 2 miles down the road. They also get told &quot;come back here if you get lost.&quot; Basically the FBI took over the first sign. Now everyone driving by is going to stop and pull up to that sign. They&#39;re going to know and see it is a scam then keep going. The people on the way already don&#39;t know it is a scam and keep following directions. Rebooting would be like deleting a sign. People would get lost, got back to the start, and see it is a scam.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an analogy and we all know those don&#39;t translate well. As I was writing this it seemed to not make it any more clear. Figured I&#39;d still post it because maybe it will help you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a droplet get hit with a botnet and this is how it worked. It had an ongoing check against the master though. I don&#39;t know about the details on this, but does it infect firmware and need the reboot to reinit and grab the new domain, or couldn&#39;t they just update the remote instructions and wait on time?

    <div class="md"><p>It makes perfect sense, and this happens all the time when taking down malware botnets. The malware is programmed to check in with a specific domain and then receive instructions (this is called a malware command and control server, or C2). The FBI seized and sinkholed the domain. If you don&#39;t reboot, the malware on your router will keep asking the C2 for instructions using the cached IP address for the domain, which is supposedly the server used by the Russian hackers. If you reboot, your router will re-resolve the domain, with its new IP address, which is a server controlled by the FBI instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also need to add that only a factory reset cleans it from the VPNFilter. A reboot only protects from stage 2 infection, stage 1 infection is still there.</p>

<p>And via the overtaken command and control center the FBI can then control your router. They analyzed the commands already.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Oh, does that mean that only certain brands or models of routers are susceptible? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this very common to be the case. Usually a company will re-use the same parts and software/firmware across a line of products, and so that whole line tends to be susceptible to the same problems as each other.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also somewhat common for this to affect multiple brands because they often use the same parts/software/firmware. A lot of these devices are just re-branded while being made by the same generic manufacturer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI already had access to your router, and all of your network traffic through your ISP.</p>

<p>This was probably legit, where refreshing your router would force it to re-resolve the malware C2 domain to a sinkhole (meaning after a reboot the domain would resolve to an IP address controlled by the FBI, but if you don&#39;t cycle it, your router will keep using the cached domain IP). </p>

<p>The FBI and the rest of the government surveillance apparatus does not need to be pushing malware and kindly asking people to refresh their devices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on if you were infected prior to the power outage. A reboot now wouldn&#39;t hurt. The FBI seized the domain that the group running this botnet/malware infection had, so a reboot allows the FBI to get the call home from infected devices, so they can get a picture of what the infection looks like.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;d recommend a factory reset of the router firmware and an upgrade to the firmware if it&#39;s available. If your router supports it, you should flash it to an open source alternative instead of the stock firmware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This conspiracy has merit, 90 of routers in america not sure about other countries have ports filtered by your ISP meaning theres no way for a remote attacker to even make an implant feasible in the first place, how can you hack someones router if remote management is disabled majority of time by default? oh wait you CAN&#39;T, so the FBI has to be bsing some of the statistics here, unless it&#39;s some sort of cross site request forgery shenanigans using malicious javascript on a page this seems peculiar.</p>
