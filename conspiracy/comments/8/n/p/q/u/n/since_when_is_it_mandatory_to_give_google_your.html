        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe this is normal nowadays and I&#39;m just being paranoid, but I have 3 different email accounts I made some where between 2009-2014 without any of them being linked to a cell phone number. Sure, they would always <em>suggest</em> that for verification purposes and lost passwords you should give them your number, but it was never mandatory before. I know because I hate giving out my cell phone number and avoid things that require it when possible.</p>

<p>So I went to try and make a new Gmail account right before posting this and yeah it is now required to verify by text if you want to continue the steps needed to register the username. I mean I get it, I know about yopmail and the other burner email services, but it just seems kinda &quot;big brother&quot; esque to force people to give you unrelated personal information in order to make a simple email account. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on the fact that it singlehandedly destorys any shred of anonymity left in using the internet. Google is the powerhouse. Gmail is probably one of the most used email providers, and they are now saying that if you want to use our services, we demand we know who you are. </p>

<p><em>We promise we wont share your identity or personal information with anyone</em> </p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>The real answer is to not use Gmail if I have a problem with it lol And that is the route I went. I just couldn&#39;t believe it when there was no option to skip that step as there had been in the recent past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does though. I mean you can get past it without using your personal cell number by using a burner or a texting app (if that even works, because I have had trouble using free texting services when a verification code has to be sent) but it is not as easy as giving out a fake number. You need to have access to that numbers text messages in order to verify the account.</p>

<p>also, try to stick with incognito mode on browser so they don&#39;t try to merge your various email addresses.  if you log into two different addresses on the same non-incognito browser, they&#39;ll try to merge them into one account :( it totally sucks.</p>

If they took it away that is fucked up. If they didn&#39;t and I was just too fucked up last night to find it, then I will admit I fucked up while being fucked up.</p>

<p>Could just be some sort of glitch, or maybe some sort of regional thing.  I have two accounts that I have tied my phone number to because I care about the stuff in them so I want to be able to recover them easily, but I&#39;ve made a lot of gmail accounts for games and such that I&#39;ve never put a phone number on before.  In fact I had just done that yesterday for a game which is why this thread made no sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering they give you 15gb free with every email, I’m sure they would like to limit the user not to create 50+ accounts for whatever reason. It saves them money and is used for authentication. How else are you going to get the password to your email? Sure, you could use security questions but that’s not as safe as a phone number for two factor verification. Anybody who knows you well could break into your account with your security questions.</p>

<p>Honestly, some people in this sub are grasping at straws. You could get an app that will give you a free 2nd number. Otherwise, giving up a phone number isn’t that much of a security risk. The reason why we have phone numbers is to give them out to people and to receive them (you know, for calling and stuff)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not skippable. I know exactly what op is talking about. I tested this out months ago and it was exactly this, you must provide a number. I am not sure if providing the phone number of a public place will work, I cannot remember rid I tired that or not. Up numbers and soft phones won&#39;t work. WiFi phone apps like text now won&#39;t work. </p>

<p>The only email services that I see will take a softphone last I checked is Yahoo and aol. </p>

<p>I hate it too. I want more Gmail accounts but don&#39;t want them tied to this set of Gmail accounts or what they have in their database. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the best part:</p>

<p>After your Twitter account linked to you cell that is also linked to your gmail is suspended by the Shitlib Censorship Volunteer Brigade, and you go to create a new gmail account linked to the same cell, Google forbids it because you can only have one gmail per cell phone.</p>

<p>And if your Twitter is suspended, and the linked phone you used ISN&#39;T used for any Gmail account and you go to create a new Gmail linked to that cell, Google forbids it and tells you that you have to use a different phone number.</p>

<p>And if you used a Google Voice number linked to your suspended Twitter account, then Googke won&#39;t let you release the number and geberate a new one.</p>

<p>I know this tedious process because I went through it multiple times after being one of the most suspended AltRight accounts on Twitter.</p>

<p>I totally gave up on Twitter after about the 27th or so account.</p>

<p>And fuck Google.</p>

<p>Twitter and Google are colluding to mass censor voices from the right to promote the illusion that everyone online is a hardcore Das Kapital kissing Leftist.</p>

<p>Use Yandex.</p>

<p>Yandex also requires a cell number, but I trust Russia with it a helluva lot more than any FVEYS snitches.</p>

<p>And Yandex accepts pre-paid &quot;burner&quot; cell numbers. Google and Twitter sonehow know which phone numbers are pre-paid so they can&#39;t spy on your subscriber info which they buy from the Telcos and shady resellers like LocationSmart.</p>

<p>Everytime you use Yandex, a GS-13 NSA Analyst loses their wings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, but Im not about to go and buy a burner phone to make a gmail account.. thats ridiculous. Like objectively ridiculous.</p>

<p>The real answer is to not use Gmail if I have a problem with it lol And that is the route I went. I just couldn&#39;t believe it when there was no option to skip that step as there had been in the recent past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasnt able to find that option on the chromebook I was using.. Maybe it is the OS being shit, but that is the wholw point of this post: I had made multiple emails where I was allowed to skip this step, but I spent 10-15 mins earlier trying to make a new username and was unable to find the option to skip it. If they took it away that is fucked up. If they didn&#39;t and I was just too fucked up last night to find it, then I will admit I fucked up while being fucked up.</p>

<p>A Fuckception of sorts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>try opening gmail in a new tab, while logged in - if it doesn&#39;t also ask you to verify with number &amp; takes you to the next steps / inbox, then you may have to do that to evade the bot.  </p>

<p>also, try to stick with incognito mode on browser so they don&#39;t try to merge your various email addresses.  if you log into two different addresses on the same non-incognito browser, they&#39;ll try to merge them into one account :( it totally sucks.</p>
