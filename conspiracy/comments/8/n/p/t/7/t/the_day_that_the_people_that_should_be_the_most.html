       Many people on this sub are able to question their own mind and its workings and fallacies. They are closer to the truths being looked for here, because their minds are less clouded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly there's also a group that thinks their own mind is infallible and that all their thoughts are true. To them everything is a conspiracy. This group compromises the credibility of conspiracy theorists totally and are the reason conspiracy theorists are not taken seriously.

       I would certainly agree with this. The problem with the genre of conspiracy theory is that it has been fed to us through our television and societal media as entertainment for decades. This programming is now being used to create "brands" or "tribes" within conspiracy theorist communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of this programming is quite effective. The Q phenomenon can be modeled as a MMORPG, in that the Q followers feel they are participating, that they are part of this drama and narrative that is being crafted for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are only "woke" (and I hate that term) to the extent that we continually question not only the world we see around us, but that world which exists inside us.

       Naturally? Sure, with maybe the exception of XYY and other chromosomal anomalies.  Wouldn't surprise me if the tech already existed to create at least female/female crosses, and possibly male/male crosses in a lab.

       There are no exceptions. You are either male or female. That's a universal truth. Meddling with it, is another topic. Seems to me, you are either ignorant, or didn't completely think through what you originally said. I'm going to go... with a mixture of both. Just like your Scientists in the laboratory ;)

       You said: "TPTB want us in tribes and divided" (paraphrase). And that is wrong or something. You are one to believe in Subjectivity, and that's fuckin' dangerous, imo. We are not all "one" (that is what they want us to think- not united under "tribes"). Life is not purely Subjective.

       Perhaps I should have said "warring tribes." I see nothing wrong with people living in tribes, communities, communes, or collectives smaller than the whole species. I think that's healthy for humans (much healthier than a lot of city life).
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is that two tribes (actually quite a few more), nations really, living within the same polity with the same state, where each tribe wields against the other. Picking a side on this, even the "right" side, is a bad fucking idea, because now you've pitted yourself against the very people you need to make peace with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting we all come around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, but we need to stop fighting each other. You lean "conservative", and I dig that. But making enemies of "liberals" is just making more enemies. You make them dig in to their trenches as you're in yours, and the misleaders happily collect all our taxes. I would venture to say your actions on this sub have caused more liberals to double down against you than brought supporters to your side.

       It's an information war, mate. If you think you're gonna win it against those who

       wield power without at least an
       <em>

       with the other 50%+ of the population, you've already lost.

       That's a shite comparison. From your statement we can say some of the universe is filled with matter and some isn't. 2 states of being. The members of the tiny intersex population still lean more towards one or the other gender individually. It's like saying 0,018% of people are born with a tail, so now we need a tail acceptance movement and change all of our society to reflect the existence of these tail people. Call it ignorant if you will, doesn't change the facts. There's 2 genders.

       No he wasn't. It's not about politics you dip. There are 2 sexes, intersex isn't a third. Intersex people have characteristics of both to some degree, they still lean closer to one or the other sex.

       If it isn't about politics why were you talking about acceptance movements and changing society? I wasn't talking about that.

      <p>
       But you're right, intersex isn't a third sex. It's a category that describes several kayrotypes which are distinct from XX &amp; XY. You can try and play semantics and say 'they're more male or female', but that isn't how scientists talk about them. I'd suggest you go and read up on the actual science, but I know you won't. You'll just keep running your mouth so you can avoid having to face up to the fact that you only give a shit about what you feel is true.

       How is that not implying there are more than 2 sexes and intersex is the third? That's what I picked up on.

       I meant this isn't a political issue for me, it still has major political consequences for society.

       <p>
        But you're right, intersex isn't a third sex. It's a category that describes several kayrotypes which are distinct from XX &amp; XY. You can try and play semantics and say 'they're more male or female', but that isn't how scientists talk about them.

      <p>
       Fair enough, but for all societal intents and purposes they belong to one of two groups. They are exceptions that don't need separate sex designations 99% of the time.

        I'd suggest you go and read up on the actual science, but I know you won't. You'll just keep running your mouth so you can avoid having to face up to the fact that you only give a shit about what you feel is true.

       Lol, think and speak some more for me. I'm usually the first to admit when I'm wrong and totally open to change my opinions. Not an ideologue. I wholeheartedly agree that I'm no expert on these matters, just  speaking my mind.
Feel free to link some sources and I promise I'll read em. We'd probably agree on most points in this issue, I just disagree that there are more than 2 sexes. If that wasn't what you meant I have no issues here
      </p>
      <p>
       Also English isn't my first, second or third language so I get terms like sex and gender mixed up.

       Totally agree. However, I think that you have to properly educate yourself on the types of propaganda the MSM puts out before you can properly use them as sources. This would be done by using high-quality alternative media site, such as the Corbett Report, Mint Press News, Consortium News, Common Dreams, The Real News, and Moon of Alabama (blog site, but very good in my experience).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have a foundation of information you can stand on, it is much easier to spot MSM bias, disinformation, and misinformation.

       In my experience, this group is not very big. On the internet, there is always a vocal minority, e.g. flat earthers. Most people I know IRL who are "conspiracy theorists" like me are open to being wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is also my experience that common criticisms from (usually self-proclaimed) skeptics often stem from lack of knowledge on the topics they discuss; I routinely see a-priori reasoning and arguments from incredulity from these types.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that there aren't good criticisms of course, but they are sadly overshadowed by the former group.

       This
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       how I feel about the subject. An example of how large a problem this is becoming: yesterday, a fellow posted a study about the psychology behind conspiracism to the subreddit. Its conclusions apparently made many people uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that they were attacking it with the very same logical fallacies that are often used to dismiss conspiracy theories. We seem to be forgetting that how much we like a piece of information is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a rating for its validity.

       That is EXACTLY why psychology,  by definition, doesn't fall under the term "science".  The human mind is not quantifiable.  If you're  working with subjective "evidence" as opposed to scientifically provable evidence you don't have a science.

       <p>
        This medley of contradictory – even pseudo-scientific – ideas in and of itself should prove that psychology is not a science.

       Great.  Even though you earned a Masters in psychology,  you still think it can be defined as a science?

       I don't avoid certain types of information.  I absorb whatever comes my way and make decisions based on the entirety of it, using critical thinking to separate the wheat from the chaff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information filters are for those afraid to explore reality for fear of finding something which doesn't  agree with their imagined reality. This is another reason the average person takes the words of someone with a degree as gospel....   They're scared to investigate and question for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR. I expose myself to material and information from all camps of thought on any particular subject before arriving at personal conclusions of belief.   Most people don't do that,  and I can tell you do not do that either.

       I honestly don't give much of a shit at all about the whole "not definable as science" debate. I only brought it up because the circle-jerking between  OP and his mini-me sidekick was too funny to not poke a stick at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steeped in their self-assured superiority revelations about how critical thinking in this sub is so limited,  they seemed to be oblivious to their own hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mention that psychology doesn't fall under the definition of science and they LOSE THEIR SHIT without being able to concede that my perspective isn't any less valid than theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a settled debate,  yet, they deny the debate has any merit at all because it upsets their feels.
      </p>
      <p>
       From their perspective,  they're unquestionably right because they adhere to mainstream thought and I'm wrong because  I frequent this sub. OP only came here to smear shit on the walls.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I had to say made them uncomfortable because it disrupted the way they want to view things, but,  they were blind to their own hypocrisy about it.  Ultimately,  their egos are more fragile and their worldview more coddled than any veterans here.   They have not yet  been able to admit that, possibly, they don't know everything... that is the first step to having an open mind.

       Most of psychology research doesn't adhere to empirical principles, and the debate on wether or not psychology is "a science" has been going for over a century, with very smart people on both sides unable to provide a definitive answer. So the "psychology isn't a science" line isn't as dumb as it seems, be more openminded.

       That's a common misconception. While some social psychology research has indeed had issues with conforming to empiricism, psychology as a whole tends to be fairly rigid when it comes to scientific robustness, especially if the 'harder' fields like neuropsychology are included.

       It was more the complete lack of argumentation I was complaining about than the statement itself. If you can support your point of view with solid evidence, I'll be quite happy to change my mind, but I am so far not convinced.

       I don't claim to have the definitive answer here, just pointing out that there is and has been for a long time a debate on the question "is psychology a science?". This isn't centrism, not everything has 2 sides, a subject or question like this has nuanced answers. Maybe it's scientific in some ways and not so much in others for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like this write up I just found, the author concludes that in his view it's a science but honestly represents some of the other sides pretty well.

       There is absolutely no reason to fire a Stalin's organ of insults at me just because we disagree about psychology's scientific merits. Ad hominems don't add any strength to your argumentation and only breed needless tension. In fact, I have found that debaters often use personal attacks to conceal the weaknesses in their point of view, so this kind of hostility only
       <em>
        detracts
       </em>
       from the value of what you are saying. Is it really so hard to be decent in debates instead of immediately executing the other party for the crime of disagreeing with you?
      </p>
      <p>
       With that out of the way, let's get back to the discussion.

      <p>
       Again, I was criticising the lack of argumentation of your original comment, not necessarily its content. To not cite evidence for your proposition and instead say that it is the other party's task to prove the opposite is a clear case of shifting the burden of proof.

       This is also an established logical fallacy.

      <p>
       Again a well-crafted ad hominem. If you're this good at fallacies, imagine what a shining star you could be at actual logic! Maybe you should try it for once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I am aware I am indulging in a fallacy myself here, but even my patience has its limits.

      <p>
       Surely the irony of claiming that psychology isn't a science and then ''''''proving'''''' that claim with an article that doesn't even
       <em>
        pretend
       </em>
       to be a peer-reviewed study doesn't escape you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we cast aside that objection, the article itself is fairly mediocre. Early psychology was more a philosophy than it was a science, and to judge the modern fields by its early roots strikes me as more than a little unfair. By that same logic, one should also dismiss chemistry, as it is merely an offshoot of alchemy.

       It is a science. Stop being pedantical and simply Google the definition of science. Even if psychology doesn't fit your particular definition of science it is still a field of study utilizing observation and experimentation.

       I have to agree, but the issue is the most vociferous and frequent voices here are not about discussing or learning, they're about arguing to stroke their own fragile egos, throwing around cherry-picked "woke" ideas that are usually as speculative as the ideas they try to put down. It's annoying sure, but at the end of the day remember to just filter the noise and take what has value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also say don't worry about compromising the credibility of conspiracy theorists - it's just a label. Just keep learning and looking for the truth.

       You fail to provide any real argumentation and just say 'they' don't understand, categorise them as 'normies' (as opposed to who? Yourself?), immediately conclude 'they' have an agenda, have infiltrated this sub, conclude from air that they're ignorant in a sub that belongs to who? You?

       You are trying to sway public opinion of this sub by using problem-reaction-solution tactics.   You're pretending to be "one of us" so you can inject fabricated concern over the state of "your sub" while you actively work to disassemble it by spouting mainstream nonsense and pretending it belongs here.

       I am only pointing out, that if you're not prepared to question your own thinking, your thinking is probably compromised.

        everything

       is one big conspiracy, without questioning their own thinking about it, to start being critical about their own thinking. That's all. I'm just hoping the actual group of conspiracy theorists can get a little more credibility, because many things said actually have merit.

       You are going to see the comment section divide into groups each circlejerking that this is about their opposition. Especially the anti-Trump camp who believe the corporate news more. It may have not been your intention, but watch how the comment section plays out.

       You're taking a preconceived notion, a generalization, about a small percentage of people here and putting it out as a subtle smear on this sub.

       What percentage of this sub would you  say falls under the category of "the ones that think everything is one big conspiracy, without questioning their own thinking about it"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You would probably say I'm included in that percentage merely because I have expressed that psychology isn't,  by definition,  a science... and that upsets you emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have your head so far up mainstream's ass you don't even question your own thinking because the world reflects your false reality back to you and that is your proof that your way of thinking is superior.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are mainstream mini-me.  A little copy of it which has already declared that anything challenging your world view isn't real.  If that wasn't the case,  you'd be in here discussing reality with us instead of trying to push your way in and awkwardly force your own false reality misperceptions here.

       A common example would be confirmation bias. I see that a lot in flat earthers for example.

       Also, our memory isn't nearly as accurate as we think. Especially episodical memories can be severely compromised by context and suggestion.

       Flat Earth is the go-to example for people trying to improperly conflate this sub with nonsense.   The Flat Earth psy-op perpetrators/victims are an extremely small minority here.  They only tend to appear here in noticeable numbers to discredit the sub. During the election, this sub got 4-5 FE submissions per hour, but they weren't organic.

       Have you considered whether your own confirmation bias is causing you to see inordinate amounts of confirmation bias?

       Old enough to know that "flat earther" and similar posts are not representative of this sub. I asked you for examples, and that was the best you could come up with?

       You're trying to break down my credibility because you feel offended, because the post applies to you.

       Ah, there we are, then. My post and comment history is open. Dig up some examples from my submissions to justify your assertions, and copy-paste them here -- but be sure to include context -- okay? :-)

       Is that so? Well then, post some examples in evidence... In the meantime, I think I'll have a nap.
