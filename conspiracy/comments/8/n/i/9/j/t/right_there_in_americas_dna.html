    <div class="md"><p>Just a warning.. take what I&#39;m saying with a grain of salt because I just feel like ranting. Why don&#39;t you guys go form your own government somewhere away from the rest of us. You take for granted your way of life and the people who fight to keep it that way. You take for granted your government because you sincerely believe you&#39;re being treaded on. Hell, they can do a better job and they are corrupt as shit sure but the western world has the best standard of living any society has ever had in the history of humanity. You think you can do better? I know it&#39;s just a pipe dream of yours but you traitors who talk of revolution don&#39;t even know where to start. Seriously though, you think it&#39;s some easy task or some shit to control the most powerful country in the world and keep it civilized and controlled? You just know you hate our government. We don&#39;t want you here. Go find like minded people and gtfo. Shit, you don&#39;t even need to wait for a revolution you and your like minded friends can go live off grid right now and form your own little commune somewhere in Nevada. Nobody&#39;s going to tread on you there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US ranks 17th In the world on the <a href="https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index">Human Freedom Index</a>.  The 3017 Democracy Index lists the US as a &quot;flawed democracy&quot;, and Reporter Without Borders lists the US freedom of the press index as 45th in the world.  So its not me, its the experts saying the US isn&#39;t really that free, friend (not to mention more US people find American Imperialism as a morally questionable foreign policy).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rant away, you raise some good points. </p>

<p>I concur with the other reply, I think that you are neglecting to factor many elements, and are judging this society only by its material prosperity (not to devalue its significance though). However, you surely must agree that a world where 62 individuals have as much wealth as the bottom 3.5 billion and a world where an insidious form of economic colonialism conquers sovereign nations and bends them to the will of oligarchs, is a world that can be reformed and become more just. </p>

<p>I believe in democracy, and I believe that this system can become a helluva a lot more democratic. Do I think we can do better? I think <strong>we the people</strong> can do better. A good first step would be to remove corporate personhood and get corporate money out of democracy, break up monopolies and media conglomerates, strengthen the middle class, make the revolving doors between corporations and regulatory agencies illegal, protect the commons from privatization, and severely limit the absolute powers of intelligence agencies and the military industrial complex. </p>

<p>You must agree that our current system, despite providing some material comfort, is a corporate-controlled semifeudal pseudo-democracy. I believe that democracy, and a competitive economy based in middle class wealth, a 21st century update to the founding ideals of this country, would actualize a better existence for this country, and provide a beacon to the rest of the world of what a modern free society looks like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not calling for an eradication of the United States government, I want a government that is (apologies for the broken record) of the people, by the people and for the people. The current American government has represented the interests of multinational corporations (NAFTA, TARP bailout, Federal Reserve intertwined with Wall Street, Halliburton + military industrial complex deciding geopolitical strategy). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you feel about what the late Robert Kennedy has to say here? </p>

<p>&quot;Even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction - purpose and dignity - that afflicts us all. </p>

<p>Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things.  Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. </p>

<p>It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them.  It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. </p>

<p>It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities.  It counts Whitman&#39;s rifle and Speck&#39;s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. </p>

<p>Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. </p>

<p>It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. </p>

<p>And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.</p>

<p>If this is true here at home, so it is true elsewhere in world.&quot;</p>
