       I do think it's hilarious whenever celebrities etc. try to act like they know anything about stuff like prison reform. Seriously, what is KK even saying in that meeting? lol

       So I guess other than the disproportionate influence wealth/fame gets you and that most people with one or the other know each other/are connected in one way or another, probably not.

       Have you gone into the slums of LA to talk to actual homeless people about how they ended up homeless, what impacts their criminal history has had their lives, and how they're struggling to get back on their feet due to minor convictions years ago?

       I never said I was an expert. But I’d be willing to bet Trump could find 10 people more qualified than she and I combined within 20 miles of the White House daily.

       Agreed. But "Trump meets with policy makers to talk about prison sentences" does not make as many headlines as "Trump meets with Kim K."
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim isnt writing policy. Publicity and the public push for policies to be made by professionals (unfortunately they're fighting a bigger lobby funded by private prisons and led by fuckface Jeff Sessions).

       Would you disagree? All they did was set up the system. We're the suckers crashing with it? They literally printed and released documents about their plan and
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       the public just goes with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it's hopeless and the world is ending. Never does. But. You don't think passive manipulation was their end game? As long as we stay on their financial system and follow their morals. They win.

       During a emotional divorce his wife claimed he karate kicked her in the head. That's pretty crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a conservative speaker, writer, and film makers. I guess that is why you call him a liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was on probation for going over the allowed campaign contribution by about $5000 and accused of trying to set up strawman contribution to get $20k through.Which he claimed innocence.  All by the Obama admin who he criticized heavily.

        During the plea proceeding, D’SOUZA admitted before the Court that he caused two close associates to contribute $10,000 each to the Long Campaign with the understanding that he would reimburse them for their contributions and that he did reimburse them. D’SOUZA also admitted that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and something the law forbids.

       It was a plea agreement. By taking a plea deal you are by threat admitting guilt instead of going to trial where you could be railroaded and face decades in prison.

       If you read into the story more he contended through the whole thing that he was a victim of selective prosecution by the Obama admin.

       Even if it was "selective prosecution" They selectively prosecuted a guilty person.  A valid defense to a crime isn't to say "but the liberals do it too and they aren't all getting thrown in jail!"  Claiming selective prosecution is admitting that you broke the law but you don't think you should be charged because there are other people also breaking that law without being charged.  But "guilty guy plays the victim" is pretty funny.. what a cuck!

       He pled guilty to the strawman donations, hence why he needs a pardon.

       So are you going to claim anyone convicted under the Trump​ Administration, who criticise Trump, should be let off, even after pleading guilty?

       What is wrong with all the mindless Trump​ apologists? Does "No man above the Law" mean anything to you anymore? This guy knowingly broke the law and pled guilty to it.

       When the DOJ of the presidential administration you have been criticizing heavily goes after you you are kinda of just fucked and should take whatever lenient plea deal they offer so you don't get water boarded.

       So should we care when someone knowingly committed a crime or not? If they criticise Trump​ and get prosecuted by "his DOJ" then it must be Trump​ being corrupt? Conversely when "his DOJ" convict his campaign staff, no one can claim unfairness?

        the Abu Ghraib scandal, for example, was actually the fault of liberals because the soldiers who enacted the despicable acts, Lynddie England and Charles Graner, were divorced, sex-crazed partiers who were therefore “act[ing] out the fantasies of blue America.”

       Pretty rich coming from the man who got engaged and was allegedly sleeping with another woman while both were still married.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On May 20, 2014, the day the trial was to begin, D’Souza pleaded guilty to the illegal campaign contribution charge (taking the second charge off the table) and professed to take responsibility for his actions. The next few months would be critical, as the judge would be deliberating on the appropriate sentence. The moment called for humility. D’Souza enlisted 27 people—colleagues, friends, and family members in India—to write to the judge on his behalf. While they got busy attesting to his remorse, he began publicly conveying just the opposite. Brafman begged his client to keep his mouth shut, but D’Souza couldn’t resist.

       What a nice forthright guy. Especially when he asked the judge to suspend his sentence so he could go on tour promoting a movie first.

       The dude's campaign manager has been caught laundering money. His national security advisory been caught taking bribes from foreign governments in exchange for affecting our policies. His personal lawyer, and the RNC's deputy finance chair has been caught selling access to the president as without registering as a lobbyist.

       A team of lawyers could find process crimes and technicalities on any halfway prolific businessman. Its telling that the crimes Mueller has found have nothing to do with the Trump Campaign or Administration. To me it looks like they are trying to give the investigation legitimacy with these inconsequential crimes, and it seems to be working on some people.

       If that was something that actually happened then you might have a point. In my opinion, you should carefully consider the fact that you are being subjected to propaganda before you decide to believe unsubstantiated bullshit because it confirms your biases.

       There you go again, you just can't help yourself! As I said before, this is bullshit propaganda and you should be more skeptical of the sources you use for news, because they are manipulating the way you think.

        The new documents show Inovo wrote six-figure checks to Flynn's firm in September and October as he served as a top national security aide on Trump's campaign. The final payment of $145,000 came on Nov. 14, 2016, just days after Trump captured the presidency.

       No, I'm saying that Flynn was lobbying as a foreign agent, which is completely legal believe it or not. USA Today is trying to manipulate you into thinking that this is somehow unusual and potentially illegal, when its not. It looks like they succeeded.

       You could have just said that without linking the shady propaganda story. The truth is that he was covering his ass by registering as a foreign agent. He was actually lobbying for a Dutch firm but he was concerned that it could be construed as lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government through some tenuous connections. Probably a smart move on his part, since he has had a target on his back.

       As if Clooney’s humanitarian work is on par with that airhead’s ideas on prison reform. The man has actually worked towards his goals while this dumb bitch just found someone trashy enough to let her in the front door.

       Did you even read the article of why she met with him or are you just talking out of your ass? Maybe if you actually read the article, you would understand. How many people met with Obama and talked about their own concerns and agenda? Give me a break.

       It's a way to highlight more hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone can laugh that a whore Kardashain is talking to the President about legit issues this country has. "Why is
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       there?!" When a lot of the people who find it laughable are the same people who love how many celebrity friends Obama and the Clintons have. And they love to hear celebrities opinions on political and social issues.

       Who gives a shit if it's Kim k or anyone else, at least he's talking about prison reform which is a good thing.

       As if Clooney’s humanitarian work is on par with that airhead’s ideas on prison reform. The man has actually worked towards his goals while this dumb bitch just found someone trashy enough to let her in the front door.

       Yes, being selected by Trump to be the nation's national security advisor, then influencing president Trump based on bribes you took from foreign governments has nothing at all to do with the Trump presidency.
