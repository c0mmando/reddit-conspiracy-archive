      <p>
       Other than that, I wrote one comment in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       yesterday, perhaps my first contribution there in
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2018, the year
        <a href="/r/worldnews">

        surpassed

      <p>
       The deliciously ironic aspect of this is that they like to claim that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a "safe space" and yet shithole default subs like
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       are some of the safest spaces in the history of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decline of the front page of reddit is unprecendented and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       has fallen perhaps the hardest (after
       <a href="/r/politics">

       Well done for calling a spade a spade. It’s truly amazing to watch people that do nothing but bash conspiracy theorists, push a conspiracy theory so hard just because the “intelligence agencies” said so.

       From the looks of it, it seems like you might be the next target. I've seen enough posts/posters over the last couple weeks here attacking you specifically. Looking like you might be the next FT lol.

       Don't leave out r/politics. Well...all of reddit for that matter. They jump all over a "conspiracy theory" as long as it fits a particular mass media narrative, while simultaneously holding r/conspiracy in contempt. I think it's hilarious and pathetic at the same time.

       Maybe, but the mods there have at least treated me with respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few months ago, a user was obsessively spamming walls of text on several default subs that went on about how I'm a cambridge analytica plant etc. Not only did his ravings teeter between nonsensical and slanderous, but he was pinging me multiple times a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       He usually was downvoted for his efforts, but occasionally his posts would gain traction, so I opted to refrain from muting him so I could hop in to defend myself whenever he pinged me.
      </p>
      <p>
       One time a comment of his got over 100 points in
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       , and as it was demonstrably false and unhinged, I contacted the
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       mods about it, and was pleasantly surprised when they were not only civil, but they took care of the problem immediate. I really appreciated it.

       The next day a similar comment from the same user started receiving attention in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       . Optimistic after the treatment I had received at
       <a href="/r/news">

       , I brought the issue to their attention.

       You know the Trump appointed FBI director, current secretary of state/former Trump appointed Director of the CIA, and former Trump appointed secretary of state have all publicly said that undoubtedly Russia meddled in the US elections?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you also know that the US Intelligence community already concluded that as of Jan 2017 and now say undoubtedly that Russia was trying to swing the election in Trump's favor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not consider the Trump Tower meeting  of June 2016 with Russian representatives to not be highly suspicious, or the dozens of documented contacts Trump Campaign officials had with Russian officials and Russian oligarchs during the campaign?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it is normal for foreign nationals (Russians) to pay for and create political adds supporting then Candidate Trump and attacking his opponent and then distribute said adds across American social media?

       Idk I don't really pay attention to political soap opera. Im sure if they had proof the Russians actually did anything besides produce memes then trump would be impeached by now. Source on how the Russians helped Donald trump win the election? I mean, besides opinions and rumors, do you have a source with hard evidence showing how many votes the Russians were able to give trump? Has there even been an audit of the results of the election? Or are we still taking about the emails that were allegedly leaked by the Russians?

       So you're admitting that you're not informed on the topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Democrats have filed articles of impeachment but the Republican held Congress has not entertained either motion. Plus the Republican held Congress refuses to investigate or censure any of the scandals, violations and crimes committed by Trump since he's been in office
      </p>
      <p>
       Sources for Russian efforts include the thousands of political ads they crafted directly and indirectly supporting then Candidate Trump or attacking Hillary Clinton. Or just Google the public statements by Wray, Pompeo, Tillerson, Haley, Ross stating that Russia clearly meddled with the intentions of helping Trump.

      <p>
       So you think the US IC statements and reports, FBI reports, official statements from the Trump appointed Ambassador to the UN, Secretary of State, FBI DIRECTOR, CIA director is just rumors and opinions?
      </p>
      <p>
       And secondly no formal audit or investigation into the actual voting has occurred since the DHS has refused any such action. The delay in that lies on Trump and his administration not pursuing it.

       Let's see some political ads supporting trump over Hillary. Not to mention, didn't Hillary spend a record amount of money on her campaign? Including ads, memes, shills, etc.? Are you telling me that Hilary's ads weren't as good as the Russian ads? And, no I don't give a shit about whatever random person gives testimony because they haven't shown any evidence whatsoever that whatever the Russians did, if anything, had any influence on the outcome. Seriously bro, you shouldn't believe tre horse shit spewed by the us gov and it's mouthpiece the msm. Show me actual evidence proving trump won solely because Russian "interference" whatever the fuck that means. Not to mention, you didn't post a single link or source to prove anything you just said. Really, if enough people go on the news and give testimony you'll just believe it? Plenty of people have testimony about nukes in Iraq. Idk if this is your first rodeo, but governments lie, and they use bullshit testimony to back those lies up. So before just believing everything the news tells you, I would wait for sone actual evidence first.

       So what would convince you if you're unwilling to investigate the topic at all or even bother seeing what information is out there. You are explicitly saying that you have no desire in seeing information pertaining to this topic, nor the official opinions of groups involved in this topic. Equally if you don't trust the government at all I assume you are highly critical of the President too since he is the government in its current iteration?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you even bothering continuing this conversation if you have no desire to actually engage in meaningful discussion?

      <p>
       Please define MSM for me, because when you say government and media mouthpiece I interpret that as Fox News, ya now the massively popular "news" outlet that directly coordinates with President Trump and his administration, has hosts who talk to President Trump on a near daily basis and is the only news outlet the president religiously watches and livetweets too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling all of the other media outlets the mouthpiece of the government is absurd. Considering that Outlets like the Dailybeast, NYTimes, Wapo, BBC, Reuters, AP have all out numerous pieces not only critical of the government but exposing blatant abuses, corruption, violations, pay for play, etc under the Trump administration directly contradicts your "us gov and it's mouthpiece the msm" idea.

       How bout you show me evidence that disproves all of the reports and official conclusions made by the entire US IC. Show me evidence that would directly imply that Pompeo, Coates, and Wray all lied under oath about Russia's clear involvement in the us election. if your so sure of that Russia is simply a scapegoat provide evidence that contradicts dozens of US agencies, allied intelligence agencies, independent investigative outlets, verified news reports, direct admissions from involved actors, statements made under oath which leave said people responsible for making the statements susceptible to legal repercussions  if the statements were false or misleading. You must have a treasure trove of evidence that can refute the combined efforts of thousands of individually compiled and verified stories, reports, data collections, money trails, emails, exchanges that are all part of the very real Russia investigation?

       Well, considering that you've stated repeatedly that you don't know much/any of the information in pertaining to this topic, especially from the US Govt's side you really can't speak on lack of evidence since you haven't considered to evaluate any whats already out there.

       Whoa, hold on, I just saw an nyt article that totally convinced me that the Russians totally swayed the election with 13 twitter accounts, that's right, 13 entire twitter accounts!!!!! Here's a quote from the article
      </p>
      <p>
       "The indictment said that Facebook ads for the Florida rallies reached more than 59,000 users and were clicked on by more than 8,300."
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoa guys, 8,300 clicked on an ad. Holy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, there's more.... they also hosted, get this, an anti trump rally!!???!!?  What the what!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       "the group also organized anti-Trump rallies, including “Charlotte Against Trump” in Charlotte, N.C., and “Trump is NOT my President” in New York after the election"
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe the overwhelming evidence of "Russia meddling"? Don't take my word for it, The NY Times will sway your opinion I'm sure.

       I'm glad you found that article. While you may think it doesn't prove anything it actually does.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whoa, hold on, I just saw an nyt article that totally convinced me that the Russians totally swayed the election with 13 twitter accounts, that's right, 13 entire twitter accounts!!!!! Here's a quote from the article
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're wrong in this claim. The article reports that thirteen Russian Nationals were indicted. It never says they only used 13 twitter accounts. As the article goes on, it is clear that these thirteen individuals were utilizing far more than 13 twitter or social media accounts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The indictment said that Facebook ads for the Florida rallies reached more than 59,000 users and were clicked on by more than 8,300."
       </p>
       <p>
        Whoa guys, 8,300 clicked on an ad. Holy shit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those are just the clicks from for their Florida rallies. No information is disclosed about the success of their ads for their numerous rallies in other states. You might think 8300 clicks is meaningless, but in an election where the winner won thanks to 80,000 votes, while massively losing the popular vote, 8300 clicks for ads promoting Trump rallies and spreading lies and falsehoods against his political opponent is not nothing. And that is only the information from Florida. Those ads, created by foreign nationals and spreading misinformation about Hillary Clinton reached 59,000 users and were clicked on by over 8300. Analytically thats not bad at all for social media ad impressions. More than 10% of the number that allowed Trump to just win the election clicked on these ads in regards to this particular campaign in Florida. That isn't a smoking gun proving Trump gave Putin a reach around for help winning the election, but it does prove that Russian efforts to meddle in the election were received by American citizens.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But wait, there's more.... they also hosted, get this, an anti trump rally!!???!!? What the what!!!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you actually read it and look into it, it becomes clear that not all their proposed/supported rallies are the same. Their is a clear distinction between their rallies for Trump and their rallies against Trump/for Hillary. The rallies and ads for Trump are standard appeals to conservatives and right leaning moderates. Those talk about God/Jesus supporting Trump, echoing his talking points and framing them as inherent positives i.e. the PA miners one talks about how only Trump will save PA miners and PA from a looming depression. The ads play up Islamophobia, common attacks on Hillary, etc. Yet the ads and rallies for Hillary are explicitly polarizing and divisive for their intended audience (read conservatives and right leaning conservatives). Understand that these ads were targeted very specifically (implied to have received analytics information from Cambridge Analytica- although not substantiated yet). Not everyone would see ads for the Hillary "Save the American Muslims" rally, but you can bet that the analytics will show that those already being courted as potential trump voters did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally if you do more research you can find thousands more ads where it is clear that those payed for and created by Russia clearly market Hillary in a very polarizing light. Just like how the largest Black Lives Matter facebook page (before it was exposed and deleted) was created by Russia and served to be far more divisive, polarizing and extreme than actual real BLM pages, groups and ads. Even the barest of critical thinking exposes the tactics and patterns at play here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think on whats presented it becomes obvious that while the Russian's in this article did make rallies for both sides and ads for both sides, between the intended audience and difference in content it is clear that both Pro Trump and Anti Trump/Pro Hillary ads were made in the purpose of scaring off people from Hillary to Trump. Again, I expect you to use some critical thinking when assessing these things.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "the group also organized anti-Trump rallies, including “Charlotte Against Trump” in Charlotte, N.C., and “Trump is NOT my President” in New York after the election"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You act as though those rallies don't have a purpose but let me put it to you like this. How many violent incidents and deaths has "ANTIFA" caused since the 2016 election? You can probably name a few scuffles, we all know about the bike chain thing, and the punching Richard Spencer, but other than that there hasn't really been as many as people on here and in other social media platforms purport to be. Outside of the fact the "ANTIFA" is very much a boogey man term since it some how groups many different groups that have similar interests (protesting a rise in fascism in the US) into one monolithic group, the Alt-Right and Trump supporters have instigated, perpetuated far more violent incidents and have killed more people than the "ANTIFA"- "ALT-Left" boogey men have. Yet there is a lot of ongoing discussion by Trump supporters, political ads, pundits, etc still equating the monolithic "ANTIFA" with the Alt-Right, yet statistically we can see that the Alt-Right far surpasses the other side in violent incidents, deaths caused by members.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said you you really think its impossible for these indicted Russians to have used that idea and promote rallies that from the outset seem radical and bait for spreading more violent and unruly "ANTIFA- ALT-Left" narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep on trying to poke holes in everything, but it seems like you make no efforts to fairly evaluate anything presented. At no point do you try to look at things from a different perspective. If you are going to apply critical thinking to dismissing the Russia topic, you really should employ critical thinking to try to understand the Russia topic too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But please keep finding articles and research and I'll keep breaking it down for you.

       How? You haven't successfully refuted any of my arguments. You keep on personally attacking me, and I'm just trying to engage in good faith based discussion. You don't need to keep responding to me, but like I said I'm happy to engage in discussion with anyone. If you don't have anything of substance to say though, I'd recommend you move on and not waste time on something that is clearly making you upset.

       Because you live in a fantasy world where 13 twitter accounts can actually change the minds of millions of people with ridiculous memes. You're fuckibg looney and just can't get over the fact Hillary lost. If you think 13 Russians on twitter can have greater influence than Hillary's online army of trolls and msm puppets. Shareblue, media matters, ctr, not to mention all the stooges in the msm constantly kissing her ass and calling any criticism sexist. Hillary had the entire media apparatus supporting her, but apparently 13 Russian twitter accounts thwarted all that. If you believe that you fucking nuts

       Nowhere in the article you posted did it state the Russians featured in said article and under indictment only operated 13 twitter accounts. Additionally that article only tackles a single group of actors and one facet of this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's undeniable that the wikileaks involvement with leaking of Clinton's emails along with Comey's letter also had significant effects on the election. You seem to be limiting the scope of the topic to one single facet of it when it is far larger. Current discourse also posits that Cambridge Analytica may have (probably) shared it's incredible data (Cambridge Analytica really did an incredible job when it came to it's data collection operation. As someone surprisingly familiar ad analytics, what CA did is like the gold standard. Completely inappropriate, unethical in the ways it was used, collected etc, but wow was it done well) with Russian actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you are going to go with this old bit:

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       At least provide some sources backing it up. The claims of Shareblue, CTR extreme efforts and astroturfing have long been highly exaggerated without any evidence. Also independent reports showed then Candidate Donald Trump received far more media coverage from all outlets than Clinton did, to the tune of billions of dollars worth of air/coverage time than Clinton did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also claiming she had the whole media apparatus supporting her is flat out wrong. She also had constant critical coverage of her by the vast majority of media outlets, mainly pertaining to her emails. You keep on stating opinions without sources.

       Nowhere in that article you posted did it say there were only 13 Russian twitter accounts, and as stated that article only focused on the efforts of 13 Russian nationals who were indicted for their actions. You haven't provided any evidence or sources showing that it was only those 13 Russian Nationals involved in the Russia Election Meddling issue. Additionally there is not reason for you to constrain yourself to that idea anyways.

      <p>
       I'm not fuckibg looney, and that is an uncalled for personal attack. I also I am over it. I was over it on the morning after the election. I literally woke up that morning checked my phone saw Trump won and my first thought was "the Russians did some shit", but then I dismissed that idea as being straight up crazy conspiracy. My second thought was "I hope he just does good for nation." I was willing to give him a chance even though I think he is a detestable person, a liar, a fraud, a terrible businessman, bad all around human being, excessively creepy, narcissistic, sexist,, vulgar, simple minded cretin. It only turned out that he began peddling lies and bad ideas for America within the first 2 days of being in office that I realized he won't be good for the nation. Even now he has began a trade war with absurd tariffs on our closest trade partners and allies, and for what reason? if he came out today and did an about face and actually dedicated to fixing America, removing his unqualified and veritably corrupt cabinet members and advisers (Ivanka and Jared included), cut back on spewing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, excessive gloating and credit taking for things he hasn't done, denigrating other figures for petty reasons, the constant international political blunders, began actually imposing the veto proof sanctions on Russia that were passed long ago by now, stopped lying about everything (especially the unimportant stuff, it's like why even lie about it, people wouldn't have cared as much if you were honest as opposed to lying), divested himself of his business and actually set about dealing with domestic and policy problems that need to be addressed like the opioid  crisis, education issues, etc I'd be ecstatic. Granted I'd still want all of his scandals to be investigated fully and fairly. I don't play team politics. I am registered democrat because I agree with those policies and views and ideas, but I think all politicians regardless of party must always be held accountable and fairly criticized. If a republican was out there who had views and platforms I agreed with and was dedicated to being an honest and transparent politician, I wouldn't hesitate to approve of that either.

I'm still willing to discuss the topic in good faith, but I won't stand for any more personal attacks from you because I don't respond immediately. I can't reddit when I'm asleep.

       Having a different opinion than yours doesn't make me a worse person, or guilty of shoveling a "bullshit MSM narrative down people's throat". I haven't run away from anything, let alone any of your responses or personal attacks against me. I actually keep on encouraging you to engage with me in honest and open debate utilizing evidence and critical thinking. Even now, if you want to I'll continue to engage your arguments/responses and ideas from my informed position.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if this exchange is making you upset you can just ignore it and move on. I'm not trying to upset you, but I am responding to all of your comments in good faith. I haven't resorted to insulting or personally attacking you and I never will. You have no obligation to continue any discussion with me so if you don't want to continue this that's fine and I'll respect that. If this exchange is making upset there's nothing wrong with leaving it and coming back to it later. Or if you can refrain from personally attacking me and want to provide more of your ideas and positions on the topic I'd be happy to continue engaging them. Heck, even if you do continue to insult, but continue to share your ideas too, I'd be willing to discuss those.

       From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the original sense, public officials stating there is meddling is a meme. It's not conclusive proof of anything, just words spoken by an official and
       <em>
        repeated
       </em>
       by others.

       That is the definition of meme alright.
      </p>
      <p>
       However labeling what I wrote "memes" in no way addresses the fact that all statements I was referring to were made in an official capacity, with one of them made while under oath at congress. Thus Pompeo's statement is not just words spoken by an official, but an official statement (based on reports compiled by the FBI, CIA, other US intelligence agencies, investigation) made under oath, subject to legal scrutiny and punishment if false or misleading and official record in congressional proceedings. Calling Pompeo's statement a meme with the connotation that it is not conclusive proof seems incorrect doesn't it.

       Calling it a "verified thing" is more incorrect, unless the verified thing is that yes, they did in fact say these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the United States, facts are determined by courts, not by individual public officials, even if those public officials are speaking under oath or in their official capacity.

       So in your understanding, nothing said by government officials in an official capacity, said by the government itself, or said under oath before congress carry no merit unless it happens to be verified in court?
      </p>
      <p>
       So all the information uncovered, independently verified by journalists, compiled by FBI, CIA, admitted to by actors involved can't be considered fact regardless of outside verification if it isn't determined in court?
      </p>
      <p>
       By that same metric reducing Pompeo's statement because it wasnt determined by court fails to understand that as far as congressional records go this is an operating idea now linked to the Head of the State Dept., made with provisions that if misleading or false would merit Pompeo be susceptible to legal reprecussions, simultaneously granting said statement full credit that it not only was it made with the backing of the State department, but in a legal setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while not determined by a court, Pompeo's statement has far more weight than officials repeating unproven things. If the statement made in an official capacity and carrying legal weight is considered to be no different than comments made not under legal scrutiny, then what is the point of speaking under oath?

       I've appealed the ban already, and yes I agree, there are some legit folks on the mod team.

      <p>
       The reason given was very immature as well, "Brigading is against the site-wide rules. Grow up."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the "brigade" they're referring to was a
       <em>
        self post
       </em>
       on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       with
       <em>
        one link
       </em>
       that even used "np" (no participation). Not only that, but I gave 0 calls to participate in that thread. In addition, my "offending" thread only managed to net about 40 points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with TMOR's carte blanche with their constant brigading of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and the fact that there's an overlap between TMOR and worldnews mods, and boys I think we've got ourselves a bona fide reddit conspiracy!

       No, that's not necessary, though as we are in a

       I'll say that it's hilarious watching Axolotl complain about being banned when he bans people just for disagreeing with him (and personally had a comment deleted for allegedly breaking a rule in the "no meta" joke of a thread) with my 3 year old account that has numerous comments in this sub then.

       As someone with a history here, and doesn't particularly always like the actions of the mods, you are one of few that I agree with most in regards to what is going on. I won't complain to you about the downfalls of the caste system, it does no good. idk who to trust around here, I try to fly under the radar, but the opinions you voice coincide with my own interpretations... Which is why these "users," Imo, have such distaste for you.

       I don't track specific examples or care to try digging back through. My problem is that you appear to capriciously ban people who disagree with you or offer reasonable criticism. I suspect I'd be banned right now if you didn't feel like this was under a microscope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other issue I have is that you, and other mods here, seem perfectly fine with political content in this sub as long as it pushes the right agenda, and even if there is no clear connection to any kind of conspiracy theory. You even post that type of stuff yourself:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8m1vvx/north_korea_comes_crawling_back_stresses/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8m1vvx/north_korea_comes_crawling_back_stresses/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You're curating the subreddit towards a specific political agenda by ignoring the purpose of the subreddit to favor these kinds of posts.

       In context you can see my comment was replying to someone else calling me a shill and all I did was spin it back on them. I didn't even call them anything!

       I literally got an official mod warning for saying "reported" to someone who went around talking shit to people for months without the mods doing anything cause the user was going after people who weren't following the "(((deepdish pizzagate)))" narrative. One of many users that shows if you are saying what they mods want you to say here you can stay while others get banned for wrong speak in a forum for "free thinking and discussing issues".

       and how he was. Only took months and months and months for him to get banned. On any of his submissions you could click the "other discussion" tab and see it was a direct xpost from TD within the last hour.

       But none of those reasons were for the ban. The ban was cause of "yay! contest mode" in a topic he submitted. Was put into contest mode about 3 hours after it was submitted and the comments/voting weren't going the way he wanted
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 2 years of commenting in r/conspiracy and I get banned for "yay contest mode" with the reason being a troll. Either it took the mods over 2 years to figure out I was a troll or the ban was in reaction to the mod being butthurt his submission wasn't getting the attention he wanted.

       So you can can unban the account if you want. I'm only responding cause you wanted an example. This account wasn't made cause of the ban and I have never used this account to comment in this sub before. So before you get all ban happy again and ban this for "avoiding a ban", just realize you asked for an example and the only way you are going to get one is if someone who was banned by you speaks up on another account. You know people aren't going to keep tabs of others bans and figure out why you might have banned them. So your request was pretty fucking safe. Too bad I still read this sub (while not commenting) and happened to see this comment of yours.

       Of course not. If you weren't in a ban happy spree that day that account wouldn't have been banned and you know it, but wont admit it. Anyone that made a comment that day you didn't like, their account was looked at for any stupid excuse to ban them.

       Serious question, why do you bother with the mockingbird propaganda subs? I look at them the same way I look at facebook... just not worth my time and energy. There are more positive places to engage. I understand maybe taking a peek to see what the neo-con narrative is, but I don't get
       <em>
        responding
       </em>
       . To what end? You know you're not changing any hearts and minds, so why bother? (I don't mean to be discouraging, but rather to point out the entrenched opinions are just that.)

       I consider neo-con to be the "new conservative" originating in the 1950's, with prominence into the early 2000's. They are supposedly socially conservative, but fiscally not-that-conservative (like Bush's bailouts of auto and finance, or the incesent wars). Fox News would probably encompass the neo-conservative narrative.

       Since the Democrats have moved so far to the right in terms of supporting American corporate imperialism abroad and near literal fascism at home, I would lump them right in with the group you're describing and call them all neo-cons. That most of the population still differentiate themselves into left and right media consumers is a convenient distraction that only serves the economic elite by creating a separation illusion. Mainstream media is a tool of the neo-cons.  Departures of opinion on social issues between left and right are few and minor, distorted and amplified by the media. Neo-cons aren't interested in de-escalating the growth of government, but rather look to the government for solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who's not a neo-con, then? People who identify with the Greens, Libertarians, Anarchists, and probably most independents. I'm not sure about Berniecrats. I think you could make a case either way for them.

       Fair enough. Are you familiar with the horseshoe model of the political spectrum? As you move to the extreme left or right (favoring government or unrestricted corporatism, respectively) the result is essentially the same - an oppressive ruling class with dangerously high inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that reason I think Berniecrats could probably be lumped in with your definition of neocon. However good their intentions, the result is more government intervention in one's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I hate lumping everyone under the term neo-con, since they don't share any conservative values with each other.

       Horseshoe model supposes only one axis, the economic one, bent into a hoseshoe shape...I don't think that agrees with reality. I think the addition of the authoritarian v libertarian y axis is fundamental to sorting out political ideology. Though I will concede that the outcome

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       looks the same when you apply far left or right, since we've had the needle pegged on authoritarian since the early 1970s. It is this lack of ability to imagine any options other than authoritarian ones that have led us to the Berniecrats... I think if they could conceive of a different option than government-run healthcare, they would flock to it. Ditto higher education.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're absolutely correct in your final point. When everyone's a "neo-con", the label becomes useless. I actually hesitated to use that term, but did it anyway because I knew OP's political viewpoint would provide the necessary frame to interpret "neo-con" in the way I meant it. I do think there should be a more accurate phrase for the political persuasion we're talking about, because it's easily confused with the more traditional definition you cited earlier.

       Sometimes I feel compelled to participate in those subs, particularly when other users ping me, and
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       when they attack me. Also, these subs have a habit of mocking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , so this whole episode is centered around the hypocrisy of how they've all become conspiracy-themed themselves in recent times.

       I bet a lot of people you banned here have asked the same question "what rule did I break?" and you then muted/blocked them instead of discussing it or unbanning them cause the ban wasn't apart of this subs rules. Anyone who has been on this sub and seen your power trips and blowups every few months knows this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, your the mod of this sub, not any other that you complain about. What they do is totally up to them and them doing something you don't like, well, nothing you can do about it. The amount of complaining you do about other subs is pretty ridiculous. You're always looking for a boogieman.

       Sometimes I feel compelled to participate in those subs, particularly when other users ping me, and
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       when they attack me. Also, these subs have a habit of mocking
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , so this whole episode is centered around the hypocrisy of how they've all become conspiracy-themed themselves in recent times.

       why did r/politics resort to a white list?

       I don't track specific examples or care to try digging back through. My problem is that you appear to capriciously ban people who disagree with you or offer reasonable criticism. I suspect I'd be banned right now if you didn't feel like this was under a microscope.

      <p>
       The other issue I have is that you, and other mods here, seem perfectly fine with political content in this sub as long as it pushes the right agenda, and even if there is no clear connection to any kind of conspiracy theory. You even post that type of stuff yourself:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You're curating the subreddit towards a specific political agenda by ignoring the purpose of the subreddit to favor these kinds of posts.

       You banned me on a different account for posting a conspiracy about Donald Trump, which isn't against the rules. So how about that? Your response was literally "we don't want Trump obsessives in here".

       So you're admitting that you're not informed on the topic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Democrats have filed articles of impeachment but the Republican held Congress has not entertained either motion. Plus the Republican held Congress refuses to investigate or censure any of the scandals, violations and crimes committed by Trump since he's been in office
      </p>
      <p>
       Sources for Russian efforts include the thousands of political ads they crafted directly and indirectly supporting then Candidate Trump or attacking Hillary Clinton. Or just Google the public statements by Wray, Pompeo, Tillerson, Haley, Ross stating that Russia clearly meddled with the intentions of helping Trump.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        mean, besides opinions and rumors, do you have a source with hard evidence showing how many votes the Russians were able to give trump? Has there even been an audit of the results of the election? Or are we still taking about the emails that were allegedly leaked by the Russians
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you think the US IC statements and reports, FBI reports, official statements from the Trump appointed Ambassador to the UN, Secretary of State, FBI DIRECTOR, CIA director is just rumors and opinions?
      </p>
      <p>
       And secondly no formal audit or investigation into the actual voting has occurred since the DHS has refused any such action. The delay in that lies on Trump and his administration not pursuing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       **But big take away here is that you dismiss all the discussion and evidence into this topic, even though you admit you
