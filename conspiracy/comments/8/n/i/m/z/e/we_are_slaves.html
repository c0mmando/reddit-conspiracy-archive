    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it interesting how what we perceive to be our nature becomes our nature?</p>

<p>We are selfish and selfless. Neither is exclusively our true nature.</p>

<p>Selfishness is emphasized by those who embrace it as a way of life, because it makes them feel more comfortable with choices they&#39;ve already made. We seek to justify what we choose to do.</p>

<p>Actually, social animals developed better memory and brains to remember who is who and what they did. This evolution allows group members to practice giving behaviors with each other. The inevitable moochers are dealt with by memory and social punishment. If they don&#39;t reciprocate, they don&#39;t get services from others in the group. Humans are the best example of this evolution available.</p>

<p>Social animals evolved reciprocity on top of selfishness. Selfishness is expected to be accepted in some cases, but natural social tendencies have us punish those who harm the group or members within the group too much with it.</p>

<p>The perspective people project into others is a window into their mind, into how they see the world 8n relation to themselves. That&#39;s why some say that we are selfish and some say we are giving. It&#39;s sort of like a mirror of self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but I believe that both selfishness and a giving nature are sparingly used within and without a certain group of people.</p>

<p>You could find a group of people calling for death and bloodshed to another group that is different from them, while simultaneously generous with the fellows in their group.</p>

<p>I would label this (for lack of a better term) as a grey area, and most certainly a complex facet of human nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked into this and found something that few others speak about.</p>

<p>Our empathy is enabled and disabled by our ability to connect our sense of personal identity to another.</p>

<p>So, as you said, a group can be kind to their own, but evil to others. This is why. Their group is human like they are. The other group is less human, less connected to ones sense of personal identity. So, empathy is disabled to some degree.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not gray to me. It&#39;s just another piece of the puzzle of our behavior I&#39;ve examined.</p>

<p>What I wonder about is if some psychopaths are created by disassociation of personal identity from the rest of humanity. </p>

<p>People use brain scans to show areas of the brain that light up for different tasks, but the correlation is not causation fallacy is so easy for the mind to fall into. If you choose to not use your mind the way that is expected, it won&#39;t light up and they will conclude your brain isn&#39;t work the way it should. Yet, the problem can be changed simply by having a new belief, which allows for new thought, feeling and action.</p>

<p>So, when we scan those who have shut down empathy, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary caused by a physical problem nor is incurable. In many cases it probably is that way, but I think some psychopaths are created by life experiences rather than brain injury or genetics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much like the Japanese WWII Unit 731 (and to a degree, the Nazi doctors of concentration camps), the doctors who would preform abhorrent experiments on humans were desensitized by experimenting on animals for years beforehand, oftentimes without anesthesia. One could agree with the notion that a lack of empathy comes from different experiences which do not reward the areas of the brain associated with empathy.</p>

<p>Is this something that is systematic in cultures today? Like you&#39;ve stated, a lack of empathy often arises from a lack of connection, much how many will despise immigrants from foreign lands because they do not see any similarities in them. I&#39;m not sure there is a concrete answer to my aforementioned question. However, one concept that stands out to me (which is almost never thought about, let alone discussed in a more political and influential medium) is the fact that all humans have one thing in common: death. We all share a bond in our mortality, and while this would connect us in theory, it never quite seems to make even the slightest dent in our perceptions of others that are different.</p>

<p>I think college is an academically enforced caste system, it elevates the few yes, but  it&#39;s used as an excuse to pay the majority less. </p>

<p>Compare jobs and job duties and pay side by side. People watching people work make more than the people working</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this gets thrown around a lot, but John Gatto&#39;s <em>Dumbing Us Down</em> really opened my eyes to the tragedy that is America&#39;s education system. It is worth the read. </p>

<p>From my own personal experience, I went from kindergarten through senior year of high school believing I was dumb. Mainly due to how my teachers viewed me and how my peers responded to me. I swore off education and college from high school graduation until about my mid-twenties. That time frame was spent &quot;taking my lumps&quot; as I call it. I worked dead end factory jobs and spent my off days at the public library. I always had an interest in reading but was told throughout my school years that reading was &quot;a hobby&quot;. </p>

<p>College absolutely starts at square one, but if I ever had kids, I think I could do a much better job preparing them for higher education than a high school could. Knowledge is about experience, discovery, and practicality. Geometry and physics never made sense to me until I started playing billiards for money. Grammar and syntax seemed like tedious rules to be forgotten until I started reading poetry. Science and biology was just a bunch of terms until I started taking an interest in growing a garden. </p>

<p>I feel like a child&#39;s mind would be much more receptive to engaged learning activities as opposed to sitting behind a desk and being told to focus on math until the lunch bell rings. </p>

<p>Exactly this. It destroys the child&#39;s natural curiosity and will to learn because they made it so tortuous. Nevermind that they don&#39;t teach kids to think as much as repeat/appeal to authority.</p>

So I say, okay, no problem, let me run up to the city hall and get one. About 80% of the cities that I go to, give me the run-around, or just straight out tell me they do not sell permits for this type of thing.

<p>Cops don&#39;t become cops because they see the law as a stable platform for people to build lives on.  Cops become cops to use the law as a means to power.  Segregation, slavery, Prohibition, the Drug War and so on, couldn&#39;t have happened without cops.  Police are a greater threat to most people in the US than terrorists or gangs.  Errr, non-LEO gangs.  Police powers are to harass, intimidate, cite, detain and kill.  Those aren&#39;t positive qualities.  Those aren&#39;t priorities for people who desire to build things.  </p>

<p>Its tragically comic when people on the right go on and on about supporting the police and Blue Lives Matter, etc.  Who do they think is going to come for their guns?</p>

<p>Through meditation, self-observation, and other pursuits, I became free in mind. Me and my experience became one. I entered a creative orientation. From that moment on I&#39;ve been creating my life in a very conscious way.  I don&#39;t buy into the Ted Kaczynski manifesto. Life is what you make it. It&#39;s been a creative adventure filled with love, sorrows, joys, successes, failures, sex, spontaneity, and the buildings of several bodies of work in different artistic mediums. </p>

<p>You get what you focus on. There&#39;s no other rule when it comes to experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever notice in the moment of deep focus on a task, whether it be trying to solve a puzzle or a creative activity, that there is no self to be at peace with? The self I believed I was was a phantom, an illusion of thought, a story. Once I saw that, everything got much better.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re not at peace with yourself...that doesn&#39;t make you a slave. It just means you&#39;re focusing on the wrong thing--in a mental loop. That doesn&#39;t mean that at this very moment you can&#39;t have an idea and then act to make it real. Doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t do something kind for someone. Doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t start to build a body of work in some medium. Doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have fun.</p>

<p>There is an element of surprise to life. It&#39;s spontaneous. I can&#39;t control your actions, nature, the movement of the planets. But there&#39;s a lot I can control. A lot I can make happen through action. I&#39;m not a slave, you&#39;re not a slave. It&#39;s insult to actual slaves to consider us to be one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, everybody already thinks this. The only difference is who you blame for setting up the system of slavery. Is it the government, who is the direct administrator of the systems which control most aspects our lives, or is it the institutions and people who accumulate and concentrate wealth in order to set up or control that government? As me and a conservative friend of mine often agree in saying, the enemy is the same, and everything else is mostly aesthetics.</p>

<p>The way I see it, modern complexities are what enslave us. Currency frees us from bartering and having to all directly perform physical labor to produce services or goods, but enables clever people to manipulate economies more easily. Clocks and calendars free us from looking to the sun or tracking the passage of time ourselves, but enables a rigid system of &quot;be there by then or else.&quot; The internet frees us from having to travel or talk to manually gather information, but also enables the mass manipulation of that information.</p>

<p>Humans mostly organize themselves in these ways for convenience. You could argue that these types of things have been put in place deliberately by people that want to control us, but it is my belief that we would end up with these things existing in virtually any type of society or set of circumstances. Because we enjoy the byproducts of a more specialized, technologically advanced, and convenient world, these things won&#39;t go away. Because wealth naturally concentrates and power naturally corrupts, the influencers of these systems won&#39;t go away, either. </p>

<p>The users of these systems will <em>always</em> be struggling against the influencers. There is no way to destroy the system that wouldn&#39;t involve reverting to a non-industrial society. That means the only real way to improve things is to become an influencer yourself. Railing against the system as a whole is meaningless. Focus on specifics, converse with others, sharpen your wits, keep your bullshit detectors on, and try to be a positive force for change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an easy misinterpretation of what I&#39;m saying.  I&#39;m not saying people don&#39;t game or cheat.  In fact I think most at the billionaire level are cheaters and &quot;joiners&quot; into different societies that help each other at the expense of the rest.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is more fundamental.  Someone somewhere had better be productive or we won&#39;t have our modern lifestyles.  The more of us that are productive the more goods and services we all have as a society.  Obviously there are limits to this.  But if we cut the workweek to 20 hours per week and people are not allowed to work even 21, we would have more expensive products and services (more demand but less supply).  So there has to be a balance, and productivity is the fundamental wealth creator.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we are and the money system is the biggest cause. It&#39;s designed to keep us paying off debt. Only the principal portion of new loans is created with the loans, not the interest. So, there is always insufficient money for humanity as a whole to get out of debt. The illusion of freedom is supported by the fact that any individual can rise out of deby if they compete well enough against others in the economy. Someone will always have to be indebted in order to keep the system going though. We have to think in unity, as a whole unit, to see this scam for what it is. It could be changed in so many ways, but it is designed to siphon value to the money creators as it stands now.</p>

<p>I think they don&#39;t want us to get our heads outside of the fiat money rat race they engineered for us. By chasing that interest money as a collective, we work way more than we need for the goods and services we require. That way we don&#39;t have time for the best things in life that are free, well , that require time rather than money.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve been working part time at a factory for years, about 16-30 hours per week. It&#39;s not responsible insurance and retirement wise, but it offers benefits. I have time to think, to explore and expand my mind. It has lead down the rabbit hole quite a bit. I strongly suspect this is the biggest reason why we can&#39;t work less and have more time.</p>

<p>Sure, having a decent national healthcare system and basic retirement factored into the tax system would free us from the need for 40+ hours per week as a standard. Companies are pressured by the monthly employee expense to work each employee more hours to offset that cost. Even paying overtime can be cheaper than hiring another employee. </p>

<p>My workplace doesn&#39;t have full time positions, it has part time and overtime positions. It makes sense for many businesses to do this, because of employee benefits.</p>

<p>I doubt I would have as clear of a picture of our enslavement if I had worked (full/over)time positions. I would lack the time and energy to focus on such ideas. I can see this clearly in hindsight. My curiosity really took off after I went part time more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>Foe those who want to tell me how irresponsible I am, I ask you what stupid prze will you win when you finally get to stop working 40+ hours per week as a 65+ elderly person? What freedom of experience will you have with an old mind, body and spirit (emotional drive to animate oneself)?</p>

<p>I suggest living the best years of your life not chasing money is more fulfilling. Granted, that I don&#39;t have a family allows me to do this. If you do, you&#39;re probably stuck with the need for those benefits and larger incomes. It&#39;s a hard trap to overcome in that situation.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are better off being free.</p>

<p>No shit, that&#39;s the point. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s an obvious predilection for those who have had a family whether they would still want one or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just happened that way for me. I actually long for a family at times. It&#39;s good for many kinds of health and bad for many kinds of health. Having kids can make people more giving and less selfish. That behavior change, in an of itself, is a very healthy thing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just that, from my perspective of not having my own nuclear family, I can see clearly that having one means an end to occupational and time freedom. Benefits aren&#39;t just for me anymore and we&#39;d need the income for so many things for the kids.</p>

<p>So I am happy to be free, but would love to find the mate for me. I know we can&#39;t all do what I am doing. You have to be single.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very much so. But I don&#39;t think we are slaves in the material sense. Yes wageslavery is real, yes debt-slavery is real but it&#39;s still everyones choice wether they want to enslave themselves through vapid consumerism and insatiable greed. Nobody is forcing us (yet!) to work 60 hour weeks in order to mantain a shallow flashy lifestyle.</p>

<p>I have a very easy time making a humble living running an online business from home. If I worked hard I could make a good middle class income no doubt. But I&#39;d much rather work one day a week and have all the time in the world for the good things in life while driving a used Mazda instead of a new Audi sedan. </p>

<p>The real slavery is of the spirit and soul. Atrocity propaganda, the media injecting garbage into our minds, the school system making us dumb, docile parrots, tv talkshows with dumbed down lies and scripted debates, jewish critical theory making us hostile towards one another and radically individualist, yet at the same time collectivising and agitating, pitting young vs old, man vs woman, middle vs lower class, black vs white, everyone vs white, muslim vs christian, left vs right. As &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; we&#39;re ahead of most in having broken these chains.</p>
