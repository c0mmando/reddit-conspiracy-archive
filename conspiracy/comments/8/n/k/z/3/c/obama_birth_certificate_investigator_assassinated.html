       Does any one else find it weird that the the only person to die in the plane crash was the health director responsible for verifying Barry's birth certificate? Does anyone else find it weirder that there were divers clearly visible in the water who pulled her under water?

       Look at 2:21. Also try to find an unedited version of the clip.

       Can you screen shot what you are talking about and label the divers and the person you say they are pushing under? I watched the ad for the GoPro (aka the crash footage) and did not see it.  A bit messed up that the description of the video says everyone survived, then the commentator says someone died.

       The full Clip has shows the diver pulling Fuddy under, I am searching for it now. This clip shows the divers circling and has edited out the more visible parts of the diver. Pause the video at 2:21. The diver shows up

       She probably had a heart attack when she saw the divers already in position and she had the sudden epiphany that her being alive was a huge liability to the official story of the birth certificate.

       Well done, amigo. Im glad to see that this site still has some who are capable of investigation and developing intellectual thought on their own without fear of being shamed. I like you.  As a reward, I shall present you with some other thought provoking research that is all cited and sourced:

       I think that there are more than people let on. They just get down voted and face shaming tactics based in arguments from pathos rather than logos. The tide is turning and reddit is doing its best to stymie it, but we are starting to win  the overall culture war. Too many people are waking up the propaganda. The internet can be a beautiful tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep the faith and stay the course, brother. The Truth always has a way of surfacing (like those divers).

       2:21 in the first video. They are in black wetsuits, you can see one surface and move towards Fuddy. The later links break the whole thing down. It's awful funny how calm everybody was in the crash and how everyone made it out of the plane. Then, as they're all wading in the water, they just let her her slip  into the water? Its laughable.

       That doesn't actually look like a diver unless you want it to.  I don't think the chances are very good that a person showed up in a diving suit without having someone call it out on camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't this be one of the peoples legs as they kick in the water or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just me, but I thought it was hugely strange that this person died out of all the people in that crash but calling out an unidentified shape in the water as if a diver somehow got there or was waiting in the exact spot they landed is quite the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone yelled out "WTF!  Hey, there is a diver here!  Hey man, what's up, can you help?", that might help a little bit with the claim.  Instead, no one catches this diver or even screams before they notice its a person and not a friggin' shark or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, I'm no expert.  I don't know what that is.  It seems like a strange shape but that itself doesn't mean my brain can jump to the diver conclusion and support it.

       Im sorry bout that is undeniably a diver surfacing.  Please watch the following two videos which provide a more in depth break down of the dives involved.  I'm push back on the leg hypothesis by stating its a round head covered in a black hoodie/wet suit thing with a respirator on his back. I ask that you watch the two videos below that provide a more in depth break down of what I am proposing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider how controlled the landing was and how no one yelled or seem stressed out by the situation at all. They all knew exactly how to get off the plane in an orderly fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would yell out if they were unaware of divers. That is a very astute observation . Then one would have to ask well, who else was on the flight, are they gov't employees, could they by in on it, why was the military conducting drills right around the crash site,  or why did not one grab her as they saw her slip under as they were all calm, near shore and had flotation materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are navy Frog Man. Look at the equipment they use vs what ended up showing up on scene.

       That video did it for me.  That was all I needed.

       The black parts surfacing are that persons legs as they kick.  That person is lying on their back facing the sky and the neon yellow parts are on the bottom of their shoes.

       Thanks for that.  I don't see any navy frogmen and now I definitely do not.

       Thanks for your time though, this is one conspiracy I can't get behind.

       You can attempt to gaslight people here but its very clearly a diver arriving on scene. You can only push the false narrative so long. You know that the "hit" is actually being investigated as we speak so the truth is going to surface.

       Your absolutely right you can clearly see those are legs from a kicking motion, not a diver

       There is absolutely a diver! It took me a while to see where but once I did there was no mistaking him.

       Whydoes it say all passengers were safe? I did see what looked like a diver though.

       They were all safe, but Lorretta drifted off after the safety and died. This "drifting" was helped along by two divers. I saw the full clip last week and have been searching for it since. Even by the clips provided for by the news, there are clear shorts of a driver surfacing in the area of Fuddy.  This is real. This is an was a political assassination  conducted by frog men in order to take out the the one lady who inspected his birth cert. Did it really feel likg they were crashing or conducting a controlled landing into the ocean.
