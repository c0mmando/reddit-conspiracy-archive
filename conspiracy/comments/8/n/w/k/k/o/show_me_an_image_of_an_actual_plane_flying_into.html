       Many cameras were pointing directly at it...but not a single clip released?  Meanwhile there are tons of videos showing planes slamming into the twin towers, first and second...so why the obvious discrepancy?

       well, if this is true, it completely flips upside down the entire story of 9/11, and would undoubtedly prove there is a massive global conspiracy going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       the endless media reports talking about a plane smashing into the pentagon, all the animations describing what officials reported.  everyone on the planet has an image in their head of a plane crash, even myself when i think about what happened that day i imagine a plane flying down into it...
      </p>
      <p>
       if that never actually happened, well...it makes this situation a lot scarier than some fuckin brain-dead terrorists...

       yeah it looks like it could be faked when compared to the explosion on the released footage.  problem here is that we have just a few frames of reference with no visible plane so disinfo is really easy when there is nothing released.  this is why a single image of the plane would be huge in regards to 9/11 conspiracies.

       Everyone and everything, vaporizing at multiple sites. Any rational person realizes there are too many abnormal occurrences in 9/11. It's taking a long time for the fear of being labeled a conspiracy theorist to wear off.

       Yes, and with a bunker buster charge. Instead of huge blast at impact it penetrates and makes it look like a plane might have gone through there.

       Its common knowledge in the conspiracy community that it was a missile. There are multiple eyewitnesses searing and hearing the object of a missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the most important thing is WTC7 and why it fell. The media is only talking about the twin towers and pentagon. Never about building 7. Isnt that funny? Its almost like someone wrote a script to all the big medias and have them never mention it. For me it all starts with WTC7 being the big smoking gun.

       I wouldn't say that is true.

       If one researches the events surrounding the Pentagon, the available evidence clearly shows some type of large aircraft hit the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was likely, just like the other three aircraft, a remote controlled drone.

       While I agree with you about WTC 7, official reports can explain it away as simply collapsing due to damage inflicted by falling debris from WTC 1 &amp; 2. The Pentagon offers them no such out. It stood alone &amp; if not hit by a plane as they claim, was obviously attacked using some other means. Witnesses claim it was a missle &amp; I tend to lean toward what they're saying because the whole ordeal felt off to me from the get go.

       The official story about the fire starting inside the building from falling debris from twin towers?? Bullshit since no tower could fell from just that. Also it collapsed like a controlled explosion, which some engineers have said.

       I'm not debating that it was controlled demolition. I'm fairly certain it was. I was simply stating that the lack of evidence to support a Pentagon plane hit was a bigger red flag &amp; I imagine it'll be what leads to the whole ordeal being exposed as a false flag to the masses.

       My guess is that it's easy to dissuade discussions about the Pentagon being a false flag by simply turning the conversation toward patriotism. Only an unpatriotic individual would dare question the narrative when it comes to an iconic building like the Pentagon. It enables painting "conspiracy nuts" with a broad brush much easier &amp; widens the divide with those who see themselves as level headed Americans.

         The light poles were effectively 100 feet apart, and the generator-trailer and low concrete wall were effectively 43 feet apart. These objects could not all have been impacted by a missile. The shape and size of the impact hole precludes a missile, the damaged internal columns were spaced apart over a wide area, and the bowed and abraded columns could not have been rendered in such a condition by a missile.

       So a missile cant do that but a plane can? WutFace. Its been proven in videos aswell by engineers. The plane had to be touch the grind and hit straight in which is impossible. A missile is way morr likely also based on witnesses. So why link to an unknown website?

       Yeah a missile is not shaped in such a way as to clip light poles and trees over the area like the wings of a jet would.  I could question your video by engineers but you did not provide one.  I also have a hard time understanding how the missile left plane debris.

       That plane was said (based on the one still shot from the parking lot camera) to be traveling approximately 400 knots when it hit the pentagon. As a pilot who understands the forces involved, it has never made sense. Never. No engine gouges in the grass (757 engines hang lower than the fuselage), and there is an effect called ground effect when an airplane is within its wingspan length over the ground (and exponentially so when half a wingspan height over the ground) where drag is canceled as the vortices coming off the wingtips are canceled as they hit the ground. At that speed, at that altitude, the forward pressure on the yoke would be immense, and would require drastic and constant forward trimming to keep the plane from ballooning higher. The idea this was pulled off BT a student pilot who was scaring his instructor in a high wing Cessna, is simply preposterous. No matter how many bullet point retirements of this the shills try to show me, I will NEVER believe that a 757 was flown into the side of that building. Even more simple, where are the engine and wing marks on the side of the building?  It is just too stupid too ever believe. Cue the shills...

       You may have many good points but do you realize this is one huge argument from incredulity?  You cannot believe its possible so you make the decision to believe it is not.  I am not a pilot nor do I honestly know enough about flying to say much.  I do know and as a pilot so should you that the FAA has amazingly skilled and experienced experts who know how to dissect a plane crash.  Why are they so silent on your theory?  Lets table that and move on...
      </p>
      <p>
       We do know from the evidence collected from broken tree's and light poles etc that something plane like struck the building.  We know from the wreckage gathered that the debris belongs to the plane that the experts say flew into the pentagon.  As a pilot  you should be aware of some facts about engines such as tractability to the manufacture who is often part of the crash scene investigation.  So for this to be anything but the story you will have to convince me that at least 1000 experts and investigators are either inept or part of the conspiracy.

       the cabbie is Lloyd England.  plenty of videos and websites have discussed this previously.

       This would be a first persons account of an incident exactly what supports his account?  If he was a witness did he take pictures of them faking the scene or was he part of it as others believe?  Why would people willing to blow up buildings and kill thousands not kill him for speaking out?  I am not saying he is lying but one persons account is not enough to overcome the thousands of people who have a different story.

       Seriously? You just suggested light poles being downed are not evidence yet earlier you suggested it was staged.  Why would you suggest the scene was staged if not to provide physical evidence to create a false narrative?  I only find it highly suspect that so much of the scene was staged so quickly and without anyone except this cabbie you mentioned who states this completely without evidence.  Then you suggest the thousands of witness are all working for media outlets.  Just how big do you think this conspiracy really could be?  You suggest I offer nothing concrete but that is not my responsibility.  I am trying to discern between two narrative the conspiracy vs. the official story, I am just pointing out the conspiracy seems flawed.

       OPINION: They used missiles at the pentagon because they look like planes but come in so fast/ so low that people would have no clue what they just saw, and the towers, they most likely used empty military passenger jets loaded with something flammable as an excuse for when they fired off their directed energy cold fusion device at the towers to basically cause the actual atoms in the building’s metal to repel from each other and vaporize every inch of evidence into dust. Did you notice how people were trying to get outside windows and jumping like crazy? In that situation, you would do everything you could to survive and hanging out 100 story windows is not how you do that. Sprinklers most likely either went off, or pipes burst and soaked the people after the planes hit, and because we’re dealing with a microwave type energy device, people would be in an insane amount of pain and feel like they were extremely hot or almost burning inside, and microwaves cause people to run in the opposite direction of the source of microwaves (it’s a known military grade weapon to use on crowds as well) so that would explain why they would do everything to get out of the building, and would also explain how everyone who was on the phone could speak fast and coherently despite severe heat and smoke inhalation. (you would speak slow and deliriously if there was smoke and fire everywhere, but most people on cell phones sounded clear as day and anxiety ridden) The people and most of the building literally vaporized and there are videos where you can actually see pieces of building, car handles on the ground, etc turn to dust in real time, which just does not make sense in a normal fire. However, it does make perfect sense if the Hutchinson effect was used in a focused energy cold fusion weapon: every effect you see in Hutchinson’s original work can be seen happening in NYC on 9/11/01, and not to mention the fact that two scientists discovered cold fusion like 40-50 years ago and one scientist, in the press conference to decide if they release the info they learned on real cold fusion and tritium, (world changing as it’s nearly endless free energy) decided that because it would cause physics to be totally rewritten, he didn’t think it was “necessary” to introduce the topic to mainstream science and literally
       <em>
        took a vote with the media to determine this and it’s all on camera
       </em>
       ... totally shady and Dr. Judy Wood brings up all these fascinating ideas in her big original presentation at the 2011 free energy conference! Also, check out Rebekah Roth for more extremely interesting 911 ideas!! She explains what happens to all the people on the planes and common knowledge in the airline world back in the 90s because she was a flight attendant for years!

       I dislike presenting Judy Wood's material because it is usually beyond people who haven't studied physics at even basic level....but I will say this.......a building collapse would never cause steel girders to actually shred in spots which is what we see on multiple vertical beams after 9/11. It's incredible really.

       Oh I get what you’re saying; I’m no physicist, but the videos she shows from Hutchinson, as well as those two scientists who discovered that (I believe it was this new element) tritium could be used in cold fusion, just totally blow my mind and I know people have been trying like crazy to discredit Hutchinson, but I really do believe his experiments to be true because I have no idea how he could fake all those years worth of videos and evidence! Forget it about the scientist leaving cold fusion up to a vote to the media - that was just disgraceful and screams that someone got to him with a TON of cash and threats!

       In '93 there was a bombing in the basement. It caused them to remove a huge amount of gold (thanks wiki).

      <p>
       In '02 the Sarbox was passed, requiring much better accounting practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing that after the tech boom built on falsified documentation meant that they had to obliterate all of that paperwork, but a simple bomb wouldn't do the job. It worked well for a vault full of gold in the basement, the papers were spread all over the building.

       I haven’t gone through this clip. But this retired US military intelligence officer agrees with you. If it’s not in this one he says it was a cruise missile engine that was captured in a photo. Sorry it’s been a while since I looked into it, but he’s a good source to go by.

       The problem is, as you have already admitted proudly, that you can only stand to listen to an alternative point of view for less than two minutes before you crack and have to turn it off.

       My college friend Dan’s dad died. I’d met his dad many times before. After he died, Dan and his mom and brother were very sad. I never saw his dad again.

       My college dorm had a view of the Pentagon from the roof deck. While watching the reporting on the towers, the news anchors mentioned that they were hearing reports of an explosion at the Pentagon. We ran to the roof and saw fire and smoke, which persisted for about 36 hours. Within a few days, we drove to Arlington and saw a huge gaping, smoke-stained, ragged hole in the side of the building.

       If you look at his comments dick doesn't cut it... if you look at how much he rails against women, his complete inability to apply a consistent standard to his own and others theories, his inability to see others view points, his complete unwavering belief in his own ideas, and his inability to grasp abstract concepts makes me think there is more to the story that just being a dick... there is I think actually something wrong... that kind of unpleasantness is special.

       Yeah, that post he made gave me a good laugh. I normally don’t go out of my way to call someone out, and I feel some of the stuff he regurgitates is plausible, but he is so hypocritical, dishonest with himself and self absorbed in how he cherry picks his “evidence” that it needs to be called out. And the sheer

       Think about it, how can someone honestly be that stupid to think 9/11 was a fake movie lmao. The guy is cancer and poisons all the discussion on this subreddit with absurd claims based on absolutely nothing other than that his views go against what other people think. He wants to be the smartest person here, so he goes about that by trying to find the silliest reasons to things
       <em>
        only he can believe
       </em>
       . It makes him feel important. Like he’s the only one capable of saving the world with his unique knowledge. But he’s just an idiot
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been calling him out a lot lately in threads but not on purpose. I am always calling out the dumb comments but I end up founding out half way through my responses that I’m responding to him
       <em>
        every single time
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah. He’s a troll or just reaaaaally stupid. Everyone should just ignore him. And (like I will be doing) making sure I know who I am responding to before writing a comment so I don’t have to waste time with this moron

       What level of evidence would you need to verify something? Someone to come back from the dead and meet you in a cafe and tell you they died on 9/11...
      </p>
      <p>
       You will say every video or photo is fake, articles and obituaries you will say are fake, accounts of people knowing people who died you will call 3rd hand or say people faked their own deaths...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no sufficient level of proof for you so why do you bother other people?
      </p>
      <p>
       In your own video you have a table of air densities... have you verified the air densities yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you test how a plane operates in those densities?

       No, the problem is that you seem delusional and whichever way the conversation goes, you’ll find a way to deepen your convictions. 
Unlike the previous commenter who said “well, I do believe planes flew into the WTC but hell I’ll give this guy’s opinion a try” you refuse to acknowledge the fact that you might be wrong. 
And, unless you have absolute top level gvnmt clearance, you can never be truly sure about what happened that fateful day. 
So, instead of agressively attacking one of the probably very few dudes in your life who are willing to check your perspective out, how about a polite agree to disagree type interaction from time to time, huh? Or is this more like an Über/untermensch situation where are opinions aren’t equal? 
If it’s the good ol’ Divide &amp; Conquer tptb are after, they’re doing a damn fine job, even among critical thinkers so it seems.

       Enough people lived there to see it first hand. I don't need some idiot on youtube to tell me what happened that day. There were witnesses beyond TV broadcasts. Period. What caused those planes to hit those buildings is up for debate. But to say some kind of aircraft did not hit those buildings and no one died is absolute lunacy. You clearly have never lived in the NY/NJ area.

       Ooh! Ooh! Pick me! I was there that day and saw the towers come down with my own eyes. You could see people falling and you can hear the impact when they hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, everytime they got close to the ground, I turned away cuz I couldn't take it. So maybe, just maybe, they teleported to somewhere else right before they hit the ground. Teleported a dummy back and then sprawled all over the street with their body parts all over the place and splattered cow's blood all over the streets and cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, I also saw the planes. I saw the towers come down. So there ya go. I got your answer right here

       Why does it matter to you? Nothing he can say can convince you because you subscribe to the idea that unless you were there yourself to see it that you cannot verify it... so it does not matter what he says because his eye witness account will never be sufficient for you...
      </p>
      <p>
       Although for your own theories you demand substantially less proof like an early 90s youtube clip of hulk hogan or a clip from back to the future...
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pointless to argue with someone who demands impossible proof of others and requires not proof of himself...

       You fucking asshole. I was in DC that day and watched the Pentagon burn. Another friend of mine was leaving Courtlandt street and ran from (and got covered in) the rubble of the falling towers. Friends of mine lost parents in New York that day. Just because you didn’t personally see it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

       Engines didn't match at the Pentagon vs what hit it. I'm not going to get I to a deep debate about it because I don't try to change people's minds. I'm adding something to the conversation and simply giving people the opportunity to research it themselves.

       The FAA and the vast majority of aerospace engineers are part of this conspiracy?  I mean making engines requires tons of people and each part is stamped for tracibility all the way down to the guy who made the part.

       When I first heard this I rewatched all the news broadcasts my mom taped live on our VCR.  Not a single one is shown hitting the tower. A plane is shower flying what appear to be behind the first tower but the wing barely touched it, if it all. And they want us to believe this plane crashed through the building completely unscathed? I call bs.

       33 year old here.  I was in high school and watched it live on TV.  Planes hit the towers.  The live broadcast showed the second plane hitting and then later on we see video camera footage of the first plane hitting.

       That's how I remember it, too.  I had turned on the TV after the first plane had already crashed and they were still calling it an accident, and then I saw the 2nd tower hit.  I was glued to the TV for the rest of the day (and longer.)

       I swear i saw a few days after  the event  a video shot from a truck driving on a major road in Washington  and a plane comes out of no where from the right and fly over  the top of him very low to the ground and you can hear him say sometging like holy fuck. But i never saw it again after   . Was bigger then a missile but maybe it was a smaller plane and that why you cant find it now    . Maybe it was a video from some where else but defiantly looked like Washington  with big open multi lane roads  and boring govt buildings

       Aside from the obvious fakery and jiggery pokery, this mentality is so fucking annoyingly condescending, isn't it. a Daddy knows best mentality. Aw, poor citizens, you wouldn't be able to handle the pictures (even though headline after headline is about our investments in death, war and the destruction of earth's ecology).

       I think the rationale was not that it was too gruesome but rather that they didn’t want to provide fodder for the terrorist PR department. If there was a photo they would have used it to recruit more terrorists. Not saying that makes sense, just that “too gruesome” wasn’t the problem.

       That wasn't Saddam. The guy had 16 lookalikes he used as decoys to avoid assassination. They hanged one of his doppelgangers and evacuated him through their black ops infrastructure. Everything was already in place to make it happen, a black hood and unlisted flight plan, he was already kidnapped out of Iraq months prior to the hanging. It was too big an opportunity to miss.

       I find it amazing myself, how when you look up plane crash on Google image, you can basically look at every plane crash ever and see the wreckage...but, there is no wreckage from any of the 4 crashed planes in photos.

       Pretty simple explanation here :. Almost all plane crashes you have seen aside from 9-11 had the pilots doing everything they could to keep the plane from crashing.

       Quite a few pictures in there from WTC and pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       For flight 93, I don't know exactly how it hit the field but considering what the hole looked like wouldn't surprise me if it nose dived into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done plenty (16 years and 9 months) of research into 9-11, since the day it happened.  I was showing print outs about the pipelines planned on Afghanistan and Bin Laden's kidney treatment in Dubai at Thanksgiving of 2001.  Don't think for a moment any piece of information regarding what may or may not have happened on that day has slipped by me.  A lot of suspect events happened surrounding that day - there not being any planes involved ia not fucking one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, people like you have actually hurt the cause of finding out the real truth about that day, because now if I ever want to raise doubts or concerns with people about what happened on 9-11, I'm assumed to be harboing the "idiocy" in people like you, who think the planes were computer generated who a missile hit the pentagon.

       What if the 9/11 conspiracy is just a government conspiracy? What if terrorists really attacked us, and in an effort to make us seem not as weak and vulnerable, the government released conspiracy theories to make people think it was them, thus giving them an even more powerful illusion.

       One of my theories is that TPTB knew there was a plan to  hijack planes and fly them into the towers, and they just allowed them to do it, but then they (TPTB) totally upped the ante by bringing the towers down themselves. Imagine if you were this enemy looking to cause some damage and then you come to realize that your opponent is totally psychotic and is causing more damage to themselves than you even intended to do... That would send a message that these people are unfuckwitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one of many theories. For all we know there may not have been any "terrorists" and the whole event was created and executed by TPTB.

       Those guys did not have the flying experience to pull those maneuvers off in commercial airliners, especially the supposed flight path of the Pentagon plane which even the most skilled and experienced pilots would have trouble doing (something out of a cartoon).

       After doing basically a full circle in the sky, which it didn't need to do (it was already headed the right direction I believe) and then to hit that tiny target (within 300 feet at least) - it's just too incredible to believe. It's not rocket science, but it may as well be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, could you even pick out a building that far up in the air, let alone the correct one?

       This is dumb logic. If you've been training for years to carry out the mission, it's not that hard to pick out the most recognizable Pentagon in DC. How many other Pentagon buildings are there? You seem to refuse to accept the facts here and make up discrepancies to continue your silly argument. Read the popular mechanics book and tell me what you find wrong in it

       So what do you think happened then? I mean it's pretty obvious what happened as there are dozens of eye witness accounts. Are you one of those people who wasn't there and thinks it was a missle, negating the eye witness reports of all those people who witnessed such a horrific attack that is burned in their memory forever?

       I wasn't there, I didn't see it with my own eyes. So - eye witnesses? I mean, I haven't met them. It's the same problem. Which is why you would expect some photos, some footage, to back up the government's story.
      </p>

       And there is no footage. There are no photos. And besides - when have you ever known any government anywhere ever to tell the truth?

       We're being exploited by a ruling class made up of the greedy and the sociopathic and the demented. Nothing they say is worth shit. So no, it's not pretty obvious what happened. Actually there are hundreds of questions which are begging to be resolved.

       They didn't "pull off" anything. You are implying that the trajectory by which the pane hit the Pentagon was a planned one, which would be a ludicrous assumption. His only goal was to hit the building. It could have happened in thousand ways, it just so happened this way.

       Problem - Reaction - Solution = False Flag event.  Not that something didn't happen, but that They want a certain outcome (ie wars, Patriot Act)...how do you get the people on board?  By creating a situation where people will wig out and rally around the enemy.  A controlled narrative.  People believe what they see on the 6pm news.

       I believe in it because the evidence is abundant and the story is reasonable.  The conspiracy theory is fantastical and every line of evidence I have seen is baseless conjecture.  I am not married to any belief or idea but I do require sound evidence.

       I don't understand how a big plane can fly that low to the ground to crash straight into the Pentagon.  It would have to be almost landing for quite a distance....,a camera would totally have picked it up...

       The Pentagon didn't have cameras pointing at that area of the building. It only had the one camera on the road that caught the impact, but the slow frames didn't pick the plane up very well. It was obviously allowed to happen by the upper tiers of government but it wasn't a damn missile, why complicate things and not just hit the damn buildings with planes?

       Planes aren't as accurate as  missile and it is harder to control the damage.

       Further the whole camera thing is the biggest pile of bullshit I have ever heard. My business does not have better cameras than the home of the US military command.

       Look into its trajectory, the plane supposedly made an insane corkscrew turn beyond the maximum capabilities of a 737 (especially with an inexperienced pilot),  ending up 10-20 ft off the ground (low enough to knock down the street lights) and then managed to directly hit the building. I remember there being high level pilots attempting the maneuver in flight simulators and saying it was impossible.

       This really is the only reasonable position. You don't believe what the government says, ever, first of all. Second of all, you don't believe what the government says is on tapes that they've confiscated and refuse to show us.

       How about this. If 9/11 was an inside job, and clearly the government was capable of crashing two planes into the Twin Towers (as we can clearly see they were planes), why would they take the risk of using a missile or a bomb on the pentagon when they clearly were capable of using planes?

       There are eye witness accounts from two police officers (on camera and signed) that they saw a plane overhead, but not on the official path.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory being that a plane did fly towards the pentagon, but if it wasn't the exact path the official story claims, it couldn't have knocked down the poles, the taxi on the bridge must have been set up, (you can find interviews with the taxi driver who gives conflicting accounts and refuses to acknowledge photos that differ from the official story and gave quotes such as 'I'm just a small man, this is a big thing, much bigger than me'.   The overall theory being that a plane was heading to the pentagon, though was never intended to hit, but to fly over. What hit was a missile.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also the theory for the other planes, the flight paths all seem to do a u-turn (as they were hijacked) but it also matches air bases on the ground. The theory being that the passengers were unloaded, which is where they made the phone calls to loved ones claiming men with box cutters have taken over the plane, Or in the case of .....just realised my account isnt old enough to post here ;D

       The Pentagon SPO required a direct hit for target elimination, that target was inside the Pentagon building. The target was successfully destroyed 43 minutes after the start of the operation.  Think Trillions.

       Perhaps they wanted to see if the pentagon was really capable of withstanding a direct hit from a missile.

       imho, 9/11 is an example of compartmentalization gone horribly wrong. You don't need 1,000's of conspirators if you have faithful americans who don't know that they went "live" run by a few well-intentioned power drunk fucktards.

       That seems like a risky way to test that. It would have been easier to just build a copy section of the pentagon in the desert somewhere and hit it with a tomahawk without risking blowing open the conspiracy of the century.

       To be sure, I'm not suggesting that it was a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       idea, just that however 911 happened there were many moving parts, (I swear to god that was not an intentional horror pun) and if you are playing out the version of events that the us govt was involved "somehow" (I hope I never know) then you can easily imagine a scenario in place where if some power takes over a section of the pentagon or some major goes bonkers and they have to "take back" the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may seem
       <em>
        beyond
       </em>
       far fetched, but the fact is the pentagon has plans in place right now for such an eventuality, they have a plan for an obscene amount of eventualities and if there's a fork in the command chain then there are scenarios where the "need to know" number is single digits and yet missiles can be launched.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a good point you make, I wonder if they didn't build major portions of the pentagon somewhere so they can do live fire drills of taking it/ taking it back. And for shooting missiles at something your first thought has to be the 1,000's of sq miles of desert the govt already owns in the west.

       There were no planes, the genuine eyewitness accounts you hear mistake a cruise missile for a plane. It really looks like a small passenger plane.

       The videos are faked. Like come on! If something is easy to fake then it is an eyewitness video, yet don't see how  all evidence of planes is a couple of videos. And then we have shit-poor crisis actors trying to set the narrative immediately

       Because they needed the Pentagon damaged, but not inoperable for the upcoming war. That and everything was so overwhelming to the general public that they probably assumed no one would go back and double check how a commercial airplane completely disintegrated against the side of the Pentagon.

       The pentagon was a hardened structure meant to withstand WW2 era bomb blasts. If they wanted to not damage it, they could have used a smaller plane like a 737 instead of a 767 to minimize the damage without the risk of people seeing a missile.

       I'm pretty late on this, but it's important to look at this from all perspectives as well... I work for a major US airline, the airline would have to be involved as well. You can't just broadcast to the entire world "American flight 11 crashed into a tower" without American being like wait wut.. Which also means the FAA would have to be involved. You can't just make planes disappear, the amount of people from different entities needing to be involved is pretty high.. unless you work for Malaysia airlines, they seem pretty good at losing planes but that's another topic for another day.

       &lt;sigh&gt; This argument has been debunked. British entertainer Jimmy Saville raped 1000's of children over a 50 year period. No one in the public knew until he died. That also clearly involved 1000's of people to complete. Fact.

       I agree if someone can please do us a image of this undocumented even in history. I can get pictures of Thomas the tank engine giving the all his friends together in sweet train based intercourse but when it comes to 9/11 I can find anything. It's clearly a Obama cover up to win the election in 2020, all answers point this this. Nothing but plastic bags in the wind and a giant card stacks.

       "... releasing just a single frame will in no way cause anything negative to happen"      Plenty of negative will happen if they release even a single frame of the object that hit the Pentagon. They know that. That's why they won't release it.   (Hint: missile, not plane)

       Maybe I’m remembering this wrong, but didn’t the guy making the White House’s official statement on what happened to the Pentagon slip up and actually start to SAY “missile” at first?

       Also, wasn’t there another plane that just so happened to have crashed outside of DC right before the Pentagon was hit?

       A plane did not hit the pentagon and even if thay were the case, there are too many inprobabilities like the flight path and speed, going past speeds so close to the ground that would cause the airplane wings to rip off due to drag, the fact that they came in for a risky side maneuver instead of just dive bombing on to the pentagon, the lack of plane parts, most importantly the engines, and the most daming piece of evidence is the clear alteration of the 2 frames we see the plane from the camera and the security booth. They are in the same cctv however the plane does not match where it should be in one frame, which shows signs of tampering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the exterior wall that was hit was where there was an ongoing investigation as to where 2.3 trillion dollars went missing. Those employees are the ones who were targeted

       Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all this say about the American mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
       De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">
        https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle."
      </p>
      <p>
       He went on to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       He further goes on to state:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don't have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it's too big to stop.

       I've seen quite a few shots of planes hitting the tower by now and thought the main issue with most of them was that the plane hits are so unrealistic as to raise questions about what kind of plane it was, what it was carrying and so on. For instance, it's so bizarre that they just disappear into the buildings, without leaving any debris outside

       Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Whatever it is, it's heading straight for the world trade centre.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess? It was a plane. An old, disused plane from a graveyard or old hanger, loaded with fuel (not explosives) to give a great 'fireball' effect. That's why it was photoshopped out, because any spotter would have realised that this other plane didn't have the same profile as the plane that supposedly hit the pentagon.

       If the ruling elite have trillions in black opps "unacknowledged" money, why can't they fake a video and release it to the public. These days it's hard enough to tell what video is pure and what is doctored. Seems to me they could release even a "grainy" CCT footage of a plane hitting the Pentagon. To NOT do this fuels more conspiracy talk. So maybe they want more conspiracy talk?

       No, the problem is that you seem delusional and whichever way the conversation goes, you’ll find a way to deepen your convictions. 
Unlike the previous commenter who said “well, I do believe planes flew into the WTC but hell I’ll give this guy’s opinion a try” you refuse to acknowledge the fact that you might be wrong. 
And, unless you have absolute top level gvnmt clearance, you can never be truly sure about what happened that fateful day. 
So, instead of agressively attacking one of the probably very few dudes in your life who are willing to check your perspective out, how about a polite agree to disagree type interaction from time to time, huh? Or is this more like an Über/untermensch situation where are opinions aren’t equal? 
If it’s the good ol’ Divide &amp; Conquer tptb are after, they’re doing a damn fine job, even among critical thinkers so it seems.

       Enough people lived there to see it first hand. I don't need some idiot on youtube to tell me what happened that day. There were witnesses beyond TV broadcasts. Period. What caused those planes to hit those buildings is up for debate. But to say some kind of aircraft did not hit those buildings and no one died is absolute lunacy. You clearly have never lived in the NY/NJ area.

       Ooh! Ooh! Pick me! I was there that day and saw the towers come down with my own eyes. You could see people falling and you can hear the impact when they hit.
      </p>

       Now, everytime they got close to the ground, I turned away cuz I couldn't take it. So maybe, just maybe, they teleported to somewhere else right before they hit the ground. Teleported a dummy back and then sprawled all over the street with their body parts all over the place and splattered cow's blood all over the streets and cars.

       But then, I also saw the planes. I saw the towers come down. So there ya go. I got your answer right here

       I don’t claim to know what happened on 9/11 either way. I’m a natural skeptic, so Ive lurked in these circles for a long time, and I swear to you that that is the first time I’ve ever heard that suggested.

       This really is the only reasonable position. You don't believe what the government says, ever, first of all. Second of all, you don't believe what the government says is on tapes that they've confiscated and refuse to show us.

       Perhaps they wanted to see if the pentagon was really capable of withstanding a direct hit from a missile.

       imho, 9/11 is an example of compartmentalization gone horribly wrong. You don't need 1,000's of conspirators if you have faithful americans who don't know that they went "live" run by a few well-intentioned power drunk fucktards.

       &lt;sigh&gt; This argument has been debunked. British entertainer Jimmy Saville raped 1000's of children over a 50 year period. No one in the public knew until he died. That also clearly involved 1000's of people to complete. Fact.

       There were no planes, the genuine eyewitness accounts you hear mistake a cruise missile for a plane. It really looks like a small passenger plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The videos are faked. Like come on! If something is easy to fake then it is an eyewitness video, yet don't see how  all evidence of planes is a couple of videos. And then we have shit-poor crisis actors trying to set the narrative immediately

       Because they needed the Pentagon damaged, but not inoperable for the upcoming war. That and everything was so overwhelming to the general public that they probably assumed no one would go back and double check how a commercial airplane completely disintegrated against the side of the Pentagon.

       I'm pretty late on this, but it's important to look at this from all perspectives as well... I work for a major US airline, the airline would have to be involved as well. You can't just broadcast to the entire world "American flight 11 crashed into a tower" without American being like wait wut.. Which also means the FAA would have to be involved. You can't just make planes disappear, the amount of people from different entities needing to be involved is pretty high.. unless you work for Malaysia airlines, they seem pretty good at losing planes but that's another topic for another day.

       That seems like a risky way to test that. It would have been easier to just build a copy section of the pentagon in the desert somewhere and hit it with a tomahawk without risking blowing open the conspiracy of the century.

       That plane was said (based on the one still shot from the parking lot camera) to be traveling approximately 400 knots when it hit the pentagon. As a pilot who understands the forces involved, it has never made sense. Never. No engine gouges in the grass (757 engines hang lower than the fuselage), and there is an effect called ground effect when an airplane is within its wingspan length over the ground (and exponentially so when half a wingspan height over the ground) where drag is canceled as the vortices coming off the wingtips are canceled as they hit the ground. At that speed, at that altitude, the forward pressure on the yoke would be immense, and would require drastic and constant forward trimming to keep the plane from ballooning higher. The idea this was pulled off BT a student pilot who was scaring his instructor in a high wing Cessna, is simply preposterous. No matter how many bullet point retirements of this the shills try to show me, I will NEVER believe that a 757 was flown into the side of that building. Even more simple, where are the engine and wing marks on the side of the building?  It is just too stupid too ever believe. Cue the shills...
