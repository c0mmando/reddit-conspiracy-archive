    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts would be that if you attack the public and draw the country into the war more, they can make them waste resources that are needed while also causing unrest amongst the public. This would cause the public to protest and ask for a stop to the war. If the country being attacked stops then the other country wins and has decimated that other countries resources and morale. </p>

<p>Germany took Paris and numerous other capitals and tried to take Moscow but failed, meanwhile the Allies entire war effort went into taking Berlin, which the Soviets succeeded in doing. </p>

<p>wut.  what <strong>Capitol</strong> (you have been spelling this wrong all through out the thread) are even talking about? Philly? Technically not really the capitol as it was just the seat of the continental congress, and it certainly was &quot;destroyed&quot; just occupied. The Capitol of the US colonies was more or less a dynamic location or idea, since they were not sovereign nation-state yet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you go to war, you never bomb the Leaders. All this does is embolden a never surrender ideology.  The people you are at war with you will fight until eradication.  This is costly and expensive.  If your goal is genocide then that is what you do.  </p>

<p>In a war, you beat the enemies army then you get that country to do work or pay tribute to you for the forseeable future. </p>

<p>Another side effect of Bombing a leader is this pisses off other nearby rulers/leaders. They will see you as nothing more than a thug that cannot be reasoned with and will often side with the victim even when they do not like them, just to get your thug ass out of the world. </p>

<p>TL DR.  War is a noble profession and there are rules of etiquette one must follow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are thinking of all the US police action of the last couple decades, not true war. In pretty much every example of traditional wars, the Capit<em>o</em>l was the prime prize or goal. </p>

<p>When you are talking about the war on terror we have been stuck in forever (nor do I support) you are not fighting a traditional nation-state like in the past. The US is fighting a de-centralized opponent, usually residing within or across a number of traditional nation-states. Taking a capitol wouldn&#39;t mean much, especially since the capitol typically has no say over what these rebel groups are doing, or lack the political will to oppose them directly.</p>

<p>to reference my other post in this thread for comparison, the british took philly, which could be labeled as the defacto capitol of the colonial forces, but that didnt really do anything, the moral deafening was the same as the british taking any other important city. </p>

<p>that is because the AR was just a decentralized rebel group operating across a number of the colonies with no true or tested centralized nation-state set up. They could just move their &quot;capitol&quot; as seen fit if the acting capitol was taken. </p>
