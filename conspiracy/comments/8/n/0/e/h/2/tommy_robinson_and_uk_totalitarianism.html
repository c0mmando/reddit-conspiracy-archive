        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seen a lot of Americans commenting on the Tommy Robinson case, with little ideas of UK law and culture, citing that its a gross act of misjustice etc etc</p>

<p>Well as a UK citizen I just want to clear a few things up about the UK, and the way it actually is, because no offense, a foreigners comments on the state of your country will nearly always be misguided unless they understand the sociopolitical makeup at the time.</p>

<p>In no way am I defending the sexual abusers in which Tommy was &#39;reporting&#39; on. And I&#39;m not defending the way in which I think the UK has become a surveillance state much like the USA just in more obscure and covert ways.</p>

<p>Firstly, the islamophobia on this sub is appaling, when will people learn that we are put on this world to love and not hate, and if the other party does not warrant love do not give them anything. I&#39;ve read several comments stating that it&#39;s as if, I were to walk out of my door, to the nearest tube station and on the way be raped by a gang of Muslims, arrested for not having a walking license, and then kicked for not reading the Qu&#39;uran. Not the case! At all!</p>

<p>There are bad people in every community regardless of your religious identity, ethnicity or background, and to suggest that the UK is simply a free for all where Muslims get a free pass is insane! I know many muslim people, and on the whole they&#39;re lovely people, we speak at length about religion and politics and how it&#39;s misconstrued. Radical islamists are akin to what the KKK is to the Christian Church, a radical sect that took the fundamental ideas misconstrued them and acts out their own deranged ideas, to blame a whole religion is absurd. If we were to start blaming religions for violence then Christianity has a LOT to answer for too. (for any of you who are gonna call me a Muslim sympathiser etc well I&#39;m an agnostic above anything) </p>

<p>Back to Tommy; a suspended sentence is a sentence which you are given in lieu of actual prison time, where you are told to basically stay out of trouble for that time, and if you do reoffend you go to prison without much of a trial because you have already been sentenced. The trial is a basic formality to tell you the deal.
Was he recording outside a courthouse? Yes. Is that against the law? Yes. Did he know this? Yes. He was sentenced for 10 months for contempt of court, and a further 3 for his suspended sentence. </p>

<p>This is not about freedom of speech or about our rights as UK citizens. This is about him potentially messing up a current ongoing trial.</p>

<p>To sit there and suggest this is a calculated act by the UK government is absurd. He put himself in this situation. </p>

<p>To put all that aside, what sort of person feels the need to go to a court and record the defendants/victims? Why does he need to do that? If he had something to say, Why didn&#39;t he just do it from the comfort of his home? Tommy Robinson is a certified shit stirrer with little credibility, he&#39;s trying to spin his arrest as an act of malice when in fact its just the law, and has been for nearly a hundred years. Look it up. </p>

<p>So to all the mainly Americans reading this, don&#39;t think that Britain is anything like described by Donald trump or Fox news, it has its pitfalls and shortcomings just like any country, no doubt my country is full of kaniving, sneaky bastards, but look at the USA, not exactly the beacon of hope its made out to be.</p>

I want nothing to do with the hate machine that is consuming and grinding up young men of all walks of life and partitioning them along racial, religious and ideological lines. WW2 will seem like a minor scuffle compared to what&#39;s coming down the road if we don&#39;t collectively decide that enough is enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. The UK and many western countries have silenced journalists/people before. Tommy Robinson doesn&#39;t fall into this category. But again I think we need more understanding. Tommy spreads hate, we shouldn&#39;t meet that with more hate, even though I think his fundamentals are wrong he is just misguided, perhaps he had issues growing up or was fed lies. I&#39;m not religious but I think we should operate on the basis of love and compassion and understanding. I just wish people would pay Tommy less notice, if he were to strive to make a positive impact then perhaps I&#39;d respect him more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultures don&#39;t mix, they clash. Keep trying to force them to work together like a square in a triangular hole and watch what happens. If we were all supposed to be together, we&#39;d be from the same places, we&#39;d look the same and live the same.</p>

<p>Islam in particular is one of the least workable religions out of all of them. Even Hitler suggested Christianity and Catholicism needed to be as strict as they are. What the left is going to learn in one of the hardest lessons of their life is that you will see White Sharia before you see Muslims getting assimilated. Because in the end, we can at least agree on men &gt; women, no homosexuality and law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslim immigration to the UK isn&#39;t exactly forced. Its not forced cohabitation and coexistence, its just the way it is, people decide to move to different countries for their own reasons.</p>

<p>You said we are not the same, yet you say that we all think alike and tend to stick to our tribes, which is true, we are creatures of habit. But to take this at face value and decide that its the be all and end all is ridiculous. People mix all the time theres no such thing as one &#39;tribe&#39; of people, there are studies showing that people&#39;s genealogies can be incredibly varied even though their families have stayed in the same area their whole lives.</p>

<p>You said the most non violent countries had no black people? What about the white owned slave trade? The USA has been one of the most violent countries, yet is populated by a majority of white people.</p>

<p>You need to stop dividing people into groups and sub categories. It will only lead to disagreement and strife. Acceptance of other cultures is the way forward. There&#39;s no such thing as genetically pure or a variation of the human species which is inherently better, the idea of something being better than something else is a man made construct to begin with. You need to see through the veil of selfishness and accept people for who they are, and realise that the world is nowhere near as black and white as you think, its a million shades of grey.
Black people are violent, white people are violent. Brown people are violent. People are violent, its not their skin colour that makes them do it, it&#39;s ignorance, even if that&#39;s ignorance of the own knowledge they preach.</p>

<p>It seems as if you&#39;re the type of person who is for eugenics and segregation. These are antiquated ideas. Life is life. Humans are humans, no matter what skin colour or religion or political affiliation, we all feel the same, we all bleed the same. If you want to be pedantic then yes there are different variations of humans but fundamentally we are all the same. It&#39;s like having two breeds of dogs, you don&#39;t sit there and say, oh my husky is better than your pitbull, no, because that&#39;d be sad and boring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you have a naive, rose tinted view of people and the world, probably due to your western upbringing.</p>

<p>If you used facts more than feelings to inform your viewpoints you&#39;d recognize that western society is <em>incredibly</em> tolerant of opposing views, cultures, religions etc. The problem is that Islam is not, <em>and</em> they are fundamentally opposed to some of our most foundational values, such as tolerance and diversity, specifically religious diversity. Don&#39;t tell me about individual Muslims you may know, I&#39;m not talking about them, I&#39;m talking about Islam. </p>

<p>Islamic doctrine is black and white, no shades of gray, no single room; it&#39;s either haram or it&#39;s not, and what dictates what&#39;s what is &quot;the word of god&quot;. The views you hold that I judge as naive are seen by a large number of Muslims as weakness to be exploited; tolerance is a great thing, but only to a certain extent, if you take it to the point that it&#39;s detrimental to you, your society, or culture, it becomes foolishness. Wearing blinders and trying to mitigate hard facts with excuses because they aren&#39;t nice is just willful stupidity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as someone with unpopular opinions myself i give you a thumps up.</p>

<p>To the case, due to reasons not worth explaining. I wasnt able to follow tommy since about 2015. I also have to say just to tell you that i am not your typical bigot i have been to muslim countries and i have been in a relationship with a Muslim women for a while....i even use &quot;allahim&quot; instead of oh my god (because its shorter and has a nice ring to it, while the meaning is the same), so i dont have an aversion to Muslims...</p>

<p>The problem is the islam in Turkey, Iran and other places is very different then the Islam in lets say Germany or UK. The Muslims see themselves often &quot;in enemy territory&quot; Im a immigrant myself so i know how quickly folks can fall into that kind of thinking. Race does Play a factor in this case. If a country has a long history of racial diversity there is less tension. If it doesnt, you have problems.</p>

<p>So you have a group of people who see themselves as Foreigners in &quot;white europe&quot;, with a different religion that demands utter submission with a Alien culture that is often incompatible with civilized standards (shariah law).</p>

<p>This atmosphere does not create moderates. It creates a very strong draw towards extremism and crime. The religion is used as a Gang for all intends and purposes.  Studies have shown that UK muslims are considerably more radical then in their homelands. Those loosers can live out their powerfantasies in them. <em>Belonging to a group of people, chosen by god, to fight against unbelievers.</em> For some Pathetic thug that sounds great, oh wait there is more! <em>Women are a subject to their Husband</em> Fuck yeah finally they can get a women and not have to actually be a good person, because Islam says so. There are so many little loopholes in islam that when interpreted in the right way thugs get a hardon. Pedophilia is one of those things. To make matters worse, its impossible to discuss this failings of the Muslim community within the UK . You are Instantly labeled an islamophobe, nazi, racist and other nutty things. The government is clearly trying to &quot;keep order&quot; but they are sitting on a massive Powder Keg, that daily gains more and more strength with each pass and low sentence, even going so far to excuse clear crimes because &quot;they have a different culture!&quot;.</p>

<p>Tommy has pointed that out, time and time again. His arguments are basically the same as my former GF and her parents who where teachers. I would go so far to say that her opinions where considerably more extreme. </p>

<p>Islam has changed, even traditionally secular countries (turkey for example) are becoming more and more Islamic. Moderates who speak out against it usually live dangerously since those Thugs threaten, Beat or Kill them.</p>

<p>Considering the nonsense the altight and nazis are saying, tommy has been quite the moderate. The UK government has time and time again moved heaven and earth to entrap him in various ways, while ignoring crimes commited against him. His book <em>&quot;enemy of the state&quot;</em> really drives that point home. </p>

<p>Islamophobia is a bad thing i agree and there is WAY too much of it here, but there is a difference between that and to see how Islam has changed over the past 20 years , how much dangerous and criminal potential it now has. Daesh is the culmination and ultimate consequence of what this exact type of islam is capable of when they hold majority and power. Genocide, use of ABC weapons, Slavery, destruction of culture are the consequence. The Worst things humanity is capable of....all because of a religion. That has the potential to poison minds and kill souls.</p>

<p>Im sorry but while the UK operates in the realms of the law, in this case they are operating well outside what i call reasonable and well within Immorality. All in an attempt to keep some kind of fragile peace that wont last. </p>

<p>Since you didnt bother to give sources i dont give them either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with many of your ideas, and yeah I didn&#39;t give any sources because I&#39;m on mobile but that&#39;s besides the point. The fact that certain religions and communities breed violence and sexual abuse is true, and I will agree that the Muslim community is antiquated and needs to beheld accountable similar to the Catholic church. But that doesn&#39;t mean every Catholic is a pedophile. The world is far far far from perfect, people expect results yesterday, things like these, communities integrating and immigration take time to work, and may never work properly.

    <div class="md"><p>Criticising a religion and hating a religion for the action of a few are two different things. I think nearly every religion needs to be updated to relate to modern societal values, but if I started calling every Jewish person I saw a money grabbing world controlling cunt then I&#39;d be hating, if I stopped and said well I don&#39;t exactly understand why xxx does this, and I don&#39;t like it, maybe someone more knowledgeable could explain it and have a discussion. The islamophobia on this sub is more in line with thinly veiled racism, when, if reworded to be pointed at for instance a white community, would be met with a negative response. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points but our values are based on Christian teachings so I hate how we have to change our values bc a few can&#39;t adapt. Europe is changing its culture for a small fee that want nothing to do with the culture. Islam is a virus. It has only spread through violence and control. What is happening in Europe is text book on how muslims have taken over countries. Sorry I&#39;m going to criticize the fuck out of the religion bc it has brought nothing but oppression and censorship to the west and the rest of the world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were a practicing Christian in a minority Christian country would you want a church there? Would you want to be able to pray? I think you would, obviously I draw the line with placing religious values onto a society, I disagree with this even in situations where the country is deeply affiliated with that religion, people deserve choice. But to say Islam is a disease? I think you&#39;re pushing the boat, Christians have done a lot worse to Muslims in the past (see the multiple crusades). And also, people seem to think all Muslims have religion as their defining trait, just like there are super religious Christians there are super religious Muslims, but its a scale, a varying degree. I don&#39;t sit there and blame white people for enslaving colonies of people, just like I don&#39;t ask my Muslim friends why they commit terrorist attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minor correction: the goal of Islam is not world domination, it&#39;s to spread &quot;the word of god&quot;, and they aren&#39;t unreasonable, they give you the option to convert and if you&#39;d rather not then unfortunately they&#39;ll have to kill you, but it&#39;s not their fault, you made the decision, right?</p>

<p>So the natural end result if successful is world domination, but it&#39;s not the goal, it&#39;s the will of Allah and his prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all part of &quot;their&quot; plan. England was never a Left vs Right country like the US, not even many years ago it was the working class - upper class.</p>

<p>With the wedge that is being driven into our working class, it splits us down the middle so we get shit like working class people voting for the Tories who couldn&#39;t give 2 shits about people on the breadline.</p>

<p>With us divided it makes us easier to manipulate and control. You can see since the lead up to Brexit and onwards the Left vs Right bullshit has been crammed down our throats and people are choosing sides instead of saying &quot;wait a fucking minute&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with many of your ideas, and yeah I didn&#39;t give any sources because I&#39;m on mobile but that&#39;s besides the point. The fact that certain religions and communities breed violence and sexual abuse is true, and I will agree that the Muslim community is antiquated and needs to beheld accountable similar to the Catholic church. But that doesn&#39;t mean every Catholic is a pedophile. The world is far far far from perfect, people expect results yesterday, things like these, communities integrating and immigration take time to work, and may never work properly. Sorry if this wasn&#39;t the meaningful reply you were expecting, you madevery valid points, but I think both of us and most of reddit generalise. I have my own ideas on Tommy Robinson, and you have yours, I applaud you for taking the time to write this your opinions must mean a lot to you, thank you. </p>
