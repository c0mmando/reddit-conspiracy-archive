       That message "from a journalist to all journalists" is such utter tosh.

       The second sentence he wrote is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Edit2: impossible to get such a piece passed my editor"

       The shills will likely bury this one though, as you probably already know. Pizzagate is almost certainly why this sub became such a big target for the shills.

       He honestly did a terrible job of presenting it. He was mocking it as unreal before he ever got into the details which he never did. I like his comedy so I was wildly disappointed he's controlled or just a useful idiot.

       <p>
        This is the email that sparked the majority of this investigation. Various theories have been thrown around regarding “handkerchief codes”, but I am not convinced by those. There was never any conclusion on what this email was really about, since it was never addressed by Podesta (I don’t think anything in here has been, actually).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In that email Podesta doesn't use any of the "code words" he says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it's mine but not worth worrying about
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why does Podesta need to explain Susan Sandler &amp; Kathryn Tates language? What leads you to believe those women were talking in code?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say Podesta hasn't addressed pizzagate but that isn't true, he called pizzagaters "crazies" after Alex Jones gave his James Alefantis apology.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before I go into the emails, I want to clarify that there isn’t anything conclusive within them that could incriminate anybody — they are just weird. These are the starting point to an open-sourced internet investigation. No one example will convince you that this is real. I suggest you read everything before coming to a conclusion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       The handkerchief email is there for historical context. It is not why I conclude that these spirit cookers are up to no good.

       John didn't attend the spirit cooking dinner which was a dinner party for supporters which was publicised on kickstarter.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I’m outraged, because this is taken completely out of my context,” Abramovic told me by phone this afternoon. She was at Sean Kelly Gallery, her rep in New York. The dinner, she explained, was a reward for donors to a Kickstarter campaign she had run. Tony Podesta has collected her work since the 1990s, and he attended, but John couldn’t make it. In fact, she has never met John Podesta.

       So, direct evidence of someone they are a satanist isn't good enough for you, but a Reddit comment is "real life" proof that Sex Stains and Heavy Breathing are hipsters?  And btw, that link said Majestic Ape is hipster, a band I was NOT talking about.

       Yes, because your "opinion" isn't quite valid in this regard.  If you can find ANYTHING that states they are a shitty hipster band BESIDES your opinion, I'd be surprised.  OR, put them on a hipster forum and see if people consider them "hipster" (hint: they aren't).

       Opinions are like assholes but here's a pizzagate researcher referring to them as hipsters.

       It's more an interpretation of their style than something that is codified in an encyclopedia.

       Interesting. Thank you. I pray daily something is going on and this is not just a massive long con. There are just enough true facts along the fringes--all the CEOs and politicians who have resigned, NK, the Hawaii missile--that lend credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I look at the nation's leadership--Goldman Sachs guys, torturers, war mongers--and it becomes harder to believe.

        Marina Abramovic once had an art show in a slaughterhouse where she explained how to burn a body
       </a>
       (you have to drain the blood, stupid!). She also attended Satanist gatherings hosted by artists Thomas Lips in the 70s.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Spirit House' was first installed in a
        <em>
         former municipal slaughterhouse in Portugal
        </em>
        in 1997. Here, the separate parts of the installation developed a strong relation with the actual exhibition site. Being quite reminiscent of earlier works by Abramovic, 'Dissolution' shows the artist whipping herself with a lash until her back turns red and her body starts to tremble.
       </p>
       <p>
        The spectators who entered the space heard Marina's tape recorded voice,
        <em>
         arguing that the body cannot burn as long as blood flows and claiming that the spirit can actually never burn
        </em>
        . However, the installation was later exhibited at other locations, developing new meanings in this way.

       Nah, you said that in a previous comment. The Thomas Lips exhibition was based on parties she attended prior to her art performance, her autobiography states that she rejected the satanic aspects of them, but it's clear satanist symbology and mutilation were a part of it.

       They don't have to use the exact phrase when we have numerous references to food being used in out of place ways between the Podesta and Stratfor emails (international pizza website? channels for flying food?).

       If you saw every email, and the picture where they placed a slice of pizza over a child's face, and don't think any of that's suspicious at all, then we'll have to agree to disagree.

       I disagree because I am sure that Pizzagate is not at all confined to one party. It might have come to light due to Podesta, but I guarantee that Establishment Republicans are involved just like Democrats. Its sad that you feel the need to protect your "team" in this instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the dude's name is not a misunderstanding. People have simply speculated that James Alefantis is not his real name, and that he took the name due to his role in child sex trafficking to sound like "J'aime les enfants" , which translates to "I love children." These scum love to hide in plain sight and I like the theory, but nobody fucking knows. To call it a misunderstanding seems to be a misunderstanding on your part.

       Pizzagate is clearly partisan, only lately did it become "pedogate" and try and legitimise itself by association with real pedo rings.

       Just some suspicious emails that appear to possibly have been written in code. Alone, that wouldn't mean much, but combined with all the other suspicious shit it does. And of course cheese pizza was already a code word. But yes, he has plausible deniability, which I'm sure you will argue.

       I found the theory interesting from the start and it has always been associated with pedo rings. I've seen shills try to argue that it is only about Comet Pingpong and the alleged torture dungeon basement, but that's bullshit from my experiences.

       I'll take "creepy", but none of it is related to pedophilia nor suspicious.  Even look at that creepy balkan artist's paintings.  There's no pedophilia just frumpy pictures of kids with wedgies.    Really there's not a single pedophilia image in any of the corpus of "pizzagate" """""""evidence"""""""".

      <p>
       Really at best this is homophobia in action.  You think that a gay man saying he loves children is creepy or suspicious but what would you say if a straight white woman says she loves children in her profile??

       Nah man, no smear campaign. People that believe in it also cite the Franklin case from the '80s that was all Republicans. It's all about the elites and their pedophilia. Nothing to do with political parties. The theater of politics is for the profane masses to consume like any other form of entertainment.

       Your only recent activity on reddit is coming into PG threads and "debunking" them. It wouldn't be as suspicious if you frequented other subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how do you always arrive at these Pizzagate threads so quickly? Your level of activity suggests you're not very active on reddit, yet you're consistently and conveniently in these Pizzagate threads.

       And? shouldn't these heinous allegations be held to a high scrutiny?

       Or should we just accuse everyone of being a pedophile because they like pizza or music or art?

       Maybe he's trying to avoid harassment. That's why I created this account. As long as I don't manipulate my votes or break any rules, there's nothing wrong with having an account that only focuses on one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of pizzagate "investigators" personally attack anyone who challenges their theory. Often scouring through their post history in an effort to "investigate" (read: dox) them or simply to harass them. Notice how most everyone who responds to my posts (which I try to fill with actual info/reasoning) attacks me personally (often calling me or implying that I'm some kind of shill). Just imagine what they're PMing me. It's just easier to keep my regular account clean. Wouldn't surprise me if they're doing the same thing.

       Maybe nothing will, or maybe someone will make a mistake, or maybe someone will talk, or maybe some news will break (like NXIVM). People suspected Jimmy Saville for a long time, and the truth only came to light after his death. Who knows what will happen.

       We're not outright calling him a pedophiile, but would an innocent man threaten somebody else with their life, who presented evidence against them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, before you call Ryan a "merchandise profiteer" who faked the story, you should know that he filed a police report against James' death threat to him and his family. I'll see where this thread goes, but I may tag him in it later so he can elaborate.

       His post amounts to: "You don't really know that he was talking in code." Calling people who discuss pizzagate "crazies" is not really addressing pizzagate. And saying that cheese pizza doesn't appear in emails is pointless because people are alleging that the code word "cheese pizza" has been shortened to "pizza," probably to be less suspicious and because its shorter.

       I think "pizza" is used to refer to pedophilia, not just pornography. I don't know what she was trying to say because I don't know if any of the other words, such as "handkerchief" or "map" might be code as well!

       No, I think pizza is likely a code word derived from "cheese pizza" referring to pedophilia. I have no idea what a white with black handkerchief with a pizza-related map could be. There has been plenty of speculation about what white w/ black and map could mean, I'm sure you've probably read it.

       This is the weirdest aspect of your belief system that I just can't comprehend.  Do you know what a handkerchief is?  It's a square of cloth.  You can print on cloth.  So for example you could print a black map on a white square of cloth.  This could be a keepsake for a "normie" who has sentimentality and emotions.  So a real estate agent is asking if he wants his keepsake handkerchief back that might have sentimental value.  How could this possibly be inuendo?

       You can get keepsake handkerchiefs printed with whatever you want on it.  No doubt there are hundreds of keepsake black and white handkerchiefs out there.  People that wear suits and have highly social jobs (like lobbyists) often keep handkerchiefs in them to wipe their faces.

       So you're saying can take any word and swap it around and turn it into whatever you want.  That's true.  In the same set of emails you can turn "pizza" into a code word for "cocaine" and "pasta" into "heroin" and now he's an international drug smuggler.   So how are you so sure he's a pedophile and not a cocaine smuggler?
      </p>

       Usually to establish a pattern of code words you have to have some results - ie. some victim of child abuse or other evidence of it - to correlate to the pattern of code words.   For example code-breakers for the Allies can correlate an encoded message to a U-boat attack in the Atlantic.  They didn't just ascribe random meaning to the encoded messages.  This is what's missing from the pizzagate speculation.

       As someone who has been a subscriber to the conspiracy sub for probably 12 years or more, I've been strangely avoiding the whole Pizzagate issue.  I can't justify why, but I have.  But pocketfulofstones post here caught my attention, and I greatly appreciate it!  Now I'm delving into your link, TheRiseofMindhawk, and greatly appreciating that as well.  These are the kind of things that keep

       You said when others complain about brigading, it's cause they cant deal with people disagreeing with them.

       Now here you are, saying that other people (who disagree with you) are brigading.

       The shills have been quite this week for some reason. It seems to run in cycles. They go hard for a couple of months then drop off for a week or so. Maybe a contract cycle or pulling back to gauge their efficacy?

       Nah, they don't seem to care so much now.  I think they were in panic mode at the start because Alefantis' child-trafficking / pedo haven almost got exposed, but by now they've likely moved operations somewhere else.

       I’m all for pedogate and aspects of pizzagate, but one unproven fact that gets touted all the time is the coded words and their meaning, which have never been confirmed and gets conflated with the fbis pedo logos. All from a 4chan page in every breakdown. Big hole there.

       It's so bizarre that there was an obvious conspiracy to smear a political candidate and their campaign as pedophiles, with zero actual evidence and a ton of blatantly falsified evidence, and no one is focused on
       <em>

       You've got to be either purposeful or willfully ignorant to be so dismissive about people at the center of interest in #pizzagate when they've chosen to surround themselves with so much imagery associated with pedophilia. It would be like ignoring a person wearing a shirt that said, "I hate &lt;racial slur&gt;'s" and try to pawn it off as nothing more than paranoia when people point out that person is likely a racist. The media wouldn't be so dismissive as they have these very well connected people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it looks like a racist and quacks like a racist, it's probably a racist. If it looks like a pedophile and quacks like a pedophile, nothing to see here you paranoid crackpots...right?

       This is the "omg isn't this art weird??!?" argument. 2 of the 100's of bands who've performed at Comet are probably creeps. Hell, Podesta is probably a creep himself, but that's not evidence of Pizzagate being real. You're also not addressing all the points I just made.

       Which aspect of pizzagate isn't real? Because it has sort of become a catch all term. Do you mean that elite pedo rings don't exist, or that James alefantis is not connected to an elite pedo ring?

       He was like #49 on a list that included a bunch of non-politicians, and it was in trashy and pointless GQ magazine if I recall. Of course they can be involved but no evidence has actually suggested this, that's my point. And many fabricated things were presented as "evidence" in their cases.

       I have been keeping up with the media around pizzagate like some people keep up with Game of Thrones.  I have not seen any actual imagery associated with pedophilia yet, especially not chosen by any of the people who are supposedly directly involved. I look at OP's link and there's none.

         They don't have to use the exact phrase when we have numerous references to food being used in out of place ways between the Podesta and Stratfor emails (international pizza website? channels for flying food?). If you saw every email, and the picture where they placed a slice of pizza over a child's face, and don't think any of that's suspicious at all, then we'll have to agree to disagree

       Are we talking about Podesta or Stratfor here?  I'm fairly certain that Podesta never worked for any federal intelligence service, so what do they have to do with eachother?  And that ordering pizza for a work meeting is fairly nocuous.

       You say this, but then you talk about secret codes all over the place.  The entire allegation is based on speculation about secret codes.  Without secret codes you have nothing.  Within this very post you wrote, you say in #1 there are secret codes, and then by #3 you say no secret codes.

       There is no evidence.  You're presenting speculation.  People have addressed it and you have no counterpoints because there is no evidence.  In your own blog post, with most of the """evidence""" for pizzagate ever presented in one place,
       <strong>

       This goes back to the handkerchief thing.  The concept of wearing a suit and having a handkerchief is foreign to you, so you speculate that it's something nefarious to have a handkerchief with a map on it.  Same with the art, same with running a pizza shop in a yuppie neighborhood and having a walk-in freezer or doing work in a basement.   That government employees can order pizza for a meeting and joke about it.  Have you ever had a job???

       its called confirmation bias, you went looking to find something and you did. you're seeing what you want to see. any number of pedophiles is too many pedophiles. and yes 100&amp;#37; there are horrific people out there preying on children. but they arent all in cahoots and they arent all conveniently the people you disagree with politically.

       Me too!! I was never convinced of anything relating to it until the media redefined it as a sex slave ring run out of Comet's basement and called it debunked without asking a single question that we were asking.

       Otherwise, yeah great job. Only one thing I’d add is a list of confirmed cases of elite pedophillia which you added a few like Hastert and Epstein, but that list can be lengthened. I just think that adds to the validity of people wrapping their heads around this. From a laymen’s perspective it’s a pretty far out there conspiracy. No one wants to think evil exist like that. Especially when they run our government,

       It did seem pretty ironic that a known pedophile was accusing Hillary of being a pedo. They could have done some research at least to try to make a convincing story, it was just so full of holes from the beginning. Child sex ring in basement of pizza shop, a pizza shop with no basement, sitting on shale.

       We are told the work on
       <a href="/r/Pizzagate">
        /r/Pizzagate
       </a>
       (and other message boards) is illegitimate because people are rushing to conclusions, or because they are being paranoid, or partisan (despite so many of different political complexions provably working together). The subtitle here of course is that the State is solely legitimate to suspect and investigate crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if the State itself is, in a systemic way, responsible for said crimes? It wouldn’t be a first; after all, democide (death by government, a word surprisingly absent from conversations) was the first cause of non-natural deaths in the 20th century. Whether one is from the right, left, or center, one cannot deny government is the number one abuser, enslaver and serial-killer in History. We may honestly disagree on the ways to eradicate the phenomenon, or we may regret that fact, but we cannot deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the State itself is committing crimes, it is the people’s sovereign and sacred duty to expose it. Those who understand this truth best tend to become journalists. At least, that’s what drove me to the profession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now specifically on this work. First, there is context; institutional child abuse is already a common-knowledgephenomenon. From the Presidio affair to Jimmy Saville and the BBC, or from the Vatican’s historic involvement in covering-up pedophilia to US legislators’ documented trips on the “Lolita Express”, from the questions still surrounding Dutroux to the Hampstead doubts, the scourge has been featured in the news, movies, documentaries, art work. There have also been many policymakers, prosecutors, investigators and victims denouncing the very phenomenon; see for example British MP John Mann passionate speech before Parliament on the subject last year, or the extensive report by former undercover Interpol agent (Bannon). Indeed it is a secret de Polichinelle. So the only possible disagreement can be on the scale and systemicity of the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       To honestly decide whether that’s what we are seeing in the Podesta emails, please have a look at this one example. Look at the invitation at the end of the thread. Ms Luzzatto is inviting people (among which are John and Mary Podesta) to a farm in Lovettsville. This is what she says:
      </p>
      <p>
       We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Impossible, you say? They couldn’t possibly be speaking about abusing the children! After all, what step-grandmother would offer three innocent children up for group abuse?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how invitee Drew Littman answers the invitation:
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren’t aware, Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina’s 3rd congressional district; in DC he’s regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreed, if that example was the only one, one could dismiss it as baroque misinterpretation. But there’s more, much more. Let’s not even get into the handkerchiefs and codewords – even though “cheese pizza” is a known euphemism for “child porn” (and there are abundant examples in the Podesta emails where that term is used in very strange and out-of-context manners).
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the fact that John and Tony Podesta are old friends of Jeffery Epstein, Dennis Hastert and Clement Freud, three convicted child molesters? Who has so many child rapists as friends? Who stays friends with child rapists after they’re exposed and convicted?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the Katy Grannan photos plastered around the Podestas’ mansion, depicting naked teenagers?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about Tony Podesta writing he’s “very good and a little wired” from being seated next to “the kids” on an airplane?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the underground vault on the Podestas’ property which admittedly allows them to watch “very complicated video pieces”?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are feeling ill-at-ease, that reaction is honorable. And the worse thing is you haven’t yet seen much. But for more, you’ll have to look for it. Indeed one might be breaking statutory laws by linking to some of the clues Internet sleuths have found in the past three weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, did you know James Alefantis, listed 49th “most influential” person in DC by GQ, chef and White House regular, boyfriend of David Brock, owner of Comet Ping Pong, had an Instagram account filled with references to and depictions of child abuse and torture? Indeed it’s not just the frescoes in his restaurant or the “artists” he hosts there; it’s not even the fact his menu and the logos of three other iconic businesses next door feature FBI-recognizedpedophilia symbols. No, this is about his own posts, pictures, comments and friends on social media. Again, you’ll have to look it up for yourself. It is hardly ambiguous. Indeed it is Alefantis who puts the pizza in #Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that surprises you, did you know Arun Rao was caught “liking” several of Alefantis’ creepiest toddler Instagram posts? Again, that could be dismissed – only there’s all this context, and the fact Mr Rao is a Assistant US attorney, and charged with prosecuting child pornography and abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you’re still not distinguishing the pattern, did you know that Laura Silsby (Gayler), the woman caught trying tosmuggle thirty-three children out of Haiti (a country where the Clinton Foundation isn’twithoutcontroversy), whose release from jail became a personalmatterfor Ms Clinton, thereafter became an associate of MyStateUSA, which changed its name to AlertSense, and which is the one providing the technology to issue Amber Alerts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough already. If anything I have proven the legitimacy of the following question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC, as we already suspect there is one in Hollywood?
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of national systemicity, the statistics are eloquent. The International Centre for Missing Children (ICMEC) estimates that 8 million children are reported missing each year around the world. Of that number, according to U.S. Department of Justice research, an estimated 800,000 children will go missing in the United States alone — a rate of over 2’000 missing children each day — with 466,949 of those cases entered into the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database in 2014. With a current child population (aged 0 – 17) of around 74 million in the United States, the U.S. Department of Justice figures equate to around 1 child in every 92 going missing in the United States each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       This looks like a systemic problem indeed. Childhood disappearances outnumber cancer deaths in the United States by one third.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, given the sheer amount of leaked emails, and the suspected phenomenon’s scale and repartition, it is likely the data dumps (Podesta and other Wikileaks, Guccifer 1/2, DNCLeaks, etc.) provide some clue to the problem. Therefore, they should be investigated thoroughly under than particular lens, and suspicions need to be corroborated with other (and previously) known facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, my fellow journalists, why aren’t you all looking into this? Is it easy for you to dismiss it as confirmation bias?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not going to answer the question for you. At least hop on the bandwagon: this is coming out with or without your help. But remember some moments are defining, in one’s career, for one’s conscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll conclude with two excerpts of the Munich Declaration of the Duties and Rights of Journalists (kind of our own Hippocratic Oath).
      </p>
      <p>
       The responsibility of journalists vis-a-vis the public has precedence over any other responsibility, in particular towards their employers and the public power.
      </p>
      <p>
       [A journalist’s duties include] respecting the truth no matter what consequences it may bring about to him, … defending the freedom of information, of commentaries and of criticism, [and] not suppressing essential information.
      </p>
      <p>
       … and one question:
      </p>
      <p>
       If this doesn’t matter, what does?

       Trump is connected to Epstein. They're all in the same cult. US Federal government is completely compromised. Party is irrelevant. The left-right paradigm is invalid. Left-hand occultism versus right-hand occultism. White vs. Black magick. Both hands owned by the same Baphomet.

       I joined the r/pizzagate when it was only like 1000 subscribed and I remember how quickly things changed. It made me question just how much I trust social media sites like Reddit especially after all the correct the record shills changing the narrative through paid coersion. They knew that if they repeated the same lie through multiple "trusted" sources that people would eventually believe what they were saying. Thats why we still have to hear about Russia even now.

       John didn't attend the spirit cooking dinner which was a dinner party for supporters which was publicised on kickstarter.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “I’m outraged, because this is taken completely out of my context,” Abramovic told me by phone this afternoon. She was at Sean Kelly Gallery, her rep in New York. The dinner, she explained, was a reward for donors to a Kickstarter campaign she had run. Tony Podesta has collected her work since the 1990s, and he attended, but John couldn’t make it. In fact, she has never met John Podesta.

       I disagree because I am sure that Pizzagate is not at all confined to one party. It might have come to light due to Podesta, but I guarantee that Establishment Republicans are involved just like Democrats. Its sad that you feel the need to protect your "team" in this instance.

       And the dude's name is not a misunderstanding. People have simply speculated that James Alefantis is not his real name, and that he took the name due to his role in child sex trafficking to sound like "J'aime les enfants" , which translates to "I love children." These scum love to hide in plain sight and I like the theory, but nobody fucking knows. To call it a misunderstanding seems to be a misunderstanding on your part.

       Nah man, no smear campaign. People that believe in it also cite the Franklin case from the '80s that was all Republicans. It's all about the elites and their pedophilia.
