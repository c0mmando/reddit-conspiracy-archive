       has been stickying his own comments in his own threads claiming they are all being brigaded with no supporting evidence. Why cant we have rules here against mods treating their owns posts specially? Why do calls claiming brigading by regular users get removed but mods can sticky such claims in their own posts?

       The mods are not brand new, there was an attempted coup last year that removed all of the mods. When admins stepped in and re-added them, it reset their added dates to all be the same. Now that doesn't address any of your other concerns, but I thought I should at least explain the issue with the dates.

       Plus the brigades here are a gravely serious issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a week or so ago there were top-rated comments here, from people who had never posted before, saying that there is no reason to mistrust the mainstream media and that offensive speech doesn't count as free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was getting so bad that the sub was almost unusuable. I love freedom as much as anyone, but subs without moderation are easily subverted or overwhelmed.

       I'm going to try to keep my own opinions on moderation to myself since I'm already on thin ice around here, but in addition to brigades we also have a huge problem with trolls. "Regular" users who seem to go out of their way to post divisive topics and comments and start arguments. There is one who has used at least 35 different accounts to keep coming back after being banned. Another one has been banned numerous times (including again today) but is never given anything more than a temporary 3 day ban. Brigading can be hard to prove at times but these trolls are 100% transparent and yet they are still allowed to continue. I just don't get it sometimes.

       And my point is proven. “Was anti-Hillary”. Things have changed, and have shifted towards the views of the rest of reddit. This place was co-opted because it was exposing things about Hillary and Obama etc. now it’s just a smaller r/politics

       It’s not that the posts here are even conspiracies anymore. They are democrat talking points. Just because Trump won doesn’t mean that everything Hillary and the government officials, current and former, that helped her just get forgotten. This place has been co-opted and if you can’t see it, you’re part of the cancer that has infected this place.

       You have a funny way of determining proof. Everyone still hates Hillary, but she lost, and shrunk back into the shadows like I warned you all she would. Until she starts making more public moves, the person who deserves the most scrutiny is the president, not someone who ran against the president and lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you, but I don't know many republicans, so all I hear and see all day is "fuck Trump", and this is coming from people I wouldn't trust my Politics 095 homework with, if you catch my nudge. So yeah, I, like many others here, have taken to the guy a bit more over the last year. Why? Because his detractors are traditionally even more full of shit than he is, which is tremendous!
      </p>
      <p>
       You could use common ground to relate, or you could finger punt and name call. I don't care for Trump, and have thought he was a scumbag for over twenty years, as many if us knew of his exploits long before he ran for President (which will never sound natural, calling him president).
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds to me like you had hoped for Hillary, or at least for a quiet win from Trump, and now you're upset. Me, personally, I don't vote and consider anyone who does vote (or believes in the process) to be at least partially brain dead. Anyone who isn't critical of elected officials due to party is brain washed, and anyone who likes Hillary is brainless.

       She literally goes around giving speeches about how we need to “stand up to Trump”, and all her cronies that attempted to rig the election do the same thing. AKA John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey and on and on. Trump is a shitty person, cool I agree. Doesn’t mean he can’t do good things.

       I’d bet money you didn’t have an issue with it in 2008. Either way, if the republicans controlling all three branches of the government was as big of an issue as you seem to think it is, why haven’t they instated a Christian Theocracy or banned abortions or gay marriage. Nothing they have done is anywhere near to the apocalyptic theories that we’ve heard.

       That means you believe those that hold power can’t conspire against those that are. An example would be assassination attempts on Hitler by the German Army. Watch Operation Valkyrie. Those men didn’t hold complete power

       Wow way to put words in my mouth. I never said any party had no power. They are of course capable of conspiracies also. Currently, the power balance is heavily tilted however and most of the exploitation will be by the party in power.

       You said conspiracies “require” power. If one doesn’t have “power” they can’t conspire then. But that isn’t true in any way. And the power balance is not heavily titled otherwise everything Trump did would be easily achieved with little to no pushback. Everything he does gets slammed in the media. You can’t claim that he has it easy. It simply isn’t true.

       I should have said I focus on the group with the
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       power. Everything anyone does in a society requires power. Whether this power is money, physical intimidation, politics, favors, charity, etc.

      <p>
       It is not a all or nothing game. Of course any party will have power. They won't have equal power though.
      </p>
      <p>
       All my point was, is that you shouldn't think a conspiracy forum has been co-opted when the conspiracies will usually come from the group with the most influence.

       The reason I say it was co-opted is because before/during the election this place was extremely on top of the dealings of the Clintons, the backwards ways of the media, the potential assassination of the person that leaked the DNC emails and all sorts of other things. Now it’s just anti Trump, just like the rest of reddit. We know reddit is no fan of Trump, we know seemingly unbiased places on this site are extremely biased.

       He's only been in for 16 months, buddy.  If he gets a couple more SCOTUS appointments those things are a possibility.   The system is built to withstand authoritarian demagogues like trumff, but with majorities in both houses they could bypass those safeguards.

       You’re acting as if the Republicans like Trump. Republicans hate Trump. They are the counter to the Democrats, and vice versa. Trump threatens the system because he isn’t one of them. If a some Joe blow walks into a some fancy ass country club and starts to hang out there, the regulars would hate the guy. Trump is the Joe blow in this scenario. He doesn’t belong to their political system, and if he succeeds it shows the rest of the country that anyone can get into politics and do good no matter who you are.

       World news just banned my GF because they said she was avoifing my ban. Guess the whole families banned now hahaha conspiracy mods at least will reason with you after a week or so to let it cool down. But still kind of shitty mods grab power and act all important with it and reddit doesnt allow a way to have anyone to appeal a mods actions to. Anyone could get so someone in a mod role and delete and ban anything they don't like and no one can stop them. Its kind of authoritarian and against the 2 creators core for this site.

       I find it extremely questionable that axotl peyotle (sp?) pretty much controls the content in here singlehandedly. Are you a mod, or are you a user? Mods using their privileges to control content should be highly offensive. It's almost like fake news =O

       Not saying dude\ chick doesn't have some valuable insights, but you don't get to be a player and a referee simultaneously without being called a fucking cheater. Now look at the "round table discussion" of the week, and it's 100% paranormal, has nothing to do with conspiracy. I'm way into paranormal stuff, as most people here are I imagine, but I come here STRICTLY for conspiracy. Posting paranormal stuff here is the same as posting "dude that song by NOFX is so woke brah" or "look at my dick y'all" or anything else completely off topic that should be flagged as spam and removed.

       Someone said there was an "attempted" coup. What ever happened to the mod known as Sarah Connor? Sin your teeth in.

       I'm obviously not who you're talking about, and I'm not even a mod. BUT..despite the age of this current account, I've been a reddit user for going on 11 years and an r/conspiracy user not much less than that.

      <p>
       I only bring that up because this is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       sub I've ever been subscribed to where people complain about the mods being very active contributors to the sub they are modding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       implying the mods here shouldn't be active contributors altogether. I'm just saying I see that sort of sentiment here
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       , and in my experience not really seen elsewhere. It's interesting.

       I'm reasonably certain the Roundtable discussions are voted on by the users, no? It's the same with deciding if something gets stickied, except for that the mods vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I get that in your opinion paranormal stuff doesn't belong here, but the paranormal has been tied to conspiracy theory for as long as conspiracy theory forums have existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are forums somewhere that are strictly conspiracy, but they are the minority in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides - many people do consider things like the paranormal, supernatural, etc to be conspiracy theories themselves. Many people believe the government knows about aliens, ghosts, other dimensions. They're intimately attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm not entirely sure how things like the paranormal being discussed in a roundtable thread shows mod corruption. Unless that was more of an unrelated rant.

       You're one of the few people here who sees a vote and doesn't immediately think of potential corruption. A single moderator here is by a landslide the most frequent poster. It's a conflict of interest whether you want to admit it or not, and you obviously won't admit it, as you've been here for eleven years, whatever that
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       means. To me it eludes to some thought that you know better than those who have a number of less than 11 next to their name. Your karma must be pretty high too, huh? You win then, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're clearly grasping at straws. Go ahead and tell us some of your best ghost laden conspiracies. That should be pretty easy, as there's a roundtable discussing Ghosts on a conspiracy Reddit... right? Keep up the good work.

       Weaponized reason. I have no problem splashing my conspiracy with the paranormal when it makes sense. Ghosts, possession, and the afterlife are inherently free of conspiracy, though we can link the perpetuation of these themes to Christianity, and build a conspiracy out of an "A+B=$" model.

       Wow, inherently? Isn't the afterlife, or the conceptions of it, the GRAND conspiracy?  That shows to me a major lack of reason, not "weaponized reason".  And that is not even scratching the surface of conspiracies and cover-ups dealing with those topics that Lulzorr alluded to.

       And also, it is alludes. Not "eludes" as you used it.  Reason, indeed.

       No, the afterlife is not "the GRAND conspiracy", if it exists. The use of the brief of the afterlife would be considered conspiratorial, but not the thing itself. You're walking backwards if alludes-not-eludes is your next-best quip. Stay on topic, and make points rather than asking dumbass questions of my points. That's how debating your position
       <em>
        should

       work, unless you're trying to undermine my points with doubt, which is the weakest possible strategy. Weaponized reason is the act of using anti-facts to debase evidence and fact. We have some real BS craftsmen around here, as you know.

       Very logical questions unless you know the definition of the word conspiracy, in which case they become dumbass questions. I never called you a dumbass, and that's for two reasons. One, I'm not trying to get booted when you cry and suck your thumb to your favorite admin. Second, you're pitching these dumbass questions with obvious intent.

       So you understand that something cam be conspiracy related while not being a conspiracy itself, yet you're yammering on about concepts and other semantic sidetracking in order to make something without consciousness a conspiracy instead of just conspiracy related.

       I've always wondered WHY, Flytape and Dronepuppet did what they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they complain about admins doing nothing, but admins gave them the sub back.

       Sometimes you just gotta wonder what happened in the alternative timelines. What if.
