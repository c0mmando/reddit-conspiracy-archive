       On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.
      </p>
      <p>
       These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been a public service announcement by: the Friends of the FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, SEC, MSM, White House, NIST, and the 9/11 Commission. Because Ignorance is Strength.

       I still scratch my head to this day, as to why they even bothered including this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does his dialysis have to do with his the capability of telling people what to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does a satellite phone, laptop or his location make 9/11 more difficult or unbelievable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you oppose a madman in a confined space armed with a knife - Yes, boxcutters are knives. When hijackings typically involved survival?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so sophisticated about hijacking a plane?

       Amen. Seems like when certain ppl disagree with you, rather than having a logical, positive exchange, they go on the attack. There is way too much fuckery with 9/11 for it just to be a terrorist attack by Osama. This other user is just trying to push buttons at this point.

        What's so sophisticated about hijacking a plane?

       My cousin was a UAL pilot. He told me there is not a commercial airline pilot who ever flew, who would give up his charge and responsibilty to a guy with a boxcutter - let alone four aircraft.

       So instead they succumbed to the threats of bombs - Not necessarily seeing the bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the threat of being shot, but not necessarily realizing the gun was fake.
      </p>

       Whereas box cutters are real and in your face - you can't dismiss the threat when you realise the following:

       Unless you're fat as fuck, a box cutter will do a fine job of bleeding you dry very quickly.

       I assume you bothered to look over your list. Since all four hijacking occurred in the US on 9/11- let's examine all the US events and likely protocol in the 15 years before 9/11. There were two hardly giving you victory lap rights.

       April 7, 1994: FedEx Flight 705 experienced an *
       <em>
        attempted hijack *
       </em>
       by disgruntled employee Auburn Calloway as it left Memphis, Tennessee
      </p>
      <p>
       January 11, 1987: A Continental Airlines DC-9 was hijacked in flight by Norwood Emanuel on Jan. 11, 1987.
       <strong>
        Captain Mark Meyer was credited with thwarting the hijacking
       </strong>
       by quickly landing at Dulles International outside of Washington D.C..

       Gee hot shot, put the handcuffs on. He was a domestic American pilot and that is what he said to me. And the US hijack record (that you provided) supports him 100% in terms of his personal experience and knowledge and I would say conclusion.

       Dude. You're not looking like the brightest bulb in the pack. Hijackings had happened before 9/11. None really had much success. You couldn't hijack a fucking bus in rural Michigan with a box cutter but you seem to think planes are much simpler targets for some reason. The fact that Pentagon air space was invaded and literally nothing happened should be enough for any reasonable person to question this.

       Commercial pilots are trained to squawk a universal hijack code (7500) if they are subject to an attempted hijacking, thereby notifying FAA controllers on the ground. The fact is that not one of the eight pilots (4 Pilots and 4 Co Pilots) on the four hijacked planes performed this action.
      </p>
      <p>
       “To communicate to air traffic control that an aircraft is being hijacked, a pilot under duress should squawk 7500 or vocally, by radio communication, transmit “(Aircraft callsign); Transponder seven five zero zero.”

       If I said no body would spend $1 for a penny. It’s true, granted there are people who would do that and you would think somethings wrong with them or there was a catch like those printed pennies.

       You think the hijackers didn't know this?
      </p>
      <p>
       The location of the Mode A panel is common knowledge, and emergency squawks are even more common knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible the hijackers moved fast enough to prevent 7500 being set.
      </p>
      <p>
       The setting of 7500 is a very serious step, if the door was opened and trouble detected, it's reasonable to imagine that the first thought of the crew was to see what's happening rather than squawk straight away.

       Not after 9/11 certainly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But before then it was a simple door, rarely locked and certainly not armoured. Many pilots flew with the door open, which you certainly could not do now.

       The sophisticated part was flying those planes at speeds so near sea level they should be breaking apart and controlling them like seasoned biplane trick pilots. All while the U.S. Air Force couldn't seem to muster a single plane to intercept, even though there was plenty of time and ample bases. Oh, that's right, they were all involved in an exercise that just so happened to be about hijacked planes and everyone was confused. Allowing a plane to hit THE PENTAGON, which could have been THE WHITE HOUSE, or THE CAPITAL.  Like last years Superbowl, there was no defense to be seen whatsoever.

       More than wobble. Planes can start to break apart flying so fast in such thick air. At those speeds they were going, one little microscopic nudge of the yoke could send it offline by hundreds of feet. Yet these barely trained pilots flew them like the Red Baron.

       I don't know what to tell you about the rest of this, but I work in dialysis. Sure, many of them would be fully capable of telling others what to do but if you are on dialysis you can't get far from that machine for a long period of time. You go more than a few days without running and you have to go the hospital because you can't breathe. You have to have special chemicals to cleanse the blood and specifically purified water to use. Not to mention the medications you have to take on top of that. This would be difficult to pull of hidden in a cave with no trace of your whereabouts.

       Oh yea, it definitely seems like someone powerful had to be involved in the discrediting effort too. I mean, just look at his
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar">
        Wikipedia page
       </a>
       . Count how many times on there they talk about there being no records of him attending the schools he claimed to hold degrees from (MIT being one of them). Are you trying to tell me that this guy
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       go to any schooling, but was somehow still qualified enough to be contracted with NASA, and expose Area 51 to the public?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about this one!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lazar claims to have worked as a scientist "in the Meson Physics facility" at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. His name does appear in a Los Alamos National Lab telephone directory; however, this lists both employees and contractors, and Stanton Friedman claims that he actually worked as a technician for Kirk Meyer, an outside contractor.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...ok? So he did work at least WITH them. Why phrase it to make it seem like he's lying about that too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why is this Youtuber "Jim Piver" spamming this comment all over that comment section?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3/28/18  -- - Roswell, New Mexico - - - - - -  We visited the International UFO Museum here. Not a single mention of Bob Lazar. Not a word.

       Uhh yea, if anything that would tell me he's probably MORE LIKELY to be legit, when the fucking "International UFO Museum" won't mention him. It's not like they are the pinnacle of only using highly credible and well vetted sources, lol amirite?

       Yeah it’s a bit of a head scratcher. I mean they suicided Phil Schneider in 1993. There are so many secret space program whistleblowers that have come forward in the last 5-10 years that it seems like TPTB can’t keep the lid on through violence and intimidation alone.

       Unsurprisingly, the official video from Corbett's channel
       <em>
        doesn't even show up
       </em>
       when you try to search for it on YT. You'll get reuploads from other users, but nothing from the official channel. Youtube is the worst. Can't even find decent content on there anymore.

       They work for the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, if everything about their investigation was on the straight and level, why would they keep it a secret? Remember, this is 9/11 we're talking about, which didn't get an enquiry (and never got a proper one) until they caved in to public pressure.

       Ok I feel like my question isn't being understood. So this photo is likely from the debris recovery after the Pentagon was hit, and the arrows are pointing at FBI agents who should NOT be there? I'm basically asking for a source, because I'd like to learn more about the people with arrows pointing at them. Is that possible?

       Who gathered up the debris? Who confiscated the film from 80-something cameras that may have shown exactly what hit the Pentagon? Who has kept all of that hidden away from the public ever since?

       The maneuver to hit the pentagon could only have been performed by a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the first jet, I believe, that hit the first tower made another impressive turn, as if it were routine to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this would suggest these planes, at least the tower jets, were remotely controlled. If I had to guess, some of these turns were upwards to sustained 6G turns, judging by velocity and the maneuvers.

       And airplanes, especially, typically, American-made airplanes are typically capable of tolerating much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're not supposed to be stock into it. It's a guess based on memory. Improbable isn't the same as impossible, but what are we talking about anyway? A plane apparently hit the pentagon? And clearly isolated the damage to one area? The floors immediately beside and behind had fire damage but little else. Doesn't that seem improbable, if you were to believe the official story? As improbable as a 6G descending from 8,000 feet to hit a building no taller than 50ft at 500 mph. All done by somebody who trained in a cesna, apparently.

       Depends on the individuals tolerances. A G-suit will squeeze the pilots legs and arms to keep from blood leaving the brain, in such a case when blood is emptied from the head all control of a person's head and neck ceases, their eyes go blind and it's even difficult for them to tell. But a trained pilot can refine techniques, the G-suit merely augments these techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fighter pilots practice this sort of thing, but to a common person a 3G turn, or 3 times 1 normal gravitational pull, I.E. your 8 pound head feels like 24 pounds is sometimes enough to force a black out on people. Youtube G Force training of modern fighter pilots to see what I'm talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was somebody sitting in that plane they would have needed to be trained for this. Not to mention, it isn't like a 747 type of craft is designed for that kind of thing either. That would suggest to me, in turn, that the pilot wasn't new, he wasn't some random guy who recently learned how to fly a single engine prop plane. He was a pilot that knew his aircraft very well and knew the limits and how to handle it and probably wasn't sitting in the cockpit physically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare the aircraft weights, which at first I would have personally guessed, a Cesna vs a 747, to be 1:10 in weight. I was completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 747 weighs roughly 404,000 pounds. Compare that to a F-15, which is also giant, ~54,000 pounds fully loaded. These are HUGE aircraft!! Heavy American jets.
      </p>
      <p>
       A cesna weighs 1,600 pounds. Lighter than most cars!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Their flight characteristics are NOTHING alike!! Not to mention the speed differences. 100 mph vs 500 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an example of Americans failing to think critically for themselves, blindly believing what the TV says because the alternate would mean claiming responsibility and acknowledging there is a BIG lie going on(the rest of the world didn't fall victim to this and thought Americans were insane). Make the lie big and keep repeating it - Hitler or Goebbels said something like that.

       Instead of listing the weights, knowing I'm not an expert(actually I don't care at all for modern planes and openly admit to not being an expert on them), why not just list the weights and point out the flaw? Maybe help grow all of our knowledge, but maybe you're not here for that.

       I never studied the type of jets used because frankly there are bigger holes in the story. Thanks for pointing out the inaccuracy and helping expand everybody's knowledge, as I said before, though I doubt that's what you're doing. I doubt you know what you're doing here in fact.

       I also remember hearing something about "wing wobble", but have never heard it referenced since. Is there any validity to the idea that the speed the first plane was traveling (that hit the first WTC) would have experienced too much air resistance at such a low altitude, which would have ripped the wings off?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm paraphrasing a lot obviously, just interested to see if anyone here knows more about that phenomenon.

       It's my understanding that at a high enough velocity it could be possible. Like how you can do some

       if it's going fast enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I agree. The outter steel structure of the WTC, and the fact that the architect specifically stated that the building would be able to withstand a (commercial?) plane impact, makes me super suspicious.

       Just gonna put this out there... architects are not trained in thermodynamics. Or compounding failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       To his credit, the tower
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       survive an aircraft collision. The architect however did not anticipate how cheap insulation around the steel members could be blown off by the explosion, nor how burning jet fuel could weaken the supporting columns. In addition, no one had ever built a tower like this before, so a lot of the safety assessment came from calculations. Calculations run 3 years before we landed on the moon. From an era with much smaller passenger planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this piece of evidence only seem reliable when paired with everything else? Or can a building-artist from the 60s prove with mathematical rigor that an untested structural column design can survive every single event resulting from a collision with a commercial airliner 40 years in the future, with no mistakes?

       I just did. I don't think someone saying something with zero documentation should be counted as evidence. There's no record of any testing models or calculations analyzing an airplane collision, just the architect's word and a single memo to PANJNY saying that testing was done with a 707. They never say what the tests were, or give any results.

      <p>
       Why do you say a progressive collapse is slow? Have you measured the rate of collapse, or are you just eye-balling it?

       The architect designed it that way, this summarizes it well:

      <p>
       A progressive collapse is relatively slow by definition, that's why its progressive. One floor  falls onto the other. Of course planted explosives would speed up collapse, they gut the building from within instead of top down.

        It really doesn't. This is going to be the third time I have to say this: there is NO RECORD of any crash analysis on the WTC towers. There is a single memo that claims the analysis was performed. The
        <del>
         architect
        </del>
        structural engineer claims he performed the calculations. NO ONE ELSE on his staff even recalls seeing anything like the calculations:
        <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc_707_impact.html">
         http://www.911myths.com/html/wtc_707_impact.html
        </a>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       1.A: Even if we could verify his calculations with modern methods (which we can't, seeing as he "lost" his calculations), he explicitly stated he did an analysis for an
       <em>
        emergency
       </em>
       <em>
        landing
       </em>
       in
       <em>
        low
       </em>
       <em>
        visibility
       </em>
       . That meant low speeds and minimum fuel. If the plane had more fuel, ATC would have redirected it to an airport with better visibility.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=progressive+collapse">
         http://lmgtfy.com/?q=progressive+collapse
        </a>
        . A progressive collapse is called progressive because it means one element's failure causes the next element's failure. This is a very fast process.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       2.A: Stop thinking that common sense is all you need to understand building demolition. You can't "speed up" or "slow down" a collapse.  When the top levels of a building start pancaking down, those beams aren't going to hold for dramatic effect, they just
       <em>
        break
       </em>
       instantly. After the first layer, the loss of momentum is marginal.
      </p>

       BONUS ROUND: that link you sent is full of lies, here's a highlight reel:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Both technical calculations and testimony from WTC structural engineers confirm that the Twin Towers were built to withstand the impact from the passenger jets that hit them on 9/11.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The lead structural engineer was unable to produce the calculations he used.
       </li>
       <li>
        Calculations do not confirm whether something happened. They can confirm the design matches building codes and engineering guidelines, but that's a step away from saying the codes were sufficient.
       </li>
       <li>
        Designed to withstand =/= built to withstand. See Citigroup Center for more on how contractors can nearly cause catastrophe by not following design.
       </li>
       <li>
        Again, low-fuel, low-speed 707 =/= high-speed 767. The only reason high-speed ever comes up is because of the PANYNJ white paper (readable here at page 305
        <a href="https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101012">
         https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101012
        </a>
        ). Robertson continues to deny that his calculations ever went above 200 mph. It would appear 600 mph was an exaggeration by the Port Authority.
       </li>
       <li>
        Despite most of this sentence being wrong, it still doesn't say anything meaningful because the towers
        <em>
         did
        </em>
        survive being hit by the planes. The cause of collapse was weakened steel beams from burning jet fuel and lack of insulation over the beams, a compound issue that structural engineers had never considered before.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In designing the towers to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707, the designers would have assumed that the aircraft was operated normally. So they would have assumed that the aircraft was traveling at its cruise speed
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They would not have assumed, and they did not assume. They assumed a low speed collision with low fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gonna skip over the napkin math on energy distribution. Long story short, you can't do structural analysis of an airplane crash on a single sheet of paper and expect it to match reality.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is well within limits that the towers were built to survive. So why did the North tower fall?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except it didn't. Again, the towers survive the plane crashes, have their supports weakened by high temperatures, then buckle and pancake.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We looked at every possible thing we could think of that could happen to the buildings, even to the extent of an airplane hitting the side… Our analysis indicated the biggest problem would be the fact that all the fuel (from the airplane) would dump into the building. There would be a horrendous fire. A lot of people would be killed. [But] the building structure would still be there.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For the most part he's right. There was a horrendous fire, and the structure survived the impact. What he didn't consider was the loss of steel insulation in the explosion and the weakening of the support structure from elevated temperatures. An engineer from 40 years ago makes a mistake. It happens.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2001, Leslie Robertson, a WTC structural engineer who worked as a subordinate to Skilling, claimed that the Twin Towers were only able to withstand the impact of jet airplanes going no faster than 180 mph. However, not only are these statements contradicted by the design test results...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They're contradicted by a 3-page white paper put out by the Port Authority. We don't know the results because, again, Robertson has no record of them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...they also contradict statements made by Robertson in 1984/1985, when he said that there was “little likelihood of a collapse no matter how the building was attacked.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       An easy thing to say when you don't consider compounding engineering issues. Just because the engineer said it's safe doesn't mean it's safe. That's why there was an investigation, so we could find out why it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Who would design these buildings for jet plane impacts but not fuel fires?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Engineers with little-to-no experience in plane-building collisions and who don't consider steel insulation to be removeable.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not only were the towers designed to survive crashes of large jet aircraft, but they were designed to potentially survive multiple plane crashes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Huh. It's almost like the authors of this page ignored the report and chose their own version of events to dispute, where 767s make skyscrapers fall down like dominoes. Repetition does not make it true: the WTC was not brought down by collision forces, but by weakening support columns.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This assertion is supported by Frank A. Demartini, the on-site construction manager for the World Trade Center, who said on January 25, 2001:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door—this intense grid—and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As fun as it is to interview people who built something and hear them gush about how strong it is, he's probably right. If structural weakening of exposed support columns wasn't an issue, then the building might have been able to take multiple hits. But that's not what we're discussing anyway.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition, investigators from NIST who examined the destruction of the WTC skyscrapers told The New York Times in 2007 that newly disclosed documents from the 1960s show that the new York Port Authority, the original owners of Twin Towers, also considered aircraft moving at 600 mph,slightly faster and therefore more destructive than the ones that did hit the towers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think you get my point on both of these problems.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The WTC designers seemed to be correct in their analysis in the 1960s, and the evidence that these buildings were brought down by controlled demolition corroborates their conclusions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This one is stupid enough to give me a headache. If you're arguing that something didn't happen, that's not arguing something couldn't happen. You can't "prove" someone's calculations are correct by giving evidence that something else happened.

       Re: Progressive collapse - its a fast process, just not as fast as near free fall as was observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2A: BY your reasoning it would make sense for all controlled demolitions to initiate a progressive collapse top down every time, which is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think its a great source I presented. Some of your counter points are OK, thanks for sharing. It would be cool if you could provide your general feeling about the entirety of the events that happened that day, for example the destruction of World Trade Center 7 and the plane hitting the pentagon. I am just curious but do you also find these events as not suspect in any way as decribed by the press? Thanks.

        That video is no substitute for hundreds of pages of calculations. I don't believe that the engineers lied about doing a crash analysis, but I think they would have done one that wouldn't hold up to scrutiny. For example, Mr. Demartini's observation does not cover sustained fires around uninsulated steel, only the physical impact of the plane. I will also continue to say that an engineering calculation done by hand in the 60s is fully capable of being wrong.
       </li>

       2A. A progressive collapse would start wherever the first failure occurred, and as I understand it most demolition occurs nears the base of a structure to be demolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       My "general feeling" is that American psychology wasn't prepared for 9/11. No American had ever seen his home country attacked, nor their parents or grandparents. The idea that it was not only possible to cause horrific mass murder, but to have it coordinated from a cave in Afghanistan by a group so dedicated to their leader they were willing to die for him, is intolerable. Americans have always had something like vengeance in our blood, which has propelled us into many wars, in search of the attackers who "started it", seemingly unfairly. For many people, it's much easier to attack an existing villain at home, one who "broke the rules" or "played unfairly" rather than come to terms with their weakness as a society. Every conspiracy theory is rooted in the incredible power of The Authority: a malevolent force that is somehow without flaw.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events of 9/11 are, in my mind, barely knowable. So much happened that had never happened before, which raised many more questions than we had evidence to answer. It would be impractical, for example, to reconstruct the Twin Towers and fly another plane into them, this time with strain gauges on every steel beam, thermometers on every floor, cameras recording every detail. But this is the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       some people will accept a version of events. Because they will find discrepancy between reality and The Authority, and trust that The Authority was correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is we can only find the most likely series of events, given an incomplete picture. There has never been an exception to this rule in the history of mankind, save for certain religious events.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, I would ask you to investigate something else. Anything else. Do it with the same fervor, the same high standards, the same distrust in The Government and faith in The Authority as you have for 9/11. Maybe look at the Radisson hotel walkway collapse. You find out how easy it is to weave conspiracies.

       What's ridiculous is expecting an engineer from the 60s to anticipate the effects of a plane-building collision on a steel frame structure, and on a separate issue expecting it to be accurate. I'm not saying Mr. Demartin lied in that video, but do you think he read that report? Keep in mind the alternative is that the already-massive conspiracy now includes demolition experts running into flaming towers to set charges that will be undetectable afterwards, because whoever's in charge of the operation thinks the plan so far won't cause enough damage.

       Then what is? That the planes had time bombs? There was a collision, a delay, and a collapse. The official version of events explains that in a practical, provable way . Referencing a reference to a 40-year old document is very weak evidence.

       My belief is it was missiles that were made to look like planes to ground civilians and the news footage tampered with(you can find some good yt breakdown vids on this).

       Unfortunately airlines don't have g meters onboard and the flight recorders were never recovered, according to the official story, so we'll never know really, other than what radar contacts picked up and what can be extracted from that information. All the pilots are dead as well. So what we have are recreations. Whatever I watched in the past wasn't the same as what I just watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually, looking at some of them, if they are accurate then all of the turns appeared sound and simple, they appeared to be flown well within a normal envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 6g turn in a 400,000 pound airplane would be impressive too, btw and that's estimated from what I remember watching before. It was a descending right turn, sharp and sustained for a big airplane. What I just watched they maneuvered no greater than 2 G's, mostly standard turns.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, btw, flying is actually easy. Especially in a modern jet with advanced flight controls. The difficult part is not breaking the airplane, which may have endured stress and wear and tear over it's history, I doubt the simulator had those factors coded. So, I don't really care what DutchTv had on or what any tv show had, that's where the lies originated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also another main difference is the sim pilot was given instructions, he had a flight plan and is familiar with the avionics. The guy sitting in the actual plane is using his eyeballs presumably, unless he was familiar with the area and how to read the panels. Seems a bit excessive for guys who apparently got their training in a cesna? A prop plane 1,600 pounds and that flies no faster than 150 mph?

       So I’ve always thought flight 93 was shot down.  It is the only plane that was delayed, about 45 minutes.  And it’s the only plane that was still in hen air when the order was given to scramble jets.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if the other planes were remotely controlled, then maybe flight 93 was too.  What if the high jackers only job was to get into the cock pit and allow for the planes to be remotely controlled.  Basically kill the pilots To prevent them from saving the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So flight 93 left late, missed it’s window, and finally was remotely sent straight down to the earth in shanksville before the scrambled jets could get to it.

       Of all that happened, what always bothered me most was Flight 93. Maybe it was commercial jets that hit the towers, maybe they were gray, unmarked, windowless military jets, who knows - either are possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But flight 93? The pictures of the plane crash don't look like a plane crash. After a crash they put the plane together, literally, piece by piece to figure out what went wrong. This didn't happen and the pictures resemble a pile of junk, there was no luggage, no chairs or windows, nothing that resembled an airplane. Similarly, when a building 'pancakes' as the official story states, tehre's stuff left. Chairs, computers, etc. Bodies. That didn't happen, again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it begs the question, if the plane didn't go down there, where did it go? What happened to those people? It's still possible 93 went down in the manner described, but that doesn't explain the official pictures. There is some ATC chatter that helps paint a picture of what was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, a hijacking doesn't directly indicate those blamed for this were directly involved or to blame.

       Well, I guess if I got blown out of the sky by a missile or two then their wouldn't be much to piece back together.  We know for a fact a fighter jet was scrambled and got near Flight 93 but apparently was a few miles away when it went down.  They also claim the fighter jet wasn't loaded with ammo, though their are some conflicting accounts about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most likely scenario is the plane was shot down with the passengers and hijackers aboard.  That is not a fun story to tell the American public when your about to rally them into two wars.  So the official story was the passengers were brave and patriotic and whoever discounts their heroism would be shunned.

       I don't know what kind of jet was sent up but I can tell you about some of the weapons systems they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use something called 'BVR'. Beyond visual range.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most modern missiles are both radar operated and have an I.R. functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were trying to shoot down a commercial jet they would likely be able to see it via radar as far as 100 miles away or more. And would be able to shoot it within 40 or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a jet did shoot them down. Maybe the passengers forced the terrorists hand. That doesn't explain the pictures. Whatever that was, it wasn't a plane crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back through the years and see what lengths the FAA go to put the plane back together after an accident. Telling me they couldn't pull this off that time?

      <p>
       And you make a good point about the 'being shunned' bit. Very true.

       All good points.  I think the most interesting aspect of flight 93 conspiracy is it doesn't imply deeper more wide spread conspiracies.  Its possible that flight 93 was shot down by our military and they just didn't want to explain that to the American public.  That doesn't imply a widespread inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is very different from something like building 7.  Controlled demolition means foreknowledge, planning, and execution on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flight 93 could just be a PR stunt on an already sad day for the United States.  If we shot it down, it would be questioned hard by media and public, even if it was the right thing to do.  Instead the PR story of heroism and crash oozes nationalism and keeps us marching towards full retaliation to whatever enemy they choose.

       The story is plausible. Could have been shot down. Maybe the passengers charged the cockpit, particularly if they found out what their fate would be - assuming it was commercial airliners that hit the building and not something else. That would beg greater questions of course and that's probably what bothered me most, there are some questions about whether the planes themselves were commercial or not and some compelling photographic/video evidence to suggest they were not(i.e. the nose of the airplane igniting into something pre tower contact, a flame, it's hard to say as it's a single frame just before it strikes the tower. I don't remember if it's the first or second plane. What did it look like? That the nose of the aircraft was exploding before it hit the tower). If this was true though, where ever are the people from 93? Where did the flight actually go?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the pictures they offered up as a 'crash sight' don't look like a crash sight, this much to me is fair to say.

       I cannot for the life of me find it again, but I had previously found an article from the year 2000 from a major news site (NYT I think) talking about the Department of Defense couldn't account for more than a trillion dollars. I know for a fact it exists, because I linked to it in once already in response to someone else who claimed the story broke originally on the 10th instead of months before in 2000. Google and Bing can't find it anymore. It's almost as if it's been expunged from the records or something.

       The money wasn't really "missing" either. Rumsfeld was talking about how outdated the budget tracking system used in the Pentagon was.

      <p>
       The cumulative questions and sorting issues totaled 2.3t according to Rumsfeld.

       I'm saying that based on what is publicly available, the notion of a sum larger than the entire federal budget being socked away somewhere is silly.

      <p>
       The actual words on record say otherwise.

       You don't have to trust them, but that makes the most sense to me.

       There's a place and purpose for circumstantial evidence to support a conspiracy theory. But that circumstantial evidence has to actually be evidence.

       "When you spend money, you account for it--that is required in the federal government," Jacobson said. "But DOD doesn't have that. They just say, . . . 'We had money, we spent it.' Then they try to go back later . . . to pull the balance sheet together."
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know that the 2.3 trillion wasn't an aggregated number from misreporting over a longer period of time?

       The end result was that they could not provide documentation on how they spent that 2.3 trillion.

       "The Pentagon could not show receipts for $2.3 trillion of those changes, and half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made in earlier adjustments."

       Well he was made out to be the boogeyman and mastermind and one of the largest reasons for going to war...so the fact that he was literally claimed to be hiding in a fucking cave and reported (even by the MSM in 2001) to be dying of kidney failure is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted yesterday all of the articles from 2001/2002 in which the MSM reported high level intelligence reports that OBL's associates "were looking for a dialysis machine" for him. The fact that they lacked common resources like a dialysis machine but could pull off 9/11 is relevant whether you like or not.

       Ok, in further thinking - I can agree that the usage and need of dialysis and kidney failure
       <em>

       relevant, but the

       I agree. It takes away from the substance of the writing. A lot of people who don't believe 9/11 was an inside job will not take this post seriously, which is unfortunate because there is good info in there.

       I think his point really was, one way or another, these weren't a bunch of guys in caves. Dialysis is a weekly ordeal, it's artificial kidney functionality - without it he dies - maybe these are luxury caves?

       How is the physical health of Osama not relevant? How is the means how he communicated with the alleged hijackers not relevant? It's the same story the MSM told us.
      </p>

       In my opinion James tries to summarize some of the events leading up to 9/11, the event itself and the aftermath and the improbability of those things happening the way the MSM have been telling us.

       Serious question. If 9/11 was proven to be an inside job with solidarity. That the American government did indeed fake a terrorist attack to gain morale high ground from the public to invade countries to steal oil. Would there be consequences from a 3rd party? Would there be punishments at all or just war?

       Youtube Dave Mcgowan and listen to his interviews. He did a ton of research and wrote a book before he died, r.i.p.  His book, Weird Scenes Inside The Canyon, is highly recommended. He concluded that most of the musicians from the mid 60's that were instrumental in starting up the counter culture movement came from military intelligence families. The Mamas and the Papas, The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, etc. Frank Zappa's father was a chemist at Edgewood Arsenal. Frank grew up on the military base. That's where MK ultra experiments were conducted.

       There were attacks on two different days. There is no real debate on the attack on the first day. The are plenty of witnesses, radar records, damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "conspiracy" lies in the events of the second day, Sunday. A torrential rain storm in the Gulf and overwrought nerves makes reports of a second attack debateable. When Johnson announced there had been two attacks on a American ship in the Gulf of Tonkin, He was 100% right on the first one, and unknown at the time on the second one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until the late 80s that the technology advanced to the point where it could be stated beyond a reasonable doubt that the second attack was just a bunch bad weather and radar shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you can always argue that Johnson was ready for the fight and he just took a minor incident and conflagulated it enough to justify a stronger military response. And that would be correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to say nothing happen would be false.

       I may be wrong, but from what i remember reading was that the US slowly began occupation as France  began to exit Vietnam from its occupation that started in the mid 50s.  Once established, the gulf of Tonkin incident occurred which “gave” the US the opportunity to fully engage in war. From what I got from it was that the IS seized an opportunity to finish what France began. The entirety of it is really messed up.

       Yup. Also it gave the rulers at the time a monopoly on literally all ideas. Religion is philosophy for someone who can't think for himself. It's sad how many people I find that think Jesus literally walked on water and performed miracles. These people are nothing more than older infants, still clinging to their belief systems because they can't handle the unknown,

       At least religious people know that we believe in messages that were passed down. We recognize that we have faith and presuppositions. What's problematic is how many people believe the cliche of a polemic you put forth, having no clue that it is very much a recent, culturally constructed article of faith for epistemology. And a bad one at that.

       If he wants to debates the truth claims of his position, I am happy to do that. But my point wasn’t that he’s wrong. It’s that it’s as much of a faith position as anything he’s railing against, he just doesn’t seem to realize it.

       Then it seems to me all arguments of ideas are arguements of faith based on your point of view. I didn't actually reach my conclusin through Hume, I thought it through independent of any text, therefore I don't see how it's the same as a religious person blindly following their religious leaders. I think religion has value don't get me wrong, but where it goes wrong is that it creates a platform for a leader to control a population of blissfully ignorant people willing to die for "god", which is a standin for the church. You accused me of creating a circular argument yet your whole point is based on the fact that I'm wrong, which you've stated to be true yet haven't proven.

       The same thing can be said for any isntitution, take school for exampke. Are you telling me it's healthy to send our kids to a place where they have to raise their hands just to speak for themselves and have to sit in a metal fucking chair for 8 hours a day and if they can't we just drug them until their braindead.  How have we let this go on during the formative years of a child's life. I'll tell you why. The government needed mommy and daddy to go away for work but needed someone to baby sit the kids. That's where school comes in. The ultimate waste of time during the most important years of a person's life where they should be exploring and questioning everything.

       One way to look at the walking on water story is as a metaphor for steadfastly standing in the law of nature - rising above the water of admiralty law that has covered all the lands in legal fiction. It's illegal to use a LEGAL NAME.

       Good point. Maybe comfort is better than freedom if the price is utter destruction. But the tyranny will only get worse. The prosperity we are experiencing now will soon fade after another false flag causes the world to go into WW3. From there, they'll make up all kinds of justifications for more civil rights violations until we're too defenseless to do anything. What do you think all these shootings are for? Even if they're not false flags the media is still using them to push gun control, and after that amendment is gone we are totally fucked. A couple days ago the EU overruled the results of an Italian election  and NO ONE CARES. Tommy Robinson is locked up for reporting and NO ONE CARES. Humans are too self obsessed too stop and think. After all, thinking would require the ability to look at things truthfully and humans just can't handle the truth.

       Fair enough, but the consequences of favoring foreign parties over the voice of your own people can prove detrimental to the Italian social fabric. Let's just hope the Italian people are okay with their opinions being shutdown.

       I guess that's my interpratation based on the outcry in Britain over the same issue. The people wanted out yet the leaders feel they know better than the people and decided against it. Now it's happening to Italy in a different way. The people voted for a "populist" party, which stands in direct opposition to the EU which promotes unity in Europe. 
Here Macron talks about the politcal and idealogical battle between "liberal democracy" and "authoritarianism":
       <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43794856">
        http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43794856
       </a>
       Yet by denying the finance minister for fear of authoritarianism is counter to liberal democracy. The EU are a body of many people so it's hard to find a direct quote from them but the European politicians that support the EU wholeheartedly are in complete oppostion to the right-wing parties all over Europe, including Hungary, Italy, France, and the UK.

       He had a point. If we are too ignorant to see how we are being played every day then maybe we deserve slavery. We are the majority being ruled by a minority, but we love it. We love the lack of responibility that comes with independence and freedom. Everywhere I see idiots blindly accepting their fates, working their asses off when they're only here for a good 70 years. And I'm no better, because without money I'd have nothing to eat. And we all know that by the end of our lives we're gonna cry out to god for a second chance now that we've wasted our whole lives on menial bullshit and yet we do nothing now to appease that fact. We're no better than sheep, blindly following our instncts and the herd because we don't know anything else.

       As long as nothing effects their immediate life. They still have a roof over their head, food on the table and the family is safe then lots of people are willing to turn their hand to the government for most things. At most they will whine on social media about it.

       This is gonna sound like a movie but what we call the "good" side is way too focused on the good to see the bad. We are focused on the new cool stuff we have instead of the possibility for tyranny that still exists and will always exist. It's always a constant struggle against evil or whatever you want to call it. And the worst part is that these so called evil people are very very organized.

       That would depend on the resolve of the American people at the moment they admitted to it. I think they'll wait until everyone is as divided as they think they'll be, or they'll de-classify the information when everyone that remembers 9/11 is dead. We will always get bits and pieces, but never a sure-enough-thing to 100% receive condemnation of the US government from all Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this did happen, then I believe a few people would riot, some would organize and launch guerilla-style terror attacks, and, I really doubt this, but maybe we could have a full-blown revolution. This would cause the break-down of society, and people would rather just be snug as a bug in their shitty little houses, with their families, getting paid less and less each generation. They'll watch the same bullshit news, and eat the same bullshit food and get fat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody would want to overthrow the government. We're too divided, and could never agree on what to do next. But, America would break up into a bunch if smaller nations. Then people could have what they really want.

       Interesting concept.

      <p>
       If we all could somehow agree to boycott whole companies. Like even for a year......do you think we could have a noticeable change?

       Say nike did something to piss us off. So everyone got together on social media and convinced one another. We - all americans! are boycotting nike.

       people please read into Judy Wood's work. She was a professor that was selected to analyze the fall of the twin towers. Her and her team determined that the manner in which the towers fell went against the laws of physics. She lost her job, funding, and became a author researching the 9/11 conspiracy and the free energy tech.

       American, while she was still a professor at the college she used to teach at.
I don't remember exactly what her team was called as she was censored from Wikipedia and i don't have the time to search through .gov archives. 
Someone definitely seemed to take the time to erase her from the internet besides labeling her a "conspiracy theorist" to discredit her.

       In a whole series of lectures and media appearances, Wood has maintained that the debris pile was nowhere near tall enough to account for the aggregate mass of the towers and their contents. Rather, she states, the towers were pulverized in mid-air and simply blew away on the breeze.

       What does republican or democrat have to do with anything? It's interesting to me that you blame the government but then turn around and join in their master plan of division. Right and left aren't real except for those of us in the population who believe it.

       i believe hillary clinton is deeply involved in pgate and also mentally unfit, and a criminal, and a traitor, but i have absolutely no problem admitting the world would be a better place if she were president right now.

      <p>
       these operations and worst of everything is being driven out of the republican party headquarters, alec, the heritage foundation whores, and then sometimes from the democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       any equivalency is ultimately someone who is trying to help republicans, who have neither ideas, consitency, or ethics, at all whatsover.
      </p>
      <p>
       democrats have some ethics they are at least fighting over, republicans don't have that, rather its worse, they openly contemplate and secretly practice outright evil, in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you cant see the difference i am kindof sorry for you, but really just don't think you are very capable of critical thought

       It's cute that you try to be condescending while completely missing my point and even furthering it. Hilary and Trump and whoever else being republican and democrat are meaningless outside of dividing a country over which is less bad. The goal line for what counts as a democrat and republican aren't even real anymore, they get bounces around all over and anyone who doesn't agree with x version of it is labeled as something else so that they feel they're in a minority opinion and should change.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that either party is fighting for any kind of ethics you're only lying to yourself. Do you really think that your apparent team did no evil and only tried to be the best they could be? I honestly can't tell if you're trolling or just desperately holding on to the idea that you belong to a group that doesn't give a shit about you.

       we were robbed by hillary's dirty tricks and i will never forgive her

       you are right we choose between two evils and not many people don't know that now, it's kindof inane to even say.
      </p>
      <p>
       a choice doesn't imply the best of all possible choices, it could be the choice between a turd and a shit, but a choice it is
      </p>
      <p>
       you're saying all this shit would have happened under hillary and im saying it wouldn't have.
      </p>
      <p>
       since i know my friends and family and i know bernie for 20 years of public service, i believe he actually cares about the country and the people.  and nothing you can say with that attitude and level of evidence is going to be able to do much about that.

       I'm just gonna say that a good 50% of 9/11 conspiracy theories are fueled by the inability of Americans to reckon with the fact that they got their shit rocked not by some world superpower but by some previously-unknown-to-the-public terrorists. Same exact reason why Americans still can't come to terms with losing Vietnam to """rice farmers""".

       Again, it's basically American exceptionalist hubris at work. If an American pilot pulled off a crazy manoeuver in a war he'd be a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add a dash of American "my layman understanding is all I need" thinking and this is how you get the Steel Beams meme, with every chump thinking they're a structural/materials engineer now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the alternative explanation if a commercial aircraft couldn't pull off that move at all? The plane and all passengers were disappeared and it was a missile instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW my opinion is that 9/11 was not an inside job, but it sure as fuck was cynically exploited. May have even ignored warnings of an attack because they wanted an excuse for war.

       The air traffic tapes from 9/11 are a fantastic listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are unsure if what they are seeing/hearing is part of the drill, and have to ask and be reassured multiple times that it is not part of the drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This drill led to massive confusion in the air traffic towers, not to mention led to a majority of the response aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean, massively slowing down the intercepting of the highjacked crafts.

       It was missiles like I’ve said multiple times in thread, the “planes” wouldn’t have been going fast enough for aluminum to be able to penetrate steel without the damn thing exploding on impact and most of it falling to the ground or it be hanging halfway of the building. Try shooting a soda can at a semi trailer and see what happens. Ok, yes not the same thickness or exact replica but you get the point, it’s a decent representation of what would happen. You think the government has a problem with grounding planes and murdering the passengers? They wouldn’t bat an eye in the name of “freedom” or whatever sick justification they have. But you won’t listen to that, you think we’re all just paranoid and don’t think the government could pull it off. You know, not like they had trillions of dollars “missing” to play with or anything. But be naive. When the day comes and they betray you, we’ll be ready.

       I read the transcript of Dumsfeld's speech. What he's getting at is the fact different departments in the Pentagon are using outmoded and incompatible systems so they can't track payments from one area to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pretty common in any large bureaucracy whether public or private. I can't think of a single place I've worked where multiple systems were operated and there weren't discrepancies and mismatches and admin headaches for everyone who had to pick it up at the coalface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the Pentagon have large, undeclared black budgets used from who knows what? Absolutely, but that's not what Rumsfeld was talking about here.

       Because the implications, if you allow yourself to question the narrative, is paradigm shattering. Which is why large crimes like this are gotten away with . If the cruelty defies imagination they will tend not to be seen (see pedophilia, esp organized). It's easier to see no evil. This is how the holocaust happened. People saw their neighbors suddenly disappearing in the dead of night one after the other, but could not entertain the possibility that a civilized society would brook such a thing even though it was whispered about.

       I’m sure in had nothing to do with the Global Guardian warfame going on that same day which involved a side-game called “

       It says in the very wiki that it wasn't a simulated hijacking exercise but rather a Russian bombing exercise, that when NORAD heard there were hijackings, confused them as to whether it was a part of the exersise.

       The Russian bomber simulation was Global Guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vigilant Guardian was the high jacking:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In contrast to the 9/11 Commission Report - Michael Ruppert has characterized Vigilant Guardian as "a hijacking drill, not a cold war excercise". He cites direct quotes from participants which indicate "that the drill involved hijacked airliners rather than Russian Bombers". General Arnold, Tech. Sgt. W. Powel and Lt. Col. Dwane Deskins have stated that when they first were informed about hijacked airliners they thought it was "part of the excercise" [1].

       This goes along with the hiding and taunting of Bin Laden:
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a middle school substitute back in 2008, older gentleman, with a son who toured after 9/11 happened. Very decorated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This man told us as middle schoolers that his son relayed information to him that Bin Laden was actually killed back in 2003 and they were not releasing it to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I cannot obviously confirm validity of the claim, has anyone else heard similar?

       Two reasons. 1. If OBL was still "alive" he would remain a boogeyman that would justify the war in afghanistan. 2. When he died it was a big coup for obama. Almost defined his presidency. I will add a 3. That is controversial. Some think they announced bin ladens death because it distracted from the obama birther debate

       I forgot who was the journalist but the OBL in abottabad was setup by USA government and Pakistan intelligence. Basically Obama used the situation to get relected without telling Pakistan and throwing the government under the bus. 9/11 changed data and  intelligence gathering around the world and we losing every aspect of our freedom everyday.

       I have relatives from not so far back that were Nimibian tribesman. They happen to have fought lions just to become warriors. I don't know what you know about lions but they aren't like your average cat. I bet you would absolutely shit yourself if you ever saw a real life lion, especially if you were only holding a sharpened stick and you were naked. Come talk to me when some of your family members have gone on the Zambutu bibjano; A.K.A. the trial of life. Until you have done half the shit that they have maybe you shouldn't even talk like this. I know you think you're hard and shit but guess what pal, you aren't. Now go grow some Namibian genes and we'll talk about this shit for real.

       In 1990-91, I was a college student.  I recall a major hijacking, maybe in Singapore?
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I was a bit annoyed with the concept of 'kidnapping a plane' and flying it to Beirut, or wherever.  My quote, as a 19 or 20 year old kid:
      </p>
      <p>
       "If these groups really want to have publicity on an international stage, they shouldn't bother with these hijackings like this.  They should hijack a plane, and fly it into the damn World Trade Center or something."
      </p>
      <p>
       A somewhat intelligent 20 year old knew that this was possible.

       Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all this say about the American mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
       De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">
        https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle."
      </p>
      <p>
       He went on to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       He further goes on to state:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don't have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it's too big to stop.

       these operations and worst of everything is being driven out of the republican party headquarters, alec, the heritage foundation whores, and then sometimes from the democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       any equivalency is ultimately someone who is trying to help republicans, who have neither ideas, consitency, or ethics, at all whatsover.
      </p>
      <p>
       democrats have some ethics they are at least fighting over, republicans don't have that, rather its worse, they openly contemplate and secretly practice outright evil, in the open.

       if you cant see the difference i am kindof sorry for you, but really just don't think you are very capable of critical thought

       That being said, I agree. The outter steel structure of the WTC, and the fact that the architect specifically stated that the building would be able to withstand a (commercial?) plane impact, makes me super suspicious.

       My belief is it was missiles that were made to look like planes to ground civilians and the news footage tampered with(you can find some good yt breakdown vids on this).

       The same thing can be said for any isntitution, take school for exampke. Are you telling me it's healthy to send our kids to a place where they have to raise their hands just to speak for themselves and have to sit in a metal fucking chair for 8 hours a day and if they can't we just drug them until their braindead.  How have we let this go on during the formative years of a child's life. I'll tell you why. The government needed mommy and daddy to go away for work but needed someone to baby sit the kids. That's where school comes in. The ultimate waste of time during the most important years of a person's life where they should be exploring and questioning everything.

       All good points.  I think the most interesting aspect of flight 93 conspiracy is it doesn't imply deeper more wide spread conspiracies.  Its possible that flight 93 was shot down by our military and they just didn't want to explain that to the American public.  That doesn't imply a widespread inside job.

       Which is very different from something like building 7.  Controlled demolition means foreknowledge, planning, and execution on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flight 93 could just be a PR stunt on an already sad day for the United States.  If we shot it down, it would be questioned hard by media and public, even if it was the right thing to do.  Instead the PR story of heroism and crash oozes nationalism and keeps us marching towards full retaliation to whatever enemy they choose.

       The story is plausible. Could have been shot down. Maybe the passengers charged the cockpit, particularly if they found out what their fate would be - assuming it was commercial airliners that hit the building and not something else. That would beg greater questions of course and that's probably what bothered me most, there are some questions about whether the planes themselves were commercial or not and some compelling photographic/video evidence to suggest they were not(i.e. the nose of the airplane igniting into something pre tower contact, a flame, it's hard to say as it's a single frame just before it strikes the tower. I don't remember if it's the first or second plane. What did it look like? That the nose of the aircraft was exploding before it hit the tower). If this was true though, where ever are the people from 93? Where did the flight actually go?

       Either way, the pictures they offered up as a 'crash sight' don't look like a crash sight, this much to me is fair to say.

       Let's not get carried away. No one credible has suggested that the buildings got rigged to blow during the chaos of the day. That is not the alternative.
