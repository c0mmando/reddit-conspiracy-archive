        I watched on tv as it happened. If it was impossible for the USA or anyone else to go to the moon, the Russians would have called them out for a propaganda victory. Not a peep from them or anyone else who KNOW what went down.

        I watched it "live" on TV when I was 8. If it was on TV it must have been true, and we could still trust the government in the 60's

        If you think foil on spacecraft it weird, it’s not. It was done to help get rid of potential electrostatic charges (no atmosphere). They did the same thing on the Voyagers years later before they realized it wasn’t as big of a threat as they thought. They actually used brand-name aluminum foil on Voyager I &amp; II.

        I just sort of always took it as a given because everyone believed it....or at least said they believed it. Not until I actually considered the possibility that it was a lie and looked into the "evidence" for myself was I able to see the deception...and it took some time. 30+ years of indoctrination doesn't just disappear in an instant, no matter how much evidence you have to prove it was a lie.

       In a moment of desperation, they... faked the landing itself. At least some of the later Apollo missions were legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The program was so massive and so much of it was independently confirmed in real time that I have a hard time believing it was all just a big show.

       Our Ontario Science Center had/has an interactive exhibit mock up of the command module, the landing module and the controls/visuals/audio included to make it seem real and immersive.

       dont you think its an interesting study in psychology, to learn why people believe the things they believe?
      </p>
      <p>
       its pretty clear from the responses in yesterday's prompt that people will say they believe absurd claims because they saw it on TV, or because they don't want to be called 'bat shit crazy', or because they were a gullible kid, or because the claim has not been debunked to their satisfaction, or because Russians didn't call bullshit, or because theres supposedly reflectors and other artifacts on the moon,

       one person mentioned moon rocks, but the moon rock given to Holland was fake

       <p>
        Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay,[1][2][3] regardless of how long the atom has existed. However, for a collection of atoms, the collection's expected decay rate is characterized in terms of their measured decay constants or half-lives. This is the basis of radiometric dating. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have no known upper limit, spanning a time range of over 55 orders of magnitude, from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe.

       Nah, NASA has a defense team. I encourage new users to start recognizing who is posting and what they are positing. Same accounts, same talking points, same tactics. Slowly but surely people are catching on and realizing NASA is stealing and lying. Much like the rest of our government. Be well rockran ;)

       L O fucking L - “Hey they were caught in low orbit when they were supposed to be on the moon, but fuck it, I trust them”. They didn’t land on the fucking moon. Watch A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon. They were caught red handed. If you want the isolated clip, search YouTube.  So knowing they didn’t land on the moon, where the fuck did that money go? I love that you’re in every one of these threads defending this government agency btw.

       What Does NASA Do?
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA does a lot of different things. NASA makes satellites. The satellites help scientists learn more about Earth. NASA sends probes out into space. NASA scientists study things in the solar system, and even farther away. A new program will send humans to explore asteroids, Mars and beyond. People at NASA work on ways to make air travel better for everyone on Earth, too. People at NASA also share the things they learn with others. This can help make life on Earth better.

       <em>
        Jim McDade, writing in The Birmingham News, characterized A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon as "full of falsehoods, innuendo, strident accusations, half-truths, flawed logic and premature conclusions." According to McDade, the "only thing new and weird" in the film is that the claim that video views of Earth were actually filmed through a small hole to give the impression that Apollo 11 was not in low earth orbit. "Bart has misinterpreted things that are immediately obvious to anyone who has extensively read Apollo history and documentation or anyone who has ever been inside an Apollo Command Module or accurate mockup," says McDade

       right. most people should probably let smarter people watch movies for them and then just have them describe the movie

       Good thread yesterday. The moon landing is the Easter Bunny for adults. Very much an article of faith for some people, and obviously there is a
       <em>
        heavy
       </em>
       contingent of NASA shills assigned to this forum every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would daresay that there are as many or even more NASA shills here than there are 9/11 official government narrative shills. Of course some of these characters cover both topics, which makes it even more obvious why they are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no chance anyone has ever been to the moon. I look forward to the 50th anniversary coming up in a few weeks. We'll continue to expose how ridiculous the hoax is and how silly it is to still believe it.

       NASA is the close to being exposed, that’s why. I mean there is a fucking video of them not on the moon when they said they were on the moon. I’m sure you’ve seen A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon. That right there blows the whole moon narrative up.

       Except for less than 100 dollars you can prove they exist.  But I have yet to find a flat Earther who will do a simple experiment.

       How about we just see an HD launch of a satellite until and after it achieves orbit? So much to ask? In the modern era anything that can be recorded in HD video, will be recorded in HD video. This general rule is a good way to know when something is bullshit — school shootings for example.

       You will say it is CGI or that since it isn't going straight up it isn't going to orbit.

      <p>
       Basic physical laws will show you that GPS transmitters are moving very fast just do the experiment.

       It also is strange to me that you haven't asked what the experiment is.  Don't you want to prove me wrong?

       Sibrel’s film is one of the main ways I became aware of the Apollo hoax. I’ve even emailed him thanking him for the movie to which he replied and invited me to his church.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be completely honest however, I don’t know what to make of the footage that the movie is named after. I have questions such as how he received it in the first place and are they really orbiting Earth or what? When looking at the ISS and the satellite hoax, as well as  the complicity of all these space agencies in faking missions, I just don’t know that anything can go to what we call Low Earth Orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s still a great film I would recommend to anyone.

       Yeah, like not sure I ever got the straight story of how he came into possession of it, and I have my suspicions that they faked it as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to think there was no reason for them to be in the Saturn V rocket when it took off, and unnecessary risk to have a bunch of Freemasons — NOT space men or even particularly intelligent guys — go to “space” and incur the risk of tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind it took place like the movie
       <em>
        Capricorn One,
       </em>
       with the actornauts evacuated from the launch in concealment sometime before liftoff.

       Honestly, some days I really, truly wonder how many people this subreddit is supposed to have who are 'paid' to constantly attack conspiracies. Based on the number of people declared shills on Nasa, Earth-as-Globe, 9-11, Monsanto, Pizzagate and whatever else is out there, there must be millions of dollars spent DAILY just to keep this subreddit shut down by all that fake-ness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, whoever you are out there who are shills, REACH OUT TO ME. I could definitely use more money in my life.

       The science is pretty obvious here. We can’t pass the van Allen’s belt and the pressure of leaving ELO is nothing short of impossible with current travel speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asteroids travel at speeds we have yet to reach safely. Anyone who still believes we went to the moon, has a weird A/V standard that is horribly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       No way in hell did we transmit live video feed from the moon to earth to every person on earth. That is download speeds that we just recently obtained. Was impossible in the 60’s

       the point is that there exists evidence that light is paradoxically both a particle and a wave

       OP we should work out a plan for the anniversary. Clearly there is a concerted effort to defend NASA. To me, we simply have to show them “we” weren’t on the moon when “we” said we were. That single clip, provided by NASA, is indisputable. I’m sure there will be a ton of threads we can redpill. The battle is for new minds and the next generation.

      <p>
       yup, just gotta keep bringing it up every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       here is a technique i figured out for forcing an issue into a news cycle in about 48 hours
      </p>
      <p>
       1) find an issue that a lot of people can relate to, that has an effect on a lot of people, that is an injustice for a lot of people, for example issue "stop and frisk" in NYC is good, "taxation is theft" is good, "messy divorce" is not good
      </p>
      <p>
       2) find other people who are talking about that issue, through search. encourage their post with a comment, up vote etc, which will bring that persons attention back to the issue if they'd gotten distracted since they'd posted it. retweeting 50 tweets would be one easy way to do this
      </p>
      <p>
       3) it takes minimum 48 hours of dedicated attention, because that is 2 full days anywhere in the world, which seems to be about what most internet users need if they are going to 'discover' a new trend
      </p>
      <p>
       4) by talking about the moon landing hoax, you are also NOT talking about other things, which allows you to dictate the content of the conversation
      </p>
      <p>
       5) when you talk to people about the moon landing hoax who have already shown they are receptive and like-minded, their followers are exposed to the info. again, when you keep engaging these people, they are talking about the moon landing hoax and they are NOT talking about other things...
      </p>
      <p>
       6) work across multiple platforms, posting content from one platform to another
      </p>

       America made it to the moon. The astronauts never returned though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buzz et al we are all actors. They filmed the moon landing in hanger 18, Area 51. They used real info, real details and real images from the astronauts who landed on the moon but couldn't make it home.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early days of the internet, a 'top secret secrets' website claimed that Russia made it to the moon several times before the Americans, but could never get them home safely. This is why Russia won't call out America on their bullshit, because they killed their own cosmonauts, knowingly, trying to get them home.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the Americans did what America does; It lied through media and propaganda to beat the Russians. Don't hate too much on the yanks, they did this for the best of intentions; to stop the spread of communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see, both sides are wrong and right. Man made it to the moon, but the footage you see is faked. Why don't we try and get to the moon again? Because all you would find is skeletons, wrapped in tin foil,  with fishbowls on their heads.

       Honestly, some days I really, truly wonder how many people this subreddit is supposed to have who are 'paid' to constantly attack conspiracies. Based on the number of people declared shills on Nasa, Earth-as-Globe, 9-11, Monsanto, Pizzagate and whatever else is out there, there must be millions of dollars spent DAILY just to keep this subreddit shut down by all that fake-ness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, whoever you are out there who are shills, REACH OUT TO ME. I could definitely use more money in my life.
