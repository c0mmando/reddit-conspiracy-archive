        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone who has seen Napeloen Dynamite remembers the scene where he is sitting on the steps drawing. Deb asks him what hes drawing and he tells her its his favorite animal: a Liger. She doesnt know what that is so he explains it is a half lion/half tiger animal that is known for its skill in magic..</p>

<p>The whole joke of the scene was that his favorite animal was clearly a mythological creature; Deb didn&#39;t recognize the animal, and he seals it with the comment on their magicial abilities.</p>

<p>Yet here we are in 2018 and all of a sudden I find out that Ligers are in fact real?! Not like some genetic engineering chimera made in a lab after the movie, but according to wikipedia Ligers have been known of for centuries. This is fucking with me. I dont have a conspiracy behind this really.. I just wanted to let people know that yes, Ligers <em>are</em> real, and I cant stop thinking about it. </p>

<p>They were not real, but now they are. It was common knowledge back when the movie was popular that Ligers were that made up animal from Napolean Dynamite. That was a pop culture tidbit that people who never even saw the movie knew. If they were real back then why didnt anybody who knew that try and correct everybody who believed them to be made up? I know I sound nuts, but I really feel like Ligers being real came outta no where.</p>

<p>Anyways here the wiki article on them - <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger</a></p>

<p>&quot;The history of lion-tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th century in India. In 1798, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger. The portmanteau &quot;liger&quot; was coined by the 1930s.[4]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How has it existed for as long as wikipedia and sources say if they can&#39;t reproduce? I get that with current technology, hell even 90s technology, genetic engineering could easily create some of these chimeras, so I get how they could exist. But in the 1930s they were offically coined Ligers supposedly, and had been studied prior to that for a long time. The technology back then couldn&#39;t have allowed scientists to create them in a lab, and if they are unable to reproduce, where the hell did the ones in the wild come from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk why but when I read this I immediately pictured techntoke as a shady dude hanging out around a farmers market/festival.</p>

<p>You are walking around looking at all the produce, stopping at all the booths, trying to decide who you want to support, when outta the corner of your eye you see this tall, dirty dishevelled looking man leaning against a barn.  He motions for you to come over towards him but you pretend to not see him and continue looking at all the local businesses at this farmers market gathering. You finish shopping with your wife and start to head back to the car, realizing you will have to pass the barn on the way back, but hoping the man is no longer posted up against the side of the barn.</p>

<p>Success! You round the corner and to your delight there is no man leaning on the side of the barn. You think you are in the clear until your wife who was walking behind you is no longer in sight. You panic for a split second before spotting her over by the barn. You rush over to her and overhear the end of their conversation: As she had done at all the other booths, she liked to ask the owners what their specialty was. There wasn&#39;t anything overtly wrong with his reply, but nevertheless it sent a chill up both their spines upon hearing a hushed, though inticing voice, whisper</p>

<p><em>You ever seen how they impregnate farm animals?</em></p>

<p>How does one spend several decades of life, and <em>not</em> hear about some man-sized flying demon dog?!  I&#39;ve even watched various bat documentaries.  Never seen or heard of it til a couple years ago.</p>

<p>A pattern I&#39;ve noticed from some of these &quot;new&quot; creatures is that they seem to be hybrids or mutant variations of other already existing creatures.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve heard this used for Bigfoot, but I&#39;m hazy on on any specifics for that particular name. It sounded like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajC52lgFys">this</a>, only just one &#39;individual&#39;, and not continuous, but sporadic, like 5-10 second durations, every 20-30 seconds, for about 4-6 minutes.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  But there&#39;s something strange about these creatures that show up in plain sight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like one day, you wake up, and everybody thinks you&#39;re crazy because you&#39;ve never heard of the South African Flying Giraffe.  &quot;Duh...  <em>Everybody</em> knows about the South African Flying Giraffe.  I learned about it in middle school!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  think part of the problem is that people don&#39;t watch nature documentaries anymore, they mostly just watch viral YouTube videos so most people never learn about the stranger parts of nature unless it gets picked up by a big website or something.</p>

<p>I grew up in the 80&#39;s watching wild kingdom and shit like that, plus I was obsessed with animals and read lots of science books, so I have seen most of these cool animals long before they became Internet memes. </p>

<p>Also most people nowadays end up in echo chambers where they are only exposed to things they are interested in so stuff outside their interests never pop up on their feeds. I don&#39;t think many people even realize this is happening. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t considered it, you should be a Ken M type persona that is of a super innocent young adult who is obsessed with lions, and comments on any posts related to lions in anyway with little wholesome anecdotes of his love for lions. </p>

<p>Reality is much weirder and open-ended and fluid than most people think. Sometimes things do seemingly come out of nowhere, as if you have shifted from one timeline to another. Everyone has known about a particular thing your whole life but you. Or vice versa. It can just be a small little detail, or something big like an old house appearing in a field and everyone says it&#39;s always been there, but you know it used to be an open field. And there&#39;s no way to prove it, because the house is there and everyone remembers it being there.</p>

<p>Hence why you shouldn&#39;t trust &#39;common knowledge&#39; and do your own research. Ligers have been known to exist since at least the late 19th century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I wanted to get real out there with it and sound like a nutcase, my mind goes to simulation theory stuff or collective conscious thoughts being able to manipulate our reality. Its probably not, but like you said its just so weird to have random animals looking straight outta Pokemon existing nowadays and these arent giant discoveries?! Not even that long ago I feel like these things would be mind blowing but they&#39;re like &quot;Nah, these have always existed, nothing to see here.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  But there&#39;s something strange about these creatures that show up in plain sight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like one day, you wake up, and everybody thinks you&#39;re crazy because you&#39;ve never heard of the South African Flying Giraffe.  &quot;Duh...  <em>Everybody</em> knows about the South African Flying Giraffe.  I learned about it in middle school!&quot;</p>

<p>wtf...  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m some ignorant shut-in who&#39;s never studied these kinds of things.  I&#39;m fairly well learned, and not prone to jumping to conclusions about &quot;new&quot; things.  But some of this &quot;new&quot; stuff is just bizarre, and too conspicuous to have <em>not</em> known about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  think part of the problem is that people don&#39;t watch nature documentaries anymore, they mostly just watch viral YouTube videos so most people never learn about the stranger parts of nature unless it gets picked up by a big website or something.</p>

<p>I grew up in the 80&#39;s watching wild kingdom and shit like that, plus I was obsessed with animals and read lots of science books, so I have seen most of these cool animals long before they became Internet memes. </p>

<p>Also most people nowadays end up in echo chambers where they are only exposed to things they are interested in so stuff outside their interests never pop up on their feeds. I don&#39;t think many people even realize this is happening. </p>
