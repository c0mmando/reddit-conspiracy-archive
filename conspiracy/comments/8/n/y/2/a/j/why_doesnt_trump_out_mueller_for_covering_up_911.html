If Trump is going to take down the deep state what better way to do than to tell the American people the truth about 9/11 while simultaneously outing Mueller for covering up the massive conspiracy while he was FBI Director.  </p>

<p>The fact that he hasn&#39;t is concerning to either your support for trump himself, or your conspiracy theories about 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has this sub turned into another r/esist or what?</p>

<p>Mueller became head of FBI like a month before 9/11. </p>

<p>95% of the people in the military don&#39;t join cuz they want to over throw countries and murder people without going to jail. They are good people who get caught up in bad things. </p>

<p>invading afghanistan in HINDSIGHT was a bad move(for good people). But good people got caught up in it. </p>

<p>Its my assumption that lots of good people got caught up in bad things with the 9/11 conspiracy. And under threat of personal violence and threat to their families, they had to go along with it. </p>

<p>Its my belief that Mueller is working on team trump. Mueller has about 35k sealed indictments all across the country. 5k/month since November of 2017. Do you really think these are all for Trump and everyone Trump knows? </p>

<p>Trump has given Mueller a way out of his crimes. Help bring down the swamp and gain immunity for his crimes against the country. </p>

<p>Some people in the Swamp, don&#39;t want to be in the swamp, but they have had no way of getting out until now. </p>
