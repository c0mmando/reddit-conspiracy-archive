       There is an inconsistency here.  If Trump is going to take down the deep state what better way to do than to tell the American people the truth about 9/11 while simultaneously outing Mueller for covering up the massive conspiracy while he was FBI Director.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he hasn't is concerning to either your support for trump himself, or your conspiracy theories about 9/11.

       Well, JFK went the direct route, and look what happened to him. If the Deep State really is as powerful as everyone thinks, then, how else would you go about tearing it down? Seriously, I'd to hear some of your thoughts on how you'd go about it while at the same time, not ending up prematurely like JFK.

       Exactly. FFS, JFK was an Elite (heir to an old wealth Roman Catholic dynasty). Far more Elite than Trump, and look what they did to him for openly trying to cross (pun intended) them. These (TPTB) motherfuckers don't give a fuck who you are. They've been at it for thousands of years.

       Trump is an Israeli puppet. Giuliani was involved as well and is his right-hand man. He won't go near it. He's still holding on to JFK documents that were supposed to come out which most likely implicated HW Bush running the operation.

       Has this sub turned into another r/esist or what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mueller became head of FBI like a month before 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       95% of the people in the military don't join cuz they want to over throw countries and murder people without going to jail. They are good people who get caught up in bad things.
      </p>
      <p>
       invading afghanistan in HINDSIGHT was a bad move(for good people). But good people got caught up in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its my assumption that lots of good people got caught up in bad things with the 9/11 conspiracy. And under threat of personal violence and threat to their families, they had to go along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its my belief that Mueller is working on team trump. Mueller has about 35k sealed indictments all across the country. 5k/month since November of 2017. Do you really think these are all for Trump and everyone Trump knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has given Mueller a way out of his crimes. Help bring down the swamp and gain immunity for his crimes against the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people in the Swamp, don't want to be in the swamp, but they have had no way of getting out until now.
