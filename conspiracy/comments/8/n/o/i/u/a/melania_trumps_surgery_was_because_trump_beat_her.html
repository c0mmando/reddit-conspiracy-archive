       OK I got a live one on Twitter pushing this theory.  This is how it goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Melania needs surgery to cut off blood flow to a part of her kidney.  What that REALLY means is that her kidney was bleeding.  Her kidney was bleeding because it got hurt while Trump was beating her.  He is a known abuser, after all.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Or, she actually has cancer.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's actually two theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been replying that there is no information that her kidney was bleeding, that there are several reasons for the procedure Melania had, and technically we don't know for sure what is really going on.  Maybe she didn't even go to the hospital.   Who knows what really goes on in that marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are everyone's thoughts?

       His first wife Ivana accused him of beating and raping her in court documents. He was angry over a bad hair transplant he got, so she claimed he pulled out her hair and raped her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Cohen defended it by saying you can't rape your wife.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You're talking about Donald Trump, you're talking about the front-runner for the GOP, presidential candidate, as well as private individual, who never raped anybody and of course understand that by the very definition you can't rape your spouse," Cohen said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ivana later took it back and said she didn't mean rape in the literal or criminal sense.

       Idc about trump or what he does, but you flat out headlines with a lie...literally something you made up out of thin air.

      <p>
       And he didn't "beat" her, the dudes an asshole and he shouldn't of grabbed at her hair...but he didn't "beat" her.

      <p>
       Other issue, when you spread flat out lies, when the truth does comes around no one will care because everyone's so used to bullshit headlines.

       I'm a medical doctor and I've heard that she has a benign condition of the kidney that required embolization. That makes me think of angiomyolipoma, that can bleed spontaneously and grow if not treated by embolization. So yeah, it could be a mere benign kidney condition, and I hope it is, nobody deserves cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, it could be a blunt trauma caused by aggression. We never know. But if it were caused by blunt trauma I doubt the fact Melania went to the hospital would ever reach the newspapers.
