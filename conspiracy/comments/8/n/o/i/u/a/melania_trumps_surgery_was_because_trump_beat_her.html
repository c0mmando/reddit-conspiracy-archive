        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK I got a live one on Twitter pushing this theory.  This is how it goes:</p>

<p><em>Melania needs surgery to cut off blood flow to a part of her kidney.  What that REALLY means is that her kidney was bleeding.  Her kidney was bleeding because it got hurt while Trump was beating her.  He is a known abuser, after all.</em></p>

<p><em>Or, she actually has cancer.</em></p>

<p>So it&#39;s actually two theories.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been replying that there is no information that her kidney was bleeding, that there are several reasons for the procedure Melania had, and technically we don&#39;t know for sure what is really going on.  Maybe she didn&#39;t even go to the hospital.   Who knows what really goes on in that marriage.</p>

<p>What are everyone&#39;s thoughts?</p>

<p>Or, she slipped on the bathtub and hit her kidney with the water faucet. Or Barron kicked her. Or she stepped on a Matrioshka doll and fell down the stairs. Or she found still some demonic items stashed away by Barry and suffered a nervous breakdown. Or russian spies slipped some deadly, 100% fatal toxin in her tea and she suffered a nasty case of teh runs but nothing more...</p>

<p>...or as a <em>message</em> for Donald to stop making waves with the IG, she also received some inexplicably unrevised envelope with some powder and she had to be sent to emergency care. See, it&#39;s easy to come up with wild theories.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His first wife Ivana accused him of beating and raping her in court documents. He was angry over a bad hair transplant he got, so she claimed he pulled out her hair and raped her.</p>

<p>Michael Cohen defended it by saying you can&#39;t rape your wife. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re talking about Donald Trump, you&#39;re talking about the front-runner for the GOP, presidential candidate, as well as private individual, who never raped anybody and of course understand that by the very definition you can&#39;t rape your spouse,&quot; Cohen said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a medical doctor and I&#39;ve heard that she has a benign condition of the kidney that required embolization. That makes me think of angiomyolipoma, that can bleed spontaneously and grow if not treated by embolization. So yeah, it could be a mere benign kidney condition, and I hope it is, nobody deserves cancer. </p>

<p>But yeah, it could be a blunt trauma caused by aggression. We never know. But if it were caused by blunt trauma I doubt the fact Melania went to the hospital would ever reach the newspapers.</p>
