       same buildings in which ICE is using?
      </p>
      <p>
       ICE is a criminal conviction agency (like the FBI) however it falls under the Department of Homeland Security - which doesn't fall under the Department of Justice like the FBI does.
      </p>
      <p>
       ICE is the new, official face of the State's militarized police force.

       i thought they were FEMA camps (
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-fema-coffins-plastic-grave-liners.t904/">
        and apparently that isn't correct either

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       it's still a somewhat plausible theory though. do you have any articles or interviews that have helped lead you to this scenario?

       The economic crash didn't deliver as much chaos as had been intended, and worst of all for their plans, a Democratic President and Congress were elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something they were sure would not be possible once the Democratic candidates were a woman they had been attacking since 1992 and a youngish African American, not very well known.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Kind of impossible to not believe that was planned, the only way the Republicans could expect to win was to have an impossible to elect Democratic candidate)
      </p>
      <p>
       Electing another Republican President in 2008 would have allowed used to create the kind of chaos we might see with this President.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't hard to believe they were hoping to put those to use, to stop food riots and what not.

       He is just presenting different interpretations of the same facts, to show that Trump can be construed just as easily as a bad actor than as a good guy. No need to respond with a strawman like this.

        Earlier in the summer of 2015, I was awestruck when I had an epiphany about much architecture had changed on commercial and public buildings. The most striking change came in the form building what clearly looks like guard towers on new strip malls, shopping malls, new schools and this trend even went so far as to include the retrofitting of CLOSED strip malls.

       The theory is old. It started in 1979.
ICE "at this moment" goes after mainly illegal immigrants with criminal history. It isn't profitable to feed them if they are caught. They are usually deported. I don't think they are dangerous enough. Trump's CIA director is looking to build another kind of militarized "guards" or maybe just want Blackwater back so they may complete their job of assassinating Trump to destabilize our country by angering his nazi kinda "fans".

       Detention center theories gain popularity among right wingers especially when the alt right is planning on some militia movement. That said, FEMA's internal memo does say that things can change and someday they can detain citizens.

       It predates 1979.  And it is a right-wing fear of a plan that is usually green-lighted by right-wing administrations.

       Left-wing Berkeley professor &amp; ex-Canadian diplomat Peter Dale Scott wrote the following article in 2006 about the "detention camps":

       <p>
        A little-known $385 million contract for Halliburton subsidiary KBR to build detention facilities for “an emergency influx of immigrants” is another step down the Bush administration’s road toward martial law.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Halliburton subsidiary has just received a $385 million contract from the Department of Homeland Security to provide “temporary detention and processing capabilities.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The contract — announced Jan. 24 by the engineering and construction firm KBR — calls for preparing for “an emergency influx of immigrants, or to support the rapid development of new programs” in the event of other emergencies, such as “a natural disaster.” The release offered no details about where Halliburton was to build these facilities, or when.

       Previously, in 1984, the Reagan Administration gave Oliver North the job of constructing the detention plan to round up "domestic enemies":

       went on a road trip recently and i wonder about all these brand new walmarts popping up everywhere. theyre big, and theyre usually in a locally strategic location. also curious is their secured in-store wifi being called "Eagle". in the local walmart distribution center, past the office in the actual warehouse are  flags such as marines, army, air force, among others i cant remember off the top of my head...

       Any facility can be turned into a detention camp overnight with modern military technology. Suburbs can be surrounded by razor wire in a matter of minutes with trucks that drive 30 miles per hour. (

       I believe in the "FEMA camp" theory but I think it is a distraction because any area can be modified to detain people, especially after they take away their guns!
