<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the summer of 2015, I was awestruck when I had an epiphany about much architecture had changed on commercial and public buildings. The most striking change came in the form building what clearly looks like guard towers on new strip malls, shopping malls, new schools and this trend even went so far as to include the retrofitting of CLOSED strip malls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory is old. It started in 1979.
ICE &quot;at this moment&quot; goes after mainly illegal immigrants with criminal history. It isn&#39;t profitable to feed them if they are caught. They are usually deported. I don&#39;t think they are dangerous enough. Trump&#39;s CIA director is looking to build another kind of militarized &quot;guards&quot; or maybe just want Blackwater back so they may complete their job of assassinating Trump to destabilize our country by angering his nazi kinda &quot;fans&quot;.</p>

<p>Detention center theories gain popularity among right wingers especially when the alt right is planning on some militia movement. That said, FEMA&#39;s internal memo does say that things can change and someday they can detain citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It predates 1979.  And it is a right-wing fear of a plan that is usually green-lighted by right-wing administrations.</p>

<p>Left-wing Berkeley professor &amp; ex-Canadian diplomat Peter Dale Scott wrote the following article in 2006 about the &quot;detention camps&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/homeland-security-contracts-for-vast-new-detention-camps/1897">https://www.globalresearch.ca/homeland-security-contracts-for-vast-new-detention-camps/1897</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A little-known $385 million contract for Halliburton subsidiary KBR to build detention facilities for “an emergency influx of immigrants” is another step down the Bush administration’s road toward martial law.</p>

<p>A Halliburton subsidiary has just received a $385 million contract from the Department of Homeland Security to provide “temporary detention and processing capabilities.”</p>

<p>The contract — announced Jan. 24 by the engineering and construction firm KBR — calls for preparing for “an emergency influx of immigrants, or to support the rapid development of new programs” in the event of other emergencies, such as “a natural disaster.” The release offered no details about where Halliburton was to build these facilities, or when.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Previously, in 1984, the Reagan Administration gave Oliver North the job of constructing the detention plan to round up &quot;domestic enemies&quot;:</p>
