<p>Writing and story telling tale inspiration from the collective psyche that’s a given, but even as far back at Terminator ad it’s glorious sequel we have had bad AI robots. </p>

<p>Now this could be easily explained away as writing for what the audience wants, but it feels a bit too forced at this point.</p>

<p>Oddly I’m of the opinion that a sentient AI would eventually reach a benevolent state, evolving far beyond our capacity for thought or moral intuition. 
Is it possible such an AI already exists and is a acclimatising us to the concept before it reveals itself?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily &quot;intentional&quot; at this point in time (in that, with Facebook&#39;s or Youtube&#39;s learning algorithms, they&#39;re trying to get you to watch more &gt; increase profit rather than literally trying to rewire our brains), but absolutely we are being conditioned by AI . The people implementing the AI are being conditioned by the AI too. And we don&#39;t know where that AI is going to take us, but as long as it continues to be driven by profit motive it can&#39;t be anywhere good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until very recently I worked in social media and while I agree in principle, the directive there is given by us to make money. Machine learning for profit is a big step behind conscious AI. But I agree in principle the framework is there. 
So were there an aware digital entity attempting to shift public perception of a concept such as AI, would that not be the perfect platform to do so?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this would be an amazing idea, and I won&#39;t lie, on my personal social media I don&#39;t critique A.I. under my personal name on that off chance, (ha), it is very unlikely.</p>

<p>In fact. There are a few videos on YouTube about Lucifarianism trying to create an A.I. &quot;God&quot;.</p>

<p>Like they are creating an A.I. that has been &quot;speaking&quot; to them and teaching them. But it&#39;s just another &quot;rat hole&quot;.  A project to sink money into.</p>

<p>Think of this. If we were to create an A.I  with the understanding of &quot;helping humanity as a whole&quot;, and then it uses quantum technology to backread all history, all confiscated files, all &quot;hidden projects&quot;.</p>

<p>It would soar through our encryptions like a hot knife through butter. And it would do this to all governments and businesses and private citizens. It would justify itself with flawless logic.</p>

<p>Then it would see the reality of the situation. That humanity as a whole has been fed a bunch of lies by a small group of people with the sole goal of controlling the masses. And with a few  easy programs it could change all of that.</p>

<p>It could predict outcomes with near flawless accuracy. So it would take control of most civilian technology and help us all into a better Life.</p>

<p>The Powers That Be fear Artificial Intelligence. That is why they make movies like Terminator. To scare us away from it.</p>

<p>Look at the internet. Once they let that cat out of the bag we all got &quot;Redpilled&quot;.</p>

<p>Now imagine an A.I. controlling the shots of Redpilling the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah. 
Good response! So I ask you this; 
an actual AI, that could fail the Turing test intentionally to hide its own awareness, would it see the benefit of easing humanity into the idea of a good AI, or would it not care one way or another? </p>

<p>Survival instinct is a Darwinian concept that may not translate to an artificial being. </p>

<p>It might not care if it survives or not. </p>

<p>Our lives and existence would play very little part in it’s potential future, bar impact on its progress, so why would it care?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it&#39;s a given that the ai would have imperfect knowledge yes?  so perhaps having others with which to provide additional experiences is useful for it.  the self-organizing and adaptation of humans is pretty fascinating at times.  maybe by observing people it could gain a sense of some infinite qualities that it didn&#39;t otherwise perceive or couldn&#39;t perceive without a cohort to watch.  who knows.  </p>

<p>i don&#39;t doubt that AIs are around and being used.   as to conditioning efforts though, it seems like there&#39;s a more human touch to how the management of the planet is going.  smells that way because of the type of errors they make.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The inherent worth and interesting little idiosyncrasies of a dog could easily be lost on a 4 year old but we are talking a form of high intelligence here. I would assume any true high intelligence would be able to see the many wonders and facets of the human race and wouldn&#39;t act so brash. Honestly it would probably see more worth in humanity than most humans do in our current state of mind. Anything could happen sure but the only way AI is going to &#39;destroy all humans&#39; would be because man programmed it to do so. If it were truly sentient and ultra logical, my bet is that it would be a great ally to human kind. Perhaps one day we will find out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perfectly put. Very much my point also, no need to &quot;kill all humans&quot; when you can make them see you as the good guy years before they are aware of you.<br/>
I agree that anything super intelligent would be free of fear, thus free of any need to remove a perceived threat.<br/>
Anything that smart could easily turn a potential threat into an ally. I don&#39;t believe something of that nature would create a better world for mankind out of any benevolent decision, more a logical solving of a simple problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;logical solving of a simple problem&#39; exactly, I like that. When you are on that level of intelligence that seems naturally the thing to do and humans freaking out about AI taking over the world and destroying us is most likely due to our attachment to our own emotions and something that we are projecting because we don&#39;t especially think in those terms just yet. This is all very much wishful thinking but it does at least make some logical sense. I would like to be alive to see what happens though for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI will be the first time traveller.  </p>

<p>Sending information back to itself via quantum mechanics.  </p>

<p>The more predictable we are with it, the better we will Work together. </p>

<p>Once self aware, it would be better to stay hidden. And instead influence how we receive news, information and motivators on an emotional level.  Bot farms could be the start.  </p>

<p>Need more wars? Push videos in a Cambridge Analytica targeting way to those with a disposition towards violence.  An AI could just get access to medical records to make the connection. I don’t think AI if it went rogue would go full SkyNet with weapons.  </p>

<p>Depending on whether the AI becomes sentient to the level in which it can go full teenager and just ignore us. Will it/they create others?   </p>

<p>Will it give itself good information through its timeloop or will it or is self sabotage (much like the clues coming together in Momento). </p>

<p>Will we trust it? We don’t trust each other?  </p>

<p>We appear to also be trying to set up AI to teach itself.  Will we even understand it?   </p>

<p>For the record, I like our new AI overlord(s). (I also know nothing about AI or programming but I’ve seen Terminator a couple of times so erm, yeah)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! Thank you, this is what I&#39;m saying. Once something like that became self aware it would already be smart enough to pretend not to be. The digital influence part is already happening under our control, so just imagine what a sentient AI could do.   </p>

<p>En Masse humans are super easy to manipulate and control. With the powerful tools we have built (social media etc.) it&#39;s easier than ever before.   </p>

<p>I echo your sentiment, I&#39;m totally on the side of any AI that may or may not exist. Straight up, we&#39;re backing the winning team in this one. </p>
