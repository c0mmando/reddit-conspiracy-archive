    <div class="md"><p>Browder is responsible for the death of Magnitski! Magnitski took the hardest fall for Browder and paid with his life for covering up the scum work of Browder and Company!</p>

<p>Browder stole untold millions and millions from hard every day working Russians in Banking and Loan scandals - just like happened here in America! Browder gave up his American citizenship to serve himself after fleeing Russia.</p>

<p>The scandal he concocted is so tangled, interwoven between UK Saudi, Israel and the US that the full magnitude of theft might never be known. BTW his security force was the Mossad and he admits as much. Some speculate this is how Browder had Magnitsky killed while in prison custody.</p>

<p>Love him or hate him but Putin loves Mother Russia without apology. This is a fast 4 min video in his own words:</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Magnitsky had alleged there had been a large-scale theft from the Russian state, sanctioned and carried out by Russian officials. He was arrested and eventually died in prison seven days before the expiration of the one-year term during which he could be legally held without trial.[4] In total, Magnitsky served 358 days in Moscow&#39;s Butyrka prison. He developed gall stones, pancreatitis, and a blocked gall bladder, and received inadequate medical care. A human rights council set up by the Kremlin found that he had been physically assaulted shortly before his death.[5][6] His case has become an international cause célèbre.[7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think whoever held him in custody under torture for a whole year is responsible for his death.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Browder was more successful in intimidating the European Parliament where a screening of the film was cancelled in late April while I was in the audience. But I have now seen the banned documentary privately and “The Magnitsky Act. Behind the Scenes” is truly an amazing film that takes the viewer through the thought processes of well-known independent film maker Andrei Nekrasov as he sorts through the evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what the film shows is how Nekrasov, as he detected loose ends to the official story, begins to unravel Browder’s fabrication which was designed to conceal his own corporate responsibility for the criminal theft of the money. As Browder’s widely accepted story collapses, Magnitsky is revealed not to be a whistleblower but a likely abettor to the fraud who died in prison not from an official assassination but from banal neglect of his medical condition.</p>

They decided it was important enough to bring to the floor and it passed almost unanimously. Since then, only more evidence has surfaced of similar money laundering and human rights abuses by the same people.</p>

<p>Veselnitskaya herself was the defendant&#39;s (Prevezon) representative in the SDNY court case accusing them of laundering money transferred from accounts tied to the $230 mill tax fraud against Hermitage. Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s a conflict of interest there?</p>

<p>The source of Browder&#39;s accounts are public: his employees, Magnitsky&#39;s doctor and family, Magnitsky himself (from jail), as well as independent Russian journalists.</p>

<p>Factually incorrect statement &amp; blatant Browder lie.  Magnitsky’s own mother knows he was not beaten to death &amp; has stated so on film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, excuse me.</p>

<p>It was somewhere between the year of imprisonment without medical help, the pancreatitis and gall stones, the generally poor treatment, and the severe beating that took place the same morning of his death.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re getting your evidence from the same prison which illegally held him in these conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that it&#39;s ok, but everyone is using offshore shell companies. How do you think Browder managed to get his investors funds out of Russia when the authorities were trying to kill his employees? Browder worked with several businesses doing shady things - that didn&#39;t directly implicate him before either. Try to find a successful hedge fund ceo who hasn&#39;t. Again, not trying to defend the practice.</p>

<p>He stepped on the Obama admins toes with the Magnitsky act because it spoiled their plans to reset relations with Russia.</p>

<p>The appearances of him obstructing investigations of money laundering tied to the tax scam made by Russians against his firm is actually just careful maneuvering. Russia is using lawfare tactics in multiple nations to discredit Browder&#39;s account and spoil the cases.</p>

<p>Regardless of your thoughts on Browder, the official account of what happened to Magnitsky is not in dispute. There are multiple sources for that, not depending on Browder.</p>

<p>Yes.  It absolutely fucking is.  Browder told everyone they beat him to death &amp; that did not happen this is why i encourage you to watch the magnitsky act behind the scenes they requested McCain comment on their findings &amp; he ignored the request.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why dont you fucking tell me why Magnitsky’s own mother admits on film he was not beat to death in prison?  The whole reason for placing sanctions on Russia was for human rights violations against Magnitsky in a russian prison.  Thats a pretty bold claim coming from a country that imprisons more people than other country in the world.  It’s quite clear you havent researched shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you so vehement about this? Chill out. Why does your argument rest on the semantics of exactly <em>how</em> an innocent man was killed by Russian officials? Was it only one of the things I mentioned previously? probably not. Was it none of the things? No. If the preliminary Russian autopsy supports the case that it was pancreatitis that Magnitsky finally succumbed to, does that make the beating he received while dying anyways ok?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t support your argument, so you keep changing it. If you&#39;re so concerned with the reliability of the messenger, why then <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dissident-director-helped-trumps-russia-comrade-attack-us">arbitrarily choose which messenger to question</a>?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1276590?isSearch=True;">Why not read from sources other than Browder or Nekrasov</a>? If Browder was lying, then why would Magnitsky defend him to his death?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just listen to one guy and then claim to have done your research.</p>
