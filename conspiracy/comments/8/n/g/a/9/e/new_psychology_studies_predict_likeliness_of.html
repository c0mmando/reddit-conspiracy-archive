<p>Because vast amounts of scientific research in psychology shows we have a big set of biases and standard mistakes we make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not a study against conspiracy theorists. It should actually <em>advance</em> them.</p>

<p>At this moment, real problems (like for example central banking problems) are very easy to cover up. &#39;Conspiracy theorists&#39; are all mentally challenged anyway, so who believes those. Some of the responses in this thread are <em>exactly</em> why conspiracy theorists in general are not credible.</p>

<p>Those that are able to be rational and question their own mind, but ask real questions may be actually right about the conspiracies they are trying to expose. But these get snowed under by the vast amounts of people that think <em>everything</em> is a conspiracy and everything up the hierarchy is &#39;evil&#39;</p>

<p>The article should challenge you to become an actually <em>good</em> conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>The problem with current blue light MRSA research is they use LEDs. These lights are not powerful enough to penetrate skin. The heat from a 1000 watt high pressure sodium bulb heats up the topical benzthonium chloride/ epsom salt solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not much too believe. It&#39;s very simple. There&#39;s a theory, you make a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, write down what you did and have it reviewed by your peers. They can just do what you did and confirm or reject. And if they all die and someone new makes the same theory, they can just test it and come to the same conclusion. The beauty of science is that <em>it is independent of belief.</em></p>

<p>And although there is of course corruption within science (due to the enormous pressure to publish articles and to get more funding), that doesn&#39;t mean everybody is corrupt. I know a lot of scientists. These are generally good people with a mission of finding out how things work. <em>Just as a good conspiracy theorist would.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep bringing up Tesla like he was some sort of divine avatar of science? First of all, he wasn&#39;t even a scientist, but an engineer; he did not create or verify theories of his own, but created applications for existing scientific discoveries. There&#39;s not anything wrong with that, of course--he was undoubtedly one of the 20th century&#39;s keenest minds--but to claim that scientists shouldn&#39;t bother with the scientific method because some eccentric inventor didn&#39;t either strikes me as pretty insane.</p>

<p>Second, Tesla came as far as he did <em>in spite</em> of his zany ideas, not because of them. The fellow did not believe that electrons exist, much less that they had anything to do with electricity, and maintained belief in the ether well after it was experimentally disproven in 1887.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the study itself...</p>

<p>Consistent with H4, the 3-way interaction on T1 to T2 change in conspiracy endorsement was
marginally significant (b= .71, 95% CI(-.03, 1.45), p=.06). However, the 2-way interaction between
political knowledge was marginally significant for Clinton (b= -.52, 95% CI(-1.08, .04), p=.07) but
not Trump supporters (b= .02, 95% CI(.02, .56), p=.98). Simple slope analyses on Clinton supporters
indicates that post-explanation political belief confidence was associated with a marginally significant
increase in conspiratorial beliefs for participants high in political knowledge (b= 0.29, 95% CI(-0.05,
0.63), p=.09) and among individuals low in political knowledge (b= 0.54, 95% CI(-0.05, 0.63),
p=.08), although inspection of the unstandardized coefficients suggest this effect was larger among
people low (vs. high) in explicit political knowledge. These estimates are summarized in Table 2-4.
In sum, we find evidence to suggest that higher post-explanation political belief confidence
was associated with increased conspiratorial beliefs, particularly among participants low in explicit
political knowledge who voted for the losing candidate in the 2016 presidential election</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This study has nothing to do with our own fallacies.  It consisted of a small sample size looking for correlation between people that think they know  a lot about politics,  and endorsement of conspiratorial thinking, and they found a significant correlation in the Clinton supporters post election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting article, thanks for posting here. I have a problem with the article, as well as a conspiracy-theorist perspective. First, I think that it would be worthwhile to see a sample of questions asked by the study. I would like to see what kinds of questions were used to evaluate how people understand &quot;a series of public policies.&quot; That is quite a broad encompassing of a complex topic, and the way the questions are written could be misleading indeed.</p>

<p>Second. I take issue with your subtle characterization of conspiracy theorists as insecure, racist males. I have been forced into the conspiracy world as a female who has traveled the world for years. Having your eyes opened to the 9-11 situation is a waking-up that is painful and harsh, but once it&#39;s been done, it&#39;s done. </p>

<p>Congratulations on your research, but please be more transparent in the future. And know that trying to paint an entire intellectual group in a particular light is unfair and unproductive. Seek, instead, to understand and educate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not participate in this study, so it&#39;s not my article. I think the original research paper should be available and able to answer the questions in your first and last paragraph.</p>

<p>&gt;  I take issue with your subtle characterization of conspiracy theorists as insecure, racist males. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting this from. I&#39;ve posted the article here to make one single point: <em>don&#39;t always trust your brain</em>. Our brains do weird things sometimes, whether you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize you had nothing to do with the study. I am referring to Joseph A. Vitriol, a co-author on both studies, who says, &quot;The current political moment is one of volatility and major social change, including increased cultural and ethnic diversity and widespread collective action among members of previously marginalized groups, who are effectively challenging the status quo and seeking change in public policy and political discourse.”</p>

<p>He adds, “For many members of the public, particularly individuals who have benefited from existing social and political arrangements, these developments and changes are quite threatening and can motivate compensatory endorsement of conspiracy beliefs or theories.&quot;</p>

<p>This not-so-subtly paints conspiracy theorists as white nationalists, and I disagree with that characterization.</p>

<p>This study seems to me set up in order to discredit those who don&#39;t believe the government&#39;s lies. The undertone of &quot;don&#39;t trust your own mind&quot; is dangerous and, while everyone needs to practice critical thinking, the fact is: all governments lie. We need to trust our own minds more, not less, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you keep bringing up Tesla like he was some sort of divine avatar of science? First of all, he wasn&#39;t even a scientist, but an engineer; he did not create or verify theories of his own, but created applications for existing scientific discoveries. There&#39;s not anything wrong with that, of course--he was undoubtedly one of the 20th century&#39;s keenest minds--but to claim that scientists shouldn&#39;t bother with the scientific method because some eccentric inventor didn&#39;t either strikes me as pretty insane.</p>

<p>Second, Tesla came as far as he did <em>in spite</em> of his zany ideas, not because of them. The fellow did not believe that electrons exist, much less that they had anything to do with electricity, and maintained belief in the ether well after it was experimentally disproven in 1887.</p>
