       let me tell you the 'evidence' that originally convinced me that man has walked on the moon...
      </p>
      <p>
       in 7th grade science there were about 2 pages in a textbook consisting of a few photographs and some text. we blew threw those pages and the teacher didn't allow us any time to ask questions and didn't give us any homework related to the moon landings, and that was it. it was never brought up again
      </p>
      <p>
       so in the 7th grade,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was what originally convinced me that men had walked on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was what i accepted as evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       now my question for you all is, how flimsy was the 'evidence' that you accepted?
      </p>
      <p>
       i bet most people are too ashamed to present the evidence that originally convinced them, because when they go to fetch it, they suddenly realize how bogus their evidence looks and feels
      </p>

       I'm sure most people who were too young to "witness" the landing back in the 69 have a very similar story. It was just something that was told to us as young children and further drilled into our heads via news and entertainment media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just sort of always took it as a given because everyone believed it....or at least said they believed it. Not until i actually considered the possibility that it was a lie and looked into the "evidence" for myself was I able to see the deception...and it took some time. 30+ years of indoctrination doesn't just disappear in an instant, no matter how much evidence you have to prove it was a lie.

       truth! as mark twain allegedly observed, its easier to fool someone than it is to convince someone that they have been fooled
      </p>
      <p>
       it didn't take much to convince me that men had walked on the moon, but it took quite a bit to convince me to change my mind

       this phenomenon can be observed in other areas, such as with vaccine zealots

       a friend once related to me the story of how he and another friend had gotten into an argument about a particular bible verse, and whether it ended in "for ever" or "for ever and ever".
      </p>
      <p>
       they finally got the bible out and read the exact same verse from the exact same bible at the exact same time... and yet they both continued to insist that the bible said what they thought it had said

       i experience this kind of Mandela effect (for lack of a better descriptor) almost every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       after a while, you not only look at the evidence, but you also start to ponder why other people perceive evidence differently
      </p>
      <p>
       it would be easy to assume that you are always right, and that the other person is wrong, but clearly this can't always be the case

       the hollow face experiment in particular is so helpful in illustrating how your brain will determine what you eye sees, as opposed to your eye determining what your brain will see
      </p>
      <p>
       did you know that your eyes are actually a part of your brain that is exposed to light?
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, no matter how many times you watch that video, and even when your brain knows what it should be seeing, your brain will see what it wants to see anyway. I've tried to force myself to see the hollow mask as it really is, and thus far i have not been able to do it
      </p>
      <p>
       so this effect is true for everyone, which is a lesson and a warning to you... you can't trust your eyes or your brain, especially after they have been brainwashed to see a certain way
      </p>
      <p>
       the video isn't political or religious, and its short. so its quick and easy to share, and to help others to better understand themselves and their own shortcomings and exploitable weaknesses

       You sound angry, because your world view is being challenged. Maybe challenge it, and have a discussion? Could be good for you and others. If not, you're no different than a kid getting upset and taking his ball home.

       I had this discussion with this exact OP a couple of days ago. Whenever
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       worldview was challenged he simply denied the evidence and spouted yet more bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the guy that denies there is such a thing as "escape velocity" and who kept linking to wikipedia's article about the inverse square law without having the slightest bit of understanding what it meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking to him is not "having a discussion", it's more like beating your head against a wall. The wall is still ignorant and you end up with a headache.

       I believed in the moon landings, when I also believed that the US fought and won it's Independence. Both were lies. Before people say: "But, but, what about Russia and the others!". Well, I'll say: "Kola Superdeep Borehole". One went "up", the other went "down". Both stopped. Curious, no?

       It's a shame more people don't know about this. Priests of Scientism convince the masses that they know what is at the center of the so called globe earth, which by their definition is ~20,903,520 ft from the surface, yet the deepest hole man has dug on record is ~40,230 ft from the surface. Seems legit.

       I just think God simply created an environment for us to live and thrive in and gave it borders. Not so much unlike how we would have an ant farm or aquarium, but large enough that it would take great effort to reach said borders, and if/when we got close, it would be extremely dangerous for us. Extreme heat and or water pressure below us, extreme cold at the furthest points from the center of the habitat, and lack of matter/oxygen above us.

       I remember watching a video once about how lab animals behavior would change for the worst once they realized that they were in a "cage" but until it did, it was content and lived symbiotically with its environment. And I remember wondering if something similar happened to mankind during/after the industrial revolution when human technology allowed us to travel and explore the furthest regions of our environment...

       I'm not sure I understand what earthquakes or how they are caused have anything to do with the fact that the scientism establishment claims to know the inner workings and makeup of the globe, yet have only been able to witness a small fraction of depth from the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I admit, I know very little about seismic activity. But just because I can't make a model explaining it, does not mean that their model is correct. And that is even more true if they claim seismic activity has anything to do with a section of their globe that is deeper than what they are able to observe, either by digging or ground penetrating radar.

       No technology exists that could give anyone a clear look at the inner makeup of the supposed globe earth, not at anywhere close to the depths we are talking about. So for them to say that they know is a lie. Its that simple.

       Ok...if you are referring to ground penetrating radar or similar tech, you are greatly overestimating its capabilities. As I said before. The deepest hole ever dug on record was ~40,230 ft deep, and the center of supposed globe earth is ~20,903,520 ft deep. If you think that ground penetrating radar and or similar tech can give us a picture of the earth at anywhere near 20 million feet deep, even if it was used at the bottom of said deepest hole, you are fooling yourself.

       so,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was the evidence that finally convinced you that men had walked on the moon? you only became a believer in the last few years?
      </p>
      <p>
       in the picture below, first find the astronaut footpath
      </p>
      <p>
       then find the LRV final "parking spot",
      </p>
      <p>
       then ask yourself how the astronaut got from the LRV back to the lunar lander without leaving another footpath

       What convinced me originally was that a country wouldn’t have launched a skyscraper-sized mass of fuel and metal within view of thousands of people if that gigantic thing wasn’t going somewhere. 6 times. Just launching a 363 ft tall structure into orbit would be astronomical. If you’re bent on faking it, that’s unreasonable. Plus the anti-moon landing shit was originally all about the photographs looking fake. I’ve never seen the discrepancies because I understand photographic exposure, perspective, and atmosphere. I render for a living. But even when I was young I understood these things.

       That’s it? You realize that you’re looking at both sides of the flag here? From different angles as the flag finds a resting position over time? That being said, the shadows look exactly the same to me on both sides. You’re viewing pic 1 from a more acute angle. The stars are equally in shadow and the edge angles all look the same.

       I really honestly don’t see what the issue with this is. I kind of thought this was a joke at first. But I’ll look at it. I’m on vacation so I don’t have photoshop, Vray, and Rhino, etc which I could compare the images better with.

      <p>
       It looks like you’re seeing two sides of the same flag where one side is illuminated and because of the camera’s exposure the whiteness of the stars (on the edge of the shadow) on that side get picked up. Nothing crazy here. I think maybe people are confused about how the flag is crinkled and maybe don’t realize that they’re seeing it from different angles?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that the flag was probably still reaching its material equilibrium (as in a natural resting position where the tension and compression forces in the fibers equalize) as the photos weren’t taken at the same time (it probably moved slightly).

       yes its a bit curious that the coloring of the flag is so off, which is why i made a sepia version of the same pics, so that people are not confused by the colors being off and are able to focus on the shadows and contour of the flags

       Obviously it's impossible to see them they're small reflective boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the laser beam fired from earth is around 2km wide when it reaches the moon due to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_light">
        collimation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Only around 1 in 30 million photos from the laser actually hits the reflector, but it's enough to be detected on earth (the reflectors are box reflectors which reflect straight back to the source).

       I have a couple of laser pointers. I have reflected the laser of windows hundreds of meters away.
      </p>
      <p>
       More powerful lasers are used by missiles and a variety of other applications where greater distances are required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still more powerful lasers have been built which can shine a beam onto the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you can't wrap your head around it doesn't mean it hasn't been done. I think if you actually studied the science you would realise it's quite a basic concept.

       the problem with your theory is that a telescope is used to gather light, yet cannot see a reflector on the moon, whereas a laser concentrates its light into a tight dot, which means hitting the reflector is nearly impossible, as your source illustrates

      <p>
       furthermore, the detector can't differentiate between a photon reflected off of the surface of the moon, and a photon reflected off a reflector
      </p>
      <p>
       last but not least, reflectors get dusty and quickly become inoperable
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no plausible reason for putting reflectors on the moon.

       My source illustrates the opposite in that a collimated laser beam will decolimiate over distance because of diffraction so the photon stream is 2km wide on average which allows reflection of a few photons by the briefcase sized reflector.

       even at 2km, its implausible that the beam would hit the intended target at over 200,000 miles away.

       Sorry but the fact you asked "arent astronauts footprints made in dust" shows you to not understand even the basics.

      <p>
       If it snows outside with 0 wind whatsoever can I make a footprint in it?

       The reason the footprints will be there for a very very long time is because there's no wind

       Yeah, I get the concept of pointing a laser at the moon. It was done in 1963, before men were said to ever walk there and put the reflectors, which it turns out are not necessary to reflect a laser from the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that you have no way of doing this. No one can explain how they can “aim” the laser at the reflector, but that’s a different story anyway. Anyone using the reflectors as proof of a moon walk is simply relying on a NASA-endorsed planetarium somewhere saying “ok everyone. We did it, it worked.”

       but seriously. MIT could measure with a laser in 1961, which means reflectors are not necessary, nor accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, there is no plausible 'national security' reason to need to dominate the moon by putting a US flag and/or reflectors there

       during the height of the VietNam War, the establishment did the old 'point my finger at the moon, and make everyone look' trick, and everyone fell for it
      </p>
      <p>
       did measuring the distance to the moon have any significant effect on anything that was going on at the time, or even today in 2018?
      </p>
      <p>
       please don't say we learned that the moon is moving away from us, because that was already knowable in 1961

        Using that logic you can't confirm anything

       Actually that is how you confirm something....by testing/experiencing something for yourself....and there are a metric shit ton of things that one can easily confirm...

       I haven't personally been to NZ, and admit that I take it on faith that it actually exists. However, as far as I know, I can buy a ticket for a trip there, jump on a plane or boat and arrive there, just as millions and millions of other people have claimed to do. Can't exactly say that about mars, the moon or low earth orbit now can we? And its been what? 50 years sine NASA supposedly landed a man on the moon? And they have had billions billions of dollars to work with since then? Are you telling me they had the technology 50 years ago, the money and the manpower and still haven't turned it into a commercial business yet? In USA ffs? Really? Hell, I even remember back in the day one of those backstreet boys or nsync guys, i forget which, offered NASA millions to let him go up into space and they turned him down. Gimme a break...
      </p>
      <p>
       But oh yeah, keep gushing over NASA's obviously fake footage and interviews with astronNOTS in "space" and keep holding your breath for Elon or Jeff to make that dream, or even a much less ambitious dream of "low earth orbit" commercial flights, a reality...I'm "sure" they will make that a thing....soon™ ;)

       I remember something along the lines of him wanting to do a reality show in space and after the process was started, all of the sudden the people funding the project pulled out and stopped making payments for his seat. Regardless, forgive me if I don't take the word of a handful of multi millionaire/billionaires/fanboys who say they have been up there. And besides all the "eye witness" testimony in the world doesn't change the fact that NASA has repeatedly been caught lying to the public.

       There are few people I feel more sorry for than the Israelis. To be so utterly deceived by the enemy, that they freely do his will and worship him thinking that he is the God of creation, and that they won't pay a heavy price for the shenanigans they are getting into...

       And honestly, by the looks of things that are coming to pass, we seem to be pretty close to the rebuilding of the temple, and from what I understand, that is pretty close to the end of the line for this place. Of course timelines in the Bible can be foggy...with shit luck, this garbage could stretch on for another hundred years or more...

       Those passages have brought me comfort many a time over the years. And they are the primary reason I no longer stress out over all the shit that is happening day in and day out. All of this was foreseen and prophesied. All of this must come to pass. I decided to just go with the flow and trust in God.

       “But wait,” you say, “NASA has solid evidence of the validity of the Moon landings. They have, for example, all of that film footage shot on the moon and beamed live directly into our television sets.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we’re on the subject, I have to mention that transmitting live footage back from the Moon was another rather innovative use of 1960s technology. More than two decades later, we would have trouble broadcasting live footage from the deserts of the Middle East, but in 1969, we could beam that shit back from the Moon with nary a technical glitch!
      </p>
      <p>
       As it turns out, however, NASA doesn’t actually have all of that Moonwalking footage anymore. Truth be told, they don’t have any of it. According to the agency, all the tapes were lost back in the late 1970s. All 700 cartons of them. As Reuters reported on August 15, 2006, “The U.S. government has misplaced the original recording of the first moon landing, including astronaut Neil Armstrong’s famous ‘one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind’ … Armstrong’s famous moonwalk, seen by millions of viewers on July 20, 1969, is among transmissions that NASA has failed to turn up in a year of searching, spokesman Grey Hautaluoma said. ‘We haven’t seen them for quite a while. We’ve been looking for over a year, and they haven’t turned up,’ Hautaluoma said … In all, some 700 boxes of transmissions from the Apollo lunar missions are missing.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the nail in the coffin for me when I first read about it years ago. Anyone who actually believes these people have my sincere pity.

       You linked to the LRO images, which show indiscernible and shitty pixels only, which do not show what anyone would identify as the lunar landings sites, and which come from NASA, the government agency under question in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you reference Chine confirming the sites but do not substantiate this in any way, though it begs the question.

       he asked me where i was from, and i told him

      <p>
       he acted surprised and said that was where he was from too!

      <p>
       and years later i tell my friend about this chance encounter, and he calls me an idiot

       because that old veteran asks everyone the same question and says he's from where ever you say you are from

       why? have you seen astronauts gone wild, where a guy with a camera confronts astronauts and asks them to swear on a bible and most of them get all upset instead of just swearing on the bible and making a fool of the documentarian

       is hard to watch, if you are one to observe facial expressions, because these people are clearly lying, and its sad when you understand what they are lying about

       does that seem odd that you are allowed to ask about the Pythagorean Theorem all day long, even though its been proved 8 ways of Sunday...

       but you weren't allowed to ask about the Moon landing because theres some sketchy evidence that supposedly supports something thats technologically impossible?

       We went to the planetarium when I was in grade school, several times, and I had several books about planets and the solar system. When I was a young boy my friend's dad took some friends and me to see
       <em>
        Apollo 13
       </em>
       with Tom Hanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're a kid you just take these things for granted. You have no concept of conspiracies and like Hitler said, the bigger and bolder the lie is the easier it is to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never watched the original footage or interviews with astronauts or anything like this. Most people have not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you imagine how things would be on the lunar front now, almost 50 years later, if we had really gone to the moon, vs how they are now, with lost telemetry data and endless excuses and justifications for every bizarre anomaly that is pointed out, it's pretty obvious things have unfolded exactly how they would have in the wake of a hoax rather than a real moon trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I used to talk about the Van Allen belts and stuff like this when debating the moon missions. Now, I don't believe anyone can go anyway.

       I watched on tv as it happened. If it was impossible for the USA or anyone else to go to the moon, the Russians would have called them out for a propaganda victory. Not a peep from them or anyone else who KNOW what went down.

       When discussing moon landing hoax theories, I think it's important to distinguish between two very different possibilities:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's all a big lie and we have never landed on the moon.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There was tremendous pressure to land before 1970 to fulfill JFK's big promise. As the deadline approached, NASA had everything worked out and tested except for the actual landing itself, and they weren't sure if they could put it together in time without taking too much risk. In a moment of desperation, they decided to run Apollo 11 as another Lunar orbit with Lunar Module descent (similar to Apollo 10), but then faked the landing itself. At least some of the later Apollo missions were legitimate.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Personally, I put a lot more credibility into the second theory. This is the kind of cover-up that really makes sense from the standpoint of national pride/security. The program was so massive and so much of it was independently confirmed in real time that I have a hard time believing it was all just a big show.

       That’s it? You realize that you’re looking at both sides of the flag here? From different angles as the flag finds a resting position over time? That being said, the shadows look exactly the same to me on both sides. You’re viewing pic 1 from a more acute angle. The stars are equally in shadow and the edge angles all look the same.

        My source illustrates the opposite in that a collimated laser beam will decolimiate over distance because of diffraction so the photon stream is 2km wide on average which allows reflection of a few photons by the briefcase sized reflector.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       even at 2km, its implausible that the beam would hit the intended target at over 200,000 miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       furthermore, if they have the technology to track the moon accurately enough to hit a reflector with a laser, then there would be even less need for a reflector

        The reflector is small and not visible to telescopes.
