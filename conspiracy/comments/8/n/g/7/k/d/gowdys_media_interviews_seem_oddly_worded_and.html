<p>I thought Mueller already said he wont indict Trump, and they really havent produced much, what they have can be chalked up to them throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.</p>

<p>It’s that simple.  He lied.  It’s not true, and no matter how loudly he screams it and how many times he repeats it, it will continue to be untrue.  For Christ’s sake, Giuliani admitted that the whole spygate thing is a story they cooked up to sway public opinion in Trump’s favor.  This isn’t rocket surgery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nunes memo debunked the first two. </p>

<p>The third was debunked in a briefing from DOJ to the Congressional leaders.</p>

<p>What does #4 mean, is that just made up? </p>

<p>The FBI did meet with the Trump Campaign and with Congressional leader, McConnell who threw a fit and demanded that information no be made public until after the election when it was via the announcement of sanctions against Russia for election inteference. </p>

<p>The FBI accepted a report from a third party about the DNC servers,  how is that different from using private contractors? </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know what the FBI knows about Seth Rich and Wikileaks but I think that will be made public soon after Roger Stone is indicted. </p>

<p>Why do  you think the FBI needs to investigate the Seth Rich murder and how do you know they are not? </p>

<p>I think 2 or three years were spent on investigating and screaming about Hillary&#39;s email server, and Congress continues to flap on about it. </p>

<p>What is a, &quot;process,&quot; crime? Is it something only liberals and Democratic commit?</p>

<p>Nope. Besides, we have yet to see the documents Nunes requested.  </p>

<p>Unmasking. Susan Rice, Samantha Powers</p>

<p>Does not refute the FBI didn&#39;t tell Trump when they deployed a spy.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI accepted a report from a third party about the DNC servers...  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They never laid hands on the server. The same server they say Russia hacked.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think the FBI needs to investigate the Seth Rich murder  </p>

<p>To find out who did it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think 2 or three years were spent on investigating and screaming about Hillary&#39;s email server, and Congress continues to flap on about it.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we will find they broke the law while doing it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is a, &quot;process,&quot; crime?   </p>

<p>In the process of investigation someone lied.   </p>

<p>&quot;That the Republican and Democrat nominee for president received a <strong>standardized briefing on counterintelligence</strong> is hardly a news story,&quot; said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman. </p>

<p>Ignoring the difference between a standardized briefing and a briefing for an active Russian infiltration effort that required spies, targeted trump subordinates, unmasking, FISA abuse, Title one surveillance warrant, wiretaps and leaks to the press. </p>

<p>Breaking the law yet they have bought about no charges or even attempted to, make complete sense. On the other hand those on trump campaign have been found guilty and prosecuted.
