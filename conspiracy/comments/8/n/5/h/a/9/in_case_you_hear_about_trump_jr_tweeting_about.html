       And from my recollection he says pretty explicitly that he didn't perform confiscations himself: " I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the — I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt." He seemed genuinely just confused by what he was being accused of (in a non-native tongue) in that interview.

       From 1933 until 1945, it was the sole official youth organisation in Germany and was partially a paramilitary organisation; it was composed of the Hitler Youth proper for male youths aged 14 to 18, the German Youngsters in the Hitler Youth (Deutsches Jungvolk in der Hitler Jugend or "DJ", also "DJV") for younger boys aged 10 to 14, and the League of German Girls (Bund Deutsche Mädel or "BDM").

       He was an undercover Jewish child living with a Christian family who witnessed Jewish peoples property getting taken away. He was asked if he felt guilty and he said no, because he was a child and there was nothing he could have done to stop it anyway. It's fine if you think that's weird, but calling the dude a fuckin Nazi is ridiculous.

       He was asked if it fucked with him at all mentally. He wasn't asked if he felt morally responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was asked if being directly involved with stealing Jewish people's property during the holcaust had any emotional effect on him... His response:
      </p>
      <p>
       "No, not at all".
      </p>
      <p>
       I will absolve people who were forced in to fucked up shit as children. But I will never trust someone who has zero empathy or mental strife after being involved with fucking with people to that degree.

       He wasnt directly involved. He was a jewish kid who got lucky. He wasnt like "hey Nazis, there are some jews over there. Go get em!" Its sort of a weird question to ask if he felt personally responsible for this happening. It's fine if you think Soros is an asshole with too much money and power in politics all over the world. But he wasnt some Nazi collaborator or symapthizer. He calls them a tremendous threat of evil. I'm sure there are plenty of reasons you could find for why you dont like Soros. But trying to paint him as a Nazi is jumping the shark.

       Hey I know your father made you murder and rape those kids when you were too young to understand or do anything to stop it but did that fuck with you at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       "No not at all"
      </p>
      <p>
       My point isn't that he is responsible. Its that he feels zero emotion or empathy over the ordeal. He's a sociopath.

       Being ordered to be complicit in the hollocaust is pretty terrible in and of itself.

       The particular analogy of horrible acts isnt all that important to the point.

       He wasnt complicit. He was a kid who had he not been undercover, would have gone to those death camps too. Let's say some guy cuts in front of you in line for a roller coaster. Next thing you know, that roller coaster goes off the rails and kills everyone on the ride. Are you morally responsible for that guys death?

       Again he didnt do anything. He got lucky. He wasnt "on the wrong side." He just escaped the bad side. Let's say your dad comes home in a drunken rage. Your mom is worried about her young children so she tells you guys to go hide in the closet. You and your little sister sit in the closet while your dad beats your mom until she dies. Now are you and your little sister responsible for your moms death?

       He isnt complicit because he could not possibly have been, the question is why is being involved in such a horrible situation apparently "no big deal" to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would think he would have said some shit like

       "it is one of my greatest regrets"

       Why would he ever regret surviving the holocaust? That makes no sense. It's fine if you think his response is odd, but the dude isnt a nazi. And hes not a nazi symapthizer or collaborator.

       I said the NRA has more incentive to fake mass shootings then the government, considering they make loads of money after every shooting and the government hasn't taken guns away after endless mass shootings.

       Just a rule of thumb for Conspiracies, if it is played on repeat on Mainstream channels for 24 months straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not a conspiracy its a controlled narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for example Trump being good pals with Jeff Epstein, owner of Lolita Express and Lolita Island and saying in an interview
      </p>
      <p>
       "jeff likes his girls young"
      </p>
      <p>
       before the guy was arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       See thats a solid Trump conspiracy that isnt on the airwaves, not to mention the pictures of him hanging out partying with the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia gate thing is a circus act that will lead nowhere, he will not be indicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesnt mean he isnt a deepstate plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I ask again do you actually believe in any conspiracies maybe something non-political, I can tell you like to argue about politics.

       I dont think Trump will get indicted or impeached. But hes been Russia's useful idiot at least by just looking at the people he chose to hire. And he acts like hes not allowed to say anything bad about them for some reason. Hillary got non stop coverage on Fox for all of her scandals, does that mean they arent real conspiracies too? I think there are elite pedophile rings, and I like talking about people behind the scenes that are pulling all the strings. I just dont buy into the whole "they are all liberal satan worshippers who eat children." I like talking about government cover ups, what's really going on with Isreal vs Palestine and how they seem to have an overwhelming effect on our politicians. Theres plenty to discuss.

       As I said before I dont watch TV news. But saying that there is nothing going on between Trump and Russia simply because CNN talks about it is an awful argument. Fox talked about all of Hillarys scandals non stop. And they are the most popular TV news channel. Does that mean all those scandals were fake too?

       First off there are reasons that civilised societies do not treat thirteen year old children as adults.  Second the slanderous accusations were addressed and are baseless.  Third conservatives like you will grasp at anything to attack the other team.  And fourth, nice assumption, but I am not what you would define as a "liberal".  Democratic socialist perhaps, maybe Leftist, maybe a bit Bolshie, though I prefer Progressive.

       The neocon neolib NWO typically believes that if they deny deny dent, distract, and shift enough blame, people eventually will believe their version of events. HRC's hero Saul Alinsky summarized their method best if you're a new subscriber.

       So I have to prove the former Nazi who helped actual fucking Hitler Nazi's forcibly remove Jews from their home was violent.  No! He has to prove he wasn't violent. Because violent acts are the nature of Nazism. Especially, in Germany during the 30s and 40s against Jews. So, he has to prove he went against that nature. And his word isn't good enough.

       You're right its near impossible to prove. It was over 70 yrs ago. And that's what he is relying on.  In no other circumstance would anybody trust the word of a man that helped the Nazis force Jews out of their homes. You would never give a person who worked with and collaborated with the Nazis the benefit of the doubt! So, why are you so keen to give him that benefit?

       What evidence do you have that he's this big boogeyman? There are a lot of assertions from CHUDs like you (I've looked into them) repeated for a very long time now. And I know that they are taken as Gospel around here. You may disagree with him politically. But I have seen no EVIDENCE that he is doing or has done anything nefarious. Including in this post. So, who do you listen to? What is so damn convincing?
