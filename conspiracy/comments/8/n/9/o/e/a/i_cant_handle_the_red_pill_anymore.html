       I recently began thinking for myself, to start researching and getting a second opinion on everything that we encounter in our world. It's all fake, all of it. From the very religion I believed to the food I eat to the music I listen to. Everything is either faked to cover up the way things really operate or are corrupted by the powers at be.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a college student, this has been a really hard realization for me. For the past 5 months there hasn't been a single moment where I haven't been paralyzed by fear of the future. I don't want to get married, have kids, or even continue my studies because, in all honesty, what's the point? If the horrific end game of the elite will occur in 2021 or 2030, then I will have lived almost no life at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't enjoy music, food, or entertainment anymore because I feel as if I'm just 'playing into their game' by indulging in this artificial society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if I sound melodramatic, but I honestly can't get over this. I can't even talk to my friends about this stuff without them calling me batshit insane. I'd never thought I'd say this, but suicide is looks like a more pleasant option as the days continue to pass.

       As long as he's smoking an Indica or Sativa strain that doesn't cause anxiety and paranoia he'll be fine. There's more than one type of high with weed, just sayin'.

       Oh i know, but it also highly depends on the person, not just the strain.  I wouldn't recommend it for this guy, sounds like he has other issues going on.  Should probably speak to someone about it on a professional level first.

       100%, I think cannabis isn't the answer alone, but if the right strain &amp; consumption method is found it can be a great benefit for mental health issues when paired with things like meditation and some type of therapy. But it can make it worse as well if you aren't taking positive steps in life, I think cannabis can often amplify your current mindstate and some people should make sure they're in a good place beforehand.

       Vape, daily, after the 3rd day it sticks into your body and opens your mind. You see things clearer even when not dosing. Mainly Sativa's for me. This makes the mind open up. It is remarkable.

       This is good advice. Sunlight and fresh air are also good, even if one is only walking rather than running/lifting weights.

       i was in that same hopelessness/worthlessness/what’s the point state of mind when i started becoming redpilled. i was a nervous wreck, i couldn’t go outside of my house. you need to take a break and remember what makes you happy. surround yourself with people you love. turn off your phone. don’t watch the news. but most importantly, laugh. never forget to laugh. this realm is temporary.

       I've been swimming in this stuff for a while and this is the best way, in my opinion, to handle it all.  The fact we are even here, on a planet that is just closes enough to a ball of gas that's on fire, to sustain life is a miracle all in It's self.  The fact we have cars to drive, phones to fuck with, and all of these toys is also insane considering the history of this world.  We're all along for the ride, and no matter how horrible it might get we get to bare witness to it.  Life's all a game to me, we all died, just like everyone before us, but why not enjoy the show, because the last 40 years has been off the walls, and It's only going to get more crazy.

       *Spectra of the Sun and other stars tell us the composition, density, and temperature of the stellar atmosphere. Atoms in the atmosphere absorb light emitted at lower layers and produce the dark vertical lines or bands in the spectrum. The amount of light removed and the width of the band are related to the composition, density, and temperature in the atmosphere. *

       In 1802, William Hyde Wollaston built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun’s spectrum on a screen. Upon use, Wollaston realized that the colors were not spread uniformly, but instead had missing patches of colors, which appeared as dark bands in the spectrum. Later, in 1815, German physicist Joseph Fraunhofer also examined the solar spectrum, and found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), which are now known as Fraunhofer lines, or Absorption lines."

       Make your own music, there's nothing stopping you. Make your own instruments if you're that worried about fakery.

       Make your own food, go to a small farmer and ask for seeds, or buy chickens or cows, pigs whatever.

       Buy them in a mixed run of chicks and they are less than $1. Source: I’ve raised free range chickens for about 12 years. I slaughter them when they stop laying. There’s a bit of an initial cost of you need a fence, coop, or chicken tractor (HIGHLY recommended if you’re homesteading like I do, and want a chemical free way to keep bugs and weeds out from the space between your garden rows, then move the rows to where the troughs were the next spring). Overall, the eggs and chicken meat are far better and way cheaper than even $2.99 at Costco. Much more rewarding too. But it takes a couple acres and a lot of commitment. By that I mean no vacations, or a reliable neighbor kid who will take care of it for your for a 3 day weekend here or there. Also, potato boxes and aquaponics with channel catfish and duckweed. I could talk about this shit all day... but if you’re a 20 year old student, maybe start with an indoor herb garden then when you have enough income buy a couple acres outside of city limits so you can do basically whatever the hell you want.

       PS pigs are NOT worth the effort. Neither goats (milk and meat) or alpacas (fleece) unless you are basically a full time homesteader or farmer. Drexel cattle are but you’ll need a about an acre per cow in your pasture. Above all else, not pigs. They are a significant emotional experience to handle.

       Depending on what you believed.. religion itself is always a false works based system that involves man trying to "make their way" into the afterlife.  The truth is simply that Jesus Christ was God in the flesh and died for your sins.

       When I was a child, I never stopped and thought about how I could give my life meaning. I just lived, explored, and experienced each passing moment good or bad. And so I do the same now. Why would I have to consciously try to "do" anything in particular to give my life meaning? That's just how I see it.

       Haha no, I don't run a website or any channels. Nothing wrong with that but not my thing. It's fun to go into forums to exchange some banter and talk a little shit, but so much else to talk about and so many things and places to still explore.

        Can you give some examples?
Sure but it's not that important...it's whatever interests you, helps you connect - every experience and encounter is obviously a learning opportunity, and often grows into other interesting encounters and experiences. Unless of course you're just seeking out the same experiences.
       </p>
       <p>
        How do you spend your free time?
Spend it with people that matter, meeting new people, enjoying the sun when it's available, travel, see and try new things, learn, experience, eat, drink, and be merry. And of course go online and spew some rubbish.

       This is part of the fun. Teaching children the consequences of disrespect is rewarding for both parties. It teaches you as much about yourself as it does about your child.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your spouse disrespects you, talk to them about it. If they refuse to acknowledge the problem, or change their behaviour, then be a man and apply the carrot / stick. Leverage is a powerful tool and comes in many forms.

       Little Step2TheJeps to carry on what your ancestors started, to ensure that unbroken line remains intact long after you are gone.

      <p>
       One’s bloodline is the only material quality that can be traced all the way back to the beginning, and, potentially indefinitely into the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else is a transient and ephemeral moment along the way. We live in a material reality, insofar as our senses can perceive. Therefore, the effect on one’s material bloodline, the foundation of everything you are or can be, should always be in one’s mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or to put it another way: “Am I about to strengthen my bloodline, or weaken it?”

      <p>
       It certainly is delusional AND an assumption, for it wasn’t what I was talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once your kids are old enough to fend for themselves, the harsh reality is that what happens to you is no longer of any consequence. At that point you’re free to do what you want. You have fulfilled your obligations to your bloodline. Go nuts!
      </p>
      <p>
       You are and always have been a (the?) torch-bearer for your bloodline, nothing more, nothing less.  Either hand that torch to the next generation or let it go out and destroy what was handed to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your children look after you in old age, that is a nice fringe benefit of producing offspring but it also holds them back, limiting the chances for your bloodline (which, I reiterate is the
       <strong>
        only thing that matters
       </strong>
       ) to improve through their efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where else in nature do offspring support their forebears except humans? There is a good reason for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of animals abandon their old so they may focus on improving their own chances. I am well aware that “modern children” abandon their parents for plenty of other reasons than immediate survival, but that is irrelevant. Their actions and decisions are primarily the consequence of their parental upbringing.

       Look what "legacy" has done to our world. It's precisely the "elite" legacies and bloodlines that have wrought so much of the misfortune onto the rest of the "profane" bloodlines. I'm personally neither a proponent or detractor of having family and kids, but thinking of it in the context of strengthening and carrying on a bloodline seems to be a poor reason.

       Again, I personally am not against having children. But motivation does matter. There's a lot of natural instincts that we do control so that we don't act the same as, for example, chimps. I just don't accept that preserving and improving one's bloodline is all that matters, and the evidence that I see in the current state of people suggests that it's probably better that no bloodlines are preserved.

       Those who improve their bloodline are more likely to see their children rise above their peers. Rinse, repeat, come out on top, eventually stay on top forever.

       It's a simple formula that the world's elite families have proven. Is it fair? Of course it is! Anyone can start the process. So... why don't they?

       Yes but that's only because women tend to earn a lower income in a household with children. In the modern world, more women are also becoming the primary breadwinner and they too have to contend with giving up half of the stuff to a deadbeat husband.

       I've been there man. Feeling like it's all a sham. Feeling like your worthless. Once you take the red pill it's hard to keep it down. But in the long run it'll be worth it. I know it's tough. You start to lose interest in the things you once loved. Music, people, movies, etc. But you HAVE to understand: that isn't what life is all about. Life is about love. Life is about being the best you and LOVING you. I lost my best friend to suicide, it ruined me. I know it seems like no one understand you, or no one cares, but people do. People love you. Suicide is the not the answer man. Give it some time. Stay off this sub. It's toxic if you're not in the right mindset. Like I said, I've been there. When the whole Pizzagate shit broke out I immersed myself into a terribly deep and dark rabbit hole that was detrimental to my mental health. I was paranoid, anxious, angry and all around a fuckin asshole. But I gave myself the time I needed to get my mind straight. Shit gets better man. Trust me.

       This is very interesting. It seems to me that the pedo stuff is very good at this: taking people to dark places in which they cannot function critically. Too much emotional impact of the stories of pedos.

       I know how you feel. I have woken up when I was 22 years old. I realized of how much lies and BS happens on a daily basis. so I educate myself on things that they don't teach at school. The more you learn about how the world really works the better.

       Dude, I'm sorry you are going through this. For me, the most difficult thing was the "final red pill." If you don't know what this one is then you should probably avoid it until you have acclimated to the previous red pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, yea I was in somewhat of a state of shock for a good year after I came to certain realizations. The fact that I couldn't really tell anyone about it was probably the hardest thing (although I eventually did, with mixed results).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my advice: picture your goal for your life. Pre-red pill my goal was probably mostly to get married, get rich, and achieve as much as possible. I ended up going to law school and getting in an AM law 100 firm practicing patent law, so I'm doing pretty well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, my goals have completely changed. I decided that I wanted to become "independent" and live somewhere with a beautiful environment, with a good community. I would then raise a healthy family relatively free of degenerate influences, and celebrate our culture, heritage, and tradition however we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       So right now I'm in a transition stage. I still work in a law firm, and I still live in a big city. But I've save a LOT of money and I have bought a home in a city I want to retire in, far away from where I am now. For now it serves as a nice getaway home during the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not, now that I've digested the red pills I am happier than I was before. I feel like life actually has more meaning and I have more to live for.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, be patient and tough and just know that what you're dealing with is not easy. I would try to determine what your goals in life are, now that you know what you know. From there, work towards your goal and free yourself! Goodluck!
      </p>

       There is a danger in believing everything on authority from the establishment media.
But there is also a danger in believing in nothing at all as a consequence of losing that blind trust.

       Oh wow, you've been red-pilled for 5 months, so what. People have been red-pilled for years and love life. There's so much about life to appreciate. It's sad to have such a cynical view just because you became privy to the real dealings of the world in the last 5 months. If you can't find any joy in life, then make friends with people, take up a hobby, learn a skill, or do something. If none of things are able to satiate whatever emptiness you're feeling, then good luck.

       Most of us have gone through this phase. If everything comes to you at once (in a short time), it may be too overwhelming. Life will eventually end anyway, so you may just as well bear it. You should see it as a blessing that you are now open to the truth and use it to your advantage to make the right choices. Spread the message (to the people around you, your children so that they learn to deal with it early), keep thinking critically (many conspiracy theories are also just distractions). In 10 years you will be happier and think back to this day and say, this is the day that I took my life into my own hands.

       My friend, we've all been there. This is life. There's a reason they say "ignorance is bliss". You need to learn to live your life happily with the knowledge you're describing. Take the good with the bad. Our time here is finite, remember that.

       Has anyone told you that Jesus is coming back? Did anyone ever tell you that Jesus was born into the Matrix and showed us how to escape the slavery system? He did. There is everlasting life in Jesus and I would ask that you please, pretty please, before you give up, ask Jesus for help. Can't hurt, right?

      <p>
       Remember Adam and Eve in the garden? The forbidden tree was in the garden but Satan showed up to offer a choice to Eve. You notice everything around us is offered to us? Refusing to participate shouldn't suck your soul away. Refusing to participate opens the gates to an entirely new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if you don't realize the gift you have :) Please hold on. Please keep asking questions. There are many of us and our day is coming.

       Bro, there are NO rules anymore. That can seem disconcerting at first, but it's actually very freeing. Literally anything you want to do, you can do. Fuck laws, fuck rules, fuck propriety. Literally the world is a giant pussy again, waiting to get fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can dream it, you can do it, and there are no more rules on how to accomplish that. May seem scary, but it's actually great.

       The elites aren't nearly as powerful as they pretend to be. If we find alternatives to our current system then we can simply move on.

       Ex: instead of our country getting funds through gun/drug-running and human trafficking how about a large infrastructure project? Something like

       If the world doesnt want to be saved, at least you can get yourself a Frontrow seat to the Apocalypse, give a cheers, have a smoke and say. Shoulda Listened! Told ya so. Who was right? Yeah i was fucking right. Who sucks? yep You fuckin suck! Its dramatic, Over the top and very very satisfying. To be the one that told you so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But something more constructive maybe. I had enough of my society and i got a opportunity to leave. I took it. Sometimes leaving is a good option. At first its a bit weird to live in a new place, with an alien culture, language customs and morals. But for me it was exactly what i needed, when i needed it. Im a freaking chill Penguin now. Will go back in a about a year give or take, and i look forward to it, since the person that comes back is definetly not the person that left.

       As someone (50+) older than most of the people here, I would say that you need to read more history to get some perspective, and I mean 100 years ago history not 10 years ago history.

       The idea that powerful people will with do horrible things, or at least let horrible things happen, to enrich themselves isn’t new. It will always go on.

       Live your life, play in as few of their games as possible, don’t let them herd you into a lifetime of debt. Red pill as many people as you can. That’s how you win your personal battle against them.

       Don't fear. Good things not only lay ahead, but are already here!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no horrific endgame, at least not far beyond what already exists. Your paralysis IS the endgame.

       Get married, have kids, be the antidote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have some ambitions! I mean really.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think everything is bad, then I would implore you to challenge your assumptions, and again, I mean really!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been where you are now. I think most of us here have at some point. This current regime is inconceivably corrupt and has been propped up by blackmail, subversion, and black market domination. To my mind, this is the NWO we've all been afraid of.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a NWO ahead, there has to be. It is either an even more overtly corrupt version of the current regime, or something founded and grounded once again in the original values of the American project. Justice and liberty for all, that kind of thing. You guys had it for a little while, but it has long become a dream. The American Dream. Perhaps it'll be a different approach towards organising society fairly and effectively altogether, but the values of liberty and justice for all is critical to maintain at all cost either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, it is a lonesome path, but it doesn't have to be. You are responsible for your own reality, that is the original understanding of Karma, and in some sense the grand lesson of the Christian tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay alert, stay curious, ground your worldview in facts, not assumptions, or worse, some YouTuber's unsourced opinions. I've been there too. Nibiru, 2012, all that. I don't regret what I learned, but I regret that I bought into their interpretation of some compelling observations. This goes for everything from David Icke to chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've changed a great many of my views and assumptions by exploring what those who claim something else have to say and it has made me a happier, more coherent, and a more sociable, connected individual. I used to believe that the world was already overpopulated and that we're gonna run out of oil, and that the elite want to get rid of like 90&amp;#37; of us for some reason, and that aliens built the pyramids, and that Climate Change will make the world uninhabitable for humans, and on and on... It's a depressing list of beliefs that I came to realise were all grounded in assumption. There is no evidence that we are overpopulating the planet – though there is plenty of evidence that we're exploiting it stupidly. We can change that. It's the same with most things. We can change that. It's already changing. Give it time, and if can spare it, contribute your energy towards better ideas for the future, if only for yourself. Think what life you would want to live if you applied yourself in a world that was steadily becoming more hospitable, because I do believe that is what's coming. Plan for tough times and don't be too hard on yourself, and allow yourself to be seen by your friends and family as who you are. If your ideas offend them, it could be because your family is naive, but it could also be that you're not making a good, grounded point. Let it go and rethink your assumptions. Maybe you haven't yet figured it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is still not a picknick, but at least it's somewhat coherent, somewhat optimistic, and potentially manageable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know he's become a meme now and all that, but I really belief Jordan Peterson makes some very good points about
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi-RT1jYP_A">
        meaning in light of tremendous suffering
       </a>
       . Perhaps you'll find something of value in his ideas; they certainly have helped to get my life back on something resembling a track.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the best, and stay brave!

       This is a common feeling in your red pill journey.  I think probably about 80% of the people in this sub have gone through it.  The thing is, you'll never know when the shit will go down.  It could be tomorrow, it could be 100 years from now.  You just have to live your life and be aware of these things going on, but you must continue as if nothing will happen and the currupt system will continue, until it doesn't.  Until then, don't put your life on hold.  If you believe in conspiracy, I think this is the conspiracy within conspiracy: it can make you indifferent.  Don't let it.

       Rather than give up. Help make the world a better place? Learn to help others that need it, be it simple kindness or standing up for them etc. The stage curtain has been torn... that’s a GOOD thing! Shows you there’s lots of shitty people right? Be the opposite of that! Be the loving light that shines in the darkness. It’s hard but it’s worth it. Hope your mind is calmed soon and you can find peace in this world. Stay with us friend

       If you are depressed you are probably thinking about the past too much. If you are anxious you are worrying about the future too much. And really all of this is just a matter of what one chooses to believe. In the end you are ultimately accepting someones word for it. So why let something that you are actively choosing to believe ruin your life? It's up to you. Your beliefs hold consequences for your life. The greatest conspiracy is probably that nobody told you how to create your own reality.  Look in that direction.

       Humans/Eltriads will seemingly be trapped here until they become good. That includes those who are evil and powerful. Admit misanthropy and try harder. “Misanthropy” is the first step (not saying you in particular have not accepted this, this is just to everyone in general). Then you need to let it go, don’t hate. I’m not saying you’re bad though. You deserve to be free, as does every creature. You know what, it’s complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world consists of average people. Some of those people come on here and think that they’re a victim who can magically break free, despite being so average and even corrupt. It is just truth that there are average people. The things you all talk about here become egotistical all over again; you over-estimate how significant and powerful you are. There are those who can do it more individually, but most/almost all will need to work together and make up for their infinite “sins”.  There are those who really are different, and then there are your “neurotypicals” who want to be but can’t even admit they’re in the wrong.

       So you realize the world is a shity place and that you're not doing anything to make it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it that you will do to make it better?
      </p>

       Decide that; start doing it.

       And that's just the materialistic side of things, my friend. If you decide to pursue answers on the metaphysical and hermetic side of things, it sort of / kind of balances things out. But you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube, &amp;, once you pass a certain point, you'll find it doesn't matter anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you describe is the separation anxiety for materialism. Unforming attachments to the physical is in your best interest. Countless poignant platitudes have been spouted in defense of physical matter and the aspirations for same [more]. 3D space, as fantastic as some parts are, is inherently fucked, an unwinnable endeavor in any meaningful way. Plan for after.

       The future has yet to pass, what are you going to do to change this world to one you want to live in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me, when I tell you that you are not alone, I know this because many of us are in the same place.  There are a great number of us that are cursed with the knowledge of how this world really works.   We need more to help others understand the lies that clouds their eyes.  The only chance we have, is to expose the masses to the real, and hopefully that will be enough to affect change to this world.
      </p>

       I know it's overwhelming, but remember you are not alone.  Do whatever you can (tactfully) to help others understand this world and you will become less alone.

       Lots of things in this world are fake, but biology is not fake.  Your ancestors struggled, sacrificed, fought and died so you could be here and so you could reproduce.

       A lot of great comments here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to add, that when I personally fell down the hole ( US Election) it was a steep fall. There were nights I couldn't sleep, and I'd have days where I needed to talk about it and was faced with a complete void with a programmed response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to convince some friends but ultimately was baffled by their ability to ignore facts that did not meet the simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in all of this, I now feel liberated. The feeling of inconsistency, doublethink and submission to a dominant ideal have gone. Taking the Red, has allowed me an opportunity to re-evaluate my approach to life, and move through it with astounding prescience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have hope lad. There is a great energy shift before us, felt by many already. Positivity, unity and co-operation may be restored, and we will witness the people's awakening - and the ascension of heroes.

       Science: Objective, replicable, and the best mechanism yet to uncover truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many will suggest some conspiratorial BS, that makes you cynical rather than skeptical - which all scientists are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If THEY tell you they have PROOF that something is fake, ask for citations, and ask why they haven't applied for their Nobel, yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no money for 99% of the science community to simply confirm studies. The money is ALWAYS with the minority in disproving or changing a paradigm.

       I dropped out of high school, I can't function in the system, or probably any system at all, so as someone who's lost most of their humanity as a result of isolation, and not being able to appreciate love in any form, is that if you're still capable of making bonds with people, is while you're in college, when you're not studying, be more proactive and try to find ways to deliver things with humour.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're as much of a lost cause then me, then well... just think of yourself rotting in Auschwitz, in solitary confinement, getting devoured by a giant beast out of your nightmares, while at the same time imagining a place in your life you always wanted to visit, like a tropical island or somewhere in Asia, Europe, South America, and use the internet while it still exists to help visualize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile in the present moment, you've still got your apartment and you're still able to live in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fell deep down the rabbit hole and it almost turned me into a violent sociopath. My empathy is still pretty destroyed and I have trouble controlling my constant impulses or channeling them towards healthier ways of living, so I'm fucked man. I'm in my early 20s, I'm probably going to end up spending the majority or at least the rest of it in a psych ward, so it's just a matter of finding ways to just... exist without really existing, wait until my death, probably oblivion, which that eternal sleep would be a relief, but I still find myself fantasizing about an afterlife where my brain's fixed and God's sorry for all the religious crap that got dumped and brainfucked me and billions of people for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indulge in things anyways with your friends and keep the knowledge to yourself until they're open to conspiracies. You're redpilled, but you're living a life everyone else is bluepilled up the ass, so you're very much going to have to live a purple-pilled life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eat healthy, smoke weed, exercise, travel, all of these things can work but if they don't, try to suffer through life instead, even if you can't do anything else but pathetically flop about like I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe once the world order gets taken down, people are living as meant to be, there will be ways for you to get yourself back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there's a version of you out in the multiverse who's more competent than you, and is working with multiversal operations to save your lazy ass somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the sounds of things, you're not in a good mental space at all, and with your friends abandoning you, further isolation is going to make it harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets harder. Way harder. You just have to cope with this shitty reality the best you can, just like everyone else always is, and eventually you will fail, and you will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there's an afterlife after this Hellish shitshow of a life, but it's not something that would do you any good to wish and wait for as long as you still have some sense of hope.

       Sure, you could see it as destruction of the world around you. The carefully crafted image to keep you chugging along in line.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could see it as creation of a new beginning in which your goals can be set entirely by yourself. The powerful energy of a human focused on creating strength amongst their species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funnily enough Shiva, a Hindu goddess, is a perfect representation of this. She/He (the Divine hermaphrodite) dances a delicate dance that weaves in between the sides of destruction and creation. I find this funny not out of disrespect for your situation (the veil lifting is always a rough adjustment no matter the incarnation), but moreso out of the statements on religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanna improve the world? Start locally, really locally. Improve yourself, then your family, then your community, and then the world. Each passing group you improve (and you improve them simply by improving yourself and being engaged within them) will compound with more and more people doing the same. This doesn't require ideological pushes or biases either, just give where it's possible and assist where it's needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the world could be in shambles, but what better environment to temper the populace into the best possible forms we can take?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Sorry to sound preachy but with all the voices screaming about how the only problem in the world are those with ideological differences from themselves this message needs to be spread.

       Push past all the evil...
      </p>
      <p>
       The rabbit hole is far deeper and more wonderful than you know. It's really easy to get stuck in the darkness. From an esoteric point of view, you are currently going through a "dark night of the soul". This will end and there will be a new beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       From personal experience, my recommendation to you is to push through the darkness and seek the deeper truths regarding the history of the Earth, the nature of reality and true spirituality and metaphysics (without all the baggage created by organized religions). For me, all of the craziness of our world finally made sense when I realized that we live in a spiritual/multidimensional world and that we are currently witnessing a battle between good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       After my rapid awakening, to help others, I was compelled to build a website to showcase what I've learned in a somewhat linear way. If you're interested check out the
       <a href="http://realitygateway.com/reality-guide/">
        Reality Guide
       </a>
       . I suggest you start with the "The Journey Ahead" section and then jump past all the dark stuff to the "Ancient History and the Secrets of Humanity’s Past". The "Sacred Knowledge and the Science of Source" is a really fun section too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps. Keep fighting the good fight and know it's going to be okay and that you are not alone.

It is the ultimate truth, and the antidote to the deception because even if everything else is a lie, the closest thing to you will be the only real truth that’s ever been. Family.

       Dude Ive been in your shoes before but don't just end it cause it's easy man have a family spread the truth to your kin and your children will ask out fellow tooth seekers as well.  Do small things to not live in the stock society and they will make a huge impact.  Yeah you may have to at times get involved in this artificial society but it's just a party of life and life is a precious gift and use it man.

       Don't freak out. Though I know how it feels, we should never freak out or be scared. That's what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       want - to make us feel scared. 
All this Pizzagate and Illuminati mess used to ruin my sleep, too. Then I thought - well, well, well, is there anything I can do about it? No. It's not my responsibility. Remember the Buddhist saying - if there's something you can do about a problem, don't worry. If there's nothing you can do about a problem, don't worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly, most of Futurology IMO is pretty much catastrophic and exaggerated. Just look at the year of 2018 , compared to 1958. Besides Internet, what exactly changed in the world? Not much, huh? Damn, people in 1958 thought we'd be driving flying cars in 2000! So honestly I don't think the world will change much from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
       They won't be able to develop technology and AI so strongly that we have robots that think like humans. It's IMPOSSIBLE to accurately and perfectly replicate the human consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, there won't be many advances in medicine, either. New drugs? Sure, they want your money. But don't expect cures for diseases or vaccines that are 100% efficient against HIV. Not gonna happen. That would mean a waste of money, and they'd never want to waste money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Single currency? NO. Not gonna happen either. EU is collapsing already. It's highly probable that it will fall apart and set the example to the rest of the world. Don't expect a  new single currency for a good whole century, my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do think it is going to happen:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        climatic changes will be drastic and bizarre;
       </li>
       <li>
        there will be great political turmoil in many countries;
       </li>
       <li>
        poverty will increase, and so will social disparity;
       </li>
       <li>
        however, the number of billionaires will decrease;
       </li>
       <li>
        why? because the internet will generate more unemployment, leading to more economical crisis and currency crashes everywhere in the globe. Small businesses will collapse. Only big huge companies like Amazon will survive and concentrate all the money;
       </li>
       <li>
        bitcoin will COLLAPSE, and it will happen soon. All governments can see that everybody - especially Brazilians - are swimming in a happiness pool in this Bitcoin bandwagon. They will want to regulate it properly. They will make bitcoin crash and lose its value. They don't want more people to get rich. Bitcoin enabled low middle class nerds to become millionaires. They don't want that.
       </li>
       <li>
        people will get more and more lonely and with the over exposition to sex and porn and drugs, we will live in an apathetic, semi-asexual and passive society that will accept these changes until humanity dies.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These are only my guesses. I can deal with them and I don't give a fuck anymore. I'd be glad if a meteor hit Earth right now.

       Humans/Eltriads will seemingly be trapped here until they become good. That includes those who are evil and powerful. Admit misanthropy and try harder. “Misanthropy” is the first step (not saying you in particular have not accepted this, this is just to everyone in general). Then you need to let it go, don’t hate. I’m not saying you’re bad though. You deserve to be free, as does every creature. You know what, it’s complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world consists of average people. Some of those people come on here and think that they’re a victim who can magically break free, despite being so average and even corrupt. It is just truth that there are average people. The things you all talk about here become egotistical all over again; you over-estimate how significant and powerful you are. There are those who can do it more individually, but most/almost all will need to work together and make up for their infinite “sins”.  There are those who really are different, and then there are your “neurotypicals” who want to be but can’t even admit they’re in the wrong.

       Honestly, the best thing you can do is internal work. You have to analyze and realize how your MIND works then see how easily it has been and can continually be corrupted. Look inward for that is where true purpose and happiness resides. Pursue truth for the sake of natural law. Listen and dig into the wisdom of the ancients. A great place to start is Manley P Hall. Once you realize helping others is the true path you will be on your way. Best of luck and remember that the more you learn the more you realize that you know nothing...

       Fuck suicide dude... even with how messed up our world and society is, there are many beautiful things that we can still enjoy. Find hobbies that interest you and stay active physically. Appreciate the wonderful nature out there. That will heal you. The elite’s have been doing their thing for centuries and will continue to do it, no matter how many are awake. Let others take on the battles. You got too immersed in it all... take a step back and live. I was in too deep and was overwhelmed myself, but have since reclaimed my sanity. I still stay informed here and there, but there are plenty of people doing the battling out there.

       find the things that you * ** absolutely truly love** * and focus your energy on those things. get obsessed with them and pursue them without inhibition. i know this is easier said then done, especially when you are in the mindset you are in, but if you go one day at a time, one hour at a time, focusing the things you love and, at this stage more importantly, not focusing on the things you hate you will get there.  eight years ago i made two suicide attempts within 18 months of each other.  i'm still working on myself and i have a long way to go but i have found a few key hobbies/activities (fishing, reading, and developing my own games on my computer) that have kept me pushing through.  when i get down, when i think about death and destruction and the horribleness that can be our reality, i find a book to start reading or i hop on my bike and try to catch a few bass and by the time i'm done the weight and seriousness that I was feeling prior will always be gone.  as many others have already said, the world is the world regardless of what is going on or happening, you can't control gaia or the zeitgeist or whatever you want to call it but the one thing you
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       have control of is your perspective and with patience, openness and understanding you can adjust that perspective to be positive.  keep at the things you love and best of luck to you brother.

       I used to be in the exact same boat, my friend. Then, I decided that in spite of everything, I'm going to empower myself. Through my words, thoughts, actions, behavior, etc. TPTB want you to be weak. They want you scared. They want you confused. They want your moral to be low. You
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       get over this? You MUST get over it! Do you wan't to live on your knees your whole life? Living in fear? In weakness? You are NOT weak by your very nature. You are a HUMAN BEING! Capable of
       <em>
        evolving
       </em>
       yourself consciously. Capable of making
       <em>
        choices
       </em>
       that can either elevate consciousness and morality, or degrade it. You have the spark of the
       <em>
        divine
       </em>
       within you, and you are sovereign. Bound by no man's law. The sick, psychopathic human-farmers who run this world wan't to rip all of that away from you. FUCK THEM! Don't give them a goddamn inch. Do everything you can to uplift and empower yourself and those around you, because you can do fucking anything. YOU ARE FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. UNDO THE CONDITIONING.

       Here’s another red pill: TPTB want you to kill yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend Jesus and trying to live your life for others.  That is what true rebellion is in today’s society.

       This is what they want you to feel, helpless. The only power a thing has is the power you give it. For you to think this way only takes power away from yourself and gives it to TPTB.

       I understand where you are coming from, we have all been there at one point. Take some time to smell the roses. Enjoy the little things in life and meditate. The rabbit hole has a way of sucking the joy out of us, but we must realise that love is the only true way to fight the hate we face in this world. Be mindful of your feeling, they are as important as your thoughts. Learn to let go, live in the moment. I love you and know you are not alone!

       Worrying about the future is useless to the man who does not know how live in the present.

       "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"— in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease. "He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me," — in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by love, this is an old rule."

       Welcome,
       <br/>
       It is a tough road at first. It truly is. All of us live as you do. You are NOT alone. I was raised to question my surroundings and who we hold high. My whole life I have been skeptical. It wasn't until the age of the Internet where this really came to be. I would say I have been "awoke" truly sometime around 2002. Shortly after Sept. 11th. I knew some, and questioned a lot.
       <br/>
       The depression that 1st comes will pass. This is a design that has been put on us so when we do wake up the feeling is overwhelming at first. Do you continue to life or do you make it easier on yourself and take matters into your own hands? I wanted out of this too. I almost several times took matters into my own hands. No one believes me. No one accepts what I say is true. I have surrounded my self with people that do, kind of, believe. They trust me anyways and if I say something I encourage them to then look it up and disprove what I am saying. This many times leads them to looking into the subject themselves and thus being red pilled.
       <br/>
       A fellow Patriot here posted a video from a lady by the name of  Dolores Cannon. She is a hypnotist and has a lot of good info.
       <br/>
       What I did to suppress my feeling of uncontrollable loss due to all the programming was make a conscious effort to reexamine the past. The root of human existence. I had questioned the Bible until I was sure it was false. I still took the info in. I questioned all other major religions as well to show them as false. I still took the info in. Looking into all these religions and human history you start to see things differently. Intelligently designed. Not evolutionary. God or not there is a force of energy that truly binds us. And where we go one we go all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Han Solo in the Force Awakens. It's all true. The force, the Jedi. It's all true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soaking up that information, and finding out some of us are different is liberating. Play the game. Listen to what the programming is telling you to do, but do so with eyes open. Do not accept their limitations as your own. Chart your own path. Find a common ground with close friends that you can openly talk with. Maybe help them see this as well. The Path is hard don't go alone.

       Hey, I totally get you, it's really, really hard to get wind of this stuff in a serious, to-the-skull way. Personally, when I did start finally having my eyes opened, I became pretty obsessed with it--there's all this new knowledge that opens up into even more new knowledge, and once you've accepted the idea that things aren't as you thought, so much seems possible, even probable. So a lot of time gets spent consuming media that ranges from factual exposes to fear porn. It's dangerous waters out there. And it's hard to have different ideas from your family, especially at the age of a college student. I get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't sound melodramatic. Your suffering is real, and many others have felt the same thing. Personally, I think life is never quite the same after learning the truth, but I don't think that has to be such a bad thing. You might be experiencing cognitive dissonance now, but from my personal experiences (I definitely wanted to kill myself as I was learning about government pedophilia rings, it was just too much) you would regret it if you did that. Think about your family and how much good your learning might do for others someday. Or even how pure it might be to really know the truth and be able to put a face to evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       My heart is with you; I have experienced the same things as you. Until you find a friend who is on the level, talk to people on here. Consider going abroad to work or travel--assuming you live in the US, this is a very, very mind-controlled place and abroad (in my experience, Asia) you will probably find other people who are interested in celebrating the moment, speaking frankly, and not unduly worried about getting married and having kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much peace and love to you. Feel free to message me if you want to talk more.

       Do NOT Let fear rule you. Master fear, make it serve you.

       Fear is a powerful ally once tamed.
      </p>

       Go for a walk, enjoy the sunset, those are free and serve nobody's interests, but your own. Talk with friends and neighbours about things that are hum drum and normal.

       Your issue sounds like an existential crisis. You have discovered contemporary society and it's narratives are false, but also everything you generally accept is built on sand. Even your reactions to the situation may be conditioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can disconnect from the most obvious forms of propaganda, control, and conditioning without much difficulty. You can develop some an independent self directed life with some hard work. As we discover some truths about our reality it is easy to see phantoms everywhere. It can be depressing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't live your life as a reaction to "them" or the perceptions of how screwed up the world is today. I'd say be kind, open and honest (especially with yourself). Oh, and you'll love your future kids...and they will love you (and that's reality).

Or start making aRT (whatever that is )
Just a little something from Neoist Cultural Conspirator !
I’ve survived things ,I ,myself, don’t even believe !
People like you give survivors of horrors I’ve lived through HOPE !
It could be worse &amp; you know it !
It’s a five stage process 
In the end . Your find your true freedom in sharing the truth in fact you’ve learnt-
It’s the Service to Others mentality in short that will take away the pain. A Service to Self world in bound to destroy its self-
You can always call on me &amp; I will be there !
Seriously-
It a lot like grieving for those who you love that pass -

       Why try to integrate into a fake society?  There are other options, including other non-Western societies, or no society at all in the wilderness.

       None of these options are suicide, which changes nothing, only cements you into a moment you can't get out of.

       Live in the moment.
The only difference between you and non-red-pilled others is that you expect a bleak future while they look forward to prosperity. But that is all speculation, and the best laid plans develop hitches big and small, and life delivers good and bad moment to moment. Change is the only constant. Do not let the future steal the present moment from you.

       A 'legacy' of what?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        as all your ancestors did for you in an unbroken line right up to the point you were born
