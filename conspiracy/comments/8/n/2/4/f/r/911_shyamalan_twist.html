       It was a terrorist attack. It wasn't orchestrated by the people in the US govt but they are guilty of building a cheap, shitty, building.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a plane hits the cores, the cores withstand the initial impact from the plane but the reverberation of the steel 'shakes' loose the concrete attached to the beams, which begins to crack and crumble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of twanging a really long pole stuck in the ground, the most movement is seen at the top. This is why the building fell down like a free fall effect. As soon as the top floor gave way, it caused the rest to collapse due to the weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The towers WERE meant to withstand an aircraft flying into it, they just messed up the calculations when it came to fixing the steel together.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably wrong and it was a total set up, but it's one point I've never seen discussed before.

       I still haven’t seen a photo or video post-collapse that shows a pile of rubble anywhere near the size and mass it should have been if the buildings “pancaked”. It’s as if most of it went up in a cloud of dust and blew away with the wind.

       Dr. Judy Wood has some interesting observations about this very topic, the fact that the towers turned to dust, and left barely enough whole rubble to account for the two skyscrapers.

       It did leave enough rubble? I don't think so. Watch the plumes of pulverised dust blow across those Manhattan streets and ask yourself how common that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buildings that collapse due to structural failure will fall sideways and leave mounds and mounds of broken rubble and debris. The twin towers left behind piles of molten steel and enormous clouds of dust. Highly unusual.

       It's largely guess work though, working on something as large as that. The best engineers in the world make calculation errors. It happens.

       Look at the Millennial bridge in London. They had to shut it on the same day that it opened. People walking on it began walking in lock-step with each other, which caused the bridge to 'swing', which caused the people to lock-step more, which caused the bridge to...you get the idea.

       It's not "the Jews", it's the Zionists. Radical Jewish criminals that the US government's serves above their own people. Jewish people across the world denounce Zionism every day. Regular Jewish folk don't have such fundamentalist egoic principles as to agree with the genocide of the Palestinians. But you won't hear about them on the news. Because the Zionists write the news!

       The building stood for year and years.  The fireproofing was within the last 10 or so before the event?  It had nothing to do with materials and cutting corners.  That's basically you guessing.  It could withstand hurricane force winds and took years of constant weathering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why only on 9/11 would the building choose to fall at freefall speeds?  Buildings do not do that without help......falling THROUGH the path of most resistance!
      </p>
      <p>
       Materials is a flat out guess without knowing or seeing anything of the building.  MAYBE if you were an engineer and MAYBE if you had see it or been privy to it in the past, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as you're here, I don't think that's likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, that's less likely than nukes, laser beams from space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gov't conspiracies fit as Cheney was working hard to keep his end up at the Pentagon, the airforce just happened to send their planes on exercises way up north around Alaska, wargames going on where a scenario was playing out about terrorists hijacking aircraft that very SAME DAY.  FEMA just happened to be in Manhattan the day before the event.....on, and on it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just can't possibly think it was solely down to the steel, which itself happened to by cut up and shipped to China to be recycled before any forensic's could be done or checked for explosives or thermitic materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh geeez, and one last thing.  They found Nano Thermite in the dust that day.  Stephen E Jones was sent ground zero dust and in it were those hollow iron sphere's that are created from thermitic material.  He even had samples of the red chips, unused thermite in the dust sent to him which he was able to activate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the search.

        Buildings don't collapse because of shoddy work AND have thermitic material left over afterward.

       A building withstanding a hurricane is different to the force twanging the steel so hard it freed, or loosened the concrete from the steel/reinforcing beams

       I used the wind because you mentioned hurricanes...

       Your study that suggests no design flaws, suggests design flaws for the reason the towers collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you shared it, as I have never seen documents discussing certain parts of the structural integrity. However, they point to the building falling down was the heat on the beams shortening the steel which put more stress on the outer skeleton.

       Fire can shrink steel, but an aircraft could shake the core? (Theoretically)

       No it cannot "shrink" steel.  Regular fires cannot heat up steel to the point where it can melt.  That is the whole crux of ypur argument isin't it?  That regular office fires can result in buildings falling down!  That is totally not true.  It has never happened before and hasn't happened since.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST found that fire was the only possibility to cause the collapse thought they do not look into any other option.  They just reject anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which again brings me to wonder why even after I call you out on IGNORING thermitic material found in the dust, you still continue to ignore it.  It's quite unreal....like if you're a real person who has never seen that info before you still ignore it instead of saying "oh wow.....I didn't know that."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you're stuck.  If you want to know what I have seen or any other info and you're willing to ask....do so.  If not, and you're content where you are......just consider stop making posts showing your ignorance on the topic because you're missing out on a lot and you're spreading misinformation.  It only
       <em>
        seems

       to fill gaps because you haven't seen the other information, you know?

       I wouldn't trust the companies who built the buildings to tell me that there were structural issues and safety requirements overlooked after such an event. I was referring to all of the INDEPENDENT entities who came in afterwards and have nothing to lose by being honest. Those are the reports I am speaking of.

       There is also a difference between making mistakes and gross negilegence. People should not go to jail over an innocent mistake; but anyone who is guilty of gross negligence that ends in loss of life should be in prison, I don't care who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And BTW, cover-ups themselves are unethical and illegal usually following unethical and illegal activities or behavior. So yes, if you involve yourself in a cover-up, your ass belongs in prison as well.

       First of all, I believe that no planes hit the either of the World Trade towers. I have seen a mountain of evidence that real-time compositing was used the morning of 9/11, and that the planes we all saw on the morning news were nothing more than computer graphics. Yes, this means that certain people within the news media had foreknowledge of the events that would take place. The CGI planes were cued by a sound blip to hit the buildings at exactly the same time as the bombs on the 91st were detonated (to create the illusion of planes impacting and entering the buildings). If you want to delve into this more just go to YouTube and search “no planes hit the World Trade Center”. There are videos that provide the evidence I’m referring to. Let’s just say the media made a few mistakes they’d like us to forget about...
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the towers did not collapse. They were literally turned to dust in mid air. If you want more info on this, look into the research of Dr. Judy Wood. What we all watched on the news that day was something that had never been seen before by the public. What caused the towers to turn to dust was most likely a directed energy weapon. Evidence of this can be found by a parking lot full of vehicles that was more than a mile away from the Towers. The cars in that lot looked like they had been hit by a nuclear blast. They were on fire and just all burnt up, but still completely intact. Another bit of evidence that supports the use of a directed energy weapon are eye witness reports of vehicles levitating for a brief period of time near the base of the towers. Yet another piece of evidence that completely debunks the official story are reports of bombs going off in the lobbies of the towers right around the time the planes “impacted” the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, this information is all out there and available to you. You just have to know where to look for it.

       Think about your question for a minute. There were only a small number of people who claimed to witness the first plane hit the building. There were many other eye witnesses who say they did not see a plane but heard explosions instead. There was one whiteness who even said verbatim “there was no plane”. Think about the panic of the moment. Think about the fact that every single news network was reporting that a plane had hit the first tower just minutes after it happened. People on the ground would not know what was going on. And people anywhere else would only know what was going on from the television news networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve pointed you in the right direction if you’re actually searching for alternative theories and information about what really happened that day. If you want to keep trying to come up with theories that support the official narrative of the 9/11 commission then we should probably just end this conversation.

      <p>
       Are you saying that on Sept 9th or Sept 10th, someone created CGI video of a plane crashing into the towers, then distributed this film to all the news networks, so they could all simultaneously broadcast said video - and everyone involved was able to keep the secret?

       It's not rock, paper, scissors though. The physics of the incident involve 10s and 10s of tons, moving at hundreds of miles per hour, and being piled-drived into a small space.. Some of the fuselage made it through the gaps, the rest was large amounts of fuel bursting out the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that some incindiares were placed either on the plane or in the destination floors, but the beams themselves aren't going to prevent all of what transpired.

       The first bit is way too far fetched for me to believe. There were thousands of witnesses who speak about planes on the TV. It's not out of the realms of reality to think that a mass 'hypnosis' to have been carried out, but it's a bit far fetched.

       I see nothing to agree or disagree on. Just two opinions or funny what if's, bouncing off of each other.

       I disagree that the buildings collapsed. If you watch videos you can clearly see steal beams turn to dust and blow away as the building disintegrates.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been countless studies that prove it was physically impossible for jet fuel to cause the buildings to collapse. If you think planes brought them down then you are not living in reality, or just have absolutely no common sense.

       You've missed my point. And fyi, so we can move on from it, I used to work on aircraft. I know the temps that jet engines burn at and what their weight it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would fire bring down those steel beams? Maybe, under exceptional circumstances, maybe I just don't believe that brought the towers down.
      </p>
      <p>
       An engine from a passenger jet, travelling at (I have no idea of the actual speed, so I will guess at cruising speed) 400mph? 500mph? If the engine struck those beams head on at 400-500mph, that would cause some serious damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that damage be enough to shake those steel beams enough to cause a reverberation along the entire column and cause a weakening to the structure and concrete? I would say so. Concrete is a brittle substance.

       I'm guessing two huge lumps of metal (the engines) travelling 650mph~ with a temperature of ~3000 degrees Celsius hitting the beams would have made a bit of a mess of things.

       This is exactly what some engineers went to Congress with in the 60's and the 70's.  That skyscrapers could survive a hit by a plane, but at certain angles the skyscrapers would flex and simply shake apart, then collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress had their own team do a study and found the reward for having skyscrapers was worth the risk.

       I too think there was no airliner planes, but haven't written off the use of bunker buster drones made to look like planes.  I initially thought no planes was a crazy idea until I researched the pilots for 9/11 truth, which included a pilot who actually flew the plane on flight 175 before.  He said it couldn't be done at that speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, I've taken steel pipes and smashed them into aluminum at high speeds. The aluminum has never gone through the steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have old school flame burners on my stove, with the steel plates on top.  I've left those on for hours at sustained temperature and never had the steel melt.  We are led to believe the towers burned for about two hours, with temperatures decreasing to the point that people could be seen standing right next to the fires, then all the steel gave way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, Dimitri Khalezov is the craziest explanation of 9/11, and it's also the only one that makes scientific sense and explains everything.  I believe 90-100% of what he says in his "testimony".

       I suppose the 5 Mossad agents filming the first tower were just in the right place at the right time too, and the mossad agents pulled over with a van filled with explosives.

       Ok I am trying to go at this with an open mind and hear you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that on Sept 9th or Sept 10th, someone created CGI video of a plane crashing into the towers, then distributed this film to all the news networks, so they could all simultaneously broadcast said video - and everyone involved was able to keep the secret?
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems unreasonable to me. No one can keep a secret 17 years later.
