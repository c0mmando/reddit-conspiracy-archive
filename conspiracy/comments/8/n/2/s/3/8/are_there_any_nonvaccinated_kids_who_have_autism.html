       I'm assuming more and more kids are not being vaccinated due to the anti-vaxx movement. So then I would think that (assuming vaccines do NOT cause autism), at some point one of those kids who isn't vaccinated is going to be diagnosed with autism (because isn't the rate like 1 in 10 kids now?). So are there any? Wouldn't that end the debate once and for all? How could someone blame vaccines when a kid who isn't vaccinated gets diagnosed with autism?

       First, you'll have to find non-smokers who get cancer, to end the smoking-causes-cancer debate.  Then we can apply the same flawed logic to the autism debate.

       Could we say that smoking increases the chances of getting cancer? if so, would you then say that vaccines increase the chances of autism?

       What if it has to do with chemicals/pesticides? The Amish may eat less chemicals and therefore have lower autism rates. It doesn’t need to hinge on vaccinations

       That would require those kids to be alive

       On a serious note, I think it would be a highly interesting but highly unethical study. This would not receive IRB approval in the slightest and would blacklist you from pretty much any reputable journal

       I wouldn't even need a study to be honest. Even if, let's say, a friend had a kid and didn't vaccinate him/her and then that kid developed autism. I then would find it hard to believe that vaccines cause autism. I'm just saying - to end the debate, can't "they" (whoever "they" are) show the world a bunch of un-vaccinated kids who have autism? it should be easy. But this has yet to be done (I think? that's why i asked here, maybe i'm wrong).

       Your logic is broken. Nobody is saying that vaccines are the only cause of autism, and nobody is saying that if you get vaccinated you will 100% develop autism, nor if you don’t get vaccinated that you won’t develop autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best anyone can do it work to correlate autism to vaccinations (or not).

       They dont though. Plenty of smokers out there who dont have cancer. So cigarettes dont necessarily cause cancer, they just inrease the risk.

       Youre right.  And i believe that's part of the anti-vaxx position as well.  Vaccines arent necessarily the direct cause, but just like the cigarette argument... they contain things that can lead to the development of autism.

       Wait, "just increase the risk" is a bit of a fudge statement. That is a statistical issue, but it is proof positive that they do ,literally cause cancer in many people, which in turn "increases the risk" for the general population.

       While your "necessarily" does modify it enough to be a true statement, you could also have said "Cigarettes do cause cancer in many people." So they do cause cancer...just not in everyone.

       I believe it does happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Autism is just a set of symptoms. There is no blood test and no known cause. Theoretically, a number of different things could cause autism (or autism like symptoms), much like a number of things have been attributed to cause the process that leads to MS. If autism is the result of a breakdown of a bodily process, that malfunction could be triggered by multiple things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also read about Cuba having low Autism rates which was attributed to them banning Acetaminophen. It was suggested that administering acetaminophen after vaccination could result in autism, but if that is true, that leads me to consider this below, (the possible connection to infection and probiotics).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, there has been research into probiotic health, gut flora and autism. There are a number of doctors researching this connection and it’s rather interesting. Basically, they find that most (if not all) persons with autism suffer with various forms of intestinal issues. And they have found that resetting the gut flora can help reduce autism symptoms. And this research impacts us all. They have found US and Europe is lacking vital probiotic strains that help provide key nutrients. Our lifestyle and food systems have dramatically impacted our gut flora biodiversity. And gut flora impacts mood and cognitive function.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a theory, and reminder this is just a theory, that some vaccines might break down the blood brain barrier which could allow for bad bacteria in the gut to cause encephalitis in some kids (the ones with certain strains of bad bacteria in their guts). This could account for the reports from some parents that their kid was doing fine, then after certain vaccination the kid got a fever, got very sick, stopped making eye and started banging their heads on things (not all kids with autism experience this sudden change, but a number of parents have reported the same sudden onset of those symptoms, enough so that this needs to be investigated, but these parents are often called crazy despite some of them having medical backgrounds and them knowing their child’s behavior and tendencies before sudden onset is dismissed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don’t believe or deny the possibility that vaccines might be involved. I simply don’t know. But I can say I don’t like how the medical community is addressing this issue. Instead of exploring all possibilities and listening to what parents are saying, often parents are dismissed and truths are declared without proper investigation. And that always makes me suspicious. I mean, to dismiss a parent noticing a sudden change in behavior is pretty absurd. And with rates increasing the way they are, we really need to look at all possibilities of what could be causing this. Something is causing this dramatic rate increase.

       Respectfully, that paper claims that aluminum "could" cause autism, but isn't that at odds with large scale studies showing that the MMR vaccines simply don't, most of those studies being done after aluminum was introduced?

       MMR does not contain aluminum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only MMR, thimerosal and # of antigens have been explored in relation to autism. ALL of this research is completely irrelevant to aluminum adjuvant.
      </p>
      <p>
       That paper makes a powerful case with overwhelming evidence that aluminum adjuvant from vaccines causes autism. It goes far beyond  merely arguing it "could".
      </p>
      <p>
       Animal studies at the same or lower dosages given to human infants cause the brain damage and inflammation proven to cause autism in humans. Al adjuvant triggers the specific type of inflammation that is known to cause autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all but proven. All thats left to do is the definitive study in humans.

       My mistake, I don't have a horse in this race, just interesting. But your statement that it is all but proven certainly does not seem to be the case. Certain points in that paper are disputed, like aluminum injection vs. ingestion having a different effect (blood brain barrier) due to rate it's administered. That is certainly disputed. And that Li study seems to have been discredited. Also those Shaw/Tomljenovic guys cited have had papers retracted for good reason.

       Pro-vax people give nonsense reasons for rejecting scientfici findings they dont like. There is nothing wrong with the Li study. it has not been "discredited". In fact the finding that Hep B vaccination injures the brain has been further confirmed and expanded in other papers. See below.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is the case. You must read the many scientific papers to understand how consistent and overwhelming the evidence is. The paper linked above has 97 references, and more are coming out all the time. And see this list of studies for example:
       <a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/Evidence-statement.pdf">

       Al adjuvant and water soluble Al salts are completely different. Different toxicity, chemistry and kinetics. It is bad science to use one to predict or estimate the safety/toxicity of the other. But thats what the pro-vaccine rely on, and its scientific nonsense/pseudoscience. Seriously, the primary references used to justify Al adjuvant safety are based on animal studies of ingested water-soluble Al salts, like aluminum citrate or aluminum lactate. its idiotic to think this can be used to estimate the toxicity of injected nanoparticles of non-soluble Al compounds like Al hydroxide or Al phosphate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al adjuvant comprises nanoparticles, which have surface chemistry, catalytic activity and distinct immune stimulating properties. Thats why its used in vaccines. Al adjuvant must be made of particles. Water soluble Al3+ ions does not work as an adjuvant, because it does not cause the required immune stimulation. Its very clear and cannot be disputed that Al3+ ions and Al adjuvant have different biological effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biological effects of nanoparticles can be surprising. Lots of research on nanoparticle toxicity being done today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shaw/Tomljenovic have had a couple papers retracted (I agree for good reason). But their other work is good and some has been replicated. Its not reasonable to reject their papers that are part of the accepted scientific literature and have not been retracted.

       Neonatal hepatitis B vaccination impaired the behavior and neurogenesis of mice transiently in early adulthood.

       The immune system plays a vital role in brain development. The hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) is administered to more than 70% of neonates worldwide. Whether this neonatal vaccination affects brain development is unknown. Newborn C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with HBV or phosphate-buffered saline. HBV induced impaired behavioral performances and hippocampal long-term potentiation at 8 weeks (w) of age without influence at 4 or 12w. At 6w, there was decreased neurogenesis, M1 microglial activation and a neurotoxic profile of neuroimmune molecule expression [increased tumor necrosis factor-α and reduced interferon (IFN)-γ, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor-1] in the hippocampus of the HBV-vaccinated mice. In the serum, HBV induced significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4, indicating a T helper (Th)-2 bias. Moreover, the serum IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio was positively correlated with the levels of neurotrophins and neurogenesis in the hippocampus at the individual level. These findings suggest that neonatal HBV vaccination of mice results in neurobehavioral impairments in early adulthood by inducing a proinflammatory and low neurotrophic milieu in the hippocampus, which follows the HBV-induced systemic Th2 bias.

       I questioned your statement that it is "all but proven." No matter how many studies you throw at me, there are studies on the other side. As a matter of fact, your statement that "Its not reasonable to reject their papers that are part of the accepted scientific literature and have not been retracted." is exactly what you are doing, as evidenced by your website which came up in my search...I assume that is you. " Because medical science is the most corrupt of the sciences. It is extremely corrupt. Big pharma companies pay to have fake scientific papers written and published."  Kind of a double standard, since assumes there are always ulterior motives for their beliefs, and even findings. There is much of that on both sides. I went to school with brilliant guys who ended up doctors, and there is zero chance they went into relatively low-paid research to inflict harm, regardless of any other "big pharma" incentives or threats, rather than speak the truth.

       Vaccines are not the only cause of autism.  There are multiple causes,  vaccines merely being one of many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swelling of the brain  (encephalitis)  can cause autism,  for example.  Encephalitis CAN be caused by vaccines,  but,  can also be caused by other factors.

       Lots of things cause autism (pharmaceutucal drugs, toxins, infections), not just vaccines. Although vaccines probably cause most cases of autism, or increase likelihood of autism when combined with other risk factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental cause of autism is inflammation in the brain during early development. That neuroinflammation causes autism is well established by scientific research and is a consensus view among scientists in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autism is not a new disorder. It has always occurred. However, today the incidence/prevalence of autism is much higher than it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because fetuses and infants today are exposued to more inflammation during development, both in the womb and after birth. There is more pollution, more vaccines, and more pregnant women with chronic inflammatory diseases. When a pregnant woman has abnormally high inflammation in her body, the inflammation damages fetal development.
      </p>
      <p>
       vaccines are an important cause, probably the single biggest contributor, but they are not the only cause.

       You don't mention genetics. There have been many studies on this, and the only question at this point is whether is accounts for the majority of cases, or just a very large percentage.

       Yes genes are involved. But the role of genes is exaggerated/overestimated. This is becuase of gene X environment interactions. GXE interactions are erroneously assumed to not occur in autism, and this mistake causes the role of genes to be enormously overestimated.
