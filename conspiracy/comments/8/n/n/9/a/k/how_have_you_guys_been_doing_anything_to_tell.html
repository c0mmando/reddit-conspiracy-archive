       I've been kind of busy recently and was even out for a few days because of problems over here. I gotta point out clearly that I've been very angry recently because of what happened to
       <a href="/u/RecoveringGrace">
        /u/RecoveringGrace
       </a>
       . She was always looking out for everyone and keeping things under control, so I guess it was natural she became a target. Honestly, I have the habit of starting conversations with people out of nowhere all the more
       <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">
        /u/polkadotgirl

       and it feels like all the people I used to have random conversations with in order to discharge are being taken out one by one...
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way if I give up now it will only be a disgrace for her. I gotta keep up the fight. I'm really sorry about what happened Grace.

       I highly doubt many of the women frequenting this site are "helpless girls". None of them are likely to appreciate people assuming they are helpless just because they happen to have a vagina.

       I spoke with her too. That doesn't mean it isn't some character they could have created to "seduce" some of the other users here and entrap them into something that could potentially totally ban them or allow for their dox.

       If so, it was, as I said, a helluva job. Once she was at school and a kid came up and asked her a question about the bus. They really put a lot of time and effort into it, if it was faked.

       If he/she gave you their phone number, and you gave her yours, that's not a smart move. Exchanging numbers with someone you met online, especially on a sub of this nature, isn't the best move.

       From what I saw in the thread in TMOR, there was pretty conclusive evidence of u/Recovering not only threatening to dox other users on this site, but also clear ban evasion actions by her with alt accounts. You can go check the thread, the evidence is speaks for itself.

       The evidence of Ban Evasion and using Alts is what I was referring to as crystal clear. And in my opinion it absolutely was. The post in question that exposed it has screenshots of messages btwn recoveringgrace and the user where a correspondence between those two accounts is then cited in a private message to the user by a totally different account, and when the user asked Recoveringgrace if she told that other account about the correspondence she outright denies telling anyone which is super strange. How would a random account, that RecoveringGrace claims to not have told about the private messages, cite the content of those private messages in their message to the TMOR User who had been corresponding with RecoveringGrace, if they were not run by same account. A user not involved in those private messages knows about the exact content of those private messages even though both parties to the private messages deny discussing the messages with any other users makes it incredibly easy to make the assumption that one of the users in that private message correspondence is operating that third, random and non-involved account.

       There's usually an angle to what is posted in that sub. Actually, they are aware many of us browse there, so they usually cater their post feed to gaslight those of us who do. In this case, and from what I gather from RG, "she" is kinda garbage and won't be missed. Too much of the hardcore conservative vibe for me personally, consistently defending Trump regarding his Epstein relationship.

I genuinely don't think most of the users here are shills, and I don't think that vigorously investigating a topic immediately denotes shill status. And I carry that feeling over to my thoughts on TMOR as well. Many of them, particularly the more active users there are the same type of people that spend time on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to TMOR and this sub, I think something needs to be said. The two subs don't have to have such a severe relationship. I don't think posting in one sub demands being banned from the other. Yet many users on TMOR have proof of mod messages from here banning them for reasons such as "TMOR". That's not to say that TMOR users are saints. A lot of them enjoy mocking posts, users and mods of this sub, and a lot of TMOR users are shitty about it. But a lot of the complaints TMOR has about this sub, mainly what they claim to be very biased moderating practices they tend to back up with seemingly credible evidence. Additionally a lot of the posts on there calling out racism or antisemitism are usually very clear that the post they refer to is quite explicitly engaging in those things. And yes they mock a lot of conspiracy theories posted on here, but so do a lot of users on here. This sub is for discussing conspiracies, not to be guaranteed to be showered with support and praise for any conspiracy posted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest problem is that this sub is so ready to condemn any and all TMOR content as outright shilling, brigading, lying, disinformation and that anyone who has participated in TMOR threads are liable to be banned unfairly that it sets both subs at an exacerbated animosity and leaves less room for any critical claims or content to be fairly evaluated. When everything presented by one side is immediately dismissed as rule breaking, brigading, lying, shilling it leaves no room for discussion and only further engenders bad feeling on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be honest, I browse TMOR as much as I browse Conspiracy. I have posted in TMOR threads. I've never made a post on TMOR nor have I made one here. I only participate in this sub in good faith and have no desire to stir up more division between the two subs in question. I personally think some of the things posted on TMOR have merit. I don't want to be banned on this sub because I don't break any rules and participate in good faith, but I do consider the fact that I could be banned if someone reports me because I've commented in TMOR Threads.
       <strong>
        But, the main reason I'm saying all this is because I want to make it clear that users in both subs shouldn't outright dismiss the other sub as a cadre of shills, cultists, brigaders, lunatics, liars or etc. Most of the users in both subs are just people, people who like investigating topics, discussing those things and forming new opinions, and seeing what else is out there. This silly war between TMOR and Conspiracy isn't going to achieve anything, especially when both sides have grossly exaggerated ideas of who and how numerous their opponents are.

       Don't try to be diplomatic about the situation. Make no mistake, that sub exists to gaslight people into rejecting conspiracy culture and embracing the status quo. The whole "most of us are former conspiracy users" meme is something I've only seen them push recently.

       You're entitled to think those things and feel that way. I have no right to tell you otherwise. You don't need to believe me or accept that my previous comment was only made in a sincere effort. But if you do talk to people on TMOR or read some of the comments, it becomes clear that a lot of users believe in things that fit on this sub. Granted you won't see as much of that since TMOR is not a purely conspiracy focused sub, and the content posted there is more focused on critiquing and commenting other theories, or "wild claims".
      </p>
      <p>
       And I disagree that the

       I haven't seen any material on TOMR demanding users to not ask questions and to accept what they are told. Most users believe in asking questions. Additionally most users on there embrace conspiracies such as the myriad of conspiracies surrounding the Trump administration, ranging from government corruption, Campaign violations, Russian Collusion, etc. Just because those conspiracy theories are reported widely and backed by government agencies and evidence doesn't mean that they are no longer conspiracy theories. The Russian Collusion topic is a topic centered on a potential conspiracy between a then presidential-candidate and his campaign and foreign nationals and potentially a foreign state to work to influence and swing the election a certain way. While it is mainstream and receives ample attention and reporting, that doesn't dismiss it as a conspiracy theory. And this seems to be a very common gatekeeping problem on this sub where something that some users don't like can be dismissed because it doesn't favor their politics and already receives attention from the media, government and general public. But that raises the question of why is it ok to dismiss any conspiracy theory as "status quo" just because it is a hot issue. Popularity and coverage don't change the nature of the topic. Regardless of the Russian Collusion conspiracy is only discussed on forums tucked away in the far recesses of the web, or if its a topic for most media outlets and even the government it still is a conspiracy theory, that is being investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it seems like your saying that criticism or commentary of any conspiracy theory or content posted on this sub bad. Yet users on this sub do all of that to each other and only a few are accused of being operatives working to gaslight people. How is it that one sub is only filled with people with an active agenda to destroy conspiracy culture, while the other sub is full of mostly real thinkers that won't always be accused of being shill agents with an agenda. That seems like some sports team rivalry mentality, which to me seems to be utterly counter intuitive in a place dedicated to discussion and exploring new ideas or perspectives.

       Why would I not be diplomatic? I have no problems here. I have no reason to be anything but civil anywhere on this site, and I don't see a reason why not being civil would be needed. This is an internet forum that has no impact on my real life. If ideas are posted that I don't agree with, or if I'm personally attacked, it's still not something worth getting bothered over. I'll always conduct myself in a civil, diplomatic manner because if I don't I won't be able to contribute to discussions to the best of my abilities, and letting comments on the internet make me bothered or uncivil just seems like a waste of time.

       There are plenty of conspiracies that never make TMOR, namely the ones that have some evidence behind them, or are at least plausible. Check the sub for yourself, most of the posts are about conspiracies which could only really be described as political propaganda. I will say TMOR does seem to have a clear anti-Trump bias, as you don’t often see many crazy left-wing conspiracies being discussed there.
