       Well how bout this thread.

       The upvotes rolled in so fast I was convinced the upvotes were rigged. We can touch on that later but first, let's focus on Human Cloning (it would be a programmable life form, so, no soul/consciousness)
      </p>
      <p>
       First off is my proof for this clear cut banning of people speaking out against these bio-printing practices
      </p>

       Notice how a 72 hour mute takes place so you can't ask the mods what you even did wrong. This is common practice for controlled and bought/paid for and influenced subs. Thank god conspiracy is open and free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now onto Human Clones themselves. I can post link after link but all you really need to watch are these interviews with insiders that have worked at these dark labs underground that use questionable genome material.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.gaia.com/video/cosmic-summit">

      </p>
      <p>
       It is not hard to clone things. The problem comes with the ethics of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this work is carried out in secret labs, under ground labs, and underground bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of stuff is out of the public eye and they burrow far enough down into the earth where it's technically "outside the laws and limits of society"
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of thing needs more awareness because it opens up the door to egoic fueled genetic disasters built out of a need for more funds and money instead of an actual balanced scientific approach..
      </p>
      <p>
       It has become a battle of greed and deformed life forms between these secret labs and varying corporate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is only the tip of the ice berg but I hope this fosters some discussion into this PLF's. Think of vast armies of clones ready to go... That is a scary thought. Or used at will for pedophile desires. This kind of stuff happens more than we realize or have ever been willing to admit to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies tell more truth than we know. If you want more information I suggest you dig and also look into Cosmic Disclosure on Gaia streaming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start a discussion about clones and the like. Do you have a story or info/link to share? Plug away
      </p>
      <p>
       Much love and blessings to you all

       yeah its ridiculous
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact I got a 3 day ban, followed by a revised perm ban, and then a 72 hour mute, shows the mods did not like what I was saying

       Its clear cut bias. They don't even bother explaining why they ban you. Talk about a controlled Sub Reddit

       A part of me wonders how many different types of people/DNA has been cloned/used for cloning.

       This is a surfacing issue but one that needs to be addressed and awareness brought forth.

       Rhetorically...how do you know anything's been cloned? Unabashed mimicry/identical appearance and manners. My class is : average average average....however you might label that...a worker bee essentially. The other classes are roughly along the lines of Jung's archetypes....there are many questions indeed...the answers are clear as day for anyone to know...but our perceptions and discernment as a collective species have been hijacked and we 'cant see the forest (due to) the trees'

       my brother and i got into a conversation a couple months ago, and he told me he has either learned or realized or whatever (I forget) that we're all essentially clones built off different
       <em>
        builds
       </em>
       . he went on to explain that this is why so many people look very similar in one small way or another. he told me that everybody he shares that theory with eventually comes to believe it on their own - which, to his credit, I will say I definitely believe it now.

       Its a show about AI "hosts" in an amusement park for humans to go and do whatever they want to the hosts. The hosts look totally human and the engineers have perfected their behaviors and mannerisms so that it is very difficult to tell them from a real human.  They are created in a lab.

       Unless you were to cut one open, you'd never be able to tell. In fact, in the show, the "hosts" dont even know they are hosts. They think they are real.

       I seldom visit that sub, but is "Futurology" actually some kind of ideological or belief system?  It would go a long way towards explaining the fawning promotion of most of the stuff in that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually posts in that sub are like "Scientists discover new X, expect X to be civilization altering widespread technology".  If you dig into the story, it's like 4 guys in a lab spent 3 years producing a proof of concept that's marginally better than something that already exists and will take 10 years and 5 billion dollars to possibly mass produce.

       Futurology is a giant circlejerk of people who have forgotten Clarks 3 laws.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
       </li>
       <li>
        The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
       </li>
       <li>
        Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

       I don't know about that video, but being a science enthusiast myself, I do find it concerning how little criticism the development of so many extremely powerful developing technologies receive. Everyone has basically accepted the horrors of Black Mirror to be the future rather than getting together to discuss how they'll prevent it or plan a pushback when it comes. Nobody even thinks of alternative tools that are more effective and lend to less harm and violation of others.
