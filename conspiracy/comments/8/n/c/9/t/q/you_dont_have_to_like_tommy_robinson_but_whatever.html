        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You see, Robinson was arrested for standing outside a court building and reporting on a trial involving the alleged grooming of young girls for sexual assault by radical Muslims.</p>

<p>Now, what would be illegal about that, you ask? It turns out that Robinson was given a suspended sentence last year for filming outside another court building, where a trial for alleged gang rape by radical Muslims was taking place. He wasn’t inside the courtroom. Nonetheless, the judge believed he was somehow biasing the jurors. According to the judge, Robinson was sentenced thanks to “pejorative language which prejudges the case, and it is language and reporting … that could have had the effect of substantially derailing the trial.”</p>

<p>This time, Robinson was again arrested for prejudicing a case, only he wasn’t inside the court building. He was outside. And the media were originally banned from reporting on his arrest so that his trial wouldn’t be biased. In other words, Britain has now effectively banned reporting that actually mentions the Islamic nature of criminal defendants for fear of stirring up bigotry — and has banned reporting on reporting on such defendants. It’s an infinite regress of suicidal political correctness.</p>

Everything is already in place in the US, they just have to move more slowly when they decide to use these tools because Citizens can still use those pesky things called Rights and Lawyers to gunk up the system.</p>

<p>When the next major crisis happens, is when they will finally crack down on our remaining Rights that keep getting in their way...then they&#39;ll have complete control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s literally zero conspiracy here. He was arrested and charged with contempt of court. He was not “reporting” at all. He was shouting “Muslim peados” etc etc all while jurors were walking into court. This is a big no-no. You absolutely cannot colour or influence a jurors opinion on a trial. You’re literally told, as a juror, that if anyone should approach you about a trial in or out of a courtroom to report it immediately. That is the reason why he was arrested and sentenced. This isn’t his first time doing this either. He was given a suspended sentence and as told in no uncertain terms “you do this again, you’re going to prison”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think because the right insists on framing things as racial instead of addressing the problem for the problem, right wing ppl will continue to get arrested fir this stuff.</p>

<p>If we stopped using race as a way to frame things, especially since race as we commonly understand it is a social construction and nothing more, it would go a long way to helping right wing media not get shut down all the time.</p>

<p>That is to say, instead of trying to scapegoat a minority like an authoritarian, why not stress morality and advocate for a more efficient use of our power structure, like a conservitive.</p>

<p>The window has shifted so far right that media has no idea how to keep these conversations from flying wildly off base. It&#39;s easy: shift the overton window left again.</p>

<p>But lets be clear, media, news, journalists, as far as the mainstream is concerned, are just as much cogs in the capitalist machine as you are. They have jobs to make money for their companies, and if they dont get the sensationalist clicks, they lose their job for someone with less integrity.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame for this, blame yourself for consuming it and blame capitalism for perverting journalism.</p>
