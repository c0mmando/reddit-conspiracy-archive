<p>Given that Reddit now has a different user agreement/privacy policy/whatever-they&#39;re-calling-it-now...and is generally pro-censorship, pro-establishment and pro-propaganda (basically, less than a free speech zone)...it would be good to have countermeasures if they decide to shut down this sub.  </p>

<p>So in the (un?)likely event that they decide to clamp down on this sub for having &quot;conspiratards&quot; or &quot;brigading&quot; or &quot;being russian bots&quot; or &quot;being anti-vaccine people&quot; or &quot;being flat-earthers&quot; or whatever, where do we go next? What is our contingency plan? Would love to know.</p>

<p>Oh trust me, that particular plague exists in literally <strong>every</strong> conspiracy community. I&#39;m not sure whether these are absolute dimwits or people who have been appointed for the task of derailing genuine discussions by making anyone discussing conspiracy theory look like an idiot. Unfortunately however, I feel that the former is far more likely a thing than the latter - in a way that I don&#39;t think the latter is even needed all that much when the former is doing its job so very efficiently.  </p>

<p>Maybe we should have a &quot;conspiracy meta&quot; subreddit where we can at least make jokes about these kind of people and get a good laugh, if not anything else.</p>

Reddit management has allowed and encouraged and promoted so much manipulation of content and moderation here, they have destroyed it over the last several years in a most insidious way.

<p>/conspiracy has all but no credibility any more; constant moderating issues, rule changes, restrictions, trolling, brigading, interference, infighting. </p>

<p>Why ban something when you can engineer it for self destruction and then blame it on the asshole userbase?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you on your points, <em>giving up</em> is the exact thing they would want us to do, and I don&#39;t think we should give them that pleasure so easily. In spite of having a &quot;broken&quot; community, people still have the opportunity to post any new information they find on here. Sure, some of it may be deleted, brigaded etc. but the point to focus on is, that this information gateway STILL hasn&#39;t been entirely shut. And so long as it isn&#39;t, and people are still getting exposed to new conspiracies, and the occassional post is still reaching r/all...we are FOR SURE awakening (both old and new) users to more of what has been hidden from them all along. True, that our setup might not be perfect and is something that has been heavily controlled and manipulated for less-than-nice reasons...but even a little progress is still progress, and carries the <em>potential</em> in it to eventually awaken the whole world. So while it may be true that this community has gone to the dogs and everything, ALL is not lost, just yet, at least from how I perceive it. Eventually the TRUTH always wins --- because it can only be hidden for so long.</p>

<p>/conspiracy is not considered an information gateway anymore, it has been successfully been painted as a looney bin full of racist retards, functional illiterates, and politically prehensile primates.</p>

<p>This has been done over quite a long period of time - 3 or 4 years - since the demise of Aaron Swartz, the buyout by Advanced Publications, the installation of Ellen Pao, and the subsequent takeover by Steve Huffman.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a money game. r/conspiracy in it&#39;s earlier form has been completely smited by design and implementation, and turned into a laughing stock that will not be detrimental to the stock value of reddit.com when spez cashes out on Wall St. and then disappears into the sunset with his CEO profits.</p>

I remember when conspiracy split off from the main Reddit, it was about six months after I started here. I remember thinking it was the end of reddit being any good, because before that half of the front page of Reddit, was the front page of conspiracy. Sub Reddit‘s themselves, where possibly a conspiracy, to keep down the flow of information about government and business crime and corruption on an international scale. </p>

<p>I tried retrieving the password and it didn&#39;t work. I tried resetting the password and it didn&#39;t work. I tried creating a new account but their system has locked up my email address and my phone number. </p>

<p>So basically, if you lose/forget your password you are off the platform forever. That is one shitty way to set things up. I gave up trying to get on there after two days of trying everything I could think of. </p>

<p>I’m sorry to hear that you forgot your password, and I agree that it’s frustrating that they don’t have some kind of recovery method. That being said, the fact that you can’t just easily go make a new account is one of the beautiful things about an online social platform. It makes creating sock puppet accounts and bot accounts that much more difficult. </p>

<p>If you go over to r/Steemit I’m sure you will find more info about it (or just google, because I honestly don’t even know if there is an r/Steemit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already tried the Steemit sub and no solution was available. </p>

<p>As someone who has been creating content for the last 12plus years on YouTube, with over 600 videos, and considered to be in the top 1% of Youtubers in terms of subscribers, I would have loved to have been able to get on Steemit, to help support a decentralized platform, but to be honest, the platform is doomed to fail if you can&#39;t retrieve your password and by not being able to retrieve it, you are basically banned. </p>

<p>Steemit will die-off once a better platform arrives, and I&#39;ve actually already started to share my content on other platforms, bitchute being one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can always create a new account, just need to use a different phone number. I agree, it&#39;s a shitty system, but I have no doubt that they will figure something better out eventually due to competition.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t bitchute have the same password policy in terms of private keys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, as far as I know Bitchute doesn&#39;t have the same type of PW policy. </p>

<p>As for Steemit, you not only need a new phone number but also a different email address. Basically you need a new identity and have to take on all the costs associated with that to create a new account. Talk about a stupid system. If they haven&#39;t figured out how to make this easier then I have basically zero trust in them. I wrote them off after realizing that they are an exclusive club and I&#39;m not welcome in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I for one appreciate the level of security needed in order to participate. Again, it&#39;s a feature, not a bug. They warn you when you sign up to guard your private keys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of people have accounts on multiple platforms, and usually when they sign up for something it&#39;s done in a rush and mainly created as a first step of getting to know the platform. Keep in mind that the majority of people are also not tech-savvy, so they don&#39;t read all the fine print, they press next when pop up windows appear and so on. </p>

<p>So, when they come back to the account again they have usually forgotten what they had to do to create the account and have most likely forgotten their security key (PW). This was the case with me... keep in mind that I have been involved with bitcoin since 2010/2011 and even though I don&#39;t consider myself tech-savvy, I have been online since the early 1990&#39;s. If setting up an account on Steemit is this difficult for me, them the majority of humanity will have a seriously hard time. </p>

<p>As I said, it&#39;s an exclusive club and I&#39;m not welcome in it, and neither are the majority of people. </p>
