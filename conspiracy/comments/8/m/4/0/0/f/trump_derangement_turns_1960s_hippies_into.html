       You get to a certain age and you are fairly certain you have seen it all. For example, I have already witnessed a man walk on the moon, a president resign, America lose a war, the space shuttle explode, the Soviet Union collapse, a president impeached, a tied presidential race, the Twin Towers fall, and a billionaire real estate magnate elected president without a lick of political or military experience. But who would have thought we would live to see the day a Donald Trump could kill off the 1960s?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is exactly what has happened over the last ten days — Trump killed off the 1960s. Not the worst of it. The social horrors birthed in the ’60s; the fallout that never ends with drug abuse, the welfare state, and loveless sex will always be with us. You can never put evil back in the bottle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good things that came out of the ’60s — Trump killed almost all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What have we learned over the last ten days?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, only that the Obama administration launched a counter-intelligence operation against a rival presidential campaign complete with spies, wiretaps, unprecedented unmasking, media leaks, and FISA warrants based on lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that, however, is surprising. Government is corrupt, especially the federal government, most especially the unelected bureaucrats in the intelligence community. After living through Watergate, Iran-Contra, Billary selling the Lincoln bedroom, no WMD in Iraq, and Barry weaponizing the IRS and running guns into Mexico, I am well aware incompetence and corruption are the government’s default positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I never thought I would see…
      </p>
      <p>
       The children of the ’60s — you know, the hippies — and their ideological offspring in academia, politics, and, most especially, the media, are now not only okay with a sitting president’s weaponizing the intelligence community against a rival presidential campaign;
       <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/05/24/nolte-how-trump-killed-1960s/">
        they are all rolling over like whipped dogs to believe everything the intelligence community tells them,
       </a>
       most especially when it is coming from the CIA — the CIA! — and the FBI.

       Yeah, I wish we could wake them up to the fact that the See Eye Eh is the real enemy. They are, quite literally, torturing civilians in secret jails as we speak. They are murdering schoolchildren to try and get us to give up our arms. They are working to overthrow democratically elected leaders and destabilize nations all around the world. They rig our elections and work to subvert the constitution so they control the US themselves. It just never ends.

       So the other option is what--the delusional Twitter-spammer who's got an inferiority complex and desperately wants to be a tyrant (to the point that he cancels a meeting with another tyrant because he's worried that tyrant will out-tyrant him) combined with a Congress that is a rubber-stamp for whatever ridiculous ideas the current President trots out?

       I don't see THAT as a successful solution in the slightest. You can't "win" the war for America by destroying it in the process.

       So resisting a peaceful transition of power, spying on political candidates using the powers of office, and using corruption to set up a secret line of succession is cool and totally not a threat to America?

       Never before has the previous administration been so vocal or involved in protesting, legal action, and subverting an incoming administration as Obama’s/Hillary’s have been. Many have been in the media calling for violence and blood in the streets. They post with the hashtag
       <code>
        #Resist
       </code>
       . They call themselves things like “Forever First Lady”. It’s unprecedented, and classless at best. It’s seditious at worst. I’m honestly convinced they wanted a civil war over this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t have to be a Trump supporter to see what’s going on, but you’d have to be blind (perhaps manipulated to hate) not to.

       No that isn't true. They didn't even mention the FBI investigation until AFTER the election.

       You are projecting the actions of people AFTER the election to before it.

      <p>
       Frankly if the next incoming administration has broken laws and subverted our democracy with a questionable foreign power what should be done?

       You may not believe anything was done but Bill Clinton was under investigation for 6 years of his presidency and it basically started when he took office. You are letting the right wing propaganda machine dictate reality.

       Who is stopping him from being president?

       Saying to resist isn't a call for blood it is a call for protests.

       The people in T_D saying liberalism is a disease to be wiped out are the ones calling for blood. Trump himself hinted at violence against those that protest.

       No my question is entirely pertinent. Your statements either assumes the incoming administration is a normal one or that the actions during the campaign don't matter. You are ignoring the circumstances to focus the issue entirely on one aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're talking about this quote?
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it’s a time of concern for people who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on, and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers. And it has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals, who have made the difference. They’ve marched, they’ve bled — yes, some of them have died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before; we can do this again."
      </p>
      <p>
       She is saying to march DESPITE violence inflicted on those MARCHING. She isn't calling for violence she is saying not to be deterred by violence.

       It could be the most corrupt incoming administration in history. Challenging the peaceful transition of power is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       how to deal wit that. We are a country of laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what she said, I’ve watched the original video many times. It is an inflammatory video intended to keep the riots happening if you watch it in the context of the timeframe when it was released. A time when violence was only being perpetrated by the left, and the law enforcement containing them. Context is important.

       They didn't challenge the peaceful transition. You keep asserting it without it being true.

       However, you keep stating something which isn't true. Point to me where in the video she calls for violence? Show me where Democratic protesters got violent. Saying people
       <em>
        marched and bled
       </em>
       isn't a call to violence it is a call to protest.

       Never before has the current administration been so vocal in calling for the arrest and prosecution of the prior administration. Remember "Lock her up." It was all a partisan political charade because they will keep yelling it forever, but despite their power, they won't do it.

       You don’t have to be a Trump opponent to see what’s going on. Donald Trump is plainly on the 'wrong side of history,' attacking minorities and scapegoating people, even saying that people who don't 'respect the flag' leave the nation. That's tyranny. That's tyranny at the level of people like Mussolini, Hitler, and Pinochet.

       Donald Trump's policies are nearly identical to GWB's policies. They're not PC enough with each other? Is that your complaint? You're the PC police now?

       Hillary Clinton should definitely at least face charges regarding her incontrovertible, inarguable felony handling of classified material. They left her off because ‘it was an accident’. Whether you support Hillary or not, you do have to support the rule of law and accept that one is above it right? It should go to trial.

       Words are not tyranny, my friend. You’re doing a great injustice to the victims of actual tyranny by trying to equivocate a few comments with murder, and actual oppression. Please, dont’ do this.

       No, my point as you’re aware (though youre trying to catch my tail by straw manning) is that the left is so desperate to Get Trump that they’d even go to bed with one of the worst presidents in decades, and cheer for him. The congestive dissonance is audible.

       Words + Actions are tyranny. Every policy that Donald Trump supports -- one hundred percent -- are tyrannical. They also happen to be mostly the same old establishment Republican agenda that was created in the 1930's when the TYRANTS tried to overthrow Franklin Roosevelt. Fortunately for us, FDR and LBJ built a robust system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intention of Republicans is clear: they want tyranny. They have fought against democracy and for the oligarchy consistently since FDR. Each time another Republican cheats his way into the White House, they go as far as they can and further. Eventually, the system will crash and the regular people will burn.

       Decent people want Donald Trump out because of the policy damage and the words he uses to justify it. Give up your victim complex. It's the way he and his friend Neil Gorsuch got in there and it's what they are doing to destroy America.

       Getting out the perfect tyrant requires all the tools we have. If you don't want to force the population into an alignment with bad people, then don't pump up the worst tyrant in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will worry about who they "go to bed" with when the immediate danger is out of the way. As long as you support the tyrant, you are complicit in pushing the entire paradigm toward elites.

       He is doing it. He is not allowing press that criticizes him in certain places. He is literally banning people and not allowing outlets coverage.

       That isn't TDS. You may agree with his choices because you don't like that outlets. But it is outrageous; you all would have thrown a god damn civil war if Obama had banned Fox News.

       There's that old saying 'politics makes for strange bedfellows'...Being anti-DT doesn't make you 'pro-CIA'. The premise of the op essentially states the opposite. That 2 groups have what may appear to be similar limited interests for the moment means nothing more that that. (similarly if we were attacked by some foreign invader Ds and Rs would circle the wagons we'd smash them and then they'd go back to fighting one another)
      </p>
      <p>
       Reminds me of another thing I've always found strange. No conspiracy-minded discussion could really be complete without recognizing one of the most powerful forces out there--the MIC(and it's natural ally the Republicans) And yet tons of conspiracy people come down on the right and support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate--all I was really pointing out is that DT running as an anti-corruption crusader is laughable. He is corruption.

       My read of this election cycles runs something along these lines(And things certainly seem turned upside down for sure) But what I was seeing was completely straight people like accountants etc all the sudden feel like they were being revolutionaries!! by electing the 'outsider' DT. And on the other side I've seen all the other people 
freaking out and saying have you people lost your fking minds!! Donald Trump?? Really?? Definite twilight zone vibe though for sure.

       The hippies were politically influenced by foreign, anti-American Communists. Not hard to convince people like this into supporting a police state today,  especially when it is aimed at their enemy and not them. Not much has changed. Drugs are still rampant, sex has moved to the internet, and rock n roll (and other modern genres) are still the same left-wing mouthpieces.

       Once again this was a rabid fox and friends theory that is not based in reality. The wiretaps were related to someone and were authorized before the person joined Trumps campaign. This also was cleared and debunked partially through the complete shitshow of the #realeasethememo meltdown.
       <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/trump-campaign-spying-obama-administration-ignored-norms/">
        Here is an article from a very conservative website pushing the wiretap allegation
       </a>
       ....except there are no facts presented as to why this assertion is correct. That author literally uses two headlines of articles directly refuting his point, to make his point.
       <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/revisiting-trumps-wiretap-tweets/">
        Now lets look at a sourced analysis of this claim

       I honestly don't know what this one refers to. I dont watch any news on TV nor do i continuously monitor the bickering. My assumption is the author is just using a buzzword and there is nothing specific he's talking about here. To my knowledge, the only revelation of 'unmasking' which has happened in the past 10 days was actually the right wing media unmasking the informant which those on the left and right have stated make them uneasy he was being unmasked to try and score a win for Trump.

       You can't deny that the FBI did have an informant, that Trump was wiretapped, or any of what he said though. You attack it for being sourced from right wing places, like that somehow makes it untrue.

       Nice use of caps, friend. Unfortunately their use doesn’t change the fact that very few things in the Dossier are verified. Those that are mostly have to do with things Russia did by themselves because they didn’t like Clinton.

       There’s that whole thing with FusionGPS setting up the meeting between Jr. and that Russian chick as well, but I’m sure you don’t want to talk about that, right guy? Right? How Lynch let her into the country on a special visa with like a days notice, etc.

       Sure we can. We can prove many of the things Trump​ says are lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump​ was never wiretapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The informant was working on Page and Papadopoulos, the first being someone who Russian spies had worked on before, the other met with Russians regarding Hillary​'s email and pled guilty to lying. Was the FBI supposed to not investigate then because they joined the Trump​ campaign? Why did the Trump​ campaign have so many individuals with ties to Russians? Why did a foreign policy advisor for the Trump​ campaign taking to a Russian professor about Hillary's email?
      </p>
      <p>
       The FISA warrant was also based on Papadopoulos letting an Australian diplomat know that a Russian professor had talked to him about Hillary's email before anyone had an inkling that the DNC or Podesta was hacked. A crime occurred and the foreign policy advisor of the Trump​ campaign was in the middle of it, were law enforcement supposed to overlooked the crime because it's campaign season?

       So, most of those in power were young in the 60's, but weren't necessarily hippies. I'll wager most were not. Depends how you define hippie I guess. Most of them probably did try week and wear miniskirts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But drug addiction and 'loveless' sex existed a loooooong time before the 60's. At least since when somebody told the story of sodom.

       Russia has also used bullets. Does that mean if someone is shot, we can blame Russia, and not investigate to find the killer?

       It's not being an apologist for Russia, it's seeking factual confirmation based on evidence.

       It can be if you're selective in what you're "seeking factual confirmation" about, because you can do that forever with anything.  You can use that excuse to never acknowledge wrong doing from "your side".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people, despite what they think, aren't basing their belief off of objective information.  Myself included.  We have a world view of the good guys and bad guys and are quick to place blame at the feet of bad guys and when it comes to the good guys....well maybe we don't have all of the facts yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people I know who are suddenly taking time to defend Russia aren't going to put the effort into seeking factual confirmation if the DNC is blamed for killing a former staffer.  It sounds exactly like the kind of thing the DNC would do to them.  They hate the DNC.  They want to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And two years ago, they would not have continued to seek factual confirmation if the UK said a former Russia/British double agent was murdered with an exotic poison by Russia.  But now....well....how do we know really?  Let's wait for more facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this isn't you and you take as much time to keep seeking factual confirmation in an equal and judicious manner, but a lot of people I know are suddenly doing this more for Russia than they would even for the US.

       When Russia invaded Ukraine they said repeatedly they didn’t have troops. The whole world knew they did but they stuck to the lie anyway. If either Russia or the UK is lying the uK has more credibility so I’ll believe them.
      </p>

       Anyway it all comes down to believing what someone else is telling you. You don’t even know for sure if the event even happened. Are you just going to believe that it occurred?  Were you there?  If you were there how do you know it wasn’t an actor?  It never ends.

       What I do find interesting is the Russian lawyers ties to FusionGPS - the source for the dossier. How she met with FGPS before and after the Jr. meeting, and most importantly how the hell she got into the country with a visa when she was on immigration parole.

       So it's okay for Trump​'s son to meet with emissaries of other countries, who expressly said they have emails of their main opponent, "to hear things out", emails which were later released by Wikileak, which also corresponded with Trump​ Jr, but hiring a US registered firm to do legal opposition research, research which weren't made public until after the election, is somehow worse? If the meetings were oh so innocent, why did Trump​ make up a lie to try to cover it up until the NYT asked them for comments before it released the emails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meetings where they discussed US sanctions on Russia and hacked emails could very well be illegal, not to mention the "coincidence" of emails being later released by Wikileak, another correspondence of Trump​ Jr, which we again only learned about after the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was part of a case being argued in court, which was how she got the immigration parole, which was what allowed her to enter the country in 2015 to early 2016. For the June entry, she apparently got a non-immigrant work visa, probably in relation to that case, since the emails itself said she was in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, Trump​'s son meeting with people, expressedly described as Russian government lawyer there to help his father's campaign against Hillary, to discuss hacked emails and US sanctions is totally the same as the current US President discussing his ability to negotiate with the Russian President once the election result comes in. Like Obama as President has no authority to negotiate legitimately?

       You seem to have a whole bunch of assumptions of guilt in there based on coincidences. Lets not forget, however, that Assange himself said that there was no collusion with regards to the emails. Wikileaks has a 100% track record for truth and we have literally 0 reason to doubt him.

       She was denied a visa and "immigration parole" is the mechanism that allowed her to enter the country in 2015 till Jan 2016 then she got a non-immigrant work visa for the June 2016 entry.

       When "coincidences" keep piling up, it's being wilfully blind to not ask questions. We have plenty of reasons to doubt Assange, just because he publishes the documents doesn't mean he doesn't pick and choose what to publish. He claimed he wasn't colluding with the Trump​ ​campaign but the emails showed attempts to coordinate with them. Even asking for small leaks from Jr to show that Wikileak is "unbias". His insinuation that Rich is the source of the DNC leak while claiming that he can't reveal the source and then denying that it came from the Russian, yeah that's wanting your cake and eat it and keep the same slice for his Russian friend that wasn't the source. The way he published the Podesta emails showed that he took an active role in the US Presidential campaign. He has no credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself: who finances Wikileak? Who protects Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy? Why does Assange almost always publishes documents damaging to Western governments who's after him? Anyone who believes he's an unbias journalist is a fool.

       FusionGPS was working for the Clinton campaign, and worked with a foreign intelligence agent to acquire the Steele Dossier. Currently the very thin veil protecting the DNC from ‘collusion’ is the media, and testimony that “oh Steele didn’t know, and the campaign didn’t know”

       I was working with old information on this. However she was working with FusionGPS, and met with them both before and after her meeting with Jr. She says she didn’t meet him, he says they met before and after, but he didn’t know she met with Jr. riiiight. Point stands that this was purely a setup. I won’t say DHS was involved now though.

       No one said he’s unbiased, but he is all about truth and his track record proves this. I’ve met people that claim he’s a Saudi shill, an Israel shill, a GOP shill, a Dem shill. Pretty good indicator he’s working as independent as one can expect. I have 0 doubt he’s telling the truth about the DNC leaks, as you should. Schiff should go meet him.

       This is not backing up what you claim, it's just more of you making wild claims. Either back up your claim that what they did was illegal or admit it's bullshit.

       You were working with bullshit. You didn't even know what "immigration parole" is. You're just parroting what the right wing media tells you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You haven't made any point, you make wild claims based on lies Trump​ told you. Trump​ and his son lied about the meeting, until the NYT forced their hand into releasing those emails. We know Jr took that meeting willingly to get hacked Clinton's emails. We know the emails later get leaked by Wikileak who also corresponded with Jr. Those are facts. If someone set Trump​ ​and his son up to do the crime, they certainly committed the crime with big smiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       FusionGPS is a firm for hire, they work for whoever pays, which includes the Russians, regarding abolishing the Magnitsky Act. If you are unwilling to draw conclusions about the many "coincidences" of Trump, his son, and his campaign staffs working with Russians, then why would you draw conclusions about a lawyer meeting with a firm she hired to fight the law she wants abolished?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hah, he's all about protecting his skin. If he's all about the truth, he wouldn't be making insinuation about Rich. Either says Rich's the source or stay the fuck out of the conspiracy. His track record proves he picked and chose what to publish and he tried to steer the election against Clinton, oh here's another "coincidence", that's what Putin wants too. Funny how that works out. Trump​campaign, Wikileak and Russia, all wanting Clinton to lose, having meetings and privates messages back and forth but nope "no collusion".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if Wikileak is all about truth, how about they publish their finances, see where their money come from and what they spend it on?

       Muh Russia? Really? Holy shit, I wouldn't have wasted my time had I known. I was with you with Trump breaking some campaign laws in general
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       but...
      </p>
      <p>
       You're being disingenuous about FusionGPS being the front for all of the corruption and law breaking that went on with the DNC, and you know it. I got some facts wrong because it's been nearly a year since that Vvsa stuff went down, but it was only a tangent to the conversation. The only implication of me admittedly  being wrong is that there's no direct tie to the Obama Admin with the
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       setup by FusionGPS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes he took meetings willingly. Meetings are not illegal, or they'd all be behind bars already (we've been over this). Taking material, or gaining advantage in the election from a foreign entity is illegal. The Steele Dossier is exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure you're in touch with reality to understand but literally no one wanted Hillary to win. Not even the Democrats. She had to rig the primaries to win that. So saying that Russia didn't want her to win means nothing. Maybe a couple of EU states who had favors out to her wanted it, but that's it.

       If I'm being "disingenuous", it should be easy to back up your claim that the DNC did something illegal by hiring FusionGPS to continue the opposition research that was started by the Republican. Go on, back it up instead of going on and on with bullshit claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shouldn't matter if it's a year ago or now. You got it wrong because you never got it right in the first place. That's my point. The right tell you the Obama Administration must have let the lawyer in to set up Trump​ and you ran with it without checking the facts. They fed you bullshit and you ate it and thought it was delicious. At least understand that you are being manipulated with their lies. Next time, check the facts before you believe anything they claim like this next one:
      </p>
      <p>
       You should go back and read about campaign finance law. You're again sprouting bullshit about the Steele Dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people didn't want Hillary​ to win but did they have meetings about Hillary's hacked emails and did they release hacked campaign emails weeks before the election? And these groups all happen to be in contact with each other, which were kept hidden from the public until after the election? I'm very in touch with facts and reality, it's people like you who try every type of hypocritical excuse to avoid admitting the stink of collusion between the Trump​campaign, Wikileak and the Russians that seem to surround them, that are avoiding reality.
