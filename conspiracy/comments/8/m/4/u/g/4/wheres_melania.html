       She hasn't been seen in public since May 10th, when she appeared with the president to greet the three freed North Korean hostages.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the 14th, she was hospitalized for what was described as a "routine kidney procedure," and came home on the 19th. She has not made an appearance since then, and today, when the press asked the president how she was doing, Trump pointed to a window and claimed she was standing there watching...except she wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...where is she? Did she really have a kidney procedure? Is she sicker with something else, and the White House is hiding it? If so, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, she has a right to privacy, but the American people also have a right to know whether the White House is lying about the First Lady's health.

       The procedure the White House said she had typically requires a one or two night hospital stay. She was in for five nights. Why? And why aren't we being told more?

       Anytime you have surgery there is a chance for complications. Maybe she developed an infection? Also, some people recover from surgery quicker than other people. Maybe she just needs a little more time than other people. Give her a break. She really does deserve a little down-time and some privacy.

       Because she deserves a little privacy. If she isn't feeling well and needs a little more time to recover, then I perfectly understand. Give her a break. What is the big deal?

       If the WH came out and said she is having complications, then you and the MSM still wouldn't be happy and you would still attack her. You'd all say, "Why is she having complications? Michelle Obama never had complications. Is Melania not healthy? Blah Blah Blah"

       Even most people who hate Donald Trump to the absolute core of their being have nothing against Melania and in many cases actually like her.

       I don't think it is reasonable that the MSM and a large number of people online would start attacking her for having some complications with a medical issue.

       Yeah, you are right. But when something seems innocent or crosses the line (like calling Hillary obese), I speak out. Now, I'm not a fan of Hillary at all. I don't like her. But she is definitely not obese! So I spoke out in her defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Melania. Right now, her taking extra time off seems innocent and related to her hospital stay. I say, let her have a little time and give her a break.

       I will admit that I didn't pay close attention to Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, and all the other First Ladies. I'm sure during their time in the WH that they were absent and nobody said anything. Honestly, people didn't keep up with them like they seem to do with Melania and this administration.

       We’ve theorized she may have been poisoned and it was excreted out of her kidneys, causing the issue...

      <p>
       However, thinking back on our own experiences, mine having an organ removed and him having a large stone removed, we were out of the hospital within a day or two but were told to rest for two weeks following, with light walking around (to avoid clotting), no exercising, and no lifting anything over 10-15lbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering her fragile state of healing, she may be a security issue and to keep her within the living quarters for extra time than to risk her being in public and possibly being pushed or tackled.

       No. I know she has had plastic surgery in the past, but she doesn't look like she needs anything done now. She doesn't need a face lift or liposuction or anything else in my opinion. So I don't think it is plastic surgery.

       People who get plastic surgery can become to judgemental about their looks and get surgeries that none else think they need.  And then add in the effects of the media scrutiny, media scrutiny caused Sarah Palin to flip out about her aperence and weight when she had no reason to. Barring a serious medical condition I feel plastic surgery is the most likely reason she isn't in public.

       Better yet - where is Barron? (And the rest of the family for that matter?) Around election time there was a lot of threats directed towards the poor kid - really hope the perceived circumstances are plainly because I haven’t been following closely. Something feels off though. Other members of the admin doing an awful lot of talking in little I have seen.

       Trump's have always hidden Barron. Lots of speculation he is autistic. I'd don't like Trump, but if my child was special needs, no way would I throw him out to the media as President. Even if he's not, I still wouldn't put my child to the media.

       Trump moves Pompeo to Secretary of State.

      <p>
       This gives Trump access via Pompeo to CIA's back catalogue of MK Ultra and MK-Naomi experiments.

       Perhaps the feeling was that she needed an extended period of time to be 'conditioned' to be a more dutiful and loyal wife in public. Expect to see her smiling and oddly vacant in a month or so, with people helping her to and from her seat.

       First lady or not, she's still a very wealthy woman who just had a medical procedure. I've seen men and women who are wealthy but not that wealthy, stay in the private cosmetic surgery center for a week after procedures that are done as outpatient surgeries in the hospital. It's almost part of the "culture" of the wealthy. Go in, and emerge a week or two later looking like nothing ever happened.

       A right to privacy is not a right to lie. They are lying to cover up something and now the question is what is the lie about. If it is big enough to lie about it then it needs to be investigated. The MSM is failing us again and even the fringe media won't touch it because of "her privacy". Fuck that. Stop lying.
