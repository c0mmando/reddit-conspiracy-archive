<p>On the 14th, she was hospitalized for what was described as a &quot;routine kidney procedure,&quot; and came home on the 19th. She has not made an appearance since then, and today, when the press asked the president how she was doing, Trump pointed to a window and claimed she was standing there watching...except she wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So...where is she? Did she really have a kidney procedure? Is she sicker with something else, and the White House is hiding it? If so, why? </p>

<p>Yes, she has a right to privacy, but the American people also have a right to know whether the White House is lying about the First Lady&#39;s health.</p>

<p>Same with Melania. Right now, her taking extra time off seems innocent and related to her hospital stay. I say, let her have a little time and give her a break.</p>

<p>However, thinking back on our own experiences, mine having an organ removed and him having a large stone removed, we were out of the hospital within a day or two but were told to rest for two weeks following, with light walking around (to avoid clotting), no exercising, and no lifting anything over 10-15lbs.</p>

<p>Considering her fragile state of healing, she may be a security issue and to keep her within the living quarters for extra time than to risk her being in public and possibly being pushed or tackled.</p>
