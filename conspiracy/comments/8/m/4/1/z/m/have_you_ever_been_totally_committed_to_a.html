       I'm just really curious about if/when/how people sort of fall out with a particular set of ideas, especially since "conspiracy theories" are often denigrated for being unfalsifiable or using lack of evidence as evidence.

       Well that was interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe says the USA, through CIA Project Paperclip, scooped up the Nazi German scientists to build nuclear bombs after World War II (Germany surrendered in 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Manhattan Project was already underway by 1939 via British front company Tube Alloys. Many of the notorious scientists working on the technology were Jews from Germany actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fat Man nuclear bomb was being tested in 1944 by Oppenheimer (family of Jewish descent). Werner von Braun and pals weren't brought to the USA until 1945.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe needs to do some more research on this I think, because he makes it out to seem like the Nazi's came to the USA and built nuclear bombs, but it was primarily Jews working on the high tech nuclear stuff before Germany's surrender.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the dropping of the bombs was highly criticized by everyone. The Jewish scientists who worked on it felt guilty. Could this be why there is a Holocaust story behind this, so that the Jewish scientists behind the devastating act wouldn't be hated for their ignorance while making the nuclear bombs?
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage anyone questioning this to actually research it, you will be surprised by what you find.

       Yeah, but we all have situations where we make a hypothesis about something and then later say "oh, I was wrong" or "maybe I was a little hasty to accept that based on the evidence at hand." I'm talking about that kind of thing.

       I think the level of interesting answer you're looking for would be for a hardcore believer of flat earth, let's say.  Then your question would be better suited asking someone from a religious background who is no longer religious, as what you're asking seems to be more analogous.

       Let me turn this around for you. The process of coming to believe in a conspiracy theory represents exactly what you are talking about - a rejection of a previously held belief in another narrative. Good conspiracy theories do not emerge ab nihilo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to believe the conspiracy theory that 19 crazed Jihadis, under instructions from Osama bin Laden, hijacked four Boeing passenger planes which were then flown into the World Trade Centre Towers and also into the Pentagon. On the balance of the evidence, for and against the official 9/11 Conspiracy Theory, I was clearly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also changed my mind about the greatest, and most ludicrous conspiracy theory of the 20th century. Yes, I once believed the narrative that the German state conspired to exterminate 6 million European Jews by herding them into modified shower rooms, and dropping de-lousing pellets on them. I used to believe that they covered this crime up by implausibly cremating every single one of the bodies in ovens so hot that not even bone fragments survived. 6 million souls just vanished into thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy, right? It's most ridiculous and far-fetched, unevidenced, conspiracy theory ever thought up, and I used to believe it. Boy, was I wrong.

       The most successful false "conspiracy theories" are the ones pushed by governments and the media working in tandem. These narratives are believed due to repetition and psychological manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, because these  "theories" are actually disinfo, they don't stand up well to scrutiny. Scratch the surface of the "homicidal gas chambers" narrative, and you find that what you were taught - what you thought you knew - is not supported by any hard evidence - it's just stories, repeated ad nauseam by the press, television, the movie industry, useful idiot academics, writers and artists, to the extent that the vast majority of people actually believe the stories are real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, many people get really angry when presented with factual information which contradicts a story they are emotionally invested in. In the UK this week, a well known politician,
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44196298">
        Ken Livingstone was forced to resign
       </a>
       because he made the factual observation that the from 1932 until 1939 the Nazis supported the Zionist initiative to help German Jews emigrate to Palestine, the location of the future Jewish state.
      </p>
      <p>
       This collaboration between the Nazis and German Zionists, known as the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">
        Haavara Agreement
       </a>
       resulted in tens of thousands of German Jews emigrating to Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this dirty secret is not part of history which people learn about at school, and the reaction in the UK, pushed by a very dishonest media, is that Livingstone is a bigot,  because the idea that Nazis and Zionists collaborated flies in the face of their (mis)understanding of a very important part of world history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people can't deal with the cognitive dissonance of their worldview being challenged by evidence, or learning that what they thought was fact, was (largely) made up. This sub exists for those people who have learned to question the things they once believed. It's a process, though, and the key is to NOT become fixated on an alternative narrative which may not be the (whole) truth either.

       I used to think media and government were opposing forces. It’s pretty clear after seeing the collusion for so many media fakery hoaxes they are, in fact, just different branches of the same office.

       I flip flop on the Apollo 11 landing about once a year. If you look back at the previous Apollo missions and other orbiters/probes the USA did, it would seem they would have had enough "stock footage/photography" to produce a spectacle like a faked Apollo 11 landing. But that means the astronauts would know, and I'm not sure they'd be able to hold that kind of secret without being severely dosed with LSD or something. But looking at all the false flags and lies that have been floated around by various appendages of government recently, I'd say it's important to keep an open mind about some things, especially those with a little mystery or fishiness to them. Like why are all the moon rock samples missing, and all the original footage. That's like one of the biggest heirlooms of our species, so when they "lose" them it makes you go wtf?

       Every day that passes since Apollo makes it clearer and clearer that no one ever went. Fun fact, NASA is strongly rooted in freemasonry, the god of which is Lucifer. Apollo is mentioned in the Bible as Apollyon, i.e. Apollo, i.e. Lucifer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the astronauts, they give it away every time they speak. Armstrong withdrew into seclusion, Michael Collins wrote a book which contradicts some other items about the missions, and Aldrin is a drunken fool whose very demeanor testified that he never went to space.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we approach the 50 year anniversary it should be obvious to ALL that we never went. I look forward to this milestone to see how it is handled by NASA.

       yes indeed, starting with the post apollo 11 press conference, it is pure admission of guilt since it's written all over their faces... available on the youtubes for those that have missed it haha.... beyond their faces, there is a moment where they can't tell whether the LEM in a picture is upside/down or not, and then they very stressfully answer a journalist that they couldn't see stars from the surface of the moon, contradicting everything we know about the behavior of light, a lie that would have to be carried on for decades until people started forgetting, and now astronauts can say they see stars in space again haha

       I think it's in that video when they were asked if they could see the stars, Armstrong at one point answered, I don't recall. Right afterwards Collins beside him turned to him and cracked a little smile. I knew they were lying.

       Have you watched the post-Apollo 11 press conference? They don't act like people who have triumphantly been to the Moon and back. Armstrong even elbows Collins when he says the wrong thing. Their body language says it all.

       Seen some interviews with Neil where he doesn't act like the guy I'd expect him to - reminiscing on a good past time and monumental mark in history. It's not that I detect humbleness, feels more like secrecy. Something out of place is the vibe I get.

       It's unlikely that you will get any sort of satisfactory answer here, because of how the human brain works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human brain does not like to be told its wrong. There's an enormous amount of study behind the idea that people become wedded to their beliefs--especially if they feel they have 'searched' them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If evidence appears to the contrary of these beliefs, people are likely to *refuse to see it, *alter it to match their beliefs or *only see the part of evidence that -already- matches their belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if someone--anyone--has pursued what they feel is a journey to a 'truth' (in this case a conspiracy theory, but it can be any 'belief/truth'), the chances of them suddenly reversing course is very, very small. It's also why all over the internet, people attempt to point out things (on any subject, on any side) and just get yelled down by those who oppose what is being pointed out.

       Good post. We are all subject to potential biases, but only a few are willing to seriously reflect on this aspect of themselves and attempt to improve their own 'thinking about about thinking'.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most important things I learned to do was source my claims. Find citations. Provide some kind of external corroboration of what I was trying to say. It makes it easier for me to challenge my own beliefs, and encourages others to do the same.
      </p>

       On this sub, however, when I ask people for sources or citations, I tend to get downvoted.

       As for me, I used to believe in the 'creature from jekyll island' story about money and banking. Now I see that story as merely a myth, a lovely cover story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I used to believe that the Russians were responsible for MH17. Now I see that the entire event -- the plane crash itself -- was a gigantic hoax. Nobody died, nobody got hurt. There was no plane.

       Similar to 9/11. I used to believe it was a 'inside job'. Now I see that it too was a gigaatic hoax. Nobody died, nobody got hurt.

       With my amateur knowledge of the situation, they came up with a strategy to get the federal reserve act passed. It was just a different spin on the act that had failed to get passed one or two other times under a different name. Like the icing on the cake, not one meeting where they concoted the entire cake and some grand scheme from nothing.

       Have you even been on a Sandy Hook related thread? Normally there is some guy there that says he had a friend, nephew whatever who was there during the shooting and says the official events are true. I never believe them so I understand if you are skeptical of my anecdotal story. Two neighbors of my cousin were on that plane. They haven't returned from that trip. Can you explain why they disappeared without any trace? In my opinion the downing of MH17 was a false flag.

       Interesting, how does it feel to be on the other end? Does being the voice who knew someone in a mass casualty make you reassess your take on other mass casualty incidents?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I don't understand is in each of these tragedies, there are thousands of professionals involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doctor's pulling bullets and resuscitating trauma victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coroners doing autopsies and writing reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lawyers executing wills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers transferring assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life insurance companies paying out policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accountants doing taxes on these transactions, estate taxes etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       HR reps approving family medical leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to mention law enforcement and government agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are neighbors like yourself, friends, family, coworkers etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       And none of them find any irregularities worse mentioning? You can debate what led up to the events of these mass casualties, maybe the perpetrators, maybe motives, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       But that no one died?

       Thanks for your questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really, I don't reassess my thoughts about other tragedies. If people think/believe nobody died, let them. They are free to do so, I don't feel any anger or the likes towards them but that's my personal stance. Some relatives of alleged victims can behave differently. It did give my some motivation to delve more into the story of MH17.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think that even if people involved with the aftermath found something suspicious, they would need to find an outlet that would give them the opportunity to voice their concerns. That can be tricky with our current media landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a sidenote, I have just received a notice from a moderator of r/The Netherlands that I am banned after posting in a thread regarding MH17 where I asked one of the participants some questions like "why did Australia, Malaysia. Belgium etc sign a non-disclosure agreement".

       I once thought 9/11 was committed by Muslim hi-jackers who outsmarted all major US intelligence agencies and miraculously flew Boeing 747s into 3 buildings at 500mph with pinpoint accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I looked more into it and realized it was an impossible conspiracy theory dreamed up by the deep state to scare us into submission.

       I remember all the fuss about a financial crash on Sept 23 2015. All the evidence stacked up that the system was due to crash and maybe collapse altogether. I fell for it. Even made financial decisions to prepare for it. Of course, nothing happened. The same doom mongers are still crying wolf almost every day and will continue until the day they are actually right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think there will be a crash and maybe even a full reset, but they can probably keep the system propped up for as long as they want to.

       What would the stars be then?

       Flat earth reminds me of simulation/matrix theories. In any of those theories, we could be captive to an advanced race outside our realm of sensing, so it doesn't rule out aliens at all IMO.

       I was convinced Israel did 9/11 and have been the main provocateurs in getting us into Middle Eastern conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought this I guess because I didn't want to believe our own government was that nefarious. I wanted to believe they were dupes rather than agents of war.
      </p>

       Turns out it's not just Israel pulling strings. They're one of many governments hell-bent on endless war.

       Hitler did nothing wrong. When you first find out about Holohoax it's temping to completely flip 180 degrees and sympathize with Germany. However the more complete back story is that Hitler was propped up by US elites and probably Zionists to get the party going and to make Nazi Germany strong. The Havaara agreement shows hitler trying to accommodate the Zionists. So Hitler was a knowing stooge of the bankers. I imagine he didn't see their plan to pull out and support the other side coming.

       Free energy. I was all on board for that, though those videos on YouTube with inventors we're real. Now I'm not so sure, in fact I'm almost convinced. Watching the guy with the uni-brow on YouTube do electric experiments, he wants so badly for it to be real but it is not. Steven Greer badly wants free energy, yet we get nothing.  I believed Tesla could harvest free enrgy but now I am convinced his wardencliffe tower was to be used for transmitting wireless electricity to the masses; something Edison opposed because there was no way to monetize it since it would be projected wirelessly. I believe uni-brow buy on YouTube when he says that all the frequencys are measured and accounted for.

       Got tired of the aliens and disclosure stuff. I don't want to say I disbelieve, I'm just done listening to it. Call when there's disclosure, not soft disclosure or crumbs.

       John Titor story...

       I was never fully convinced but eventually enough evidence came out to convince me it was a hoax.

       Kerry Kassidy.  Listened to her a ton. Again not that i believed all her guests...  Some good science fiction in there though.  It's insane, that lady believes literally everything she is told.

       David Wilcock.  I still read his shit for fun and consider it fiction mixed with reality.  I've never seen anyone be more wrong about disclosure and keep pumping it.

       I think you may over-estimate human rationality but I certainly see your point.

       How is the Creature from Jekyll Island a myth? It seems to be highly respected around here as truth.

       Have you even been on a Sandy Hook related thread? Normally there is some guy there that says he had a friend, nephew whatever who was there during the shooting and says the official events are true. I never believe them so I understand if you are skeptical of my anecdotal story. Two neighbors of my cousin were on that plane. They haven't returned from that trip. Can you explain why they disappeared without any trace? In my opinion the downing of MH17 was a false flag.
