       I've been reading him since I was 8. I fucking love this man as a writer and as a human being generally. But... I also know that you can't be that popular without "high overlords" approving it. I am really split on this matter. It is obvious that Rowling is a puppet of those aforementioned big players but when it comes to King... I don't know man. What do you think or know?

       Ever since I read "it" ....I have thought he is an insider ....witting or not. The opening if I recall....a huge asteroid hits Earth....but it ain't no nice asteroid....it's the IT asteroid....some type of intergalactic ship of terror. I saw a small alien theory about Art Bell, Stephen Greer and some other ufo sci-fi celebs. The theorist theorized that the facial similiarities of these guys were a giveaway of their non-earth-human origin. King has these features also. Look at the original artwork of The Grinch and you'll recognize what the features are

       His face is so goddamn weird, looking at basic google img's tab has got all the markers. It's no coincidence you see a bit of Bowie in him.

       Ahaha, ye it is crazy, I agree. But that doesn't make it any less likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest google some (openly) trans men, so female to male transgenders. It's remarkable what Testosterone does to the female body, and any example you'll find (so openly transgender people) they are late stage transitioners (Post puberty).
      </p>
      <p>
       We can only imagine what a female would look like when transitioning prior/during puberty. Actually, we already do. This is what they look like.

       I was a huge fan of early Stephen King.  I grew up reading his books. Recently though I read an interview and basically he said he has no memory of even writing most of those books, like something else took him over.  Weird.

       I mean, we do.  Check out lists of top authors, there are thousands and thousands of them.  It's all a matter of opinion though.  I'm a huge King fan and love his work, but i also think that Rowling and the Harry Potter stuff is absolute trash.  Millions of other people love it though.

       I just think he's a very good author, and has been doing what he does a long time.  Great imagination, but I don't buy the whatever you're saying, and honestly, you aren't making yourself clear.

       Honestly, I feel like writers have a little more freedom in this sort of thing than, say, a TV show or a movie or something on the news. If you read many books, a lot of big authors say a lot of seriously subversive stuff. Think back to your school years. If the Elite were really worried about authors, do you think we'd have been required to read 1984 or Fahrenheit 451 or anything like that in school (and that required reading as a facet of an educational system that intentionally dumbs the population down)? Books are the most effective delivery system for Ideas, but moving images and flashy entertainment work so much better for Ideology. And it's very clear which one most of us prefer. Nobody wants to read anymore. It's an art in decline, and they know it. It's not the threat it used to be

       One of my favorite conspiracies revolves around him, and it’s rather innocuous. Basically the premise is that Stephen King is just a pen name that a bunch of different authors use/have used to get their books out, and “Stephen King” who goes around doing interviews and stuff is just the face guy. He’s legendary for his ability to just churn out books, and for switching genres, and the conspiracy is that it isn’t one guy, but a group of authors who all agree to use the pen name Stephen King because it’s a guaranteed seller. I think it’s a fun conspiracy.

       Sure you don't write that many horror stories without having a few demons in the closet. Inspirations got to come from somewhere. Bet that dude is fuuucked up.
