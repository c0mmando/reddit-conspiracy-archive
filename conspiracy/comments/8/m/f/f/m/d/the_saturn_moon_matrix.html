        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There’s information on YouTube about something called Saturn Moon Matrix. The theory is that they are using the electromagnetic frequency of Saturn, then amplifying it through the Moon to project a false matrix reality on Earth. What’s interesting is the enormous amount of Saturn symbolism in our society. Many corporate logos include Saturn symbols, especially the ring of Saturn. Even the icon of this subreddit is a blatant depiction of Saturn. Wedding rings are another symbol of the ring of Saturn. Saturday comes from “Saturn’s day.” Saturn is everywhere and it’s keeping us locked in a three-dimensional time grid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read into the <a href="http://www.yahuahreigns.com/saturn%20and%20the%20occult.html">esoteric and occult symbolism of Saturn</a>.</p>

<p>You will also find that in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon">north pole of Saturn there is a hexagon</a> discovered by NASA in the 1980s. </p>

<p>However the hexagon the 6 pointed figure is referred to as the 6 pointed star, recognized today as the symbol for the state of Israel, Star of David. <a href="http://christianitybeliefs.org/end-times-deceptions/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Talisman-Of-Saturn.gif">The Six pointed star is engraved in the Talisman of Saturn</a>. Also this <a href="https://pics.me.me/north-po-saturn-south-pole-hexagram-freemasonry-saturn-is-the-2689919.png">image</a> associates it with freemasonry, especially in the pyramid of the dollar bill which is a free masonic symbol. However what you&#39;re witnessing is a perversion of symbol by followers of Dark Occultism, the Black Sun, The keepers of light. It was originally a symbol of illumination of the union of the sacred <a href="https://drakebearstephen.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/alchemy.jpg">masculine and feminine</a> , [left and right side of the brain](.<a href="https://drakebearstephen.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/alchemy.jpg">https://drakebearstephen.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/alchemy.jpg</a>). Which is why marriage is a symbol of Saturn man and woman together as one. </p>

<p>&quot;Pythagoreans held the hexad--6--to represent, as Clement of Alexandria conceived, the creation of the world according to both the prophets and the ancient Mysteries. It was called by the Pythagoreans the perfection of all the parts. This number was particularly sacred to Orpheus, and also to the Fate, Lachesis, and the Muse, Thalia. It was called the form of forms, the articulation of the universe, and the maker of the soul.Among the Greeks, harmony and the soul were considered to be similar in nature, because all souls are harmonic.

world according to both the prophets and the ancient Mysteries. It was called by the Pythagoreans the perfection of all the parts. This number was particularly sacred to Orpheus, and also to the Fate, Lachesis, and the Muse, Thalia. It was called the form of forms, the articulation of the universe, and the maker of the soul. Among the Greeks, harmony and the soul were considered to be similar in nature, because all souls are harmonic. The hexad is also the symbol of marriage, because it is formed by the union of two triangles, one masculine and the other feminine. Among the keywords given to the hexad are: time, for it is the measure 
of duration; panacea, because health is equilibrium, and the hexad is a balance number; the world, because 
the world, like the hexad, is often seen to consist of contraries by harmony; omnisufficient, because its 
parts are sufficient for totality (3 +2 + 1 = 6); unwearied, because it contains the elements of immortality.&quot; (Manly Palmer Hall Secret Teachings of All Ages.) The number 33 is significant as well not only are there 3rd degrees in freemasonry, and 3 levels, apprentice, fellowcraft, master mason. &quot;The first temple of Solomon stood for 
thirty-three years in its pristine splendor. At the end of that time it was pillaged by the 
Egyptian King Shishak, and finally (588 B.C.) it was completely destroyed by 
Nebuchadnezzar and the people of Jerusalem were led into captivity to Babylon. (See 
General History of Freemasonry, by Robert Macoy.) Also King David ruled for thirty-
three years in Jerusalem; the Masonic Order is divided into thirty-three symbolic degrees; 
there are thirty-three segments in the human spinal column; and Jesus was crucified in the 
thirty-third year of His life.&quot; (Manly P Hall, Secret Teachings of all Ages.) </p>

<p>If you flip 6 upside down you get 9. 3×3=9. It is the number of mam because we need 9 months to be born. Here&#39;s some more <a href="http://www.ridingthebeast.com/numbers/nu9.php">references on 9</a>. I&#39;m just going to stop TMI.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to this that I still don&#39;t know. Do your research see where you end up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.</p>

<p>Random thought:</p>

<p>In Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, the fundamental answer to the question of life is 42.</p>

<p>42 is a multiple of 6, 7 x 6 = 42.</p>

<p>I am reminded of how Eve (the game) finally created their universe using the software they&#39;d developed, which was using the number 42 as a &quot;random&quot; seed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the number 7 represents here, but I&#39;ll be darned if you don&#39;t see that number pop up a lot in mythology.</p>

<p>I am not sure what all of this means, but I couldn&#39;t help but think this while reading the first bit of your post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Live from love, do good things, help others, and go above their Lord/Jesus and ask the God of all existence directly to destroy them and everything connected to this place.</p>

<p>The reason you have to do good is because if you choose evil then you are exactly telling the Big God that you love this pedo system Jesus created.</p>

<p>So by doing good through all this we can at least hope to have some credibility when we ask God to destroy this dumb sick system.</p>

The Proselenes was a society that lived in greece before the arcadia and that means “before the moon”.
