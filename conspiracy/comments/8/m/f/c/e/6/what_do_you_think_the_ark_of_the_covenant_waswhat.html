       -God’s pact with his humanity
-A terrible asteroid that the side who owned the thing could use to inflict radiation poisoning on their foes. 
-A gift from aliens that was an advanced weapon (possibly from an older civilization)
-Something exclusively from myth, used as symbolism.

       That also ties into the theory connecting the ark of the covenant with the great pyramid.  The theory goes that the pyramid was a giant power plant and the ark was the battery or conductor or something.

       Yes, I've heard that!
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of Bible verses about people accidentally touching the ark and "The Power of God" killing them instantly. Well, they were shocked with electricity!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, back in the Bible days, only certain Jewish Priests could go into the room with the Ark. They had to do lots of preparation. The ordinary people tied a rope around the Priest's ankle too. The reason was that that the "Power of God" might strike the Priest dead if he entered unprepared. So the people would just pull the rope and pull the body out, without having to enter the room. Again, makes the electricity thing seem like the answer here.

       The dimensions of the ark are precisely noted in scripture. They are, in fact, the same dimensions of the sarcophagus inside the kings chamber in the great pyramid.

       the word ark comes from the Hebrew word aron, which means a chest, box. Its dimensions are described by the bible as 2.5 cubits by 1.5 cubits by 1.5 cubits (45 inches by 27 inches by 27 inches).  Look up the volume of the kings chamber sarcophagus. It’s exactly the same.

       Its an interesting topic but like everything from that biblical era, there is no hard evidence to prove the claims made in the ancient texts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did my own research into this and read up about a few interesting theories. I decided to ignore the myths and fantasy surrounding it and took a view from the logic of reality. This led me to think that the arc was possibly a container for a radioactive substance. Considering that no radioactive substances were known about at that time, if they discovered one it would be unexplainable. I could imagine people of that era would portray its radioactive effects with elaborate myths and stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the claims about events surrounding the arc can be explained with this theory, and the rest i believe, comes from the imagination of the story tellers of that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a lot of these things, there's no way to know for sure and its unlikely to ever be revealed

       I thought the Ark was confirmed to be found. It is located in Ethiopia. The church there has a keeper of the Ark. That person's has to have unwavering conviction in God to be in it's presence apparently. Even then, it causes their eyes to get cataracts and eventually go blind. They die shortly thereafter. As I understand they are not viewing it to defy gods pact, but rather the Ark is so supreme in its power that over time, even the believers die and return to God. I Can't say much about any non-biblical interpretations of the Ark though.

       I thought this was well established knowledge in all honesty, not necessarily debunked but the thing has a huge following and cultural impact in that part of the world. It's even in the darn wiki for the thing. Of course there are more lurkers in this sub who can't do a Google search for "ark of the covenant Ethiopia" like I did. Conspiracy enthusiasts my butt.

        In the final moments of my search, I could not judge whether the ark of the covenant truly rested inside this nondescript chapel. Perhaps Menelik’s traveling companions did take it and spirit it home to Ethiopia. Perhaps its origins here stem from a tale spun by Aksumite priests in ancient times to awe their congregations and consolidate their authority. But the reality of the ark, like a vision in the moonlight, floated just beyond my grasp, and so the millennia-old mystery remained. As the devotion of the worshipers at Timkat and the monks at Tana Kirkos came back to me in the shimmering light, I decided that simply being in the presence of this eternal mystery was a fitting ending to my quest

       Very inconclusive. There's literally zero proof, only a fee lunatics claiming that one guy might have seen it sometime. lol.

       Dude, I don't know what you're talking about. There was TOTALLY this guy who lived inside of a whale once. Not a fabricated story at all, absolutely 100% happened and isn't just some fairytale told to dipshits 2,000+ years ago that still gets told to this day by other dipshits... 
I'm pretty sure the story is part of this really big book full of all kinds of truths. 
Bable? 
Bibal? 
I forget the name, but I think it's something like that. 
You should really do your Google research before you go off spouting half truths. 
Pfft! Conspiracy people these days, can't even be bothered to look into basics. SMDH

       the literal truth of the Book of Jonah is debatable, belief in it is not required of Christians, and the word "whale" is a mistranslation from the original hebrew.

       He’s probably referencing graham Hancock. There’s actually many sources that have suggested the ark isn’t lost and is in fact in Ethiopia and it would explain some of the cults that have popped up there. As far as the veracity of these claims, hancock couldn’t confirm anything but was himself to surprised at how deep he was able to go he wrote a book about it and switched careers. This is what got him into historical anthropology from his war reporting.

       I read one theory that it was taken from the kings chamber of the great pyramid. Lots of people are saying the ark was some sort of electrical and/or radioactive device, I think the ark was the key reactor or piece that allowed the great pyramid to generate electricity.

       Who says it was a sound producing device that could resonate objects against the earth's magnetic field and levitate stuff?

       That's what I want it to be.  A singing magnet that can overcome gravity.

       I remember seeing something about it being a big power 'generator' -- like a huge battery. People would die if they touched it while it was active.

       I think it was a highly radioactive power source.

       Alterwelt say it was a piece of technology from an ancient high civilization that the Egyptians were storing and that Moses stole it when liberating the Jews. It was radioactive and nobody really knew how to actually use it, but it did kill, so even though not employed for its original intention, it was useful. Alterwelt is a fun read on GLP for anyone who hasn’t done so yet.
