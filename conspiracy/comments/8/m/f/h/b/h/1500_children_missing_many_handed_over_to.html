       copypasta from other thread
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been thinking about this all day. It was barely talked about in this sub. Where the fuck are all the pizzagaters? Yesterday there was two pizzagate posts that hit the top, no mention of ICE losing these kids.  Where is the outrage? This is a fucking crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedogate people don’t care because it’s ICE, Trump’s gestapo.  If Hillary was president and this happened it would be plastered all over this sub and the_donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is complicit too. They’ve talked about it for a little bit, but since they’re attention spans are so fucking tiny, this crime will be forgotten about. I feel like the only reason why they care is because Trump is president.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should be huge, but nope it’s gonna be russia russia russia bull shit, and the right won’t care because they’re “illegals”.

       Its obviously not imediately about paedophilia, but there was also
       <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-dhs-sexual-harassment-abuse-records/">
        this report
       </a>
       revealing thousands of cases of DHS employees sexually abusing immigration detainees between 2010 and 2017. Given Nielsen's rather non-plussed testimony on the issue a few weeks ago, I think its relatively safe to presume that this is not something DHS is taking seriously. Its sad to say, but I wouldn't be shocked to see those numbers go up over the next seven year period.

       Not the molestation part.but everything else.im not saying I condone it but it's a risk factor that should be known.Being soft on illegal immigration only increases it.At some point it has to stop.

       You are correct. And to the people asking "where are the pizzagateers", I see plenty of people bringing attention to the issue. Why do they need our help all of a sudden when we've been getting laughed at for the last 2 years?

       Because that was a fake and ridiculous thing, and this is a real and tragic thing. Forget left/right for a moment—as a society, we should prioritize the abuse of real children over the abuse of fictional children.

       It's not about help as much as it is about their absence being proof that it was more political than about actual missing kids.

       When people are still screaming about pizzagate on a daily basis but choose this particular news as their moment of silence, it says something about those people.

       Who's looking into it? The same people who falsely accused that dude during the Boston bombings or the people who showed up with loaded guns in a restaurant? No one on the internet who knows what they're doing is looking into it or they would've been employed and getting paid to look into it. Take your bullshit elsewhere. Almost 1500 kids are missing. This isn't a conspiracy. They're actually missing.

       Dude, you realize many "conspiracy theories" have turned out to be true, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       This, in itself, was a conspiracy theory, that nobody noticed or theorized about until it was already evident in the public domain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Pizzagate evolved out of Pedogate, which is basically pizzagate minus the retarded stuff about the pizza parlor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really find it difficult to believe that powerful people would abuse their power in that way, if they wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing where people are trying to turn conspiracies into a political subject, where it's left vs right is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the ones in power who are manipulating it all, and turning us against each other on a massive scale. Meanwhile, they release more and more things for people to argue about, in order to prevent any group of people from actually gathering up enough outrage about any singular issue to cause some real change.

       Then send the kids back too. There's no reason for these kids not to get sent back with their parents. The fact that you're even remotely defending this crap is absolutely disgusting. There is no reason for this to happen. At all.

       You're not getting what the outrage is about. The fact that they're separating those kids from their parents is absolutely disgusting and yes, if you're a terrible person without a soul, I guess that that's the risk that comes with this crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about the fact that they're missing. These kids are gone. No one knows what happened to these kids. Did they bring them to kill shelters? Are they testing Soylent Green? Absolutely ridiculous options, but they might as well be real because no one knows where these almost 1500 kids went.

       The risk of the crime is having your child taken from you. That's not the case here. The issue is that they were taken. It's that the children are gone. Dissappeared. You don't get to do that, doesn't matter what crime their parents committed. The children must be put in the system, not vanished.

      <p>
       My point was that, despite if anyone thinks that losing your kids is an appropriate punishment for trying to seek a better life for you and your kids, it came with the idea that your kids would end up in the, already really terrible, system. They wouldn't just vanish off the face of the earth.

       The comments I saw from many of the r/conspiracy regulars in the original post demonstrates many of the pizzagaters are more interested in supporting Trump - and therefore ICE - than pursuing truth wherever it may lead.  Yes, illegal immigrants are criminals by definition, but the discussion shouldn't stop there.  Even if you support a more secure border, if you truly believe pedophilic conspiracies, you should be clamoring to find out what happened to 1500 missing children.

       You have complicit members inside and out. That is why Trump is asking for a reform on the law that separates children - he knows full well that there are bad actors in the government who are aiding and abetting these gangs and black markets. Hence - 'drain the swamp'. Are you still with me?

       Misrepresentations are common from all sides on this issue and the truth is, as usual, multifaceted.  The ACLU represents ICE as being culpable, when from what I can tell it is the Border protection agents interviewing and processing asylum seekers who temporarily separate families when they can't accertain whether adults traveling with children are relatives.  Followed by the Department of Health and Human Services section working with refugees who place unaccompanied children with sponsors apparently without adequate vetting or follow-up, (which has resulted in at least one instance where 8 children were released to human traffickers who, instead of enrolling the children into school, forced them to work on an egg farm).  This is, in my opinion, most likely due not to a malicious conspiracy but rather an overwhelmed agency with more responsibility than personnel and resources.

       I was speaking specifically to comments made in the original thread which effectively stated, "They're illegals; it's their fault; who cares." from a few of the more outspoken pizzagate believers.

       I think we have to be careful about applying the words of a few to any group of people. Can you be sure those people truly represent whatever 'pizzagate believers' means? and why would you think that those who believe that children are trafficked for ritualized abuse/murder might be fighting against the idea of Border patrol being a source of children to traffic? They are pushing the same direction; that's why I showed you the tweets of Trump and others in support of what you say.

       It's not.  But this old story is being conflated with the ACLU's more recent claims/lawsuit that ICE is separating families as an immigration deterrent, which paints border protection efforts as both inhumane and incompetent.

       The CIA trafficks drugs, weapons, money, and humans, especially children for sex.  This is why Trump wants to build the wall.  He wants to stop the CIA's criminal activities.

       Yes, 1500 children missing is a huge problem, but I hear that over 500,000 go missing each year.  The FBI does not break this down by age group, but they should.  I also hear that about 100,000 children are used in Satanic rituals each year.

       It IS true though. If we were talking about the numbers left missing after the ones were found, that'd be one thing. But the 100k number means nothing other than reports when 99% of those are recovered

       The very same FBI report that you're sourcing for the 100k number. I actually read it because I was so shocked about the 100k number, then found out it's BS because 99% of those are found. 1k is still a lot though, and a discussion should be had.

       That's a fair question, but then why tout the 100k number that's directly from their studies as if it were accurate?

       I suppose the 100k number is better than the 500,000+ number.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not change the fact that the FBI does not break the number down by age group.  That is very strange, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, you keep ignoring my question, so I will ask again.

      <p>
       Have you watched Conspiracy of Silence on youtube?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you refuse to answer this question tells me that you have not watched it, so you are not informed.  You do not know how all of this works, and you do not know the true nature of the FBI and law enforcement.  I hope that the FBI, CIA, and law enforcement are changing now that Trump is President.  Previously, these agencies were involved in committing the crimes they are tasked to investigate.  That is a conflict of interest. Why would the FBI investigate itself for trafficking children? Why would the FBI investigate the CIA for trafficking children.  You have not watched Conspiracy of Silence, so you do not understand what I mean.

       No I haven't watched it. I think the 100k number is bogus and I explained why in the other comment. It's more like 1k or less. Still bad, but there's no reason for these nonsense inflated numbers that couldn't possibly make sense and drive people away from thinking about this subject. 1% of America's children do not disappear every 10 years.

       Ted Gunderson discusses this extensively.  There are other sources, but Gunderson is a good one since he was involved with the McMartin Preschool case.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Video Lecture by Ted L. Gunderson
Recorded  on July 7, 1999, Garden Grove, California
       <a href="http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml">
        http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This video was recorded at the first lecture I ever attended by Ted Gunderson on July 7, 1999 at the Freedom Forum in Garden Grove, California. At the time, I wasn't aware of the extent and pervasiveness of satanic ritual abuse among powerfully connected, wealthy, and prominent individuals in this country and the incredible number of children that are snatched from American streets and never heard from again.
       <strong>
        In Phil Schneider's last video lecture (1995), Phil alluded to the fact that over 700,000 kids are reported missing every year and never found again. The actual figure is closer to one million missing American children that go unaccounted for every year. Ted points out that the FBI maintains all kinds of statistics on stolen cars, but steadfastly refuses to list missing children in their statistics (does that tell you anything?).
       </strong>
       The voluminous documentation and testimonies of victims described in The Franklin Coverup, by attorney John De Camp (Nebraska), leave no question that the FBI themselves are a major player in the coverup of missing and abused young children by prominent politicians and powerful  individuals in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted Gunderson retired from the FBI  in 1979 with honors after 29 years of lauded service. He had risen to the position of Special Agent in Charge and at the time of his retirement and had under his command over 700 FBI agents in the greater Los Angeles area. He became exposed to the world of satanic abuse after retiring and becoming a private investigator. He became interested in the mysterious case, featured on Unsolved Mysteries, of  Dr. Jeffrey McDonald, a Fort Bragg Army physician who was accused and convicted of murdering his wife and three young children in a viscious bloodbath that took place at his home in the early 1970's. The murder scene included satanic symbols scrawled everywhere with the victims' blood. He was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. Ted discovered irrefutable proof, including the confession of one of the satanic cult members who were, in fact, responsible for the murders, that McDonald was innocent and was being framed for the murders to cover up the trail of investigation that would have eventually led to McDonald's discovery of evidence at the hospital where he worked, that drugs were being shipped inside body bags and body cavities from Vietnam along with a huge CIA drug distrbution operation out of Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
      </p>
      <p>
       This lecture includes a short video segment that Ted obtained from the FBI of an actual satanic blood ritual. Satanic activity is endemic and very widespread in this country and needs to be exposed and stopped. This information is sobering and should not be viewed by children."

       If 100k children disappeared a year, then almost everyone would know someone who had their child disappear over the course of a 70 year lifetime. But I know no one who has had a child disappear, and I would wager most people don't either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your allegation means every 10 years, 1 million people disappear without a trace, that's .3% of the population of the US and like 1% all children. That's ridiculous. These huge numbers simply don't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can believe there is child trafficking for awful purposes, however I don't believe in these insanely inflated numbers you're throwing around.

       If you don't believe those numbers, then that is fine.  That is on you.

       It is actually 500,000+ in the U.S. alone.  I have heard that it is 7M+ worldwide each year.

       BS. The pizzag8t people have known about this for a couple of years. It's not news to us. As for your comment that don't care about brown babies it's toatal BS. Haiti, Syria, Africa, we have been yelling that thay take these kids when crisis hits a country. Very easy to conceal missing children when the parents are dead. We've known for a long time they are targeting non white babies.  You just didn't listen.

       It's all over the whole pizzag8t story. Do you not recall DJT referring to the children of Haiti with HRC?  You didn't think they were getting white American kids did you? Those are hard to comeby without heat being on you. 500 missing African American girls in DC.  Laura Silsby 
 children in Haiti. I will try and find specifics to link you to, but it's been awhile since I read about the children. I mostly try and keep it on the front burner for prosecution and revealing wat's happening. You can only read about the heartbreaaking part of it for so long without doing mental damage to yourself.

       Are there 1500 kids missing? The poster didn't tell us what we are talking about. The 1500 hundred kids missing that I found on Google are found for the most part.

       Do you think this a ring?

       I'm really upset Mr. Why are you saying people don't care about something they obviously care about? Its just that we don't have anything except your word? Are there 1500 children missing? The news I googled says that what I think you are talking about is not true.

       Cabal uses ms13 as their enforcers. They’ve kidnapped 1500 kids from recent groups of illegals to arrive in us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, this isn’t new - it’s been our policy to separate kids from their parents at the border, and it could be years before they reconnect. Sometimes the kids disappear into the system. This is likely one of the cabals many sources of kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the media is actually talking about this 1500 missing kids, and leftists are trying to somehow blame Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile GEOTUS just tweeted that it’s been a long standing problem and we must change the law that makes us split up families.

       Yes. the fact that children come into our country, brown children, then disappear is part of pizag8t. We've known this for a long time. M13 is part of human trafficing.  It's not new to the Trump administration. It's been happening for a while.  Just because news suddenly does a story and twists it to smear Trump, people are suddenly up in arms. Research about this in the Obama years. How many children  did he allow to come into our country alone?  They were then just handed off to other immigrants that were not related in many instances.  Google this and check the dates. "unaccompanied minors immigration crisis"

       Dudette. lol. Sorry. I get upset when it comes to this subject. We've been doing jumping jacks trying to get the attention of main stream America over these missing children. They're being taken from our system and other countries. Most of them brown. Missing immigrant unacompanied minors and children in the DHS system.  This is not new. It's been happening for years if you look into it. There needs to be public outcry. Please do make all the noise you want, but don't blame Trump, because he's trying to stop all this. Look at the arrests and the EO for human trafficking. Look at past POTUS on the same issue.

       Please. Do you have any idea how many pedos are at the top?  It would be impossible not to have contact with them.  Trump is aware of what's happening with elite pedos.  He's disgusted like the rest of us. Instead of joining their club, he's fighting to have them prosecuted. WJC 26 times on Epstein's plane. The guy from the tower meeting? The one that tried to set up Trump?  Yes, I'm sure they're great friends. Get real. If any of you cared you'd have joined the fight long ago. You just want to Trump bash.

       I can't believe someone can get so far gone they can read these stories about 1500 children going missing under Trump's watch using policies that he signed off on and come out thinking "he's trying to stop this." Seek professional help or something lady because you're fucking bonkers.

       Maybe because theres no suspicious photos from well connected individuals, no relationships  to connect and investigate, and most of all, not a single document from ICE agents talking about spending "$65,000 on pizza and hotdogs" where they hope to have the same "waitresses." Which was eerily quoted in the leaked email.

       And oh please, we give a Fuck, in this case ICE as an organization can be resolved with reform and implementation... strange government Code language, disgusting photo evidence from James alefantis' instagram, the podestas "art" collection... Evidence like that needs to be examined and brought into light.
But the media painted it with a broad stroke that it was just Hillary in a pizzeria basement diddling kids to discredit it.

       Look, I don’t believe in pizzagate because there’s no fucking proof(yet). You people have never posted solid proof, it’s allllll speculation. Yes, we have had pedo politicians in our government because there were VICTIMS. 
 But 1500 missing children isn’t enough to have mega threads about? Why doesn’t 4chan find these kids?  Oh and yes if you support ice you deserve to be shit talked, that’s my opinion. I said autistic because I remember those threads during the Wikileaks that would read “AUTISTS get in here!!!”

       Look, I don't care if you believe it or not, it's started with suspicious emails, all of which are verified official government email and expanded with more and more shreds of evidence that those in power were taking advantage of refugees and orphanages like in Haiti. 
At this point, our presidents veracity at taking down child traffickers is giving me more hope for the world.

       What's the mega thread on 4chan going to do? What are they going to investigate? 
These are undocumented people, when they get deported, not every single person can be tracked to make sure they're living free. 
Where's the evidence that they're being trafficked? There's no photos, no digging able to be done on 4chan/8chan, you're backing the conceptually wrong horse here to be frank.

       Nobody is arguing that the US should not have an immigration or customs enforcement branch. There is no getting through to you, but people reading might be misled by your words.
      </p>
      <p>
       The missing kids were not deported. Any reasonable person would agree that once the kids were placed back in the custody of the foreign government that the US government no longer has responsibility for them. What your cult-like devotion seems to have prevented you from groking is that the US government took custody of these children from their parents, and then lost them. Like they have no fucking clue where they went and can't explain it to us. They don't have a receipt telling us they were deported, then they wouldn't be lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this exposes is a clear disregard for the health and safety of children. And for a crowd that yelled about a conspiracy against children that has not yet been proven, any reasonable person is going to see that such people have only selective partisan outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what random people on the internet should do about it, but this was a failure of the US government to protect children that it had taken into its custody and then lost track of. This had not happened in the past. If they were deported, they should be able to show that is what happened. Otherwise we have no idea what happened, and we don't know if they were trafficked or not. It is a legitimate concern, and it is super gross of you to demand we prove they weren't before we can raise the possibility. It shows you don't really give a shit about kids.

       That guy literally said he wanted to abolish ICE... It really showed how shallow his knowledge on the topic was for them to assume all ICE does is round up ilegals. So your wrong, not "nobody."
      </p>
      <p>
       So "they have no clue where they went" and you're assuming they're being trafficked??? what a conspiracy theory! The Washington post says they "could" be, that sounds like speculation. 
They also said "From last October to the end of the year, officials at the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement tried to reach 7,635 children and their sponsors, Mr. Wagner testified. From these calls, officials learned that 6,075 children remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight had run away, five had been removed from the United States and 52 had relocated to live with a nonsponsor."
So what if the sponsor moved or changed their phone number? Or what if they tried to cross the border again and made it?

      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't assume shit. I said it was a legitimate concern. There a million "what ifs" that could have resulted in them being lost. Given that they are exactly the kind of kids that are easily trafficked, for you to say my concern is on par with believing a "conspiracy theory" (on a conspiracy forum no less!) means only that again you've demonstrated you don't give a shit about kids. Defending your alpha daddy is more important to you than finding out the truth.
      </p>

       Until we track down what happened, you writing off legitimate concerns about the unknown fate of the kids is still super gross, and you still don't give a shit about them.

       No one said that. What they are saying is you are more concerned with the reactions of Trump supporters and what conspiracy theory related news article garner the most attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       They (we) find it humorous that instead of focusing on getting to the truth you would rather focus on how Trump supporters got amped up over pizzagate and created evidence in an attempt to justify what they already believed (instead of being critically thinking, focusing on the evidence, and not jumping to conclusions.) You point out the confirmation bias with pizzagate, which is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we find funny is how you make these statements about confirmation during the pizzagate scandal, especially within thedonald community while ignoring the confirmation bias that you are presenting at this very moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have very little evidence to support your statements (some of which have already been critically analyzed and debunked by other users.) You care about the facts (and the kids) just as much as thedonald users during pizzagate. You are using this information solely to attack what you feel is unfair media bias. Your confirmation bias is one thing. (It's commonplace within the conspiracy community) what is annoying and funny is how hypocritical you are about it and even more importantly is how high of a horse you ride. You are so much more intelligent and critically thinking than thedonald users, while making the exact same logical mistakes they do.

       [The new policy has seen about 700 children separated from their parents since October, and the problem is only getting worse. A HuffPost report shows that the O.R.R. is already struggling with the number of refugees in its custody, and has struggled to keep track of where many of them have been placed. The office has already lost about 1,500 children, a Health and Human Services official revealed last month:
      </p>
      <p>
       Until recently, families that illegally crossed together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But as of this month, the Trump administration is following a blanket policy of referring for prosecution all people who cross illegally. The change means that authorities send parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Services and their children wind up in the same agency as minors who came to the U.S. without their parents ― sometimes without their parents being able to locate them.](

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I want to be clear. DHS does not have a blanket policy on separating families as a deterrent," said Thomas Homan, deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "There is no new policy. This has always been the policy. But you will see more prosecutions because of the commitment to zero tolerance" of illegal border entries."

       Zero tolerance is their idea hence the large numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that has nothing to do with what happens to the children does it? Children get separated from parents all the time. The problem is not Trump, its with the people who are meant to be looking after the kids.

       you are talking out of both sides of your mouth and confusing the language here... the zero tolerance stuff was Trump's policy, but they've always had the right to remove children from parents once they are in custody. The zero tolerance is making them use these tactics
       <strong>
        that were already in place
       </strong>
       more often than usual, but as quoted by the NBC source (which is no better or worse than Vanity Fair) these are not new things that were put into the conduct code by Trump.

       Your link seems to be about unaccompanied minors.

       The discussion in this thread is largely about accompanied minors that are separated from their parents
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       their arrest.

       The link states that the 1400+ "missing" minors were determined to be missing after the government began attempting to find the minors placed in the care of HHS AFTER the initial eight returned to the traffickers.   The information you are asking is included in the report/link provided.  The 1400+ missing minors has ZERO to do with TRUMP.

       Just because they lose track of someone doesn't mean they're being trafficked. Kids run away from foster homes at other places they put them all the time. I'm not saying bad things don't happen. But it would be stupid to attribute all 1500 to sex trafficking or anything like that.

       I don’t think anyone is saying all of those missing kids are being trafficked...I’m hoping that there’s a good number that managed to get out of the system and back with family members, and they don’t want to report it for fear they get taken away again. Unrealistic, I’m sure, but I do hope that’s the case for some of these kids

       I think they are saying that people that care about child trafficking don't care about this particular story because the children were from Mexico? Or, because the report came in under President Trump? But I think, in reality, people aren't in an uproar because it doesn't look like kids were trafficked. The runaway children are a huge concern.

       Because it should not be enough to claim that children are being handed over to traffickers to get everyone to run after that story like a dog after a squirrel. Pizzagate has a lot of evidence behind it. It is not just a random claim based on a vage statistic.

       Let me know what you think, I have spent a lot of time and taken some risk on this.  To write about people like frodsham you take two risks, he's obviously connected to a network powerful enough to shut down a wider investigation, and you come under scrutiny for someone who might have been part of their network trying to see if you are in danger of prosecution yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent investiagion can be dicey but if I see evidence of child t rafficking and/or abuse I'm not going to shut up about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is evidence for child trafficking and abuse.   Lori Handrahan, also key information.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are out here, but it's very difficult getting this message amplified as there is so much negativity and chaos around the pgate topic, it's sometimes difficult for the best evidence to get through the noise.

       See my other comment and read the article, but David McKay was in charge of investigating foster parents for background checks and in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       A young girl Devani was boiled alive.  The foster mother who filled a rubbermaid with boiling water, placed a 4(i think) year old girl in it then ddidn't call the ambulance for 5 hours.   Samantha Osteras was known by her entire family to have serious mental issues and investigators were told this, yet still given a child who was coming from yet another abuser's house, David Frodsham.

       David Frodsham was another person who had been reported to be unfit for foster parenting and no investigation by David McKay was done.  The newspaper says he worked at the local military base, but he was actually an officer in charge of computer networks and at least one other soldier at the base was arrested for some wierd parties where young children were being offered like party favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       David McKay, who ignored all the signs of this abuse, is now head of the entire Arizona child safety division after a full reorganization and there is absolutely no oversight by any government or any newspaper and this entire Devani/Osteras/Frodsham evente is being erased like it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet I post on reddit and steemit, no views, no interest, then this 1500 missing children thing, and I'm like, this is all connected, ICE is the same type of system, no oversight and the huge state of arizona in which for kids to disappear forever.

       Correct. And yeah if I remember correctly Obama signed off on it but it passed with bipartisan support and co-authored by both parties so the onus is on the individual who decided to carry it out, which was Trump and Sessions.

       I cannot believe I was once a Trump supporter. While I myself share some concern over the concepts of mass migration and illegal immigration under the current political climate, if I knew shit was gonna get this fucking bad I would've never supported him. I was skeptical of him when I saw him speak negatively of Snowden, then pulling out of the Iran deal and then going back on his promise to end Syrian intervention. I thought this guy was the fucking guy, the one to drain the swamp (I am cringing right now just typing that phrase), but no. Anti-corruption campaigns, existing power and wealth, this is the kind of shit Putin did to gain power (and now Mohammad Bin Salman and Xi Jinping), Trump even went as far as complementing Xi Jinping for his decision to end term limits in China. When the lefties were saying he was like a dictator, they weren't fucking kidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't believe Trump is going to become one, even with a full two terms, however there are six more years and a lot of unexpected shit has happened in just two. So we'll have to see how shit unfolds, I dread the day we reach 2024.

       THIS was the eye opener before the election that should have woke everyone. The Iran deal was a thorn in the side of the establishment Republican PNAC plan to attack most Middle East nations. Donald Trump literally told us that he would bring back PNAC and, thanks to a flood of LARPers into r/conspiracy, people were fooled.

       A few theories:

      <p>
       1) Pizzagaters don't actually care about missing kids and only claim to be outraged because of political reasons
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Pizzagaters DO care about kids, but only white / American / legal kids (so they don't REALLY care about kids in general, just a subset of kids)

      <p>
       3) Pizzagaters think illegal kids deserve whatever they get (so again, they don't REALLY care about kids)

       We kinda already figured this was going on. It's horrible and totally needs to stop. Laws protecting the welfare need to be in place with proper oversight to make sure things don't get fucky.

       Interesting possibilities.

      <p>
       I have asked this question several times on this sub:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people CHOOSE to focus their attention on pedo stories?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't help the victims. It doesn't stop anything.

       How do you figure it is Trump's gestapo?  Hasn't the ICE been "losing" children for a long time?  Did you just become aware of this problem?  The pizzagaters know it has been going on for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these government agencies have been infiltrated by New World globalists.  At the top, these people tend to be Satanists and Luciferians.  Some of their rituals involve sex with children, ritually sacrificing them, and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say it should be huge, but what about the other 500,000+ children that go missing each year in America?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia banned the adoption of Russian children in the U.S. Because the children were being abused.  There is a video of Putin calling out the Satanists who rule the West.   You are aware of this, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the reason behind the r/greatawakening sub.   It is to make more people aware of the "rulers and authorities".  They have been doing these things for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of times, the traffickers are MS-13, who Trump called animals.  Trump called out MS-13 in his State of the Union address.  MS-13 does the dirty work for the CIA, FBI, and others.
      </p>

       Have you been reading Trump's Executive Orders?

       It is what is known as doing research and being informed.  To you, it looks different.  I will assume it is because you have not done research and you are not informed.

       Let me ask you this.  Have you read the Executive Orders that Trump has signed?  I think you have not.  When did Trump declare a National Emergency?

       This is my fourth username. Why? Because the rest are banned for talking about pizzagate! Of course no one is speaking up, you censored us all, you pedophile mod fucks! We all screamed this and no one took our side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silence means you took mods side. Silence means compliance. Thank yourselves for running the pizzagate truthers to other platforms or for silencing them altogether. I've been banned here, news, politics, washington sub, california sub, twitter, Facebook.
      </p>

       The only place where it's been fine to discuss pizzagate is on voat, sometimes the chans, and with the Q people. That's it. Everywhere else? NOPE. SHADOW BAN!

       You say Pizzagaters won't care because they're illegals, yet the main focus has been about foreign children. So you're wrong there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask where is the outrage? Where are the Pizzagaters? They've been outraged about this stuff for the past two years. The fact you criticize them now suggests you've probably been mocking them all that time, now you have the nerve to accuse them of not caring? Fuck you.

       Yes it did. These children came into America between 2010 and 2017. It was only when Trump’s HHS attempted to locate them, presumably for the first time since then, that they realized they were unaccounted for.

       It shouldnt be any harder than to catch them, then ship them on a bus back across the border. No hearings, no amnesty, no privilages. They KNOW the rules but count on sympathizers to break the laws to justify their want to be here illegally. Capture----bus----gone. Simple. Build the damn wall. Make them go to choke points for entry and scoop them up as they come. Fast, efficient, and nobody's kid goes missing.... Win, win, win.

       If they have a ladder to go over a 30' wall then they can try. If they have a shovel and can dig under ground 30 feet, they can try. We will have air survelience and ground sensors also. Part of the wall being built will also be a roadway for our border patrols to have immediate access to areas only obtainable by trails now.

       i hear you, but most illegals got here legally, that means the idea of most of them running across the border isn't the majority. And the majority isn't even mexican anymore, and when has a wall kept anyone out of anywhere? They're like promises... meant to be climbed over. If we really wanted less illegals we need to look at the data and what makes sense statistically.

       "Most got here legally" is a poor argument at best. It just shows agency incompetance and dos not justify building a deterrant to keep more from walking in. I spent many hours with the minuteman project in Arizona years ago, and the hundreds we spotted crossing nightly were not visa packing schoolkids. They were dope mules mostly. We could do nothing but report locations and number of peoples. Could not even let them know we were there. Buerocracy bullshit. Completely undermanned border security and the democrats refused to add funding for more agents. Building the wall crewtes less demand for agents.

       It certainly didn't keep them out, but it did slow them down. Even f we did build a wall across the entire border, the point still stands that most illegals don't cross here through the border.

       People who claim this have never seen the border or people crossing it.... I have. I have watched it for months. Cartells ship drugs daily, whole caravans on foot across the border. All of central and south american illegals walk across the. Border. All mexican illegals alk across the border. How can you or anyone claim another way is used more often to get them across?  By air takes passports. Same by boat. And if you say they are coming by small boats and small planes in the numbers we incur, you are just plain nuts. They come on foot.

       It doesnt assume anything. What is does do is to state that all crossers coming in outside of established entry areas are up to no good and doing so illegally. Build the wall. Make it as impossible as e can to deter illegal crossings and the crimes that come with them.

       Never cared to be a popular person anyway. People need to do some real research on how allowing illegal immigration ruins a society. Its like they are brainwashed or something. Immigration is needed, but in limited numbers and it needs vetted from underireable types. People need to wake up long enough to do more than throw down votes at something that they deem as not being politically correct.

       All I got was the headline. I don't think children should be separated from their parents. They should all be sent back. I would like to know what the reasoning is behind it. I would like to hear from the parents. They should have recourse through the legal system. If any child was taken from their parents and not returned that should be treated as kidnapping and the individuals involved treated as kidnappers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parents should go to their embassy in Mexico and seek assistance there.

       It is still dumb to attack pizzagate people over this. You have not made your case. Pizzagate did not start with one article about an allegation. This is still nowhere near the level of pizzagate.

       There will be public outcry because Democrats are trying to pin this on Trump. This is not a new policy, missing children is not a new occurrence. Trump has now tweeted about it stating this and that he wants it to stop.  He knows what they're trying to do. The issue is with the corrupt services that are entrusted to look after the children.

       Kind of seems to me like this story is overblown.  The kids aren't necessarily missing, federal DHS just has no record of their whereabouts.  When UACs are placed with sponsors, though, they cease to be wards of the federal government.  It seems to me it would be the responsibility of the state governments at that point.  Why are we surprised that the federal government isn't keeping track of the whereabouts of children no longer in their care?  Maybe the argument is they should be in the federal government's care longer, but I don't really hear anyone making that argument.  Just freaking out about this story like the federal government dropped 1400 kids off at soccer practice and forgot to pick them up or something. 
As for the human trafficking thing, uh I'm pretty sure there's nothing at all that indicates that is occuring.

       I only heard about it because I found a pretty random link to a random un-credible article about devani.
      </p>
      <p>
       A young girl boiled alive by a woman who should never have been a foster parent as her brother reported her as someone who had mental issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a young girl was taken from a known abuser who went to prison, given to an insane woman, boiled to death in a rubbermaid bin, and the insane woman is not arrested for several days, and when she goes to prison is let out after a few weeks due to intense beatings at the hands of the other inmates.    So you kill a child under your care by inexplicably boiling them alive then not calling the ambulance for 5 hours?   I think she served 2 months in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just what got me looking at the story, it gets worse, and worse and worse, and the 1500 missing kids through immigration is partially in this same area.  It is systemic.  Someone in the system is profiting off the sale of the kids from the system to the black market.  Only answer to fit these facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the press at AZCentral or whatever is barely capable of correctly reporting a high school soccer game.  I called Mary Jo Pitzl on the phone and it was like talking with a bag of rocks.  They got a 3 year grant to investigate, not a single proper question got asked and instead all these fluff human interest stories come out that doesn't even mention devani.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the guy who was supposed to be investigating peoples background to see if they are appropriate foster parents?  The one who heard the brother warn that this woman was crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the head of the child services department, David McKay.

       Exactly.   If people were really concerned about the children and their safety, they wouldn't be calling for gun control but demanding action against the sex trafficking industry.   Last thing i read was they estimate around 100k children a year are abducted and trafficked.

       it’s sad that many americans see mexicans as some kind of enemy. the people coming over here illegally are just trying their best to survive. if i were stuck in a dangerous country like theirs i would do the same. instead of treating our neighbors like animals, why are we not helping them?

       Two things are important to keep in mind here.  Immigration reform to allow more people in while keeping things safe for both parties is better than turning a blind eye to illegal immigration. Second, an exodus from a problematic situation makes things exponentially harder for those left behind to improve their situation.

       Also, we need to know who is in our country and what their background is. That's a main part of immigration. I have a driver's license, a social security number and a paper trail for my whole life. Now when you bring in millions who have none of that, how do we know where we really need to allocate our resources? How do we know what areas are really populated vs over populated and we need to expand. A lot of it is infrastructure, logistics, and a big element is criminal records. I'm a felon and am well aware I'm not allowed in some countries, but I get it.

       Because "helping our neighbor" means that TPTB have to give up a portion of their wealth to fix the economic problems they created. Its more beneficial to them to create division between neighbors, and drum up an army of blind, loyal, nationalistic that will continue to suck on the tit.
      </p>

       Oh by the way, guess who is helping our neighbors? Countries like China. While we are too busy dragging families out of their homes, China is investing

       This is actually just a gross misuse/misunderstanding of numbers resulting from multiple completely different variables . The government does track the children via “Alien” numbers paired with the adult they crossed with, and they’re given due process, just like every adult, to go through the immigration court system.  What all these posts, and the article, fail to actually address is WHY the location is unknown: the family members they go live with...move. Either to a different address when their “sponsors” move, or they want to stop sleeping in living rooms and get an apartment of their own once they find work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they move to a different apartment number, even in the same complex, and don’t submit an EOIR-33 form with the nearest immigration court in a mailed letter...poof...their location is officially unknown.  Think of how many times these families move, it’s a ton.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a whole lot less sinister in reality isn’t it? These articles are nothing more than sensationalizing political propaganda.

       You’re incorrect. Misdemeanors can spend up to one year in jail; during that time a child’s would go to...you guessed it, closest willing family member or CPS.

       So fake kids or fake abuse from ICE? What exactly is fake here? One kid that we know of getting abused is one too many. The one thing I don't agree with though, is that I don't believe there's a higher up orchestrating this. Sadly, I think it's just ice abusing power. Maybe one day we will find some mass grave and shovels or bull dosers in the desert

       SS:  In 2015 Sen. Rob Portman of the US Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations for the Oversight of the HHS and DHS learned of eight Guatemalan children, unaccompanied alien children, that crossed our border illegally via traffickers their parents had paid.  These children were given over to the HHS department for supervision; however the HHS returned these children back to the traffickers.  After meetings and testimonies and circle jerks, calls were made and it was determined in 2016 that no one knows where over 1,400 unaccompanied illegal children were placed by the HHS.
      </p>
      <p>
       This issue did NOT originate under the Trump administration.  The beginning of this investigation began under Obama.  I am sure the issue began a longggg time ago.  It has been those under the Trump administration that has attempted to locate those children placed under Obama's watch.

       Yeah. First the government rips these kids from their parents for bullshit"reasons" and deport their parents separately. Now they've "lost" this many of them and just throw their hands up and say "Oh well!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, every year we have a lot of kids go missing from our foster care system as well. And they're legally not required to report them as missing. Because "protecting the kids information" or some bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So our government is really good at losing children when it suits them.

       Do we know they've been given to traffickers? I saw that as speculation, but I wold like to see why people are saying that. I read in a Washington Post article that many of the kids may be in the custody of family members that are not communicating with the government for immigration reasons.

       I am posting these links here because a lot of people commenting have no idea about what is going on.  1500 missing children is a tragedy, and it needs to be resolved, but there are over 500,000+ children reported missing in the U.S. alone.  I hear there are over 7M reported missing worldwide each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not researched the leadership of the ICE, and the changes that have been made since Trump came into office.  I suspect that the ICE was infiltrated by New World Order globalists, who tend to be Satanists and Luciferians.  They like to use children for sex and certain rituals, so I suspect that is what happened to these children.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP asks where is the public outcry.  That is a great question.  Why is the real story behind the missing 1500 children not being reported by the MSM?  Why have the stories below been quashed by the media and law enforcement?

       Most people don't realize this but most missing people in this world are for government experimentation, you're own government is abducting your child not some random creep on the street, this is fully organized crime happening behind closed doors, a single person wouldn't be capable of this level of sophistication and to think otherwise is being ignorant.

       The whistleblower was under Obama. A memorandum of what’s discovered isn’t an investigation.

Quite simple to understand without a preconceived notion. And an actual willingness to look into the propaganda machine that is our media. Because it’s all related. Countless people apart of the leftist media just started sharing these photos relating to this story the other day. “Caged immigrant children are what the trump regime stands for” CNN MSNBC HuffPo, you name it. They thought it was somehow a new picture and too quickly jumped at this new opportunity to attack trump. The whistleblower behind this story has now been able to connect with federal agencies that had swiped this under the rug since 15’. It was under obama which this happened and I’m guessing some disruptions in his still lasting bureaucracy’s are soon to follow

       Dudette. lol. Sorry. I get upset when it comes to this subject. We've been doing jumping jacks trying to get the attention of main stream America over these missing children. They're being taken from our system and other countries. Most of them brown. Missing immigrant unacompanied minors and children in the DHS system.  This is not new. It's been happening for years if you look into it. There needs to be public outcry. Please do make all the noise you want, but don't blame Trump, because he's trying to stop all this. Look at the arrests and the EO for human trafficking. Look at past POTUS on the same issue.

       The very same FBI report that you're sourcing for the 100k number. I actually read it because I was so shocked about the 100k number, then found out it's BS because 99% of those are found. 1k is still a lot though, and a discussion should be had.

       Ted Gunderson discusses this extensively.  There are other sources, but Gunderson is a good one since he was involved with the McMartin Preschool case.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Video Lecture by Ted L. Gunderson
Recorded  on July 7, 1999, Garden Grove, California
       <a href="http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml">
        http://educate-yourself.og/tg/tgsatanicultsmissingchildrenvideo.shtml
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This video was recorded at the first lecture I ever attended by Ted Gunderson on July 7, 1999 at the Freedom Forum in Garden Grove, California. At the time, I wasn't aware of the extent and pervasiveness of satanic ritual abuse among powerfully connected, wealthy, and prominent individuals in this country and the incredible number of children that are snatched from American streets and never heard from again.
       <strong>
        In Phil Schneider's last video lecture (1995), Phil alluded to the fact that over 700,000 kids are reported missing every year and never found again. The actual figure is closer to one million missing American children that go unaccounted for every year. Ted points out that the FBI maintains all kinds of statistics on stolen cars, but steadfastly refuses to list missing children in their statistics (does that tell you anything?).
       </strong>
       The voluminous documentation and testimonies of victims described in The Franklin Coverup, by attorney John De Camp (Nebraska), leave no question that the FBI themselves are a major player in the coverup of missing and abused young children by prominent politicians and powerful  individuals in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted Gunderson retired from the FBI  in 1979 with honors after 29 years of lauded service. He had risen to the position of Special Agent in Charge and at the time of his retirement and had under his command over 700 FBI agents in the greater Los Angeles area. He became exposed to the world of satanic abuse after retiring and becoming a private investigator. He became interested in the mysterious case, featured on Unsolved Mysteries, of  Dr. Jeffrey McDonald, a Fort Bragg Army physician who was accused and convicted of murdering his wife and three young children in a viscious bloodbath that took place at his home in the early 1970's. The murder scene included satanic symbols scrawled everywhere with the victims' blood. He was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. Ted discovered irrefutable proof, including the confession of one of the satanic cult members who were, in fact, responsible for the murders, that McDonald was innocent and was being framed for the murders to cover up the trail of investigation that would have eventually led to McDonald's discovery of evidence at the hospital where he worked, that drugs were being shipped inside body bags and body cavities from Vietnam along with a huge CIA drug distrbution operation out of Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
      </p>
      <p>
       This lecture includes a short video segment that Ted obtained from the FBI of an actual satanic blood ritual. Satanic activity is endemic and very widespread in this country and needs to be exposed and stopped. This information is sobering and should not be viewed by children."
