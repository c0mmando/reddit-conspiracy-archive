        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello I’m 21, atheist, and a high school drop out who has an opioid addicted mother and a murdered father. 
When I failed the tenth grade I was a little stupid shit. I took acid and mushrooms a lot and one time it did a thing to me. While all my friends were goofing off on the drug I was sitting there thinking about how actually stupid my friends and I were and how we didn’t know the words to describe how we were feeling and how the and the religions government didn’t care if everyone was stupid as long as the worked. Around that time and old homeless man showed me what fractals are I don’t remember what he said to me but ever since that day I’ve had some weird form of Synthesia where I can see information a giant bulk fractal all interconnected. I was then absorbing knowledge like Sherlock Holmes. I quickly realized it was a mistake to drop out of school. I attempted to go to college but my mom said I had to sign up for the military to get a scholarship (which I later found out wasn’t true) so that plan flopped. But I discovered the great courses and plus there’s a plethora of reputable scientific sources on the interwebs. So I began my studies of geology, biology, physics, psychology, quantum physics, astronomy, chemistry, and geology basically anything and everything. Then I realized there was no one I could talk to anymore because no one understood how any of that stuff worked except the homeless man so everyday I’d buy a gram of weed to go smoke with this homeless man so I could at least talk to someone about this stuff in me head. Through my conversations I realized even his scientific knowledge had limits due to the fact that he was trying to blend gnostic christianity and science and astrology. He would get angry when I questioned his loose ends and defensively brag to me his whole life story again and again so I quit hanging out with him so much. </p>

<p>But then I realized it was my lack of knowledge of religions that was holding me back from being able to communicate with most Americans. This was also when I first started watching ancient aliens (Which I think is bullshit with some hint hints in there). But through the ancient alien theory I learned about so many cultures and religions and began to me own theory of civilization. But just to make sure I began to study the occult from alchemy, to Solomons’s magic to theosophy. Then I realized all of the history and magic I learned was all one sided. It was biased toward western theology so I felt like I had to balance it with eastern religions so I studied Buddhism, and Hinduism and the cultures around them. Then something clicked. The truth in the western world had been hidden through a massive game of telephone that is taken thousands of years and run through several secret societies degrading and dumbing down the knowledge whereas in the east it right there in front of your face just hidden amongst the chaos thousands of gods and of billions of people. The eastern religions do not conflict with science as much for this reason.  I now believe that these religions were ancient systems for scientific understanding that was given to us by gods or aliens or an ancient advanced race of people(maybe giants or the nephilim) but when the flood happened it got into bad hands and in the West it was hidden by the elites and kept hidden until Science came along in the Western world and was basically backwards engineering the ancient truth of the universe outside of what the western religions had become (thanks Roman empire). But in the east they took a more communal effort to sustain the truth and that is why when science came along they blended rather swimmingly</p>

<p>But what is a religion or a government? In a since they determine your whole life’s path through space and time. This is were ancient magic (a genius form of advanced psychology) comes into play. Carl Sagan said once that the human brain has leftover parts from evolution. The reptilian brain, Which controls aggression, territoriality, sexual behavior, social hierarchy and so forth. Then we have the mammalian brain on top of that which deals with emotions. Mammalian brain was developed after the extinction of the dinosaurs when young mammals needed to hang around their parents longer to learn how to develop in this new environment after the meteor hit. So evolution created a natural drive (emotions) that allowed for this. Lastly we have The gray matter on top. This is what I think, was what god or aliens or evolution did to us to make us conscious observers. This is what gives us the ability to know facts and be logical (left brain) and be creative and intuitive (right brain). </p>

<p>Now think about how Society has people rigged up. They got males hardwired with the left brain and the reptilian complex and they’ve got women hardwired with the right brain and mammalian complex. When the obvious answer for how to get the most out of your brain is to use all of it equally but this is not what we’re taught by religion and government. </p>

<p>Ancient Magic like spells and incantations to make a specific event happen in space and time can used by an individual to help something in their own life happen. Like science, spells require a series of factors lined up to create a specific event in space and time. By reciting the incantation you’re getting your self into the state of mine needed to do what you want to do. This can also be done to an entire nation of people hence propaganda religion and government. Hint hint. </p>

<p>Part of the whole truth of the fractal bulk is that All of us are in control of our own evolution on an individual level and only we can determine what parts of our brains we will use in our lives and don’t let others trick you into believing their way of using your brain is “the true way”. Another tip in this day and age is that all the propaganda you see on the news kind of likes to appeal to your emotional and reptilian brain not the cerebral cortex. If you focus on the facts and the truth and don’t factor in your own mammalian and reptilian responses. It’s like separating the curds from the whey. </p>

<p>I’m sorry if this contains grammatical errors (I used text to speech) and seems rushed or fragmented but this is only my first time trying to type this all out and I always have a lot to say on these topics. I’ve just gotten used to people not wanting to hear what I have to say so I usually just rush through topics so that I can quickly zoom out and hope that people see the larger connections that are connected to the bulk of everything that we experience. Feel free to ask me any questions or anything. I plan on starting mystery school an hour outside of Nashville in the near future to help people seek balance with their minds and increase mental fortitude and decrease their mental turpitude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Wyzard, I am in TN right now as well and thanks for the post. It is a bit rambling and incoherent but I get the gist of what you are laying down. It&#39;s funny because my life was extremely similar to yours at that age. Dropped out of high school in 10th grade, experimented with psychedelics, thought about life, the structure of things, eternity, space/time etc... Then, I did DMT and it changed my life. Anyway, enough about that. Wanted to give you a few pointers for Reddit posts: </p>

<p>I would recommend going with one subject if you would like to get a discussion going. Get your outline of that topic, then condense it down and then write it on here. You will get a lot more communication, especially on this site. Long posts, that aren&#39;t really focused on one thing won&#39;t get much going. </p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing what you have to say so make sure to post some things. </p>

<p>Well anyway, what breakthroughs have you come across?
I&#39;ve read of double/triple meanings for secret (hidden occult) knowledge. All seeing eye, sacred geometry like the flower of life, frequencies, exiting the &quot;holographic matrix&quot;, etc. You find anything fascinating yet?</p>

<p>Also have you looked into r/holofractal ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say all the physical factors and electrochemical responses that are a part of us and determine how we feel at any given moment. The universe just creates, maintains, and destroys. it’s always doing this. When our ancestors invented language (or perhaps it was gifted to them by gods or aliens) they, for the first time, could invent words that could explain the electrochemical responses (how they felt) that they were feeling inside as a result of witnessing the earth and the universe do what it do. Which is kind of a make it or break it for us on the surface of this thin crusted magma sphere hence the broad spectrum of complex emotion we have evolved to be capable of feeling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The synthesia thing boggles me and I don’t really know but my best guess is that it is a series of factors coming together in one moment which are 1) I’ve always had a pictographic memory 2) as a kid I was kinda into things like pipe organs, Sherlock Holmes, and Doctor Who which are somewhat spilling over with multilayered complex factors . 3) in high school I learned what “trippy” things were. I felt there was a connection but couldn’t put my finger on it. 4) Later whilst on acid talking to my homeless friend about trippy things and why people are intrigued by them and he says his best guess is that it had something to do with fractal geometry and explains to me what is was and at that moment when I realized I wasn’t “hallucinating” but rather seeing the fractal nature of the universe, multilayered repeating complex factors. The only addition from what I had a hint of as a kid in figure 2 was the word repeating. Which some how gave my pictographic memory a way to connect everything in big multilayered and colored big fractal with all the little pictures (or factors or bits of data) as the vertices of the big picture. The layers are different colors which help distinguish different theories religions and fields of knowledge while the distance of the vertices (or points of data) indicates relativity or plausibility in whatever I’m thinking about. Plus every picture or point of data when I zoom in and think about it generates another one of those images in my mind like a fractal.  It’s kinda like x y z plotting and using triangulation of factors to predict or to fill in the blank. </p>

<p>Which brings me to your second question about triple meanings and double meanings and my answer is I get a lot of possible outcomes about anything I think about but the most probable is in the center like your DaVinci drawing with the probably becoming less possible the further you are from the center. Also kinda like wave particle duality. When I think about science it is usually like this  but when I think about religion it switches from plausibly more to relativity mode for it doesn’t matter what it means in the physical world or at least that’s not were there going to hide their true meanings. One of the things I personally thought of is that all of the angels and demons and gods and deities in religions are actually ancient psychology isolating the positive and negative factors of the human mind and reality. Like ancient science. Therefore a demon (foo dog) is a negative part of the human mind that causes negative ripples in space-time thru the minds of humans. I also find that a lot of “sins” relate to those leftover bits from evolution I mentioned earlier. Thats why think the statue perhaps represents the our own inner demons are keeping us from attaining the sacred knowledge. </p>

<p>It took me 3 hours too think this all out and edit it lol. I think rather slowly. But it was worth it to get the knowledge to the people. Also thanks for informing me about holofractal I didn’t know about this and it looks fucking cool! I will defiantly be posting more soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply, interesting perspective. I too sometimes take a long time to edit my posts to get a message across in an easy to understand way. The ancient psychology thing might be true or partially true. </p>

<p>I wonder if &quot;shadow people&quot; some report are just from their minds rather than another dimension. Or it could be both, I have no idea. But do you know how to better control your mind? Like being able to stop negative thoughts/depression and be motivated all the time? It would be life changing. </p>

I can&#39;t remember what it feels like to see anything other than coloured fractal patterns when I close my eyes. I&#39;ve been sober for a few months now and the REM sleep is insane. I&#39;d like to talk more about this with people who have also seen the jewel in the lotus. holofractal is good as mentioned already. I would also recommend the doors of perception by aldous huxley and the psychedelic experience by timothy leary. if you have any advice or information or would like to talk more contact me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In space if a cloud of oxygen and a cloud of hydrogen come together there is increased probability water molecules will form.  Magic is the same in the way that rituals require specific objects and words to align yourself or others in hopes of increasing probability of achieving a desired result. One reason Alchemists were cool because they blended scientific processes and magical rituals to achieve enlightenment. I’m just saying the processes are relatable and some magic may be psychological tricks like controlling the vibe you send out to get an intended vibe back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that society has males wired left brain, I think this is part of the reason atheism and associated Scientism have taken so much ground.</p>

<p>There are atheist churches. They have their own dogma. Followers get emotionally attached and defensive as much as believers do. They deify the popular minds as much as the religious deify their saints. </p>

<p>This kind of deep wisdom, especially that from the psychedelic experience, typically comes in an unspeakable form... The best we have to going that far in language are analogy, symbol, metaphor, parable and myth. Religions are pretty much the perfect medium for dispersing this knowledge, utilizing layered meanings so as to not blow too many minds at once and make a target of yourself. Every peeled layer peeled back has a deeper level of connection between concepts until the naked truth is staring you in the face. </p>

<p>I find that labels are too limiting, the same way words are - no two people, speaking about the same concept, will describe it in the same manner. Even asking the same person to repeat what they just said, it&#39;s impossible for it to come out the exact same way. This represents a fundamental drop in the quality of the transmission, due to the medium itself, language. When you get less definitive and leave more room for malleable interpretation, using metaphor and myth, it seems like the message actually has a better chance of getting through, especially when the concepts themselves can&#39;t be described succinctly. </p>

<p>I wonder how many theologians call themselves atheist for the protection of reputation it provides - while secretly subscribing to a polytheistic view or personal blend of religions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can’t blame me for picking a label that is closest to what I believe just to make it easy on the simple people I have to talk to sometime. I take everything with a grain of salt and try to hold all the grain of salt equidistant from each other as to not be biased. I’m with you I don’t like labels. But I also think religions aren’t being used properly and the power they hold is being abused therefore it is my opinion that they are no longer the perfect medium to disperse the knowledge. Science has stepped up to plate and appears to be functional it allows us to figure stuff out, change it if it’s wrong, and has lots of merit in the physical world, and does not require a mammalian and reptilian brain to compute it in you’re head. All religions want you to do is fade out those parts of your brain anyway and science is the end result of that. </p>

<p>That might be the general effect, but there can still be wisdom hidden underneath all that, which the vast majority won&#39;t notice. Occult studies are all about this obscurantism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know but the article was claiming that the dr who thought of that stuff cured a bunch of criminally insane people with out even being in the room. He’s kinda indicating who his target audience is and I don’t trust anything that tries to get some one to mindlessly ask god for forgiveness and to love him. I don’t even practice magic or religion I scientifically analyze it for real world scientific applications in the field of psychology. I do not require forgiveness for my actions nor do I wish to convert. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh i see  you have misunderstood the point entirely but i didn&#39;t make it very clear...</p>

<p>when you say those words either to yourself or others it clears paths ways and allows great things to happen on various levels.</p>

<p>i just thought you may be ready for it but your only young... god i wish i could tell a younger version of myself all i know now  lol   the paradox is a younger me would never of listened.</p>

<p>keep re-searching friend.</p>

<p>peace</p>
