<p>For all of you who recall fabreeze you are not alone, until recently it was fabreze, and now it has always been febreze.<br/>
You won’t be able to find a bottle or spray of fabreze anywhere. So if you have a spray or powder in the back of your cupboard, you bought long ago, and are pretty sure it was fabreze. It will have changed now.  </p>

<p>This is posted in ME forum but it’s heavily shilled and I see the cover up of the Mandela Effect as a huge conspiracy. And I really want to know why it’s been covered up. Maybe many of you are ready to see it. Who knows. </p>

Same happens for me with alot of names that changed spelling.. Google flashes and quickly reloads the page with the new spelling after flaunting the old spelling for a quick second, in most images. We probably most still think its hard to change spellings in pictures, but it aint for Google/C!A.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memory is way less reliable than it feels like it should be. There are many studies demonstrating how easy it is to change or implant memories. Heck, whenever you remember something, your mind is retrieving the memory <em>and then rewriting it</em>. The Mandela effect is only a good explanation in a world with reliable memories. But in this world the much better explanation is that people misremember things, and fail to doubt themselves enough.</p>

<p>For me Mandela effect falls into the &quot;fallacies becoming pseudoscience&quot; category. It doesn&#39;t get covered up, it&#39;s just an illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The above is an example of what I mean by massive bias on the part of those who believe there are actual changes happening.  </p>

<p>When shown contrary evidence (including reasons -why- that contrary evidence is more logical than what they remember), ME believers fall back to the only option they have. &quot;I trust my memory more than I trust anything you (whomever) say.&quot; Which in 2018 seems to be a fall-back position for more and more beliefs, far beyond the ME world. Unfortunately, it&#39;s also a position that refutes any--and all--debate, because literally nothing anyone can say or show is allowed as being a possible alternate answer.  </p>

<p>Instead, you have those who are open to -all- the possibilities, from bad memory to alternate universes, being labeled as shills because they attempt to find the &#39;actual&#39; answer and ME believers attacking anyone who isn&#39;t fully on-board with their belief in much the same way some religious factions attack anyone who doesn&#39;t conform to their beliefs.  </p>

<p>It makes any real debate almost impossible, no matter what side someone takes.</p>

<p>We may live in a simulation. I’m very much there with you. But nobody has any proof. And it’s always been froot loops.</p>

<p>I went down a path of obsessing over Mandela effects about a year ago. If there’s any conspiracy, it’s that of a psyop that makes you question your sanity and reality. You can see it all over atm. Yanny/laurel, ME, fake news. Someone probably is doing this to rewrite their own reality. You don’t need a simulation to do this.

<p>All of which these things always have been. So how can I prove anything ? I can’t. I can just point people in a direction and anyone sees it, great. And it’s because of the shills I do this.

<p>San Diego was not a Mexican border town before. And the baha strip by Mexico looks wrong. Alaska is much bigger than before. Some people haven’t heard is Svalbard. And have heard of Arctica. </p>

<p>Rainbow mountains are not something anyone has heard of before 2016. And the great pyramid is the same size as the other one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Googled. </p>

<p>Easter island statues don’t wear hats. At least not the most famous ones. So I’m not sure what the ME is? Perhaps if other ones wear hats then they are just less famous. We’ve likely only seen pictures of the same 5 of 6 in a picturesque spot.  I believe I heard there are a hell of a lot of them. </p>

<p>Ribbon seals. Never seen them before, but there are a hell of a lot of species of seal. I found some other pretty funky looking ones I’ve never heard of. Perhaps this is just a seal that not many people are aware of.</p>

<p>Rainbow trees. Very odd that I’d have not heard of this tree. But it’s possible that they are rare enough that you wouldn’t know much about them until they became a talked about thing on the internet. And require a climate that you wouldn’t be able to grow them in easily..so you don’t see them anywhere else. Most of what we are aware of is because it can be sold to us. Without researching them Deeply I would assume they get their colour from the nutrients in the soil? I have a friend who is a botanist. If she knows what they are that would solve the ME for me.</p>

<p>The bird eating trees were recently discovered. I don’t think new discoveries are a sign of an ME or anything. Just..something we didn’t know existed.</p>

<p>Of course bird eating trees have recently discovered they simply didn’t exist a while ago. They are on Puerto Rico. A very well covered island. If you google it some see it as strange they weren’t found before </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What percentage of them have hats? The more iconic, buried, ones do not have hats. I’ve never researched the heads so I only am aware of the ones without. I’d assume many people are as well.</p>

<p>To respond to your other post. San Diego was always a border county. I was born there. I asked my father if it is and he said it borders Mexico. </p>

<p>I don’t see newly popular or newly discovered species as an ME. Becoming aware of something doesn’t mean it didn’t exist prior. Although that’s an entire different quantum physics discussion. </p>

<p>Mongolia has always been its own country. At least in the last 30 years it has.  </p>

John goodman is alive
Aretha Franklin is alive 
Eddie large is alive </p>

<p>I recall John goodman dying quite clearly of a heart attack not long after splitting from Rosanne bar. And I never watched Rosanne I just heard it on the news. </p>

<p>Eddie large dying. I heard it on the radio and how it was sad sid little didn’t go to his funeral as they hadn’t spoken since they split. How would I know that since I have no care what so ever about little and large. </p>

<p>Its all over I’ve seen it happen there’s just no point convincing me it hasn’t happened because I’ve seen it with my own eyes. Not just distant memories. You have no more chance of convincing me the sky is red. We live in a day where people are told not to believe what they see. Unfortunately too many comply with this rubbish </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well check this thread for a start. 
The me forum has had massive problems with shills and bits upviting inane rubbish and down voting comments. When changes happen the shills come out in force. </p>

<p>Search mandela effect and you’ll just get a bad memory phenomenon. </p>

<p>The telegraph ran a piece on laurel and hardy and how their catch phrase “that’s another fine mess you got me into” was never like that </p>

<p>Fox News ran a piece on the mandela effects and dragged in a neuroscientist to say how it was bad memory </p>

<p>The x files did a program on it and how it was bad memory. </p>

<p>There is a film coming out which will be about the guy being a bit mad and bad memory. </p>

<p>Fabreeze/ febreze  changes wiki to say how they changed the logo. Only you can’t find any bottle anywhere that will have fabreze on it. (Takes one from the shills that they forgot to check what febreze’s corporate line is and that it’s changed lol). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this circumstance, &quot;shill&quot; means &quot;anyone who doesn&#39;t believe the universe changed over the spelling of a word or a movie quote or any other thing that I, the person calling someone a shill, believe was once different.&quot;  </p>

<p>While many individuals in the ME community of reddit love to declare that there are shill brigades, that&#39;s (IMO) a case of a seriously biased view of what they&#39;re reading. Are there a lot of people who attempt to point out other options rather than &quot;the entire universe changing?&quot; Yes. There are also a lot of people who frequent that community who are open to the possibility that a -number- of options could be part of the effect, including memory issues, how language changes over time, the well-recorded and documented ways that pop culture phrases shift to versions that are more easily digestible and the simple possibility of someone learning information incorrectly to begin with. I don&#39;t happen to assume that -all- of those people are &#39;shills&#39;, as that requires someone to actively be paid/ordered to attempt to shut something down.  </p>

<p>Those who are ME believers tend to believe the opposite, with (IMO) very, very little proof to their accusations.  </p>

<p>of course, I&#39;ll be called a shill by those same people for making this post. </p>

<p>Have you ever seen that paragraph where the writer leaves off every other letter?  Yet you are able to read it all the same because your mind fills in the blanks?</p>

<p>Well, mate, your mind constantly fills in gaps with its own assumptions about things, that is where some of the <em>physical</em> questions you have are found (Lincoln, The Last Supper) But the others I merely dismissed because spelling mistakes are common and pointless.</p>

<p>Tell you what. Next time you are with friends just ask them </p>

<p>What does the thinker statue look like 
Have you heard of ribbon seals
Rainbow mountains
What is the famous line from field of dreams </p>

<p>And if you want to dig.  Check Sally fields you like me you really like me and look at the parodies. </p>

<p>Check risky business and look at the parodies </p>

<p>Check James Earl Jones recalling his famous phrase Luke I am your father</p>

<p>Check Papua New Guinea being circum navigated 150 years before Australia was discovered (its within sight of Papua New Guinea if you count the islands). </p>

<p>If you were interested in digging you’d ask if there was any evidence. Which I’d happily furnish you with and you can do what you will.  You haven’t done any digging trust me </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You live in the UK? How are you so certain about fruit loops? We don’t have that here so you will most likely have had minimal encounters with it. Or, honestly, the Lincoln monument. Be honest..you’ve probably seen a picture of it a couple times in your life. Maybe been to it once. We don’t have too much exposure to it here..it’s not an icon..so you most likely just never looked at it that observantly. What a coincidence it would be if you had payed close attention to those things seemingly at random, before you noticed the shift. I feel what is happening here is a mixture of bad memory, and being suggestible. People on the internet notice it, and your mind is latching onto the group think aspect of the phenomenon and you become certain something, that you very likely hadn’t had very much exposure to before, has changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all..very creepy you somehow ascertained my approximate location. What the hell is wrong with you? </p>

<p>Secondly. I lived half of my life in America/was born there. I’ve come across the Lincoln monument a lot in my education there and have visited D.C many times. Absolutely always had a fist. </p>

<p>Fruit loops was always Froot Loops. They legally had to name it that because it contains no fruit. It didn’t switch to fruit. Some people just said it switched to froot from fruit, after switching to fruit from froot. That was the first mention. I lurk the Mandelaeffect subreddit and saw it happen and clocked onto the bullshit.</p>

<p>Rushmore always had eyes. Again, I’ve visited that a fair few times. Always had eyes. It was also recently cleaned..so details are more prominent. </p>

<p>Now, I’ve noticed some Mandela effects myself. C3pos leg, the sinbad movie, and berenstain bears being 3. I don’t think they’re a sign of the past being changed. But rather a sign of how we aren’t as observant as we believe. Although the sinbad movie has me stumped. And I find c3pos leg hard to take..all of my old toys have a gold leg. It’s possible low quality televisions and film made his silver leg less prominent than the digital renditions nowadays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of the way you were replying suggests the location. But never mind that’s something different. </p>

<p>A friend of mine has seen the sinbad movie. I have never heard of it. But I’m convinced if it because of the number of people who’ve seen it. And the story line is the same. As for Star Wars why does James earl jones recall himself even saying the line ? Luke I am your father ? </p>

<p>Yeah c3po never had a silver leg. Like no way. </p>

<p>I have family in America. But regardless I still never seen a packet of fruit loop. But I am 100% certain that when I saw the mandela effect they were fruit loops. And yes people said the same thing that there was some case they had to change it because it had no fruit. Hence that why they recall froot loops. </p>

<p>I’ve seen a clip of the a team van change from the all black one to that thing with the grey top. The same clip changed in three days. And a friend of mine saw it as well. We were gobsmacked. </p>

<p>Look I didn’t make this my first goto when I saw sox people in the jfk car or realised kit Kat never had a dash in it. And walkers never swapped the cheese and onion and salt and vinegar around. It’s a massive leap of faith. I’m not trying to convince anyone. As quite frankly people resist and I don’t blame them. It really has shaken my reality to pieces. But I think in a good way time will tell. I’m just sharing some of the popular ones and I guess people can make up their own minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He actually does say Luke I am your father. I convinced my gf to watch Star Wars the other week. The quote is “no, luke, I am your father”. That’s a famous quote but because it contains the word “no” can’t be used often in conversation. So people leave that out the “no” when saying the phrase. With, the amount of people saying that line, you’ve probably heard it from more people than the source itself..that is if your friends like Star Wars as much as I do. So your mind believes the quote is only “luke I am your father”. It’s simulacrum. A statue or replica that eventually surpasses the original and becomes the new accepted reality..whether accurate or not.</p>

<p>I also looked out for 3pos leg when watching. There aren’t too many shots of his full body. Of the ones there are, many of them you cannot tell his leg is silver. His gold leg is rejected in it. I’d imagine, without ever focusing on his leg..your mind would just assume it is gold from the reflection. Some scenes his leg is clearly silver. But without looking and observing intently...your mind would just assume it is gold. </p>

<p>Did the a team van change in the same exact spot in the same exact scene? Ive never watched the a team so have no untainted opinion on the matter. What I assume it looks like will forever be tainted by reading about the switch. The power of suggestion and group consensus are very powerful in manipulating memory and beliefs.</p>

<p>How many people did you believe the jfk car had? Including driver? My memory is there was a driver and agent in the passenger seat, jfk and wife, and some governer and his wife. I distinctly remember this, mainly from playing a game where you had to replicate the jfk assassination (I believe it was to prove it was impossible).  But if I’m honest..watching the clip I don’t think I’ve been aware of anything other than his head. You get tunnel vision watching and waiting for things such as this. My experience in goalkeeping has taught me how much your mind blanks out around you when you are anticipating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. Just put on the movie to prove you wrong but you are right. Could have sworn he said luke. I even watched it with the captions because my gf has terrible auditory focus and needs subtitles to pay attention to movies. Was quite confident he said no, luke. But then again...could just be remembering it with the culturally changed idea yet again. The scenes are shot very tightly around the dialogue in that part. I don’t think there’s enough time for the extra word to fit. Although you got me there. Touché</p>

<p>Definitely was at least 6 though. One of the bullets hit the guy in front of jfk. </p>

<p>I don’t think he’s recalling it wrong. But many many people recall like I am your father. Just like many people recall if you build it they will come in field of dreams. It’s a favourite film of mine and I know that line was if you build it the will come </p>

<p>That&#39;s very possible because (little bit of trivia) the actor who actually played the body of Vader (David Prowse) was given a different line to say (in order to keep the big spoiler a secret).  The line he actually says (which Jones later voices) was &quot;Obi-Wan killed your father&quot;</p>

<p>Fabreeze with an A sounds more right to me. Like thats what ive always said. But I do say alot of words wrong. </p>

<p>Must have held the spray like once in my life so I can&#39;t actually remember. Ran it by my Ma and she thinks it&#39;s Febreeze with an E. Like she didn&#39;t even need to think. She been spraying that shit for a long time.</p>

<p>Fabric + Breeze = Fabreeze. That makes sense. So does the fact shit you think you remember as a kid is often not accurate so who the fuck know!?</p>
