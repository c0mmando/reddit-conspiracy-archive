    <div class="md"><p>The US military industrial complex isn&#39;t doing much to quell suspicions that it is largely responsible for the emergence and continued existence of nebulous terrorist entities like ISIS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an apparent attempt to remove all pretense that the United States is nothing more than al-Qaeda’s Air Force in Syria, the American government is warning its Syrian counterpart that, if the SAA moves ahead with its upcoming southern offensive to remove ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists from its southern borders, the U.S. will take “firm and appropriate measures.”</p>

<p>In other words, the United States is telling Syria that it had better not attack ISIS forces or else. Indeed, American “Firm and appropriate measures” seems like a very thinly veiled threat of military action particularly since the United States seems incapable of taking any “measures” that aren’t “kinetic” in nature outside of its borders.</p>

<p>Of course, while no one who has been following the Syrian crisis would be surprised that the nation who funded, organized, trained, armed, and directed terrorist forces in Syria (including ISIS), would do whatever it could to protect its proxy army, it is rather surprising to see the U.S. government so openly state that ISIS terrorists are “off limits” and to do away with even the formalities of pretending that it wants to see Daesh destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author of this article opines on the abysmally short attention spot of the average American, which creates an environment where the same bullshit can be repeated ever decade or two. &quot;If it were longer, Americans might remember when the US government told them:&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The US opposes all terrorism and is engaged in a war against terror.</p></li>
<li><p>The US wants stability in the Middle East.</p></li>
<li><p>Assad is a brutal dictator who kills his own people.</p></li>
<li><p>Syrians hate Assad.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were all democracy loving peaceful protesters.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were violent only in reaction to a horrific crackdown by the Syrian military.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were democracy loving freedom fighters. There were no terrorist elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were overwhelmingly democracy loving freedom fighters with some jihadist elements who had infiltrated their ranks.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were Syrian.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were mostly jihadists but had moderate elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The “rebels” were jihadists but better than ISIS.</p></li>
<li><p>The US is not involved in Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>The US is not supporting rebels.</p></li>
<li><p>The US is in Syria to “defeat ISIS.”</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The author concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, we have come full circle and the United States is openly threatening conflagration in support of ISIS/al-Qaeda, the very terrorist organization which was used to justify the elimination of vast amounts of civil liberties for American citizens domestically.</p>

<p>In 2001, Americans were told to shred their constitutional rights and accept a police state due to an alleged attack by al-Qaeda. In 2018, Americans are told to be ready to risk a third world war to protect al-Qaeda. It appears the State Department is now reading George Orwell’s works as a script writing model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Israel is supporting ISIS/ al Nusra/ <em>whatever Jeehawdists</em> - especially those in Southwest Syria, but NOT because Israel fears Iran - that&#39;s just a paper tiger - a sales pitch to justify their real intent, which is to take over a large swath of Syria (and Southern Lebanon) for annexation to Israel.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Zionists HATE Iran <em>(for some strange reason)</em> but Iran poses no credible threat to their little Racist Retreat on the Mediterranean, and Israel knows it.</p>

<p>The biggest threat Israel faces is that it will lose the support of Jews living abroad, and the IDIOT Christian sects who have been suckered into supporting &quot;God&#39;s Hosen&quot;.</p>

<p>If they lose that support, they really ARE fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any suggestions? </p>

<p>What part of what I wrote is American propaganda? And what are your qualifications to assess it as such? </p>

<p>Are you disputing that Syria has been under emergency law for more than 5 decades? Are you disputing that Assad inherited the government from his father? Are you disputing that Assad is trained optometrist? Are you disputing that Assad&#39;s brother did die in a car crash? Are disputing that 15 youths had been arrested and beaten for anti-government graffiti, which then prompted mass protesting (inspired by Arab spring, the Jasmine Revolution, etc.)? Are you disputing that the Syrian Government was the first actor to use lethal force on protestors? </p>

<p>Do you consider the majority opinion of the UN including numerous proposed, but failed (due to Russian and Chinese vetoes) UNSC resolutions to investigate Assad&#39;s government for crimes against its citizens, to be American propaganda? </p>

<p>And I also read the BBC which is neither american or propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>well that answers nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Syria is a democracy. It&#39;s not a western democracy, and it is certainly corrupt, but nonetheless it&#39;s much more moderate than most arab nations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Syria is not a democracy. When opposition political parties are not allowed to partake in elections, it&#39;s not a democracy. When the mantle of presidency is passed from father to son with one family ruling the country for more than 50 years it&#39;s not a democracy. Being moderate, culturally or religiously has no bearing on being democratic. And even though Syria is not a real democracy, only dressing itself in those trappings, the international community did play ball with the nation, until the government began killing it&#39;s citizens for protesting for democratic reforms. If a nation is really a democracy, they don&#39;t respond to calls for democratic reforms with bullets and bombings. And that&#39;s not to say all the actors opposing the Assad regime are innocent. But to imply that all groups and people fighting against the Assad regime were terrorists or ISIS adjunct is not only wrong but outright spreading pro Assad regime propaganda. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Certainly more so than American allies like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We aren&#39;t talking about those countries though. UAE and Saudi Arabia are constitutional monarchies and everyone knows that. No one cites either nation as bastions of democracy and both nations receive constant criticism for their authoritarian governments. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doubly certain that it doesn&#39;t justify American attacks, or American support of Muslim terrorists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well remember that the US president who launched munitions at Syria was President Trump. Additionally the UN and international community had numerous plans and working papers to institute cease-fires with peacekeepers and even no fly-zones with possibility for coalition intervention (justified under R2P), but Russia and China continued to veto all actions. Even after China stopped vetoing these measures, Russia continued to do so in order to continue to prop up their ally Syria so Russia can use Syria as a foothold in the Middle East in order to expand their hegemony across the region and have access to Mediterranean ports. How do you not know any of this? Have you ever researched this subject at all? </p>

<p>Now onto American involvement. I agree that American involvement was not executed well with weapons going to actors who should not have received weapons and I criticize the American government for that. However, given the constraints the previous administration was working under their method was a solution they were able to do. I think it was poorly executed and should have been more thoroughly prepared. But that still never justified Assad&#39;s regime and their wanton killing of innocent civilians and protesters. Remember, Assad used chemical weapons on his own people multiple times. How do you defend that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you hold America&#39;s allies to the same standard?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no fear of criticizing wrongdoing regardless of its geographic location or alliances. If a person can&#39;t separate their biases from objective facts and truth, then they can&#39;t possibly get a complete understanding of events. So yeah I hold all nations to the same standard. I&#39;m not afraid to criticize the US or it&#39;s allies. But criticizing those groups doesn&#39;t mean the other side is in the clear. Syria is still the far bigger bad guy here, by a massive margin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The BBC is state media. While it&#39;s certainly better than American corporate media, it&#39;s among the worst state medias in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. BBC maybe state media, but BBC news is objectively some of the best news out there. Please tell me what other state medias are better? If you are saying that you better be able to name names. </p>

Syrian forces dropped leaflets in a De-Escalation area that was formed by Russia, the US, and Jordan in November 17.  That would violate the agreement.  Also, they aren&#39;t telling the forces not to attack because the Islamic State militants are there.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government and allied forces control about 30 percent of Daraa, the rest of which is held by various factions, including a small contingent of fighters from the Islamic State jihadist group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Islamic State &quot;combatants&quot; are not the sole occupying force of the area.  There are numerous guerrilla combatants, in area where fighting has been de-escalated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What part of what you write is American propaganda?  All of it basically.</p>

<p>Syria is a democracy.  It&#39;s not a western democracy, and it is certainly corrupt, but nonetheless it&#39;s much more moderate than most arab nations.  Certainly more so than American allies like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.  Doubly certain that it doesn&#39;t justify American attacks, or American support of Muslim terrorists.  </p>

<p>Do you hold America&#39;s allies to the same standard?</p>

<p>The BBC is state media.  While it&#39;s certainly better than American corporate media, it&#39;s among the worst state medias in the world.</p>
