    <div class="md"><p>I am convinced 9/11 was obviously a inside, false flag operation. Which IMO was very gutless and heartless. Not to mention an enormous operation at that. If our inner government is willing to do that, I am scared to think about what they may do this time.  It tends to get bigger and bigger everytime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First they have to determine who the scapegoat is, immigrants? The scale <em>must exceed 911</em> and turn everyone in to a paranoid, fearful of <em>the enemy in our midst</em>. It will include orders to shelter in place and heavy restrictions on travel. There will need to be a designated spokesmodel and hero character as well as the villains. </p>

<p>The purpose is to turn most Americans into a frightened, complicit, prisoner physically and in the mind. It will occur a month or so into the next mega-recession. It&#39;s likely to involve Fentanyl to some degree. Why? <em>Somebody is making it in mass murder quantities.</em> One bust had enough to kill everyone in New York city. </p>

<p>Instead of stalking Reddit, intelligence agencies should do their job: protect the citizens of this nation and stop wasting resources pretending the USA is an empire. Everyone know what happens to empires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on it will have to be bigger than 9/11. It has to be enough to convince the public we must go to war.  I only hope this time people aren&#39;t so stupid and start asking questions sooner rather than later. People took time to become skeptics with 9/11. W/E it is, I won&#39;t be fooled this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The night after 911 deep paranoia descended. I saw Arab looking people in cars and thought &quot;how far will this go, what&#39;s next.&quot; What did I do? First thing, clean the gun and buy a box of ammo. I assumed the role of defender barking orders to the wife and kids, bodies dropping out of exploding towers has that effect. </p>

<p>Whatever they do, it will spark primitive fight or flight reactions. In fact, not knowing who did it will only amplify the personal threat. Most people, will bury themselves in the TV searching for a Daddy to protect them. Those of us skeptical about our wayward governance will just have a higher level of paranoia because for the vary reason &quot;they&quot; might have done it: same effect as the &quot;official&quot; line, frozen, muddled thinking, cognitive dissonance and the hive mind kicks in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More likely than a massive event will be a series of smaller events over time to promote a narrative / otherwise undesirable shift in policy. 9/11 was followed by a vast series of other smaller events to drive home an agenda. Not just one, but many national media propped up terrorizing stories. Now, hypothetically, many medium small events should be more effective than a single big event. Tho a really big show with lots of small spinoffs would be effective. The level of scrutiny and mistrust in official narrative makes implementing a single large event while controlling the narrative/ maintaining control a great risk. </p>
