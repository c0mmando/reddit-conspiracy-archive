       It's got to be something big. Possibly they nuke a target and blame it on NK. Perhaps a US city or maybe even a US military base.

       I am convinced 9/11 was obviously a inside, false flag operation. Which IMO was very gutless and heartless. Not to mention an enormous operation at that. If our inner government is willing to do that, I am scared to think about what they may do this time.  It tends to get bigger and bigger everytime.

       First they have to determine who the scapegoat is, immigrants? The scale
       <em>
        must exceed 911
       </em>
       and turn everyone in to a paranoid, fearful of
       <em>
        the enemy in our midst
       </em>
       . It will include orders to shelter in place and heavy restrictions on travel. There will need to be a designated spokesmodel and hero character as well as the villains.

       The purpose is to turn most Americans into a frightened, complicit, prisoner physically and in the mind. It will occur a month or so into the next mega-recession. It's likely to involve Fentanyl to some degree. Why?

       One bust had enough to kill everyone in New York city.

       I agree with you on it will have to be bigger than 9/11. It has to be enough to convince the public we must go to war.  I only hope this time people aren't so stupid and start asking questions sooner rather than later. People took time to become skeptics with 9/11. W/E it is, I won't be fooled this time.

       The night after 911 deep paranoia descended. I saw Arab looking people in cars and thought "how far will this go, what's next." What did I do? First thing, clean the gun and buy a box of ammo. I assumed the role of defender barking orders to the wife and kids, bodies dropping out of exploding towers has that effect.

       Whatever they do, it will spark primitive fight or flight reactions. In fact, not knowing who did it will only amplify the personal threat. Most people, will bury themselves in the TV searching for a Daddy to protect them. Those of us skeptical about our wayward governance will just have a higher level of paranoia because for the vary reason "they" might have done it: same effect as the "official" line, frozen, muddled thinking, cognitive dissonance and the hive mind kicks in.

       I was in 10th grade at the time and I too was very paranoid. As I got older I looked into it more. Started asking questions. Watched video footage that only aired once On live TV. Woke up and realized they used our fear against us. They could have said Canada did it and we would have gave consent to attack. I just can't fathom killing my own people for greed. Then there was instant bumper stickers being handed out everywhere for free. "Support our troops." The biggest "don't ask questions, if you do you are NOT a patriot" bullshit. Biggest propaganda ever. Just crazy. I am getting worked up thinking about it lol

       My favorite was "we're fighting them there so we don't have to fight them here." Overnight, soldiers had become "warriors". The movies feed the delusion: cannon fodder. Whatever the nationality of the bad guy will always be the ethnicity of our masked enemy.

       Def agree. I ponder about the type of human beings who had orchestrated this shit. The evil within the planning. Literally no care for human life what so ever. Even for their own people in their own country. Then the movies come out glamorizing war heros and making them appear noble. This is done intentionally to suppress people from speaking out and asking questions.

       You could pick basically anything. Prior to 9/11 they planned for such an event. They have been planning for nukes, bombings, pandemics and economic crash. You could throw a dart at a wall and probably hit one thing that could happen.

       It's not that I even expect a false flag anymore. I fullheartedly believe that we will no know the true reasoning for these shootings and attacks. We will just hear what the sweeping masses of perception control on this sub thumb in.

       Look at all the last shootings, we aren't any closer with Vegas. These are meant to scare us, not have a purpose.

       Yes, but the major catastrophe is needed to disrupt the U.S.A., not engage in an outside war.  We are currently at war, it is so far mostly, a political and intelligence war.

       Mossad orchestrated False Flag to be blamed on Iran. Their "chemical Weapons" fiasco in Syria didn't work. They may ratchet it up a notch to something that has the same impact as their most successful false flag attack, 9/11 in order to once again "shock and awe" the brainwashable masses.

       More likely than a massive event will be a series of smaller events over time to promote a narrative / otherwise undesirable shift in policy. 9/11 was followed by a vast series of other smaller events to drive home an agenda. Not just one, but many national media propped up terrorizing stories. Now, hypothetically, many medium small events should be more effective than a single big event. Tho a really big show with lots of small spinoffs would be effective. The level of scrutiny and mistrust in official narrative makes implementing a single large event while controlling the narrative/ maintaining control a great risk.

       I was in 10th grade at the time and I too was very paranoid. As I got older I looked into it more. Started asking questions. Watched video footage that only aired once On live TV. Woke up and realized they used our fear against us. They could have said Canada did it and we would have gave consent to attack. I just can't fathom killing my own people for greed. Then there was instant bumper stickers being handed out everywhere for free. "Support our troops." The biggest "don't ask questions, if you do you are NOT a patriot" bullshit. Biggest propaganda ever. Just crazy. I am getting worked up thinking about it lol
