       The fact that we need anonymity to discuss real life issues really tells you all you need to know about free speech. Where I come from is a land that had a 30 year dictatorship and the most lasting memory you hear from folks that lived through those years is how the government had spies and informants that would rat out their neighbors if they spoke ill of even how hard life was, let alone against the government. These people would be fetched from their homes, tortured and forced to rat out the people they spoke with, and they in turn would go through the same date. Most ended up “disappeared”.  Sooner or later, this will be the norm of the world government we’re headed for.

       You have the right to share sexist and racist opinions, and people have every right to call them out as sexist and racist.

       That's the funniest thing I've read in ages.  Most of the women I've known who've chosen STEM careers can run circles around the men around them.  They're better architects, better doctors, better engineers, just better all around.  Not the ones who got hired on quota, but the ones who chose it due to interest.  Males just can't compare to a motivated and interested female
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       intellectually.

       And my guess is the majority will fall into line. "I'm not doing anything wrong!" "Only bad people have something to hide!" "I'm boring so I don't care." It's the same shit that it's been for years. That button got clicked a long time ago when it concerns the common sense of "I'm NOT doing anything wrong so fuck off and leave me alone."

      <p>
       The bumper sticker slogan we get about freedom is the most that the majority of people will think about. How many take a look around, study what's going on around them, truly ask just how much freedom they have, is it a case of not having any at all anymore? No, we get this "fuck yeah, we're free and always will be free. Bow down bitches!" attitude.

       This is exactly why nothing we do will ever change what’s already started. The majority don’t want to disturb their suburban tranquility hypno state. They want to make enough to pay the bills, chill with a beer and TV after work, take the family on the occasional vacation, finance a hobby or distraction and save a few bucks to retire and die out without much event. It’s sad, but it’s the way things are. Every once in a while someone would post something about “waking up the masses”, I get sad about their naïveté. Nothing will ever happen to make enough people to make a difference change. Most will just fall in line as they’re fucked in the ass raw. Dissenters will be called crazy and ignored, revolutionaries will be jailed or killed.

       I dislike the rule as well.  Shills have aged alt accounts to use and have likely done any account build up by now.  Some who were recently banned are now showing up on TMOR after being here for a long time.  I think there should be a greater focus on removing such users more quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule also deters new users from sticking around.

       I agree with your point about genuine users being able to have convenient anonymity for privacy reasons.

       In what way is your anonymity compromised by your account being more than 2 months old? That makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you stay anonymous on reddit is by choosing a username which isn't related to your real name, not telling anyone what that reddit username is, and not posting information which could lead others to work out your real name.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 month quarantine period for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a barrier to diminish trolling and abuse. It stops (most) people who have been banned from creating a new account and resuming posting immediately. It also deters those non-subscribers who create an alt account just to come here to troll and insult our sub.

       About what? You're not making a lot of sense. Everybody here values their anonymity, and we as mods are very strict about removing doxx.

       Apart from the admins (who know what your IP address is), there's no mechanism for anyone to find out who you are unless you reveal information about yourself - which presumably is what you did.

       I agree with this and the quarantine period. If people really believed in the shit they were spouting they wouldn't have to hide behind 100s of alts. Anyone could spend a few minutes and find out who I am yet I don't care as I don't post anything I wouldn't proudly defend publically.

       This is exactly why nothing we do will ever change what’s already started. The majority don’t want to disturb their suburban tranquility hypno state. They want to make enough to pay the bills, chill with a beer and TV after work, take the family on the occasional vacation, finance a hobby or distraction and save a few bucks to retire and die out without much event. It’s sad, but it’s the way things are. Every once in a while someone would post something about “waking up the masses”, I get sad about their naïveté. Nothing will ever happen to make enough people to make a difference change. Most will just fall in line as they’re fucked in the ass raw. Dissenters will be called crazy and ignored, revolutionaries will be jailed or killed.
