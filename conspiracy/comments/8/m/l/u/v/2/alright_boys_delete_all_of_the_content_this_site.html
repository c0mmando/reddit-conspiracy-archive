        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not saying that the recent &quot;delete your posts!!!!&quot; thread was false flag. </p>

<p>But </p>

<ul>
<li>What are the dangers of deleting all content versus reddit using it for an ad... If YOU felt paranoid about reddit, would you rush to ask <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to delete the entire community, as the first reaction? Maybe you would go to <a href="https://change.org">change.org</a> and start a petition for reddit to change... maybe brainstorm a few constructive approaches? or go to a less paranoid community? Why run to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and specifically ask for all the sources to be taken down voluntarily? </li>
<li>the 3.2k upvotes are remarkable. Amazing to see that such a destructive suggestion can get upvoted just because people are paranoid about reddit&#39;s revenue model and transparency about any potential use. Very irresponsible IMO. </li>
</ul>

<p>This topic of &quot;conspiracy theorists, flee!&quot; has become a pet peeve of mine. It&#39;s essentially the same message as when mainstream journalists use &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; as slang for &quot;wild speculation&quot;... and as when academics engineer stories about how &quot;conspiracy theorists are more likely to be loners&quot; or violent or whatever. If any conspiracies do exist, then surely their masters want the theories to disappear, and are willing to use academia and journalism to smear theorists. If there is a way to manipulate theorists to delete their own content voluntarily, then what could be more effective than that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re being sarcastic - and that sarcasm is from a person who (like, I guess, many) perhaps has a lot to hide.  If you are afraid in your life - of yourself, of who you are, of what you’ve done/what you’re doing, of how you think, of what you say, how you think people will think about you, etc, etc - then yes.  I imagine that this kind of thinking is the very thing that would take place.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t worry too much about what people think about me.  If I did, I imagine I wouldn&#39;t have chosen the career path I did.</p>

<p>I’m not perfect.  Again, far from it.  However, I try to have at least <em>some</em> awareness and understanding of what I’m about to say before I say it, and of the consequences and ramifications of my words and actions.  Because of this prior-thought I tend to give to what I communicate to others - wether on the internet or in person - I don’t really worry too much about/don’t worry really at all about being “afraid” or whatever about someone looking at my post history or what I&#39;ve said before.</p>

<p>If someone were to say “Oh, dude.  Did you say <em>that?”</em>. I would simply say “Yeah.  I did.  And?”</p>

<p>I try not to be honest and not lie in life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not financially independent and my current finances aren&#39;t enough to sustain me for the next, say, 50 years without having to have a job.  The next year or two?  Yeah.  Sure.  The next half a lifetime?  Not so much.</p>

<p>Although there is indeed a lot of unnecessary spite and catiness that occurs at times on the internet, I&#39;m actually glad that this culture has become more open because it&#39;s a lot easier for assholes and bullies to get exposed and called out.  Before, these types would have been able to be trolls and then go hide under rocks and not get called out.  Nowadays, it&#39;s more difficult for them to not get uncovered.  There are downsides, of course, but ultimately I&#39;m okay with the new trend that&#39;s moving toward more openness because it tends to make people a lot more accountable and more respectful of everyone else.</p>

<p>Well, since my comments haven&#39;t been &quot;alt-right/nazi&quot; leaning, I don&#39;t really worry about that too much either.  I am and have been before <em>very</em> critical of the zionist, racist, Ashkenazi Khazar apartheid state of Israel and the concentration camp-state they have the Palestinian people in, but - again - I stand behind those statements, don&#39;t take them back, and am not afraid of anyone reading them on here, since it&#39;s the actual truth of what&#39;s happening.  Heck, I&#39;m pretty strongly critical of <em>any</em> form of racism and have gotten into many a heated conversation with various people about it in this site.</p>

<p>Even if they are.  I mean if that’s how you feel, then fucking stand behind what you feel and don’t be a two-faced, racist coward.  Be who you are - whatever that may be.</p>

<p>I’m not saying <em>you are</em> a two-faced, racist coward, mind you.  I don’t know one way or the other since I don’t recall reading any of your statements, etc, but I’m just saying that if you <em>do</em> feel a certain way and that’s how you feel/how you are, then simply don’t hide it.  One can generally find out as they progress through life which ideas are correct and which aren’t.</p>

<p>Hiding too much doesn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>No one’s perfect - Palestinians included.  However, a racist, psychopathic bully’s a racist, psychopathic bully, and right now, Israel appears to be more that than not.</p>

<p>Either way, the Palestine/Israel issue is a side/immaterial issue to the greater point at hand here, so it&#39;s a tangent and bit besides the main point.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What’s weird about it?  A) it’s an example, B) it’s relevant to the topic being discussed, and C) there’s nothing wrong or “weird” about mentioning an example more than once, actually - especially if it’s a relevant example of something someone might express online but cower over if they’re identity might be exposed.  It’s actually very relevant in that sense.</p>

<p>If there’s really anything that’s “weird”, it’s the fact that you felt the need to point out something that’s actually <em>not</em> in fact that weird.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>those words are like freaking daggers to someone&#39;s soul, to assume that the benign shit you say online can be misinterpreted with such relative ease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then that’s the <em>very</em> reason that one should <em>REALLY</em> tailor what they say and watch how one communicates as carefully as possible.  Be as real and concise with your language as you can be and account for what you say and why you say it as much as possible.  That way you are much less likely to be misinterpreted.  Don’t just blurt things out to blurt them out.  That goes for anyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both sides of that conflict have blood on their hands, both sides have active users attempting to sway public opinion online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One owns the mainstream media.  One doesn’t.  The math as to who sways public opinion more is pretty basic and simple there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i won&#39;t carrying water for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  Again, it’s a tangential point to the main one here anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, what are you saying? Who is going to delete the shit they&#39;ve said because someone tells them to? </p>

<p>If that someone has any real clout they&#39;d just delete the user&#39;s account. </p>

<p>Most of the time I&#39;m just throwing things out there. If anyone of important acknowledges what I say, then what I say must be true. That&#39;s checkmate if you ask me!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often delete stuff that references my upbringing and my exact area. I&#39;ve had some very pointed PM&#39;s directed at me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? From Who? Like powerful people or any ol&#39; Tom, Dick &amp; Larry? That would be sick if someone powerful was like &quot;We&#39;re on to you mate.&quot; </p>

<p>Be like woohoo where&#39;s my autograph book!!</p>

<p>I was also under the impression that you only really delete things from the general public ans assumed anyone that cares enough and has the cloat could see what&#39;s been said anyway. </p>

<p>And truthfully if anything suspicious happens to me that would put my people on a different path. They&#39;d know there&#39;s some truth to the bullshit I sprout. Sooo worth it!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainly Tom, Dick, and Harry&#39;s but about 3 months back everyone was on about account length and real users. My account is pretty old, so they could have easily gone back to when I used it flippantly before getting into conspiracy.</p>

<p>Conspiracy brings out the worst in some people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record I knew it was Harry. Larry just sounds funnier.</p>

<p>I hope you told said Tom, Dick and Larry to go fuck themselves?</p>

<p>Yeah it sure does. I guess thats just Reddit and Social media. Keyboard warriors have a platform to talk shit. Though as with the above user, there&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve said that I don&#39;t stand behind and nothing I wouldn&#39;t or haven&#39;t already said in real life.</p>

<p>If there were more real life warriors about. Like straight up knights. Mo&#39;fuckas who would gladly give their lives for what they believe in or to bring their people a better life, the world would be so much better because they&#39;d be no more fear or worry. Their threats would mean nothing.</p>

<p>Instead the majority of people are cowards and just do what they are told...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re being sarcastic - and that sarcasm is from a person who (like, I guess, many) perhaps has a lot to hide.  If you are afraid in your life - of yourself, of who you are, of what you’ve done/what you’re doing, of how you think, of what you say, how you think people will think about you, etc, etc - then yes.  I imagine that this kind of thinking is the very thing that would take place.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t worry too much about what people think about me.  If I did, I imagine I wouldn&#39;t have chosen the career path I did.</p>

<p>I’m not perfect.  Again, far from it.  However, I try to have at least <em>some</em> awareness and understanding of what I’m about to say before I say it, and of the consequences and ramifications of my words and actions.  Because of this prior-thought I tend to give to what I communicate to others - wether on the internet or in person - I don’t really worry too much about/don’t worry really at all about being “afraid” or whatever about someone looking at my post history or what I&#39;ve said before.</p>

<p>If someone were to say “Oh, dude.  Did you say <em>that?”</em>. I would simply say “Yeah.  I did.  And?”</p>

<p>I try not to be honest and not lie in life.</p>
