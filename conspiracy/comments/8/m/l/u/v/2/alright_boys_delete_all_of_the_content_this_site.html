       Not saying that the recent "delete your posts!!!!" thread was false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       But
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        What are the dangers of deleting all content versus reddit using it for an ad... If YOU felt paranoid about reddit, would you rush to ask
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        to delete the entire community, as the first reaction? Maybe you would go to
        <a href="https://change.org">
         change.org
        </a>
        and start a petition for reddit to change... maybe brainstorm a few constructive approaches? or go to a less paranoid community? Why run to
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        and specifically ask for all the sources to be taken down voluntarily?
       </li>
       <li>
        the 3.2k upvotes are remarkable. Amazing to see that such a destructive suggestion can get upvoted just because people are paranoid about reddit's revenue model and transparency about any potential use. Very irresponsible IMO.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This topic of "conspiracy theorists, flee!" has become a pet peeve of mine. It's essentially the same message as when mainstream journalists use "conspiracy theory" as slang for "wild speculation"... and as when academics engineer stories about how "conspiracy theorists are more likely to be loners" or violent or whatever. If any conspiracies do exist, then surely their masters want the theories to disappear, and are willing to use academia and journalism to smear theorists. If there is a way to manipulate theorists to delete their own content voluntarily, then what could be more effective than that?

       You’re being sarcastic - and that sarcasm is from a person who (like, I guess, many) perhaps has a lot to hide.  If you are afraid in your life - of yourself, of who you are, of what you’ve done/what you’re doing, of how you think, of what you say, how you think people will think about you, etc, etc - then yes.  I imagine that this kind of thinking is the very thing that would take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't worry too much about what people think about me.  If I did, I imagine I wouldn't have chosen the career path I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not perfect.  Again, far from it.  However, I try to have at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       awareness and understanding of what I’m about to say before I say it, and of the consequences and ramifications of my words and actions.  Because of this prior-thought I tend to give to what I communicate to others - wether on the internet or in person - I don’t really worry too much about/don’t worry really at all about being “afraid” or whatever about someone looking at my post history or what I've said before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone were to say “Oh, dude.  Did you say
       <em>
        that?”
       </em>
       . I would simply say “Yeah.  I did.  And?”
      </p>
      <p>
       I try not to be honest and not lie in life.

       I'm not financially independent and my current finances aren't enough to sustain me for the next, say, 50 years without having to have a job.  The next year or two?  Yeah.  Sure.  The next half a lifetime?  Not so much.

       Although there is indeed a lot of unnecessary spite and catiness that occurs at times on the internet, I'm actually glad that this culture has become more open because it's a lot easier for assholes and bullies to get exposed and called out.  Before, these types would have been able to be trolls and then go hide under rocks and not get called out.  Nowadays, it's more difficult for them to not get uncovered.  There are downsides, of course, but ultimately I'm okay with the new trend that's moving toward more openness because it tends to make people a lot more accountable and more respectful of everyone else.

       Well, since my comments haven't been "alt-right/nazi" leaning, I don't really worry about that too much either.  I am and have been before
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       critical of the zionist, racist, Ashkenazi Khazar apartheid state of Israel and the concentration camp-state they have the Palestinian people in, but - again - I stand behind those statements, don't take them back, and am not afraid of anyone reading them on here, since it's the actual truth of what's happening.  Heck, I'm pretty strongly critical of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       form of racism and have gotten into many a heated conversation with various people about it in this site.

       That's always the reply I get, that if my comments weren't Naziish, but my comments aren't.

      <p>
       I can't control  how specific individuals handle a discussion and attempt to search out mistaken verbage as a clear cut example of someone's evil heart. I shouldn't need to defend it and I'm not defending what I say on here, anyone can read and decide for themselves.

       Preferably, I'm not a fan of either Palestine or the Jewish. Not in a racial sense, but because both are actively engaged in a huge propaganda campaign that I'll have no part of.

       Even if they are.  I mean if that’s how you feel, then fucking stand behind what you feel and don’t be a two-faced, racist coward.  Be who you are - whatever that may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying
       <em>
        you are
       </em>
       a two-faced, racist coward, mind you.  I don’t know one way or the other since I don’t recall reading any of your statements, etc, but I’m just saying that if you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       feel a certain way and that’s how you feel/how you are, then simply don’t hide it.  One can generally find out as they progress through life which ideas are correct and which aren’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiding too much doesn't help.

        I'm not a fan of either Palestine or the Jewish. Not in a racial sense, but because both are actively engaged in a huge propaganda campaign that I'll have no part of.

       No one’s perfect - Palestinians included.  However, a racist, psychopathic bully’s a racist, psychopathic bully, and right now, Israel appears to be more that than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the Palestine/Israel issue is a side/immaterial issue to the greater point at hand here, so it's a tangent and bit besides the main point.

       I do, and have said that. I find it weird you've thumbed in the racist stuff again though, maybe just the way you're phrasing it. It's funny, those words are like freaking daggers to someone's soul, to assume that the benign shit you say online can be misinterpreted with such relative ease brings me to my next point.

       Both sides of that conflict have blood on their hands, both sides have active users attempting to sway public opinion online. I'm not assuming it of you, but giving my justification for why i won't carrying water for it.

       What’s weird about it?  A) it’s an example, B) it’s relevant to the topic being discussed, and C) there’s nothing wrong or “weird” about mentioning an example more than once, actually - especially if it’s a relevant example of something someone might express online but cower over if they’re identity might be exposed.  It’s actually very relevant in that sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there’s really anything that’s “weird”, it’s the fact that you felt the need to point out something that’s actually
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       in fact that weird.

       So then that’s the
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       reason that one should
       <em>
        REALLY
       </em>
       tailor what they say and watch how one communicates as carefully as possible.  Be as real and concise with your language as you can be and account for what you say and why you say it as much as possible.  That way you are much less likely to be misinterpreted.  Don’t just blurt things out to blurt them out.  That goes for anyone.

       One owns the mainstream media.  One doesn’t.  The math as to who sways public opinion more is pretty basic and simple there.

       You’re being sarcastic - and that sarcasm is from a person who (like, I guess, many) perhaps has a lot to hide.  If you are afraid in your life - of yourself, of who you are, of what you’ve done/what you’re doing, of how you think, of what you say, how you think people will think about you, etc, etc - then yes.  I imagine that this kind of thinking is the very thing that would take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't worry too much about what people think about me.  If I did, I imagine I wouldn't have chosen the career path I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not perfect.  Again, far from it.  However, I try to have at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       awareness and understanding of what I’m about to say before I say it, and of the consequences and ramifications of my words and actions.  Because of this prior-thought I tend to give to what I communicate to others - wether on the internet or in person - I don’t really worry too much about/don’t worry really at all about being “afraid” or whatever about someone looking at my post history or what I've said before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone were to say “Oh, dude.  Did you say
       <em>
        that?”
       </em>
       . I would simply say “Yeah.  I did.  And?”
