He&#39;s a die-hard zionist who provokes random Muslims on the street and then records their reactions whilst cutting the initial provocation and says he was verbally attacked out of the blue. Shills love him because Zionist and anti-Islam and the closet Nazi&#39;s love him for racism. Even the co-founder of the English Defence League has denounced  Tommy for being basically an Israeli agent within the EDL using it to rally dumb brits to their Zionist cause.

    <div class="md"><p>A cult being the majority. A cult which rapes, stones women, pedophilia is normalized (Bacha Bazi), child and human trafficking is normalized</p>

<p>Islam is not a religion of unconditional peace. In Quran 60:8, &quot;Allah does not stop you from acting kind to unbelievers who won&#39;t put up a fight over Islam and will leave you alone in your homes.&quot; It sounds good if they&#39;re going to be &quot;kind&quot; to us, right? But notice how peace is allowed with only the quiet ones. In Quran 4:148, &quot;Allah does not like the public mention of evil&quot;. This is a hate speech law. You&#39;re not given the freedom of speech to criticize Islam in a religious debate. You&#39;re not allowed to draw a cartoon of Muhammad. In Quran 9:29, &quot;Fight those who do not believe in Allah... until they give the jizya willingly while they are humbled.&quot; Unbelievers can have peace as long as they pay a tax called &quot;jizya.&quot; Every mention of &quot;peace&quot; in the Quran is tied to certain terms and conditions that ensure Islam is the dominant force.</p>

<p>The liberal wants to defend the poor, innocent refugee against the big, bad bully (conservatives). Yes, we criticize the ideology, but we are not necessarily against the individual. It&#39;s possible that the local Muslim guy at the kebab shop is nice to customers. He&#39;s a human being who smiles, serves food, and pays his taxes. There&#39;s nothing wrong with these things, but the underlying problem is Islam on a religious, political, and historical level. In Quran 3:32, &quot;...Allah does not like the unbelievers.&quot; In Quran 98:6, &quot;Unbelievers from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and polytheists will live in the fire of hell. They are the worst of all creatures.&quot; In Quran 3:28, &quot;Muslim brothers must not put an unbeliever above other Muslims. Whoever does that will never be helped by Allah...&quot; Muslims are commanded to favor their own kind in business or politics. At the end of the day, the &quot;nice&quot; Muslim guy will obey his mosque and place his own family and other Muslims over you.</p>

<p>The liberal will say that Muslims had a &quot;Golden Age&quot; in history. The reality is that they fought with swords, traded slaves, and consolidated power. Muslims conquered Egypt, Persia, Spain, and Constantinople. The artisans and mathematicians were forced to work under an Islamic regime. The Muslims themselves did not bring an enlightening philosophy. They believed it was ok to drink from a pond that had a dead donkey. In the late 1700s, Muslims from Tripoli even captured American ships. &quot;The ambassador explained that Muslim pirates considered Americans to be infidels...&quot; Muslims also supported the Nazis. In modern times only 3 or about 0.5% of Nobel Prize winners are Muslim (excluding the Peace Prize and literature). Muslim schools are teaching children to be intolerant. They also teach that unbelievers will go to hell.</p>

<p>The liberal says that Muslims will integrate into society and enrich us with diversity. The reality is that Muslims can&#39;t eat bacon for breakfast, can&#39;t enjoy a beer at a baseball game, and can&#39;t play with a dog at the park. Their sisters and daughters can&#39;t wear a bikini at the beach. The reality is that Muslims may ask for a 15-minute break to do one of their 5 prayers or have lower productivity during their month of fasting for Ramadan.</p>

<p>I have about 100 more links that goes into all sorts of facts such as Incest being normalized, sub 70 IQ&#39;s, etc.</p>

<p>TL:DR Version: Anyone who supports reverting to a 3rd world cult that is 1000 years behind 2018, is fucking lunatic and we will end up having WW3 because of these lunatics. It will be the world vs Islam and the World will win just like it did against the Ottomans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong use of term “Limited hangout”. </p>

<p>A limited hangout is a release of information once an operation or operative is exposed to misguide the public into believing they’ve found “the truth” when in fact they were purposefully led down that path to hide a much greater secret. You could say that the Snowden revelations were a limited hangout because the information wasn’t exactly damaging to the NSA and was most likely to distract us from their new and more advanced operations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly. Patsies are used most often in limited hangouts. Snowden was most certainly part of a limited hangout but I don’t believe him to be a willing participant. </p>

<p>Do you really believe the intelligence apparatus would have allowed him to escape and leak information, if that intel was truly damaging.... </p>

<p>He hid in a room in Hong Kong, invited journalists yet the most powerful intelligence apparatus in the world wasn’t able to apprehend him??? </p>

<p>They wanted him to “leak” that info and that indicates to me that there was something much much bigger at play which the Snowden leaks distracted from.</p>

<p>Another example of a clear cut limited hangout was Jimmy Saville. Whilst he was alive evening was covered up. Once he died they finally released the atrocities committed by the man to cover up the bigger picture involving the monarchy and government. Operation YewTree was put in place to appease the UK public and make them feel like “justice” had been served. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hasabara are out in force.</p>

<p>The Zionists hate Tommy because he smartly latched onto the same rhetorical tactic like Richard Spencer and David Duke, by feigning to be pro-Israel and fawning over Israel&#39;s border Wall and tough no-BS immigration policies and unashamed Apartheid designed to preserve a Jewish majority and prevent Muslim invaders from settling.</p>

<p>I adore Tommy Robinson and consider him to be an historic Englishman right up there with Cromwell.</p>

<p>Tommy is the one guy in England who is simply speaking the truth about the Muslim invasion of England and calling out the UK ZOG on their BS.</p>

<p>England is a white country. There is nothing wrong with wanting to preserve that.</p>

<p>Notice (((who))) are the people who strangley are in constant opposition to preserving the heritage of England?</p>

<p>Every single time.</p>

<p>Asia for Asians.
Middle East for Arabs.
Africa for Africans.
Israel for the Jew.</p>

<p>White countries for everybody.</p>

<p>We are neck deep in a Zionist Infowar and Tommy is on the front lines in the gas filled trenches fighting back against the Infowar onslaught.</p>

<p>If you care one bit about the English people, you should support Tommy Robinson.</p>

<p>May Allah preserve Tommy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude I have never been so disgusted by our government. </p>

<p>I have been politically apathetic for most of my life after I experienced a sharp wake up call as a young kid. I was at school when the 1st parliament was televised and we were all sitting around to watch it and see the important people that ran our country. </p>

<p>When it went live we were greeted by scenes of Mps asleep, reading the newspaper and chatting amongst themselves. I can&#39;t remember how young I was at the time but I was in Primary school and looking back it affected me in a way that made me have no interest in politicians for many years.</p>

<p>Over the last decade with New Labour (tory lite) and the transformation of the Conservative party into basically Evil Corp I have grown increasingly angry with the way our country is run.</p>

<p>With the current front bench, we have the richest cabinet we have ever had. Nearly all of them are up to their eyeballs with Big Business and/or the private sector.</p>

<p>Watching our services be plundered and sold off, the funding cut to important services like Healthcare, womens shelters, Youth services, Mental health and the Police and the effects we are all seeing today from these cuts is really starting to take its toll. </p>

<p>This is before we even get started with the Tories obsession with backdoors into encryption, internet control and surveillance. </p>

<p>Oh, we could also talk about our booming arms business and the misery we export around the world.  </p>

<p>We could talk about how 2 weeks ago they released a statement saying they don&#39;t believe cannabis has any medical benefits at all and how it poses a danger to not only those that smoke it but also the people around smokers while conveniently forgetting to tell us that we are the worlds largest exporter of medical cannabis in the world. </p>

<p>This is the most corrupt and soulless government we have had in my lifetime. There is no lie they won&#39;t tell or figures they won&#39;t fudge to keep on in power and continue to line their and their friends&#39; pockets.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text but I fucking hate our sitting government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man absolutely in agreement with you. In terms of state spying, the UK got screwed with the silent but shitty Investigative Powers Bill (Snooper&#39;s Charter).
George Orwell warned us against this shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen parliament footage like that too, the puppet shitheads acting like spoiled brat kids laughing and making noise when the opposition are speaking seriously. When Corbyn speaks, sometimes the Tories deliberately make as much meaningless noise as possible to drown out what he&#39;s saying. Then the corporate media can parrot &quot;Corbyn&#39;s a bad leader see! He&#39;s weak! BTW let&#39;s boomb Syria for profit.&quot; -_-
Brutality and strength are two different things. Warmongers are pathetic.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read bad things about that NEOliberal shill Thatcher, guessing the current Tories are emulating that woman, maybe they&#39;re worse, I don&#39;t know. But the UK hasn&#39;t been shat on this hard for at least decades. Only the elites&#39; economy is on the up, exact opposite is true for the people.</p>

<p>UK had hung parliament, Corbyn almost pulled it off despite media bullshit like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/dwd7E88.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/dwd7E88.jpg</a></p>

<p>But then the retarded DUP screwed over their northern Irish people AND the rest of Britain by allowing a Tory coalition victory, in exchange for cheap pocket money. Their people would have a much better economy without NEOliberals in charge. Here&#39;s hoping the current UK government gets their asses kicked out next election, they truly have no shits about the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the snoopers charter has been taking a beating recently in the courts. A group called Liberty got their 1st win in court last month. </p>

<p>As for parliament now.. what you see most often is PMs questions which is really just a dog and pony show. The jeering and shit is just British politics I don&#39;t begrudge them it, that is why we have a speaker. At least they are engaged. Both sides do it during PMqs :)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hold out a lot of hope for the next GE if Labour doesn&#39;t take it it could be another decade of Tory rule. </p>

<p>The thing is while we have people like Diana Abbot (a great local mp but imo a hopeless cabinet member) in the Shadow front bench I don&#39;t think they will swing the vote. The other problem is the likes of Momentum trying to push out Corbyn picks in local races for their own guys. This alienates moderates and will cause them to throw in with the Tories.</p>

<p>There has never really been a big Right vs Left in the UK it was always working class - middle class - Elites but recently with Brexit and the GE they have really driven the wedge in and split the populace almost down the middle which has severely weakened the working class. Now we are seeing a right vs left argument like they have in the States and that is much easier for a party such as the Tories to manage and control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The divide strangely seems to be about immigration mostly. It&#39;s odd because mass immigration isn&#39;t necessarily left wing except maybe the compassion part. Angela Merkel is pro-mass immigration but her party is very right wing economically. Plus the root causes are caused by very right wing problems: NEOcon wars for profit, NEOliberal globalist economics (workers move from poor countries after being exploited hard by transnational corporations, thus immigration to &quot;richer&quot; countries increases). </p>

<p>This leads to more workers in a country, then we have to compete for low wages when it should be businesses that compete. There&#39;s probably also the factor of secret society and/or corporate influence on the leaders of poor countries. I&#39;m economically center left (like Corbyn, Clement Atlee and George Orwell, I believe) but only tolerate mass immigration just to allow victims of war and economic slavery to escape the bullshit.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s insane is some people online (some may be shills) are pushing the narrative that
&quot;Corbyn would flood the country with immigrants!! Vote Tory!&quot; when they&#39;re ignoring the obvious fact
Tories have allowed mass immigration for a decade. You can&#39;t make this shit up. I don&#39;t think mass immigration is problem number 1 (social program funding is way more of a problem, NHS being partially privatized is going to have bad effects). But with Corbyn, he won&#39;t fuel the root causes like war and globalist economics. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with Momentum, but be careful who these &quot;moderates&quot; are. If they&#39;re like Blairites, then they can go join the right wing Lib Dems and leave us alone. If they&#39;re like centrist, I don&#39;t think center left and centrist are that polarized. I don&#39;t mind centrist economics myself, way better than Tory/Blairite economics. I just think Momentum are being demonized by the extremely biased right wing media (even the supposedly &quot;left wing&quot; Guardian writes suspicious stuff sometimes). Just my view from what I&#39;ve seen.
I hope Corbyn can also &quot;drain the swamp&quot; of Blairites like Sadiq Khan (I think).</p>

<p>Nah man New Labour was nothing more than Tory-lite I have 0 love for them at all. I am talking about in the local councils where Momentum was trying to push out Corbyn picks in a few seats for their own guys. This isn&#39;t about pushing out the Blairites but cementing Momentums place in the party. Don&#39;t get me wrong they are an incredibly effective tool, as we saw in the GE, and understand how to connect through social media and events.</p>

<p>This is what gets me and how the wedge they have driven into our country has been so effective. We have working class people voting for a party that wants to destroy their healthcare, roll back eu protections on workers rights and are clearly only making changes that benefit the top tier of our society. </p>

<p>People seem to forget the Tories have been in power for 8 years now, all the shit that is happening is their own fault. I guess we still have the PFI problem etc that was spearheaded by Blair and Brown but the majority of our problems are from Tory austerity and their blatant disregard for the vulnerable in our society.</p>

<p>Apparently Corbyn and the left are going to flood us with immigrants while Maybot as the home secretary completely failed to check immigration from outside the EU and presided over scaling down of our border forces and immigration officers. </p>

<p>We clearly have a problem with grooming gangs at the moment and I am all for deporting anyone that commits a crime while awaiting asylum with a 0 tolerance position.</p>

<p>You see users on this sub who have clearly no idea about the realities of living in Britan going on about how the Muslim invasion is causing the spikes of violent crime in our cities while the reality is for the last 5 years our Police have been predicting this crime spike and elevated gang violence if cuts continue the way they are going.</p>

<p>Last year Amber Rudd told the Police that they were scaremongering to get more money. One year later everything they have predicted has come true.</p>

<p>With the defunding of after-school programs, youth clubs, community outreach and the like coupled with lack of funds for effective policing we get the crime levels we are seeing in our cities at the moment.</p>

<p>I would like to see this government held to account for what they have done and what they continue to do but sadly I see it getting a lot worse before it gets better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you&#39;ve said but when discussing with others, I really recommend not to give a blanket statement of muslims (people may think of you as bigoted for example and not worth listening to). </p>

<p>A lot of muslims are decent people (I&#39;ve met plenty good + a few bad that are just regular bad eggs nothing to do with religion) and don&#39;t do anything culturally backwards while the seriously bad ones (rapist gangs and MKUltra-Saudi Arabia style wahhabists) do give them a bad name. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m in total agreement, if someone can&#39;t behave decently, they don&#39;t deserve the country&#39;s hospitality. Same with criminal mafia thugs from other countries too. Although I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a violent immigrant&#39;s innocent family....maybe social services or something. I believe in rehabilitation and giving people a second chance but some people do cross the line repeatedly, those ones should be dealt with appropriately. </p>

<p>I live in a predominately Muslim area in north London and I have never had so much of a sideways glance from a single person here, lived here 7 years now and the whole area is friendly and outgoing.</p>

<p>As for the family, you can&#39;t deport a whole family because of one persons crimes. But if you commit even a minor crime while awaiting asylum you should be denied. It sounds harsh but if someone is going to break the law while waiting for asylum when people should be on their best behaviour you can be fairly sure that will continue. </p>

<p>But being anti-mass immigration doesn&#39;t automatically make you socially far right or racist. UKIP is basically almost the same shit shill policies as Tories:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/charts/uk2017">https://www.politicalcompass.org/charts/uk2017</a></p>

<p>No one can guarantee fair immigration or closed borders. It won&#39;t stop
until the root causes are reduced (corporate jobs outsourcing/globalism, profiteering war and 3rd world corruption of the economies).</p>

<p>That stuff makes people move countries.
Then worker wages may go down as workers have to compete for shit wages.
I trust Corbyn and his allies but not all of his party (Blairites like Sadiq Khan are shitty center right corporate shills almost as bad as far right corporate Tories).</p>

<p>But someone honest like Corbyn would at least stop fueling the root causes
since he&#39;s anti-war (but pro-defense), against corruption and globalist NEOliberal economics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am so glad I don&#39;t live in Europe!  The EU functions like a totalitarian master, ruling over all European countries, and the leaders of each country follow the EU&#39;s orders.  The barbarian invaders, the Muslims were given rights that the real citizens od Europe used to have but no longer have.  It&#39;s a damned nightmare!  The people of Europe are being censored, indoctrinated, and told only propagands to keep them from organizing against the EU and the Muslim savages.  We have the leftists here in the U.S. trying to do the same crap, but we don&#39;t have a EU stepping on our necks, and we have a Constitutional law guaranteeing freedom of speech.  I admire conservatives in Europe.  The leftists there, and everywhere, are evil bastards who use Islam to destabilize Western countries.  I won&#39;t even say what they deserve, but they deserve it.</p>

<p>reporting outside of a court about the muslim grooming gangs isn&#39;t bad behavior. There is no excuse for what the Orwellian British Gov did to this guy even if you dont agree with his take on the british muslim take over and all the grooming gangs that have gone on for decades without any of the police doing anything about it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you&#39;ve said but when discussing with others, I really recommend not to give a blanket statement of muslims (people may think of you as bigoted for example and not worth listening to). </p>

<p>A lot of muslims are decent people (I&#39;ve met plenty good + a few bad that are just regular bad eggs nothing to do with religion) and don&#39;t do anything culturally backwards while the seriously bad ones (rapist gangs and MKUltra-Saudi Arabia style wahhabists) do give them a bad name. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m in total agreement, if someone can&#39;t behave decently, they don&#39;t deserve the country&#39;s hospitality. Same with criminal mafia thugs from other countries too. Although I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with a violent immigrant&#39;s innocent family....maybe social services or something. I believe in rehabilitation and giving people a second chance but some people do cross the line repeatedly, those ones should be dealt with appropriately. </p>
