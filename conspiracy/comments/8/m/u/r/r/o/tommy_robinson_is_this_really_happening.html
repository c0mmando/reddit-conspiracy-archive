<p>Yes, unfortunately it&#39;s real. Welcome to the UK, and the future of the West...</p>

<p>Because of a gag order in the UK at least, and the fact that he&#39;s been painted as an alt-right radical by the UK Press, so the US Press wants nothing to do with him. </p>

<p>an independent journalist live streaming the arrival of the pedos to court is not a &#39;mistrial&#39;. Journalists and citizens alike are allowed to be outside any court, and in this case it&#39;s highly suggest t hat the people keep the courts in check considering the lengthy amount of pedo gangs that have been allowed to continue</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had to divert the jury through another entrance so that they didnt come into contact with Robinson, who wasnt just standing quietly. There were also signs warning not to film, and security warned him multiple times.</p>

<p>The defence could <em>abso-fucking-lutely</em> claim for mistrial by saying that Robinson had prejudiced the jurys opinions. Which Im sure Robinson wouldve loved because it wouldve allowed him to spin a narrative around it.</p>

<p>Its honestly mindboggling to me that so many people are falling for his spin in this case. He was told not to do it again or he&#39;d serve his suspended sentence. <em>Then he did it again, and literally just pleaded guilty.</em></p>

<p>Also worth noting that a good friend of Tommy and a founding member of the EDL, Richard Price, is a convicted pedophile. Tommy has defended Price in the past and said he was stitched up. I think that shows you how much Tommy Robinson actually cares about kids getting molested i.e. he doesnt unless he can use it as an excuse to yell at brown people.</p>

<p>You defend his right to show up and yell at &quot;alleged&quot; pedophiles, but the convicted pedophile that hes friends with? Nah that dudes probably been stitched up.</p>

<p>it depends. People who are fighting against the Gov, often times get framed. On the other hand, in Islam, pedophilia is part of the culture:</p>

<p>Its 2 different situations. Its 1 guy who you said possibly got stitched, versus a pedo trafficking gang, which is something normal in Islam. Apples and oranges mate</p>

<p>if he did it and is convicted for it, then yeah fuck him.</p>

<p>But the muslim pedos on trail, this is part of muslim culture. They practice pedophilia, bacha bazi, and child trafficking in their home countries as a regular part of their culture there, that&#39;s the point you are not getting.</p>

<p>As more and more muslims come into UK and it spreads, you will always find child pedophila and trafficking going on because its systematic cultural practice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hes talking about the source I listed. Hes completely misunderstood the context of the source though so Ill lay it out so you can get a better understanding.</p>

<p>Robinsons original charge was from his actions on 8/05/2017. This caused the jury for the case to be diverted so that the defense could not claim mistrial for having the jurys judgement prejudiced. He was charged and given a suspended sentence on 22/05/2017 and the ruling given was that should he show up and do the same thing again that he would no longer have a suspended sentence and he would have to serve it. Thats where the link that I gave you is from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In short, Mr Yaxley-Lennon, turn up at another court, refer to people as “Muslim paedophiles, Muslim rapists” and so and so forth while trials are ongoing and before there has been a finding by a jury that that is what they are, and you will find yourself inside. Do you understand?“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then showed up at court while cases were ongoing and did just that.</p>

<p>He also has already pleaded guilty to contempt of court.</p>

<p>So he got an official warning instead of getting locked up. Then he did it again, pled guilty, and got locked up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In short, Mr Yaxley-Lennon, turn up at another court, refer to people as “Muslim paedophiles, Muslim rapists” and so and so forth while trials are ongoing and before there has been a finding by a jury that that is what they are, and you will find yourself inside. Do you understand?“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then showed up at court while cases were ongoing and did just that.</p>

<p>He also has already pleaded guilty to contempt of court.</p>

<p>So he got an official warning instead of getting locked up. Then he did it again, and got locked up.</p>

<p>If this were some grand judicial conspiracy then why didnt the judge lock him up a year ago when he had every opportunity to?</p>

<p>I quickly looked up coverage from the BBC and found this article:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44124556">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44124556</a></p>

<p>Which seems pretty neutral on the whole thing, but tacitly and ever so slightly gives benefit of the doubt to the Palestinian terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So from what I’ve gathered what he did is technically not “illegal” as he was filming outside of the courthouse but there’s some weird English (UK) rule that stipulates that he isn’t allowed to film these people specifically because it hinders the “states” (that’s what they call it here in the US, they might just refer to it as the “governments”) ability to give these guys a fair trial. Another way to say it is “he can’t film them because if he does and it leaks then most jury’s will find him guilty prematurely, this they won’t have a fair trial”. </p>

<p>The laws regarding this are very different in the US as most main stream media outlets are quick to pull the trigger on filming alleged criminals and broadcasting their images with gory details of what they’re being accused. Apparently this is either strictly illegal in the UK, or is heavily frowned upon, and in this case specifically protected by court order of a judge. So in any regard, technically what he did was illegal, either by English (UK) law or because a judge ordered it. I’m not entirely sure as I know very little about British law compared to that of the US but this is what I’ve gathered after a little digging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the reason he was “breaching the peace” is because a judge strictly ordered him <em>not to film/report</em> on the people he was reporting on because it would lead to other people to assume they were guilty before their trial thus giving them a reason for a mistrial.

<p>Secondly you need to understand how British law differs from American law, and the fact that a current suspended sentence becomes in effect if you reoffend. Filming on court grounds is a government offense in the UK and anytime you see reporters there during high profile cases, they&#39;re off court property, so not committing an offense, or much more likely to be on the day of conviction/case closure </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a contempt of court for anyone i.e. public or press, to use, or take into court for use, a tape recorder or other recording device, without the consent of the Court. Similarly it is a contempt to use or publish any such recording. The court may in its discretion allow such recordings to be made. To be safe, programme-makers who are attending court should not take into court recording devices even where there is no intention of using them.</p>

<p>Taking photographs, filming and sketching (if intended for publication) are also prohibited in court. This includes not just inside the courtroom but anywhere within the court building and its precincts. Filming parties to proceedings as they arrive and leave the court house is also technically forbidden but in practice this rule is not enforced e.g. pictures of defendants and witnesses arriving and leaving the Royal Courts of Justice or the &#39;Old Bailey&#39; are commonly shown. Regarding sketching, whilst sketching in court is prohibited if intended for publication, attending court, memorising proceedings and then making a sketch afterwards is permissible.</p>

<p>Where court proceedings are open to the public and where there are no reporting restrictions in place journalists may now use live, text-based communications (e.g. email or Twitter) to communicate directly from courts in England and Wales where it is for the purpose of fair and accurate reporting. Anyone using electronic text is strictly bound by the restrictions on reporting court proceedings under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49">Contempt of Court Act 1981</a>. Equipment should be unobtrusive, hand-held and silent. In Scotland permission for journalists to use live, text-based communications from court requires permission from the judge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two sides</p>

<p>“Martyr” side: TR is a martyr being imprisoned by a tyrannical government for minding his own business and being a journalist. some quiet dog whistles on this side cause defendants in court he was picketing are muslim.</p>

<p>“Tyrannical gov’t” side: TR jeopardized the court trials of pedophiles and committed a crime in the process while already on a suspended prison sentence so he was sent to prison. some of the folks on this side are bringing up TR’s history with the EDL and racebaiting, which to me is out of place since it has nothing to do with why he was charged but probably has something to do with why he was there in the first place. either way it waters down  the argument of the, imo, more rational side by bringing race into it. </p>

<p>courts tend to care pretty heavily about the law as it turns out, so when some asshat threatens to cause a mistrial for dozens of pedophiles for influencing the jury and he’s breaking a law in the process, they throw the book at them. honestly if it wasn’t TR but some other asshat he could have been seen as trying to cause a mistrial. I had no idea who this guy was prior to hearing about what happened and I thought the outrage that came from it was inorganic as fuck, especially on this sub. we have multiple posts on the front page about the 1500 kids but some dude gets thrown in jail after putting a number of pedophile trials at risk and he’s a martyr?</p>

<p>I mean people are saying he deserves it because he ignored the courts orders for basic censorship.. which is just fucked.</p>

<p>People are mad because he is antagonising child fucking traffickers.. which is also just fucked.</p>

<p>Tommy has fair judgement and seems to be fairly level headed - the amount of abuse he receives and deals with fairly and with conversation is inspirational.</p>

<p>if he did it and is convicted for it, then yeah fuck him.</p>

<p>But the muslim pedos on trail, this is part of muslim culture. They practice pedophilia, bacha bazi, and child trafficking in their home countries as a regular part of their culture there, that&#39;s the point you are not getting.</p>

<p>As more and more muslims come into UK and it spreads, you will always find child pedophila and trafficking going on because its systematic cultural practice</p>
