       Do you think Jeff Bezos told the CIA/NSA no when they came to talk to him about using his company to achieve more control through surveillance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Eric Schmidt said no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world aren't putting together a plan that incorporates AI programming into everything that involves surveillance/control of movement/communication?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't they? How could they not see the increasing level of civil unrest that is occurring? How could they not see the increasing levels of mistrust occurring?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they going to change their ways to "alleviate" the problem? Or are they going to double or triple down on their ability to "control" the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are we seeing happen right now? Are we seeing the media use their power to help police the intelligence agencies that would have to be involved with this? Or are we seeing the exact opposite? Are we seeing the media and the intelligence agencies cooperate with each other in order to pursue this agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know with absolute certainty that the transportation industry was going to become completely automated within the next 20/50 years...when would you start looking at ways to control that automation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you going to try to do it a couple years before it happens? 5 years? 10 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you going to do it from the very beginning?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many aspects of the system would you seek to control? One of them? A few of them? Or all of them? The satellites? The GPS software? The surveillance cameras? The cell phone networks? The vehicles? The street networks themselves? The RFID chips?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can anyone believe that when law enforcement know with absolute 100% certainty that the transportation industry is going to become automated, that they aren't going to say..."great...install kill switches that we can control...no more high speed pursuit...thank you very much". It's not believable.. at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you going to be honest while you do it? Are you actually going to tell people that "yes, we have a plan to incorporate these technologies to make it possible for us to track and control the movements of any citizen we need to in the interests of national security"?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much of a factor is Tesla/Musk in the "vehicle" equation at this time? 25%? 50%? 75%? How much of a factor does it have to be in order for it to become a matter of "future national security"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking...seriously...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe they aren't figuring out how to accomplish this? That they aren't figuring out which companies/individuals are mandatory factors in the equation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe they're going to try to do it without the owners of the companies knowledge/cooperation?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only two points of contention I see with all of this...is "when" and "how much"?
      </p>
      <p>
       When is the automation going to happen...and how much will be mandatory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is is going to be all vehicles? If not, how many..which ones..and most importantly...who will get to retain manual operation of their vehicles?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us know that 50 years isn't that long...it's not really that far away at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem like it is to you...but trust me...it's not. It goes by faster than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways...that's my pure speculation for the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is up with the Musk versus Media thing that's going on...and I think it involves way more than "shareholders concerns".

       I think once citizens catch more drift of Michael Hastings and the guy outside Indianapolis, there will be a demand for low cost, simple, mechanical cars with no brain in them.  No connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the manufacturers will fill that need.
Or customizers will make killing modifying cars to not have satellite technology in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or vintage cars will skyrocket in value regardless of all other factors.

       If you're sick of it then quit posting and making claims without anything to back them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you make the extraordinary claim that Musk must have had an Israeli contract and that him refusing it is the reason Tesla crashes, it is then on you to provide the necessary evidence to back said claim. I don't see how asking for this evidence is in any way unreasonable, especially on this sub, regardless of how 'curt' the request may seem.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're that jaded, then take a break, the world isn't going anywhere. And if it does, well not like we'll be around to notice it.

       Or was all of it second-class information, designed to punish people who a) ask for evidence b) do so rudely c) probably never read it and d) trust rando anons on the internet, instead of researching for themselves?

       Or just support your claims with actual evidence maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       So since I've called out your shit links, they're now "second-class information" designed to punish those who ask you to verify your claims? I could care less about what you're specifically referring to, what I care about is when claims are made on this sub and someone asks for supporting evidence to said claim, they shouldn't be shit on for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, a lot of people have the mentality of claiming something, then when anyone asks for supporting evidence, they're told to "research it yourself, bruh". I find such a response to be a fallacy, as the person asking for the supporting evidence is, by definition, conducting research into the topic by asking the OP for their evidence and perspective on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why share the best info related to the topic? Because you care about the truth and the topic at hand enough to spread awareness of said topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps you don't care about those things, and would rather sling around baseless claims without anything substantial to back them up. Just the fact alone that you linked a paywalled source is bad enough. Now they're supposed to punish those who don't "conduct their own research". How pathetic.

       The movie inception, The Matrix, and Black Mirror(the christmas epsiode especially) are important culture on the world that's headed our way.   Phillip K. Dick(there is a story where a person has so many nightmares they can't believe the real world anymore)
and The Truman Show are instructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In times past we had true intellectual leaders like Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov, in our time, for some reason all we get is Neil Degrass Tyson and he's not really cutting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Joy's the future doesn't need us is interesting.  Asimov's the three laws of robotics, which will not be followed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't watched Person of Interest, I think that series comes closest to describing what it is like to be a pawn in the world of Palantir, when you know it has flagged you and you are being followed.  Which has happened to me, and I think is still happening even though I left the country.

       Nexus is an important novel on the subject.  If you get nanobots in youre brain, you might be able to be made telepathic, and then a satellite signal comes from orbit and now you lost control of your body......

       you're not going to have any luck deciphering bare metal physical reality if you can't see through the lies of your daily life and escape the invisible strings of control that most of us are yanked around by since childhood.

      <p>
       Also, if you aren't really free of those your investigations are going to attract people and institutions(read: cops) who intentionally sabotage everything you do, if not outright finding a way to entrap you in a whole other layer of illusion like The Truman Show or Inception, or someone in The Matrix who is placed in yet another Matrix for good keeping.

       As I have posted elsewhere, gnawing on the edge of the cage is a political activity that the people who run this place see as a threat.

       I suspect and evidence exists that certain bloodlines and power pyramids want a monopoly on the power to gnaw at the cage, or believe themselves to be true gnostic masters.

       I just checked out your comment history for a few minutes. You can understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back in the late 90s I came up with an idea to create a baseline of facial heat signatures by using subjects undergoing different emotional and mental states with thermal imaging..Obviously anger, nervousness and anxiety were at the top of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a machinist at the time..never got around to doing it..the computer capabilities weren't there anyways...
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all changed...I think about that idea from time to time. I know damn well I'm not the only one who thought of it. And it was 20 years ago almost...so I figure, they've got the baseline programming down to a T by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think they'll take the surveillance that far (using thermo imaging) Or do you think they'll just use AI programs that map facial expressions/body motions and such?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, have you thought of other ways they'll accomplish the predictive behavior analysis that I haven't mentioned?

       why bother with image recognition when you can go direct to the source?  from a great distance?  and then inject what you want into the source?

       That's a very clever idea and I have no doubt you're right in that it's probably already in use, likely in conjunction with other tells, but predictive behavior analysis is something I'm not at all versed in.

       no info...just theoretical speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can definitely target a specific area by key word searches through the multiple social media platforms and get a really good idea of how hot an area is getting...as they start to see a ramp up of activity that doesn't relate to peak activity patterns/parameters then I think they start to tap into other more specific communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they get access to instagram and whatsapp data from the NSA...then they are pretty much "johnny on the spot".
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect they have full NSA permissions...unless the CIA is actually running the whole project...then they get both, most likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're back dooring the phones of individuals that appear to be main nexus points of the conversations/activity...or track the data back to initial start point statements from users that appear to be nexus points..then they already have the organizers tagged...
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're able to take pictures of those subjects through their phones...then they just feed those into their facial recognition program that's set up for that specific hot spot they've been monitoring..
      </p>
      <p>
       If the city has a decent surveillance system in the downtown area...well then...theoretically...they could pick them up anytime they wanted....as soon as those faces tripped the cameras...there's also the phones GPS tracking signal...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing...I believe they mention something about a response communications network that works in tandem with the program...it sends out alerts already...I know that for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is...who's on the list for that network? Because they don't say much about that at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a few speculations I've made about the project.

       I just watched an episode of Electric Dreams on Amazon and there was a guy holding out on using automated cars.  Not to spoil things, but they found a way to force him to use them. I can see that happening in real life someday.

       Where do u think elon gets his money from? The entrepreneur business man is the perfect cover for the govt to build shit with tax dollars or missing money and claim a man did it in case there is an issue. He will probably be used for the next gen of faked space travel now that nasa is under the gun. We will all eat it up because we like the idea of the science man who will save us from our selves.

       good luck having fun playing Eve Online or idk inventing something when your processor's intel chip backdoor has been leaked from the mossad, to the ex-mossad, to the mafia, to your next door neighbor.

       will be more problematic when said chip is in your car....or your brain.....

       this is a global problem.  i write about it a lot here and on steemit.

       if this is the level of your analysis, you need to do a lot more reading.  i say this as politely as i can.
