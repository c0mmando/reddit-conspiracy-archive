       I mean Bill Cosby, Morgan Freeman (have yall seen the only footage caught on video about all this?) And now Steve Harvey is getting accused.
      </p>
      <p>
       And didn't  Terry Crews piss off some high up hollywood people? Maybe there's a correlation to him saying something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave Chappelle did a sit down in the Actors Studio (i believe?) And said part of the reason Hollywood shunned him was because he wouldn't wear womens clothing. This is during a time of Tyler Perry movies, The Waynes brothers and i believe even Mr. Bill Cosby in his tv show, all feminized in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at the Superbowl commercial from this year; there's a commercial where Peter Dinklage does a lip sync over a Busta Rhymes song. The NEXT commercial they have Morgan Freeman but over a Missy Elliot song.

        The best way to restore public faith in government institutions is to “send Hillary to prison“, according to Hollywood icon Morgan Freeman, who warns that unless the former First Lady’s crimes are seen to be punished, “everyday Americans will forever know, deep down, that there is one law for those with money and power, and another for the rest of us.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Hillary should be in jail for her unlawful deeds and President Trump should absolutely, absolutely make sure this happens to send the very strong message that no-one, and I mean no-one, is above the law in the United States of America,” Morgan Freeman said in New York while promoting National Geographic’s new docu-series The Story of Us.

       Cosby has been accused of this long before "a few years ago" though. In the 80's one woman went to a reporter about it. In the 90's another woman did an interview. In the early 2000's a woman filed a police report. In the mid-2000's Cosby settled for $3.5M in the Constead case where she also had 13 other alleged victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Freeman isn't conservative? He's a Democrat and was a big Clinton supporter in the election. He did voice overs for Clinton campaign ads and was also in a video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz9PNoecNxU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        urging an investigation into Russia
       </a>
       . He also just interviewed Bill Clinton last year. Do you have a source he laid into Clinton?

       No, it was a Walmart truck. Unless there was some loophole that stuck KMart, a company that’s barely in operation, with the bill, pretty sure it was Walmart.

       I watched a video recently stating that all these allegations came out against Cosby because he was trying to buy NBC. He was unhappy about how black people are portrayed on television.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to add that I find the lack of evidence against Cosby kind of suspicious. I haven't heard of any physical evidence, only accounts of being raped while drugged. I'm not saying these accounts are fictitious, I just find it odd that they ALL have the same story. If they were to undergo questioning, they have an easy out "I can't remember. I was drugged." I just think that for all of these stories to come out now, decades later, and all at once is just kind of... I don't know. Strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back when all the MJ allegations were going on, I really thought he was molesting kids. But now, looking back, I don't really think so anymore. I just wonder if this will end up like that in 50 years "yeah I thought Cosby was guilty back then, but... Not so sure in retrospect."
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, let's not forget the people who control all our media and government have a long history of sexual misconduct. Why aren't they getting buried with the same allegations?

       And I'm glad you threw chappelle's inside the actors studio in there. I love that episode. He's A wise dude. He drops hints on what the elite are up to in his stand ups. I'm glad he keeps out of the spotlight. I'm sure they'd bury him too eventually. He just knows too much, openly disapproves of Hollywood's ways.

       The Cosby buying NBC theory is ridiculous.
Cosby doesn't have 1/100th the money to buy that network. Last I checked its value was around 30 billion dollars.
Cosby's net worth ....400 million and he's been spending shit loads paying lawyers and women he (allegedly) slept with...

       Without question, Bill Cosby is a piece of shit rapist. However, it was apparently common knowledge in the industry, so why did they wait so long to destroy him. I expect he pissed somebody off. Maybe the same somebody that Weinstein pissed off.

       There were rumblings of Bill Cosby’s actions for YEARS, especially amongst the comedy and Hollywood scene. However, making allegations against stuff like that when you aren’t involved isn’t really a good move, so no one said anything. Then Hannibal Burress said something in a stand up special, shed a light on it, and it took off like wildfire.
      </p>

       Unfortunately, he’s probably a rapist. And OJ, probably a murder; MJ and Prince, probably drug addicts. Kanye and Katt, crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Freeman, he may just be a creep. He did have that weird phase where he was accused of having an affair with his step granddaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, there are HUNDREDS of AA actors who AREN’T being accused of anything, who aren’t being diminished, and who have very successful careers. On the opposite side of that coin, there’s also just as many WHITE celebrities that ARE being accused, diminished, and destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t really think color has anything to do with the outcome of all these lives and careers....

       The similarity between Freeman and Cosby is that they both have old school civil rights MLK era ethics that focuses on the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       This contrasts to the current system that is based on collectivism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their attitude is that being black is secondary to their character/accomplishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a contrast to Hollywood's attitude that being black is the most important thing and accomplishments are secondary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollywood exploits black people. When Cosby was popular in the 80s, his thing was that he was a black guy that seemed just like anyone else. He showed middle America that black people weren't all scary like how Hollywood had portrayed them previously in the 70s.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with black people that don't 'act black' is that the industry can't rip off their music, fashion styles, trends, etc and resell them to suburban youth who are sold entertainment and product that is derivative of what people misconstrue as 'black culture'.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the main reason the US adopted 'multiculturalism' as an ideology over nationalism, is that so they could systemically keep using 'black people' politically and economically.

       I don't see "Hollywood" going after anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I see are a fair number of sexual predators in Hollywood who just happen to have a great deal of money, power, and influence using it to extort sexual favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Predators who have gotten away with it for decades to the point where it's virtually expected and that anyone aspiring to any kind of a career in TV or the movies in front of or even behind the cameras is liable to have to prostitute themselves in order to obtain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like anyone didn't know that it was going on or that it was morally and criminally wrong, either. Just that no one was actually brave enough to come forward out of the fear that they wouldn't be believed or not get themselves blacklisted for outing some of these big important people and celebrities because that's exactly what happened to more than a few who tried. It just goes to show you how corrupt and pernicious the practice had actually become.
