        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, because the internet, I was looking around old photos from the excavations of Baalbek (Temple of Jupiter) in Lebanon. And came across these pictures showing different points of view of the entrance.</p>

<p>The first picture here is post excavation:
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b16182/">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b16182/</a></p>

<p>This second picture though which is from the inside, and obviously from before the excavation: <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b16182/">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b16182/</a></p>

<p>If you download the 12mb Tif file and zoom it becomes more obvious imo.</p>

<p>Now am I crazy or does it look like the black area behind them is edited in some way. Shouldnt that, if it is a shadow cover at least the guys standings faces?</p>

<p>So why was the tower on top of the columns outside the entrance of the Temple of Jupiter/Bacchus/Baal removed between 1915 (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.25926/">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.25926/</a>) and 1936 (<a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/matpc.03482/">https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/matpc.03482/</a>)?

    <div class="md"><p>Those guys are in front of all of the shadow-casting structures. That blackness doesn&#39;t look like it was edited, it looks normal for a scan like that. The detail in the shadows are probably lost to the dynamic range of the film. They might have to overexpose the rest of the subject if they wanted to include the black portion in the shot. Or they could have chosen a time of day with less harsh sunlight. That was poor lighting, for sure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not nearly as nice a print as in your first link. There is marked difference in quality of photographer, print, and scan between the two prints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might be right.</p>

<p>If you zoom in on the shadows, the largest area appears to have been treated to a spot of rough adjustment by cloning and stretching to cover, well, something. You can clearly see that the lighter pixels appear stretched up and slightly to the left. There is also a very visible repeat pattern of pixels, too. The hard edge around the top of noticeably stretched area has had a clone brush, or more likely, the healing brush tool.</p>

<p>All of that said though, it might not be hiding anything per se, but there might have been damage to image and it&#39;s a not very good restoration job. Old prints like this were often mounted on a type of cardboard that turns to a brittle, fibreboard type thing, with the structural integrity of very fluffy meringue. The adhesive used back then was primarily bone and hoof reduced to become scotch glue. When it&#39;s been dry for a few years, it is very brittle and breaks like glass. The two in combination often results in the print being damaged by something pressing on cardboard and shattering the scotch glue, this leads to the fiber board to break away.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have retouched it the way whoever did this.</p>
