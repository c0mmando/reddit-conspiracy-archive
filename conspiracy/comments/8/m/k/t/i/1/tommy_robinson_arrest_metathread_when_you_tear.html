I literally want people to protest this, but it&#39;s like protesting someone being arrested for marijuana possession instead of protesting for legalisation - they broke the law, and got arrested.

<p>no, the facts are Tommy is in prison because he broke the law and the evidence is pointing toward the fact you are trying to spin this in such a way to cause division amongst those you see an easily manipulable. Hence the constant posting in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that SC has rehashed all his previous rubbish into a Grand Unified Thread of bewildering proportions.</p>

<p>To sum up:
* 1) Robinson was arrested for activities that nearly derailed a trial
* 1.1) He was already on a suspended sentence for doing the same thing last year
* 1.2) Therefore, he has breached the terms of his suspended sentence and goes straight to prison
* 1.3) And he has a new sentence added onto it for the new offence</p>

<ul>
<li>2) Robinson would almost certainly be a free man today if he had filmed his video someplace else, because</li>
<li>2.1) Recording video in the precincts of an English court is illegal;</li>
<li>2.1.1) And has been illegal since 1925;</li>
<li>2.1.2) And it is enforced very strictly in all cases.</li>
<li>2.2) Robinson was well-aware of this, because this is precisely the offence for which he was already serving that suspended sentence;</li>
<li><p>2.3) And the judge who sentenced him told him that if he did it again, he would be jailed (as in, it was a fact, not a threat).</p></li>
<li><p>3) Tommy Robinson has a string of convictions for violence and fraud</p></li>
<li><p>3.1) Including mortgage fraud, meaning that he told lies to get money;</p></li>
<li><p>3.2) These are not desirable qualities in a journalist.</p></li>
<li><p>3.3) Tommy Robinson is not a journalist anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>3.3.1) He is a shit-stirrer with a big mouth and a smartphone</p></li>
<li><p>4) There is no conspiracy of silence about Robinson&#39;s latest court case. </p></li>
<li><p>4.1) There are <strong>temporary</strong> reporting restrictions in place</p></li>
<li><p>4.2) Those restrictions expire on June 25th</p></li>
<li><p>4.3) The restrictions are in place to prevent reports of Robinson&#39;s trial from affecting some ongoing trials</p></li>
<li><p>4.4) The ongoing trials are the ones that Robinson was picketing when he made his illegal video</p></li>
<li><p>4.5) Robinson&#39;s conduct threatened the integrity of those trials, which is why he was arrested and sentenced</p></li>
<li><p>5) The fact that thousands of morons do not understand the preceding is irrelevant. </p></li>
<li><p>5.1) Don&#39;t embarrass yourself by becoming one of those morons.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone fucking knows Tommy Robinson has been arrested. It has been published in the media. He has not been &quot;disappeared&quot;, no conspiracy of silence has descended over his mysterious fate, there has been no kangaroo court.</p>

<p>There are reporting restrictions temporarily in place (till June 25th) because Robinson&#39;s recent trial involved discussion of a trial that is still ongoing. The purpose of the temporary restriction is to ensure that information from Robinson&#39;s trial does not contaminate the ongoing trial, because if it did it could lead to a miscarriage of justice or the abandonment of the case.</p>

<p>This sort of temporary restriction on court reporting happens fairly often in Britain, due to the complexities of holding related trials simultaneously. </p>

<p>That might not be the way they do it in your country, but frankly so what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gosh, what an imposing and demanding style you have. I can see that there will be no shrinking from your impressively inquisitorial manner (!)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just a question of what Robinson was talking about in his piece-to-camera. The fact that he was recording a video was <strong>a crime in itself.</strong></p>

<p>But, since you ask, we know exactly what Robinson thinks was going on in court - viz, that it was a secret trial, conducted as part of a cover-up orchestrated by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, and the Judiciary themselves, and that the defendants were going to escape justice due to this cover-up.</p>

<p>As for &quot;in what way&quot;, he was livestreaming to thousands of anonymous viewers, all of whom would have been getting enjoyably wound-up by his fiery rhetoric. </p>

<p>Is that harmless? Look at what happened earlier on Sunday, when hundreds of Robinson&#39;s irate fans descended on Downing Street to lay siege to the Prime Minister. </p>

<p>Preventing that sort of thing from happening at the court while a trial is ongoing is about as clear-cut a matter of protecting the public interest as you could hope for.</p>

<p>Moreover, when he was last convicted of illegal filming at court, Robinson had been trying to film and talk to witnesses and members of the jury. </p>

<p>If you need any explanation of why this could disrupt a trial, then you would probably need to have the concept of   &quot;trial&quot; explained to you too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just wondering about the offence in question as he was outside court whilst filming in a public place. Section 41(<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/86/section/41">https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/86/section/41</a>) states that you cannot film inside court or within the court precinct, is it possible he violated this law by filming individuals leaving or entering court? In the video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwitkPBsHdo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwitkPBsHdo</a>) at 1:55 there is another person filming after it switches from the phone Tommy is using, would this person filming also be subject to this law? It is not known if this other person filming is arrested as well but I think perhaps this person wasn&#39;t as the film was uploaded to youtube at least. I have only seen the youtube video on the case after a free tommy hastag appeared on facebook and don&#39;t know much about the guy at all, I&#39;m not going to defend him by any means.

    <div class="md"><p>The key word in that is &quot;precinct&quot; - there is no fixed definition, either physically or legally. It varies from courthouse to courthouse.</p>

<p>Robinson was clearly in that court&#39;s precincts, or he wouldn&#39;t have been arrested. Since the other person who filmed Robinson obviously <em>wasn&#39;t</em> arrested, s/he must have been doing it from a safe distance.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s one of those &quot;how long is a piece of string&quot; situations. No-one but the police court staff themselves can decide how far the precinct extends, but the area will be defined consistently for each individual court&#39;s premises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was that in the video link? I may have missed that. I did think the whole idea that the court can decide how far reaching the area of  precinct is, is a little on the nose. I think the fault lies on poor direction by the police as to how far from the court is legally possible to film. From google I have read that Tommy has been convicted of a similar crime last year. It should be written in the glossary of this statute how far this distance is or at least a court ruling on how far it is so that others aren&#39;t caught unawares </p>

<p>This would certainly be worse in the eyes of the Crown, as it would directly affect any investigation or potential jurors opinions - ensuring a mistrial and rapists go free. Britain does not have freedom of the press as the United States does.</p>

<p>At that point yes it would be fine. They day that Tommy was arrested, he was doing everything he could stay within the legal bounds as he understood them, while still reporting on a subject he feels very strongly about. The trial was purported to be finished that day, at which point he would have been free to report on any additional info that he acquired.</p>

<p>As for the second half of your comment, I suspect that you are biased and mistaken. Tommy has never, ever, &quot;yelled about brown people&quot;. He has friends and supporters of all colours and creeds, every walk of life. The fact that you would even say such a thing demonstrates your biases. That is probably (at least) part of why you don&#39;t seem to be getting answers that you find satisfactory.</p>

<p>No, that is not what I said at all. He was reporting information which is already publicly available, and waiting for the trial to finish before he released any additional information. He never got the chance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your bias is still showing. When he founded the EDL it was an attempt at nationalism, not racism. He has since resigned, as the group was becoming something that he could no longer endorse - different values. Why not focus on the truth, instead of clinging to your half truth talking points? </p>

<p>As for Pegida, what&#39;s the problem? He is against Islam, as are they. Seems like a resonable alliance. </p>

<p>Islam is not a race, it&#39;s an ideology. Tommy is friends with people of all walks of life - including muslim - however opposes radical Islam. Do you support Islam? Forcing women to wear burkhas, beating wices, throwing homosexuals off roofs, stoning rape victims, murdering apostates? Because that&#39;s what Tommy and Pegida oppose..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because like it or not, this group of cowardly rapists are predominantly Muslim.  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident either, not by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>This runs counter to the multi-cultural/identity politics narrative that most on the left ascribe to.  Therefore, rather than having an open (and sometimes politically incorrect but necessary) conversation/debate about the merits of said multiculturalism, the totalitarian left would rather shut down debate.</p>

<p>I personally think there are pros and cons to multiculturalism, I don‚Äôt think that makes me a racist or a bigot either.  Labeling someone as such is just another tactic the left uses to shut down debate.</p>

<p>All Tommy was doing was bringing the underlying issue of multiculturalism and some of its downsides to the surface.  I think it‚Äôs perfectly fair for you to disagree with his viewpoints, but I think we should all agree that the state is doing the wrong thing by trying to silence him....if anything it will backfire and only raise awareness of the some of the problems that multiculturalism brings</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first, I was quite appreciative of your post as I always like to hear the opposite side to the story and you raised some points I hadn&#39;t heard mentioned in the initial flurry of reporting of this incident. However, its apparent you have significant bias regarding the man in question and this has clearly prevented you from taking a purely neutral assessment of the points at hand.</p>

<p>Obviously, Robinson was pushing his luck and given his suspended sentence should have realized there was a possibility of the court/police cracking down on him. This isn&#39;t in dispute, what I (and it seems many others) have found draconian, is the manner in which it was done.</p>

<p>Your claim that the arrest was for actions that &quot;nearly derailed a trial&quot; is pure supposition. It is a possibility that they could have, but far from a given and no statement was made laying out the specific grounds justifying the arrest. Initial statements by police were that he was under arrest from breach of the peace and potential incitement, not for contempt of court (incitement is in legal terms an inchoate offense and refers specifically to encouraging others to break the law - it doesn&#39;t apply to sharing information which may prejudice juror opinion). Not only is your claim not a given, official statements regarding the reasons for arrest have been unclear.</p>

<p>The idea that he would have been left alone if he had filmed &#39;elsewhere&#39; is clearly ridiculous in that the &#39;precinct&#39; of the court is such a vague and undefined term that it could potentially be applied to the entire region in which the court&#39;s rule is valid, i.e. &#39;the entire local community, town or city&#39;. Also, the idea that it is strictly enforced in all cases is simply not true and numerous examples exist of intimidation outside courtrooms by Muslim groups that have been ignored by police for fear of the backlash or violence that might occur if action were taken. I&#39;m not going to spend time compiling examples, this is purely the first one that popped up</p>

<p>(At the Old Bailey)[<a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/209432/Muslims-tell-British-Go-to-hell">https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/209432/Muslims-tell-British-Go-to-hell</a>]</p>

<p>Forget any other arguments, your statement that it is always strictly enforced is simply not correct.</p>

<p>Then there is the excessive punishment. In the vast majority of cases related to contempt of court under the 1987 Criminal Justice Act, 1992 Sexual offences Act or 1996 Criminal Procedures Act the punishment is limited to &quot;a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale&quot;, in other words five thousand pounds. </p>

<p>You said that &quot;Robinson was well-aware of this&quot; yet he was very clearly not aware of the extent of the restrictions, asking police where he was allowed film from and evidently left under the belief that moving away from the court steps meant he was in a &quot;free speech zone&quot;. It is also highly unlikely he was made aware that the punishment for infraction would be so severe. </p>

<p>Yes, what he did was, given what happened, probably foolishly optimistic/ignorant but there were no clear guidelines given to him about what was and was not allowed, nor any warnings that he should refrain from specific action or face arrest.</p>

<p>This is what most people are bothered by. Not that he was arrested for contempt of court but that he was arrested for a very vague and unclear set infractions and that he was given no clear explanation of the reason for his arrest and no opportunity to contest it in court.</p>

<p>If you are suggesting that anyone on a suspended sentence can be picked up off the streets simply because of how the court subjectively interprets their behavior, and then be shipped directly to jail to serve a newly (and excessively) extended sentence, without any form of representation, you have a very different conception of what spirit the justice system should be aspiring to than I do. </p>

<p>The fact that you are obviously smart and educated makes me think your personal distaste for Robinson has clouded your view of the wider ramification of this kind of precedent.</p>

<p>If you were to say that it hasn&#39;t affected your judgement I would point out that comments regarding Robinson&#39;s fraud conviction have zero bearing on the specifics of this case and are a clear case of Poisoning the Well, a fallacy I rather think you would usually avoid in cases without personal animus. Other than that, referring to those one the opposite side of an argument to you as &#39;morons&#39; has never made the speaker seem more intelligent or encouraged other people to engage with them in a calm and neutral fashion. </p>

<p>So in the end, rather than providing a rational assessment of the issue you have only pushed things to an opposing extreme point of view, i.e that the courts were acting perfectly fairly and Robinson is a thug and villain.</p>

<p>Personally I think there is a more reasonable middle ground. In my view Robinson was acting foolishly and should have been aware that he was risking breaching his suspended sentence and potentially hampering the trial proceedings. With that said, I do not at all believe that it justifies the heavy-handed response of the court. There should have been clear instruction given regarding what Robinson was allowed and not allowed to do, there should have been a warning given prior to his arrest, and there should be no way that a person should ever be lifted off the streets for a non-violent offense involving questions of the right to freedom of speech, without having a court appearance in which to defend themselves and have their offense clearly proven to the public.</p>

<p>Arguments that this is simply the way the law works and that it is applied to all equally are clearly false (e.g. the above link) and it is this unbalanced enforcement, more than anything else, that suggests that this is a case of targeted punitive, and selective, law enforcement.</p>

<p>For any with a belief that the above comments mark me as a &#39;moron&#39;, please do us both a favor and simply ignore them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your claim that the arrest was for actions that &quot;nearly derailed a trial&quot; is pure supposition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong. Contempt of Court is what is called a strict liability offence. Here is the legal definition of &quot;strict liability.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 The strict liability rule.</strong>
In this Act ‚Äúthe strict liability rule‚Äù means the rule of law whereby conduct may be treated as a contempt of court as tending to interfere with the course of justice in particular legal proceedings regardless of intent to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got that? It is quite correct to say that Robinson nearly derailed a trial (&quot;interfered with the course of justice&quot;) because strict liability means that you are guilty the moment you do it, and have no excuse whatsoever.</p>

<p>Like drink-driving, which is also a strict liability offence, and means that there is no excuse for being behind the wheel while over-the-limit. You are guilty the moment you have done it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>official statements regarding the reasons for arrest have been unclear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably due to media rather than the police. Yes, it&#39;s regrettable, but it&#39;s not very important either, so I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re making a fuss about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the &#39;precinct&#39; of the court is such a vague and undefined term that it could potentially be applied to the entire region in which the court&#39;s rule is valid, i.e. &#39;the entire local community, town or city&#39;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is true that there is no fixed legal definition of precinct. However, it is also true that you are talking nonsense. Robinson was pretty close to a courthouse. All he needed to do was check with the nearby police officers whether he would be within court precincts is he stood where he ultimately did. He chose not to do so, and the responsibility is therefore Robinson&#39;s and his alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forget any other arguments, your statement that it is always strictly enforced is simply not correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The piece you&#39;ve linked to is from the Daily Express (which is notorious for poor reporting), and it is a story that was not covered by any other paper. You can draw your own conclusions about that. However, this is the relevant bit: <em>&quot;City of London Police, whose area covers the Old Bailey, confirmed there were no arrests. A spokesman said: ‚ÄúWe monitored the situation outside the court but no complaints were made.‚Äù&quot;</em></p>

<p>No mention of any uproar in the court itself. Only that three Muslims protested <em>at some unspecified distance away from the court</em> and no arrests were made. </p>

<p>This story wasn&#39;t the proof you were looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then there is the excessive punishment. In the vast majority of cases related to contempt of court under the 1987 Criminal Justice Act, 1992 Sexual offences Act or 1996 Criminal Procedures Act the punishment is limited to &quot;a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale&quot;, in other words five thousand pounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve googled something and not understood it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/contempt-court-reporting-restrictions-and-restrictions-public-access-hearings">This page</a> is what you googled and didn&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t say what you think it said. Look again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You said that &quot;Robinson was well-aware of this&quot; yet he was very clearly not aware of the extent of the restrictions, asking police where he was allowed film from and evidently left under the belief that moving away from the court steps meant he was in a &quot;free speech zone&quot;. It is also highly unlikely he was made aware that the punishment for infraction would be so severe.</p>

<p>Wrong. He was informed when he received his suspended sentence that he would be automatically jailed if he did it again. And if he was curious about what sentence he would receive for a breach of that suspended sentence, he should have asked his lawyer, or the Judge, or perhaps even googled it himself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two years is the maximum for contempt, and Robinson earned every last second of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, what he did was, given what happened, probably foolishly optimistic/ignorant but there were no clear guidelines given to him about what was and was not allowed, nor any warnings that he should refrain from specific action or face arrest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of this is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what most people are bothered by. Not that he was arrested for contempt of court but that he was arrested for a very vague and unclear set infractions and that he was given no clear explanation of the reason for his arrest and no opportunity to contest it in court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to take the last of those remarks, the reason he was not given a chance to contest it in court is because he was already guilty (that suspended sentence, remember?) and had chosen to commit the same strict liability offence while already guilty.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t get the luxury of a second trial for that. Nor would anyone else. </p>

<p>So again, you&#39;re complaining to me because you don&#39;t understand the thing that you are complaining about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you are obviously smart and educated makes me think your personal distaste for Robinson has clouded your view of the wider ramification of this kind of precedent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this exchange has more than amply illustrated, what you think does not necessarily coincide with the relevant facts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to respond to the final third of your post, because it&#39;s just a mixture of carefully-worded personal attacks, more irrelevant daydreams about how courts should be run, and what a poor innocent lambkin Tommy Robinson is. </p>

<p>(1)The strict liability rule applies only in relation to <strong>publications,</strong> and for this purpose <strong>‚Äúpublication‚Äù includes any</strong> speech, writing, [F1programme included in a cable programme service] or <strong>communication in whatever form, which is addressed to the public at large or any section of the public.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no room for evasion here. You must have read this bit to get to the bit that you quoted, which was immediately below it.</p>

<p>And you chose to pretend it didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>On your way, <strong>liar,</strong> and spare your sanctimony about life lessons for the next poor dupe you try to con. </p>

<p>Tommy seems very selective about wanting to protect children.  His friend Leigh McMillan didn&#39;t get his trial covered by Tommy a few months back, strange that.  Maybe Leigh was fitted up too as a white male, because we all know white males can&#39;t be pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tommy Robinson, a previous (2012) spokesman for the UK&#39;s English Defense League (a political movement that&#39;s anti-Islam and pro-national UK identity, as I understand it), has been arrested again in the UK. The ostensible reason is because he was &quot;breaching the peace&quot; by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/tommy-robinson-arrested-leeds-court-child-grooming-trial-edl-founder-latest-a8368821.html">standing in public and livestreaming an event</a>. </p>

<p>For those unaware, here&#39;s a comment I recently made that provides background as to what Robinson&#39;s position is:</p>

<p>&quot;It won&#39;t be 13 months in jail, it&#39;ll be the rest of his life. The prison overseers already previously arranged things to try and get Tommy Robinson murdered by Muslims twice. The first time he had just arrived and a fellow (white) prisoner tipped him off that Muslims were boiling water and sugar to attack him with it--a substance that&#39;ll stick to your face and burn your flesh off, most likely resulting in death, if not permanent debilitating disfigurement. In response Robinson preemptively went up to them and started a fight, resulting in him being placed in solitary confinement--thus saving his life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The second time it was the intervention of a single (white? I forget) guard who previously saved him. The guard arrived seconds before other guards and told him to refuse to move cells under any circumstances, as he was about to be moved to the wing of the prison where Muslim gang-members serving life sentences were placed. He later learned it was the deliberate decision of the (female) prison administrator to place him there, and she had also previously refused to listen to his petitions to keep him separated from the hardcore Muslim criminals, given the previous attempts on his life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The circumstances under which he was previously arrested were obvious bullshit too, like purposefully placing him under protective custody so that he&#39;d miss a court appointment and be thrown back into prison because of it. Not to mention they investigated his entire family until they found a clerical error in his brother&#39;s business, then sued and seized all his assets, as well as his brother&#39;s. After protracted legal struggles to avoid his family from being destroyed, UK spooks approached him multiple times and said they could make it all go away if he agreed to be controlled opposition for the British equivalent of the white-rights movement.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR: In other words, it appears the UK government is conspiring to murder Tommy Robinson. I recommend listening to this interview: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkqdusRWA_gYouTubeYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkqdusRWA_gYouTubeYouTube</a></p>

<p>If you look at Ibn Kathir and the Hadith, we get the following story:</p>

<p>-Muhammad&#39;s own followers initially refused to rape kidnapped married women.</p>

<p>-As a result of this refusal, Muhammad reveals verse 4:24 which encourages raping married women &quot;your right hands possess&quot; i.e. kidnapped.</p>

<p><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/17/41">https://sunnah.com/muslim/17/41</a></p>

<p>Ibn Kathir says:</p>

<p>&quot;The Ayah means, you are prohibited from marrying women who are already married, <strong>except</strong> those whom your right hands possess, <strong>except</strong> those whom you acquire through war, for you are allowed such women after making sure they are not pregnant. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &quot;We <strong>captured</strong> some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them <strong>because they already had husbands.</strong> So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and <strong>this Ayah was revealed</strong>, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess. <strong>Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>I said: &quot;Rape means sexual activity carried out forcefully on an unwilling participant (i.e. no consent).&quot; this is based on the (Merriam-Webster dictionary definition](<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape</a>). </p>

<p>What you believed these hadiths and the Quranic verse were talking about is not actually the case, and it&#39;s okay to accept new information if you are intellectually honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could anyone please enlighten me as to why the trial was under a DNR at all ?</p>

<p>Obviously a braying mob outside the court would be prejudicial, however the police have coped before and kept protesting crowds at distance from the court.</p>

<p>Cases such as the Wests , the Y. ripper and the moors murderers for example ,were protested and the public recieved widespread and grisly, detailed daily reports. In these cases jurors were ordered to not read or watch reports.
Additionally some of the trials were moved from the locality they took place in.
Lately we have had celebrities and sports people and churches etc etc involved in rape cases and CSA cases and once again - detailed reporting. </p>

<p>So why have these cases in particular been subjected to DNR notices?</p>

<p>Is there a conspiracy to try the dozens of UK grooming gangs in dozens of cities as quietly as possible ,or is it because of a genuine risk of civil disobedience, or is there some sort of cover up of police and council involvement - as was the case in Rotherham and Telford.....</p>

<p>Enlighten me......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because like it or not, this group of cowardly rapists are predominantly Muslim.  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident either, not by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>This runs counter to the multi-cultural/identity politics narrative that most on the left ascribe to.  Therefore, rather than having an open (and sometimes politically incorrect but necessary) conversation/debate about the merits of said multiculturalism, the totalitarian left would rather shut down debate.</p>

<p>I personally think there are pros and cons to multiculturalism, I don‚Äôt think that makes me a racist or a bigot either.  Labeling someone as such is just another tactic the left uses to shut down debate.</p>

<p>All Tommy was doing was bringing the underlying issue of multiculturalism and some of its downsides to the surface.  I think it‚Äôs perfectly fair for you to disagree with his viewpoints, but I think we should all agree that the state is doing the wrong thing by trying to silence him....if anything it will backfire and only raise awareness of the some of the problems that multiculturalism brings</p>
