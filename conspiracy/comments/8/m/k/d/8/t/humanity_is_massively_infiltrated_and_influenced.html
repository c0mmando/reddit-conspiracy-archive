       They're everywhere, they blend right in, and they're completely negative. Stay aware my brothers and sisters, be not influenced by evil beings who walk among us. Love and light WILL prevail!
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware of your heart, your capacity for love and generosity. Be aware of your "higher self." You are a spirit made of pure light. Have faith in positivity and in love. Do not succumb to negativity, self destruction and evil. You are a free spirit worthy of a positive existence. Be free!

       Yes but there are more. Jews are the figureheads, the frontline soldiers. Just like biblical times, who did they deliver Jesus to? Itâ€™s a tightly knit group, the thread that ties them all together is unwavering commitment to the arch enemy that they call (but is not so named) Satan l.

       To the people who might be quick to call this man crazy ask yourself this very simple question, who is the most evil person in the world? There must be someone in this world that is the most wicked woman/man alive. Now my follow up, do you think this person is not hell bent on ruling the world?

       I'm not talking about people. I'm talking about evil life forms that aren't human. Although real humans are manipulated and controlled by these reptilians and other negative entities which we can't even see. This is far beyond just regular humans acting out of self-service.

       I believe this is the truth. We must all seek the highest truth. It is clear that you are questioning our clouded reality. Keep asking questions my friend, and together we WILL reveal the truth.

       Thank you for being the voice of reason. I saw at a young age how cruel people can be. Not interested in sob stories either--"I did this because I have a bad childhood." So yeah, you took your suffering to make other suffer? Bullshit, I'm not falling for that.

       I absolutely do not deny the dark and corrupt potential of any living thing. Obviously there are some very twisted people out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious question: Do you believe we humans are bred and born to kill, conquer, destroy and dominate? A bunch of naked monkeys don't seem very intimidating in my eyes. We need clothing and tools just to survive, let alone dominate anything. Never forget that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about natural wildlife- there are species that thrive on predation and domination and fear. They live because we fear them. A snake or a spider can move much quicker than you or I, they can hide extremely well, and many of them can easily kill an adult human. Some creatures just naturally have a greater capacity for stealth, killling, predation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, humans can obviously be evil. But that's not how we've survived, evolved, and lived through thousands of years. It's just not our way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine belonging to a species that's designed to hunt, kill, and dominate. Now fast forward thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years. Or more. Now your species has developed space travel and eventually comes to Earth. Do you think such a race is going to see us as anything but a source of labor and/or food?

       What do you mean by 'completely negative'? Not like I'm out raping, killing people and kicking puppies but I DO think negatively. I'm sure I'd be labeled negative for realizing evil is stronger than good. Always has been and always will be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no use for the mumbo jumbo of anything that's supposedly 'over' me as an authority figure. Maybe that's actually on the up and up, I just don't trust it. That bridge got burned a long time ago. I do want my freedom. I'm just not willing to trust anything outside of myself to get there. Look, I don't mean to be a bitch. I just shun religious stuff and new age stuff because I lump them in the same bullshit file.

       I'm legitimately and deeply sorry. Does your viewpoint fulfill you? If it does, I will not criticize. Personally I haven't always been a "new age" type. But I've had too many experiences up to this point that have led me down whatever this path is that I am on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you the ultimate best on your path, and perhaps our paths are not so different: they both end in truth.

       In a strange way, it does fulfill and empower me. It's like I was saying on another thread, you would think a lot of this shit would be something to avoid because it seems so hopeless/fear based and I don't look at it like that. I see it as being a case of realizing this is a VERY fucked up environment and this isn't something I'll be repeating ever again. Freedom is my goal.

       These are just devils/fallen angels.  Outer space is just a hoax.  Lizard aliens don't exist.  If you continue practicing witchcraft (now called new age) you will eventually be tormented by these things.  When that inevitably happens simply rebuke them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and see what happens.  If you want to have some fun, try asking your higher self to "reveal who you truly are in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ" and see how it reacts.

       1Co 15:1Â  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

       1Co 15:2Â  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3Â  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4Â  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
