    <div class="md"><p>Arabs are the replacement for the Soviet Empire. After the wall came down in &#39;89, the MID, which became a dominating force under Regan, searched desperately for a new villain. There were attempts to make narco-traffickers into &quot;narco-terrorists&quot; which may be an accurate description, but the public wasn&#39;t moved. Many people had begun to question the CIA&#39;s involvement with drug trafficking and crack--with the help of Mike Rupert and Gary Webb, and the war on drugs has been losing steam ever since.</p>

<p>But Arabs, they look different, talk all crazy, they&#39;re brown, they smell funny, eat different foods and they blow themselves up. Easy to demonize, and justify their murder. And there&#39;s a never-ending supply of them, since Sunni Islam doesn&#39;t need a top-down mandate. Any Sunni Imam can issue a fatwa. The important part is that there&#39;s no shortage of these guys willing to die for their family and their country, easy to dehumanize, perfect targets.</p>

<p>So if you look at that time under Clinton when the military was downsizing, take a look at the random places the US was involved: Bosnia, Panama, the China Sea, Colombia, airstrikes in Iraq, a few other places. But no real enemy to point our finger at. There was a real feeling that American military superiority was losing its edge because of a lack of military action. </p>

<p>Then 9/11/01 solidified the stereotypical Arab terrorist. This put the US in line with the Israeli mindset. Interesting, right? To be clear, I do not believe Jews control the world. That&#39;s an intellectually lazy theory founded by the fact that the Jewish culture values intellectual prowess far more than most other cultures. But there&#39;s no doubt that modern Israeli propaganda initiatives include among others, to align US and Israeli enemies as much as possible. The &quot;Dancing Israelis&quot; are no news to anyone in this sub. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidental that we now solidly share enemies with the Likud party of Israel. We&#39;ve been fighting their wars for decades now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that the controllers of the world aren&#39;t represented in the US Presidency. Ever. Is there evidence of the Zionist agenda influencing our politics? Yes. Absolutely. No doubt. Are there wealthy Jews? Yes, of course. But that&#39;s not enough to come to the conclusion that Jews rule the world. That methodology underdetermines who and what is a threat in the real world.</p>

<p>In other words, the Vinn diagram that includes all wealthy Jews is a subset of the circle of world rulers, but certainly not the whole thing--not even close, nor is it the most influential. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. One way to dissect the power structure is through raw military power. <a href="https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/wolrd_military_spending_barchart_large.png">This diagram gives a glimpse via budgets.</a></p>

<p>There are no numbers on that graph, but it conveys the point: the US far exceeds all other nations in all measurable ways, militarily. That&#39;s one measure the US has maintained. Given that, he who controls that military is the most powerful. Unfortunately, now that bribery is legal, the next most powerful group are those who can write checks for $100 million. We&#39;re talking about less than 1000 people in the world. I don&#39;t know them all. Also, not all billionaires are playing real politik. Also, there are powerful soldiers and brokers and players along the way to the maintenance of these power structures. </p>

<p>It should surprise no one that Erik Prince moved his operation to the UAE. They have a lot of loose money and no army. These days, you just hire an army of former US Special Forces at your disposal. If you can afford the retainer.</p>

<p>Those are the two main filters to discern who holds real power. I&#39;m sure you could apply different standards, i.e., who owns the most gold? PGMs? Silver? Intelligence network? Assassin network? Congressional control? But guns and money are a pretty good proxy for power.</p>

<p>You think it means they are dominating the world. If you want the cliff notes on who&#39;s dominating the world, it&#39;s Congress and the members of the boards of a handful of companies. These people are largely, though not exclusively, white, Christian men. That&#39;s your conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the Nobel Prizes are academic. Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to point that out, but here we are. <a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-world-religions-infographic-with-world-map-charts-and-other-elements-vector-illustration-472038343.jpg">Here&#39;s the percentage of Jews compared to the rest of the world.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Religion_of_Nobel_Prize_winners.png">Here&#39;s the percentage of Jewish Nobel Prize winners.</a> This includes medicine, literature, chemistry, economics, physics, physiology, and peace.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s 0.2% of the population, but 21% of Nobel Prize recipients. Notice on that graph that the VAST majority (65.4%) are Christian. Again, there&#39;s your conspiracy.</p>

<p>To recap, the current Israeli government, occupied by the Likud party, led by Bibi Netanyahu, most definitely wants to align US interests with their own. That much should be uncontroversial to us both. But Zionism as a world-domination agenda is as real as the Chinese agenda to dominate the world. Or the Russian or the Mozambiquian. That&#39;s not what we should be paying attention to as much as our particular strategy with that country. </p>

<p>I do believe the Towers fell partly because of an effort of what I&#39;m guessing are ex-military from US and Israel, and perhaps a random guy from here or there. The point is that Israel had a horse in that race, and when those buildings collapsed, it solidified our relationship with Israel in a new way. And now the wheels are in motion for an Iranian invasion. We are definitely being lead by the nose. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t appear to be a strategy of world domination more than it&#39;s Israel using the US military to whip its neighbors into submission. Honestly, that&#39;s just smart. Why fight your wars alone when you have the world&#39;s dominating military force on speed dial?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>USA is anything but Christian values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Have you ever heard the phrase &quot;the war on Hannukah&quot;? Me neither. Get real. The religious right is balls deep in our political system. GWB was born again. Jimmy Carter was born again. Reagan opened the door to the Evangelicals, and they flooded in. Now we have guys like Pence and Bolton who firmly believe in Biblical prophesy. Our relationship with Israel hinges on Biblical prophesy. The hard core of Trump support comes, (ironically IMHO), from the Evangelicals. Our slogans are insinuated with &quot;God and Country&quot;. Christianity has about 2.35 billion followers. That&#39;s one in three people on the planet. America is much more concentrated than that. There are enough Bibles printed for every person on the planet to have one. Every US president has been Christian. To say the USA is &quot;anything but Christian values,&quot; is simply a denial of reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you feel like a victim of something. I just don&#39;t buy it. If you&#39;re a white, Christian male, you&#39;re not a victim. In fact, you were born into a lucky group at this time in history. Gay Marriage? Where does it say anything about that in the Bible? The Old Testament. But no one follows the Old Testament. Remember, unless you&#39;re Jewish, you gave up the Old Testament for the New Testament under Jesus? So why pick out that one issue? Transgenderism? What the fuck does the Bible say about that? Please help me understand.</p>

<p>Teaching evolution? You&#39;re against teaching evolution? That&#39;s a belief you can maintain, I suppose, but if you know anything about cell biology, DNA, bacteria, medicine or any of the biological sciences, you must accept the reality of the Law of Evolution in order to make sense of disease and health. You cannot ignore or deny it on a professional level. You can ignore it in your personal life it you want. Go ahead, but reality does not comport.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why do you think their is so many translations and different versions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a great question. Really. It&#39;s the right question to supplement an understanding of the evolution of Christianity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library">The Gnostic Gospels</a> spread light on the sorting parameters used by the early Catholic/Orthodox Christian church. Early Christianity was so different and varied that it&#39;s questionable whether these practitioners would recognize any of the versions in practice today. Some of the quotes in the Gospel of Thomas sound like quotes from Zen Buddhism.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Christ Cults spread out through the colonial Roman powers, Bibles became codified by groups of the most powerful forces and translated into Greek and Latin from Hebrew as a marketing tool: the wealthiest people were the Roman occupiers, and although they resisted this at first, we all know Christianity has lasted far longer than the Romans. Attempts to break away from the Holy Roman Empire gave rise to all forms of Protestantism, of which Evangelism is one of several thousand subsets who need not go through the Pope to get a message to God.</p>

<p>The King James version allowed this rise of Protestantism as the public was no longer dependent on their church leaders to interpret the book. There&#39;s a ton of history I just breezed over, not to mention the great influence of Constantine&#39;s advisors to paint history with a Christian brush, but you&#39;re asking a very relevant question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the word of God need changing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You tell me: Do you actually follow Leviticus? I doubt it. That was the &quot;word of God.&quot; Why don&#39;t you follow it?</p>

I for one, can&#39;t wait till they fight it out because it is coming, first it will be Europe already taken over without any problem doing so. I think Poland won&#39;t let any in. My friend is Romanian been here for about 25 yrs family still there says she cannot believe Europe when she goes home. As an American she now is afraid to travel to home. think about that folks, and at least 90 Musim Dems plan to run for Ofc. They alread are there have/now hold vital security positions. Valerie Jarett and Obama were the first there and are still working to destroy us. Mi and Mn are 2 States totally long gone because of Islam. God help us all</p>
