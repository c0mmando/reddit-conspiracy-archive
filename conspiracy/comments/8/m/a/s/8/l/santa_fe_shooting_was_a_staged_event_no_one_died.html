       If there really is a nefarious group staging these shootings look no further than the NRA and weapons manufacturers. The sales and stocks skyrocket after every single one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this. After all these years and shootings are you still allowed to own firearms? Yes, you most definitely are. The gun grabbers seem to be really fucking bad at carrying out the back end of the plan if they still have yet to move on the guns.

       Those events you see on the TV are fake. And laws

        are

       being passed left and right in almost every state and on a federal level too. Stop with the trope "still have yet to move the guns" - this shit I see everywhere, and it's a fucking lie bro. You are not paying attention to what is happening there.

       I've heard this same argument for 30 years man. They aren't taking the fucking guns. Passing more stringent laws does not equal taking away the guns. The whole god damn economy would collapse if they stopped selling a shit load of guns.

       Convincing people that value their 2nd amendment rights that they

       coming for the guns sure does boost sales though.

       I would urge against basing your view of whether these events are real or staged on your perceived outcomes of the events, rather than the evidence from the events. This is highly illogical.

       I'm agnostic on whether or not these shootings are real or fake. Until I've been personally involved in a mass shooting I'll never know the truth. Sure is crystal clear which industry benefits after each one of these events though.

       Just as a detective walks on a murder victim, he doesn't have to surmise right then and there what the motives and methods were, and doesn't have to determine who benefited to be able to at least conclude that a murder has in fact taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, I don't understand the full implications of these events or who specifically is involved in orchestrating them, but these things aren't necessary to survey the coverage we are given from these events and weigh them in our minds, to see whether they have the 3D appearance or flavor of a real mass shooting, and in my opinion they often do not.

       Yes, DHS and the M Chertoff types that sell safety apparatuses to every airport in the country (post -911), and now that same industry is going to benefit fro selling that shit to every

       I agree that the NRA seems to be part of the show. IF they really cared about citizens' gun rights, why have they not filed a lawsuit against the federal government for faking/staging school shootings such as Sandy Hook, Parkland, and now Santa Fe?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're supposed to believe no one in the NRA has figured out Sandy Hook was a hoax yet? And that they can't afford lawyers to make cases for this?

       You kinda missed the point here. It would make way more sense that if someone was faking shootings, it would be the NRA, not the government. Considering their entire business thrives off the fear of gun owners losing access to guns. And the government hasn't taken away your guns after an ocean of mass shootings in the past 15 years.

       You'd think more people would catch on after the last, oh, 25 bullshit drills with fake news reports and zero video or photo proof of a single fucking thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where I start to believe those people that say that the entire world they live in is a made-up fairy tale lie. I mean, every radio show during the day, even the 247 sports stations, are
       <em>
        screaming
       </em>
       into the microphones that "something must be done
       <em>
        NOW
       </em>
       !", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, the whole god damn thing is fake. All this shit that's happening is based on lies and made up facts. BLM and NFL taking knees is all based on fabricated bullshit that all these innocent blacks are getting shot by cops for no reason, when we all know that this is pure bullshit. ALL of those cases had circumstances that exonerated the police in a court of law, with juries and proof, etc. Yet, they are ALL operating under a fake premise that's a total lie, created by the media and social platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       These drills with fake victims and blood are being treated like they are organic real events by the people who run our government and media. So fucking bizarre, and scary. They still bring up sandy hoax, and scream about it like it was real. smh..

       They don't even bother using fake blood these days tbh. People believe shootings happened just based on footage of people standing around outside the school in a line, a few cop cars here and there, and some bad actors fake-crying on CNN.

       Lol, they probably just walk up and take a snapshot of the school for the paper, and call it a day. They certainly can't show the chronically empty triage areas in every event. That's got to be getting embarrassing for them.

       jj, I love your approach to getting even a single shred of proof from all these fuckers here claiming it's all real. I always upvote your efforts, which incidentally
       <em>
        ALWAYS
       </em>
       come up with literally
       <em>

       Thank you. I plan on doing it every time an event like this occurs. In my opinion demanding evidence from MSM outlets should be a major activity of this forum anyway.

       Lol nobody is taking your guns. Officer in Baltimore were found to be selling confiscated guns back to the streets...to gangs, drugs dealers, etc.

       If you want a gun, you can find it. Anyone serious about the crime they're about to commit will damn sure find the weapon for the job.

       Me too and I can verify they didn’t.  See how that works without any real facts? Are you going to do a Sandy Hook on us all and claim your cousins aunts best friend died to make it more believable?

       I understand, I cant provide any real evidence to verify what I have said. I agree with you that with out real facts what I said means nothing. However I just felt like throwing my 2 cents out whether people believed me or not.

       Those events you see on the TV are fake. And laws
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       being passed left and right in almost every state and on a federal level too. Stop with the trope "still have yet to move the guns" - this shit I see everywhere, and it's a fucking lie bro. You are not paying attention to what is happening there.

       I agree that the NRA seems to be part of the show. IF they really cared about citizens' gun rights, why have they not filed a lawsuit against the federal government for faking/staging school shootings such as Sandy Hook, Parkland, and now Santa Fe?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're supposed to believe no one in the NRA has figured out Sandy Hook was a hoax yet? And that they can't afford lawyers to make cases for this?
