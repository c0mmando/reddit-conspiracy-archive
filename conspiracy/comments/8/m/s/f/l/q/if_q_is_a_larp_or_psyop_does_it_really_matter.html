       This is a thread on great awakening.  It is asking if it matters if Q is a larp or a psyop.  Just asking that question, not even if Q is that or not.  chime in and make a thoughtful argument.  Looking for  open minded responses.

       What answers do you expect asking that question in the sub dedicated to worshipping anything "q" types out?
      </p>
      <p>
       The general position seems to be "it doesn't matter if he is real or a psyop because he is telling the truth". Right then and there, I disagree fundamentally, as I've seen other people do in this sub. So the question changes in tone completely: if q is not telling the truth, then it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       matter whether he's just some informed NEET in a basement going through a fit of anonymity grandeur, or an actual psyop by
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       in order to trick people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, what really matters is whether q is telling the truth (about everything) or not.

       Yes, not only does it matter but it is dangerous.   This group is actively promoting military intelligence as the good guys and fantasizing about a military style coup which purges society of 'evil' elements.  In addition its rhetoric is one of evangelical renewal...'the great awakening'... which one are we on? The fifth?

       These are signs of an authoritarian movement.

       Although I agree about Q.  I really do not agree on the article although I have not read the book.  Christian values and our very culture are under constant attack.

       It is great to be tolerant and open minded but no so much that your brains fall out.

       This is the party line is it not?   What Christian values?  What culture is under attack?    Evangelical Christian movements through their commitment to fundamentalism are constantly undermining education and scientific understanding.  In addition the movement is largely responsible for the support of Zionism, actively doing it hoping for Armageddon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the book recommended.

       Well I have an idea, try being tolerant and open minded. You will find that out that your brains can't fall out.

      <p>
       Religion is a tool used to get people to identify with a political state.  It is and will be treated as the noble lie required to make the political order function.

      <p>
       I don't know what you mean by this.  In Christianity there have always been authoritarian strands, and they are embraced by a large population in the US.

       The basic tenets of christianity are the same as our constitution.

      <p>
       "God" given rights.  Because if our rights do not come from a creator omnipotent source then who will decide our rights.  What person or group of people will decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       In India they have the caste system which is based on their religious beliefs.  All cultures are based on their religious beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you are agnostic or believe in scientism that is still a religious belief.  Because no one knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end game in my opinion for the nwo is:
      </p>
      <p>
       surveillance
      </p>
      <p>
       transhumanism
      </p>
      <p>
       posthumanism
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they own your body or body parts or have tweaked your dna, once robots have  rights and we are no more than robots in a simulation.  What rights do you think you will have?
      </p>
      <p>
       Christian faith, I believe, will be one of the biggest voices against this.  Although this too has been and is being compromised.  It is a tangled web.

       These are not basic tenets of Christianity. At this point claims are just made up.   In fact, the 10 commandments contain many provisions that are in direct opposition.     They place a limitation of speech, and on worship, for a most obvious example.  The rhetoric about a creator as a guranteer of rights, comes from deism, an enlightenment philosophy, not Christianity.

       The causality here is reversed, religious beliefs are based on material and cultural practices.   It is why when monarchies were the dominant form of government, Christianity was used to justify it by appeals to divine rights of kings.

       Agnosticism is not a religious belief.  It is a position one takes on religious claims.   Scientism is an ideology. None are relevant to authoritarian streaks that are found in American Christian Fundamentalism.

       Why Christian?? I mean what should be obvious is that spiritual traditions in general would be advancing arguments against trans/post humanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Christianity would have any problem with mass surveillance as its tenet is already of a cosmic panopticon used to keep the plebs in line.

       Anything, and I mean anything, can be used for good or evil.  Religion can be used to enlighten or control.
      </p>
      <p>
       And every belief system ends up distorted and compromised at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the Core tenet in christianity which is Love. Love your neighbor as yourself even to the point of loving your enemy.  The ten commandments help define the golden rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

       Government, sadly, always ends up trying to control the people.  Even here in America, where the government was suppose to work for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government uses the 7 mountains to control people and religion is just one of those.
      </p>

       education

      <p>
       government
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these are infiltrated and used to control.  And yes people, a culture, needs to organize around certain values.  The values America is organized around are christian values as reflected in our constitution and laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have they been infiltrated and distorted by many influences:  Most definitely, Yes!

       In this example, love is stripped of meaning and simply used for its connotation.  For starters love is not a tenet.   It is a word for a complex set of ideas, which include various emotional states, as well as actions and obligations towards others.  In fact it is such straining to claim any relations that using a theistic name in an institutionally unapproved way, or not worshiping on the sabbath has jack all to do with the golden rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is arguing to throw out the golden rule.

       You than proceed to list government as one of the '7 mountains'.  This is a circular argument.

       But to  bring this thread back to the original claim which is the authoritarian strands in Chrstianity and the power that they wield, and seek to wield in the US, I suggest people read on the Dominionist strands.

       You say no one is arguing to throw out the golden rule.

       I am glad you said that.  However Luciferians are arguing to throw out the golden rule.

       Do as thy wilt is the whole of the law.  This is the proposed religion of the nwo elites.

       What strikes me as the ruling ideology of the elites is that generating wealth is the same as having a good society, that those who generate the most wealth and are rich have a special place in terms of knowing what is good, i.e., they have a special epistemological position.  Incidentally, this is a viewpoint, advocated through quite a bit of Christian churches.

       Look, I don't want to seem like I am a pedant, but think about what you are writing here.  Not that I disagree with a notion of free time reserved for contemplation, in fact, I think we should have more of it; and this fight for free time in the ancient world would certainly partially explain why the sabbath existed as a cultural practice. Ultimately, the sabbath, is a day from sundown to sundown, reserved for a specific form of religious practice.  That is not 10 percent of our time.
