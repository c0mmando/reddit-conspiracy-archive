       Nope not at all. Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israelis were "given" land owned by other people. It is what it is.
I'm not saying Israel shouldn't exist. They deserve to exist and I'd go as far as to support their occupation of their land.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israelis are continuing to encroach on Palestinian land. The settlements and the non stop isolation of the Palestinian people CAN NOT be compared to the USA protecting its long established borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are purposely conflating the details here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Israel stayed within their originally given land... no issue. It wasn't really theirs but fuck it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way we'd be able to compare these situations would be if the US was continuously moving their border south... incrementally shorting Mexico's territory. You know this isn't happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       lol... we'd be on the same page if the USA was moving it's national capitol to Tijuana. I'd agree with you then.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as it is... you are comparing (again) long established national borders being protected from mass illegal infiltration to an ever encroaching nation on a people kept in squalor in an open air prison.

       Look, I've already given links for you to study the history, if you want to ignore the historical facts and the similarities, that's your business. But I'm against empire and I'm against destroying peoples lives just because they want a better life when you have all the resources and continue to steal them from the rest of the planet. Fuck off with this American exceptionalism bullshit. Where do you think Zionists learned all of their tricks? Fuck, it goes back further than that, Hitler even based his genocide on the native americans. People make such a big deal about the holocaust but nobody talks about the genocide that dwarfs that shit, the one that inspired him in the first place. America is free from all faults because we're number one and we're the greatest.

       I've literally never said that, wtf? I'm saying if you ignore that history and ignore the impact it has IN THE NOW, you are perpetuating that violence against other people. This isn't in the past. Why do you think people are crossing the border in the first place? Like seriously, what else would make someone run away from their home? They're escaping violence from a war on drugs that we started. Everything is linked. These aren't isolated events that aren't connected. The American Empire is the most powerful empire in the history of the planet, we've been at war for 93% of our existence, if you ignore the history, you repeat it.

      <p>
       It doesn't matter what you say. This is a stupid fucking comparison.

       You couldn't have proved my point better if you tried. As if the UN would ever condemn the genocide against the native americans or the theft of half of Mexico's land. The UN is a shell that ultimately bows to the US, Israel, and NATO and accomplished almost nothing in terms of human rights.

       I've been calling out all of my liberal friends posting that picture on Facebook, when I talked about this shit when Obama was in office I was seen as a "right wing agitator" nobody on the left or the right actually cares about these people. We treat them like animals. People are making a big deal about the 1,500 kids going missing and some going into child slavery, but Obama did that too!

       I just want to add that if 1,500 white kids were declared missing in one day, there would be nonstop news coverage, a major congressional hearing, and fucking riots in the streets. But since it's brown kids, everybody just sees the headline, shrugs, and keeps scrolling.

       The Mexican immigrants are not claiming the US belongs to Mexico, or that they are seeking to "return" to US lands they claim belong to them.  They are trying to get into the US and, eventually, become citizens.  There is no Mexican equivalent of Hamas.  Yet, you can have a look at what happened, early in the 20th Century, when a Mexican force that was hostile to the US did launch attacks and threaten security along the US Mexico border.

       Oh, how cute you sweet summer child.

       They're here for the Great American Free-for-All.  No rules, no consequences, everyone else is responsible for raising their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drunk driving accident?  No problem!  Skip bail and buy some other stupid guerro's stolen identification.  Move towns, problem solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't afford the children you shouldn't have had?  No problem!
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply show up to an American hospital when it's time to deliver your next baby, and guess what, that's free too!  Don't worry about customs, just tell them you're here as a tourist!  Now your newly minted "American" qualifies you for lawful permanent residency, household food assistance, etc. to the benefit of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       in the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, they're not here to "work, gain residency and become citizens."  We have a process for doing that that they believe does not apply to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're here to "reconquer," and they're not fooling anyone but you.  Well, there's still a few rubes left, no doubt.  This is reddit, afterall.

       Come on man/not man, we can only give one or two nations shit at a time. Israel has done more than enough to earn our attention. 
Don't think the USA has escaped our wrath.

       That's why black and white racism isn't really a big deal in Britain. They've united in their hate against Muslims. LOL. White rascist British people literally don't have the time to hate on black people.

       Jokes aside, I was not aware of the treatment of undocumented immigrants in USA.

       I think I finally realized why people here think Israel is worse than the USA even though Israel is just an evil arm OF the USA. It's because you don't want to believe YOU'RE part of the richest 10% of people on the planet that oppress everyone else. It's a way to scapegoat someone else when, in reality, you're on the same side as them.

       I've seen a lot of pro-Israel posts here recently,  filled with ignorant justifications for genocide. They all have the so feel to them...  It's like listening to a 12 year old kid explain with a complete lack of self awareness that it was okay to break a 5 baby's arm because it threw up on them.

       If anyone commits a crime, violent or otherwise they're gonna face some kind of consequences regardless of citizenship status.

       Simply being undocumented and trying to make a living shouldn't be the sort of thing we destroy family's and ruin lives over. Israel is conveniently outside the range of US 'democracy', but our own internal armed forces and for profit prison system is right under our noses and we do nothing.
