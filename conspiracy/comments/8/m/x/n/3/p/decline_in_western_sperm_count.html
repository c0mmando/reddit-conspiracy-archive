<p>According to this data, Western sperm counts dropped between between 1973-2011 by 50-60%!!! Which makes one wonder where we will be in another 25 years, completely sterile?</p>

<p>What the paper doesn’t seem to note are the ethnic origins of their data set, Western infers Caucasian but doesn’t factually mean that Western men were born in Western countries, only that they live there- therefore the drop in sperm count is geographic, which is very weird. </p>

<p>What is even more weird is that no one is talking about it. </p>

<p>Testosterone levels in Western men have dropped so much that the national average standard for healthy levels had to be reduced.</p>

<p>TPTB are feminizing men and &quot;empowering&quot; women via feminism, neither of which makes either gender happy. This is all to destroy the American Dream family unit for further population control. </p>

They can get away with literally whatever they want without even a slap on this wrist. There is no oversight and you are deluded if you think they have good intentions.

<p>The reason is that <em>some</em> humans behave like a virus.  A parasite on others.  Let&#39;s try to not be like that.  Our consciousness can be used to enact a plan of action to be fulfilled while benefitting others.  </p>

<p>Back to breeding, some humans have consciously made the choice to not breed since another child isnt really necessary amongst the millions being born on some short time span</p>

There isn&#39;t much selection pressure for sperm to be strong swimmers because in general people only reproduce with one person, so there&#39;s no competition.

    <div class="md"><p>Monogamy has been around for centuries, if not millennia, in almost every single culture and civilization in human history. It is very unlikely that monogamy has caused a decline in sperm count just since the &#39;70s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My reasoning behind it is that you see it in other animal species that are more monogamous, that their sperm is less effective. Where as less monogamous species have evolved different adaptations for their sperm to compete better inside a female against the sperm of other males. </p>

<p>Reproduction is a complex event, and I&#39;m sure modern ingredients that the first world is exposed to plays a part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their sperm is less effective, or they only have 1-2 offspring at a time? They are not the same. I see the connection you&#39;re drawing, but this is actually more along the lines of K selection versus R selection and has nothing to do with sperm quality. Animals that reproduce slowly and keep the babies nearer longer do tend to be more monogamous, but its because their babies are needier, not because the males sperm sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s probably because more babies for those species would create demands that couldn&#39;t be met and so natural selection has whittled the reproductive capacity down to a manageable level, and selected for monogamy to further improve the odds of survival for the scant and burdensome offspring. Monogamy and slow reproduction share the same cause, monogamy is not the cause.</p>

<p>Otherwise this wouldn&#39;t have started in 1970s. People are way, way, way <em>less</em> monogamous now than they were 100 years ago when sperm counts and birth rates were higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just making the point that smoking has nothing to do with this. </p>

<p>Many would say that there is a huge conspiracy related to a lot of things which smoking is blamed for but has no relationship to ( for example the paper which all of the original indoor smoking bans from the 80s and 90s cite as proof that second hand smoke is harmful ended up being retracted due to making statistical errors in their math to the point that the original conclusion of the paper could no longer be supported, or that every other paper on second hand smoking since then simply references that paper as proof of harm ) </p>

Something is very very wrong and it could easily be intentional. We see the full out war against men in Western society as it is. Could this be a multi-pronged attack?
