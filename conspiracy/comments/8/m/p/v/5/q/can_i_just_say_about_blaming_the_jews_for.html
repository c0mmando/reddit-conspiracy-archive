        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>I think I need to take some time to drive home a fundamental truth. We are all human beings and are privvy to the same range of biases and emotions as every other human being.</p>

<p>The fact that there is a financial elite that are in control of media and craft messages to keep people confirming their own biases isn&#39;t because the subscribe to a particular religion or belong to a certain race. They are just bad human beings. </p>

<p>It worries me immensely that the kind of circular logic where people think &quot;some rich humans are bad and they happen to be Jewish, therefore Jews are bad&quot; has arisen again and its exactly the same kind of logic Hitler used to develop his campaign and eventually the Nazi Party. </p>

<p>We need to move back to understanding that its the actions of bad human beings in isolation if we are to evolve as a species and begin tackling the issues these bad human beings create effectively.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>Yeah, everyone should know the Jewish historical-background... Like when they sacrificed children to Moloch in the Valley of Hinnom only 3000 years ago. Or, how they have been kicked out of 110 nations, always for similar offenses and their engagement in horrific-rituals. Or, how the Bolshevik-Jews declared war on Germany in 1933 (contrary to popular belief), after just slaughtering over 100 million people prior and during WW2. Or, how men like Herman Rosenblatt (the &quot;holocaust survivor&quot; featured on Oprah) have been proven to be nothing but liars. </p>

<p>But my absolute favorite is this... The dumb Jewish woman who spilled the beans, LIVE on Oprah Winfrey. She admitted that many Jewish families across the country engage in child-sacrifice and other disgusting and perverted rituals. And that they have been doing this for hundreds of years... I guess that Jewish woman is an &quot;antisemitic conspiracy&quot; theorist, right? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s test this argument using the Socratic-method...</p>

<p>Hypothetically, let&#39;s say you are brought before a judge in a court of law and the judge tells you, &quot;You stand accused of murder&quot;. At which point you state, &quot;But your honor, there are horrible evil groups in every society. And because there are other people who are murdering people too, I should get a pass on my crimes.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, hypothetically, let&#39;s say your the responding judge now... How would you respond to that half-assed, retarded, bullshit excuse? (Don&#39;t answer).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh did he? Riddle us this then... Why is that according to population censuses before and after WW2, the number of Jews in Europe increased, while nearly 15 million German men, women and children perished? Who really was exterminated here? </p>

<p>And was this Jewish plan for extermination announced? </p>

<p>Did these murderous Jews state their intentions? </p>

<p>Why, yes of course... Just see the book, &quot;Germany Must Perish&quot;, written by Theodore Kaufman, a NY Jewish man, who in this book called for the extermination and sterilization of over 17 million Germans. This book was praised by the likes of the NY Times, The Philadelphia Express and TIME magazine. Your commie-grandfather likely smiled while reading it.</p>

<p>But you weren&#39;t told this by your Marxist-professors at school, so it must not have happened, right? Wrong... </p>

<p>So let&#39;s recap... Your grandfather, was communist-scum, who aided in the extermination of over 100 million people in WW2, at the hands of communist, Bolshevik-Jews. Then, the murderer lied about being a victim. And, aren&#39;t you so proud? Pssssshhhhh... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, those who are cognitively-dissonant are the ones who continue to believe that 6 million Jews were gassed in &quot;death-camps&quot;, despite Simon Wiesenthal admitting these numbers were made up, despite drastic conflicts with International Red Cross reports, despite the population census of Jews in Europe increasing during WW2 (as in not decreasing by 6 gorillion), despite no mass grave-sites even nearing that number ever being found, despite the fact it&#39;s literally the only event in history you can get imprisoned for disagreeing with (totalitarian-communism, anyone?),  despite the fact the Soviets built chimney&#39;s &quot;attached to nothing&quot; next to German camps in a failed attempt to make them appear to be &quot;death-camps&quot;, despite the fact that 16 out of 22 &quot;death-camps&quot; were internationally agreed upon to have never been used as &quot;death-camps&quot; or &quot;gassing operations&quot; and the remaining 6 in Poland suddenly closed their doors to investigation, despite Theodore Kaufman&#39;s, &quot;Germany Must Perish&quot;, which foretold exactly what would be the fate of Germany (over 15 million murdered, by Bolshevik-Jews and their commie-cucked allies), despite no signature &quot;blue staining&quot; being found on any walls where Zyclon-B was alleged to have been used to &quot;gas Jews&quot;, despite the same amount of Zyclon-B being evenly distributed to all of the 42,500 German camps and ghettos, and not any over-abundance sent to any of these alleged death-camps&quot;, despite countless Jews being caught lying about their holo-hoax stories (such as with Herman Rosenblatt and his lying, bitch of a wife), despite Adolf Hitler himself being the grandson of a Rothschild Jew (Yeah, yeah... you don&#39;t believe it. Who&#39;s his grandfather then?), despite Jews themselves speaking out about this lie, such as David Horowitz, the Jewish man who went to Auschwitz and proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was not used as a &quot;death-camp&quot; where any &quot;gassing operation&quot; took place using nothing but simple-logic, despite the fact that I could literally go on and on like this, giving you reasons that more than substantiate my claims and lend much credibility to my argument while you struggle to find small-shreds of anything that can possibly be mistook as evidence for your own implied stance. </p>

<p>Eh... I told ya! This is a variation of the, &quot;It&#39;s not worth it, man&quot; excuse. But I digress...</p>

<p>I appreciate the compliment on my writing-skills. </p>

<p>And look, it&#39;s nothing personal, but someone has to rattle the cages of those who&#39;s minds have been locked into various boxes of manufactured-thinking. We were all there at one point or another. And, at one point you and I both believed in the Easter bunny, Santa Clause and a bunch of other shit that propaganda polluted our minds with. It&#39;s really not hard, when you have access to mass-communication networks. Not everyone in the flock is a shepherd, ya know? And not to sound Alex Jonesy (because I hate that cunt) but there really is a war on for your mind, so to speak. We have to question significant events and occurrences, more than ever, in this day and age.</p>

<p>Look around you today... You see the lies of the fake-news and media around you on a daily-basis. And you know, this is nothing new... The same Marxist-pawns who are a thorn in our side today, were victorious in WW2. This people advocate for degeneracy and an unraveling of society. They do not seek to mold a just and peaceful world, but instead long for the power to subject others to their will. People hate to admit it, but the communists won WW2 and the US and British got cucked into murdering their own brothers and sisters, for the sake of these Bolshevik-bastards. And look at limping and raped Europe today...  It&#39;s actually incredibly tragic and heart-breaking how everything has played out. </p>

<p>People like me simply aim to ensure those who attempt to deceive the masses are called to account for their lies. And we are numerous. </p>

<p>I’d like to hear more about how the Jews really did commit the genocide</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a historical fact...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Aleksander Solzhenitsyn:</p>

<p>“We cannot state that all Jews are Bolsheviks. But without Jews, there would never have been Bolshevism. For a Jew, nothing is more insulting than the truth. The blood maddened Jewish terrorists have murdered sixty-six million in Russia from 1918 to 1957.”</p>

<p>Judea declared war on Germany in 1933... not the other way around: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=judea+declares+war+on+germany+1933&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWgceu-63bAhVCzFMKHfxwCXwQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=900">https://www.google.com/search?q=judea+declares+war+on+germany+1933&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWgceu-63bAhVCzFMKHfxwCXwQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=900</a></p>

<p>It is a fact that 15 million Germans perished in WW2... It is also a fact that NY Jew, Theodore Kaufman called for the extermination/sterilization of 17 million Germans in his book, &quot;Germany Must Perish&quot;. A plan that seems to have gone over without a hitch. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Must_Perish">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Must_Perish</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://20thcenturytruth.wordpress.com/germany-must-perish/">https://20thcenturytruth.wordpress.com/germany-must-perish/</a></p>

<p>And despite no evidence of any plan by Germans to exterminate Jews, you continue to believe in &quot;complete bullshit&quot;. Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no see, thats exactly the point. People blame &quot;Jews&quot; for things that evil men do, who are Jewish. Why don&#39;t people blame Christians for all the evil things that are done by Christian men. When things are done in the name of the religion, than there is a point. However when a group of people is blamed for the actions of few, thats just idiocy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying dude. Have this chat with my friends in real life. It is just easier to say &quot;fuck the Jews&quot; than fuck Zionists or Ashkenazi Jews and that is wrong. </p>

<p>Anyone that&#39;s Jewish that knows in their heart they are a good person. Should certainly be excused from that shit pile. Anyone that feels Israel&#39;s treatment on Palestine Is justified and right then fuck them. </p>

<p>I live in Wales we don&#39;t really have many Jews. Most of them are Orthodox and seem to keep to themselves.</p>

<p>I know of one unorthodox Jewish guy and I swear to God he is the biggest cunt you&#39;ll ever meet. Most of the reasons he is a cunt is because of the way his parents have raised him up and the way he views the rest of the world. I get the impression his entire family are just as cunty.</p>

<p>So any person Jewish or not that is like the only Jewish guy I&#39;ve met then, fuck them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh... but I&#39;m sure you wanted us to believe Herman Rosenblatt&#39;s lies, when he was on Oprah, right? His proven-false holocaust love-story... </p>

<p>But, let&#39;s examine your argument on the other foot... So, if I said, &quot;Yeah, that guy said the holocaust happened and that he was a victim of it, but hey, the clip is from fucking Oprah. And that&#39;s a scripted fake slice of entertainment for stay at home moms and grandmothers in the 90&#39;s&quot;, you would accept this as a credible rebuttal??? </p>

<p>You would probably say, &quot;Yeah, but there&#39;s a lot more evidence of the holocaust than that clip.&quot;</p>

<p>To which I would say, &quot;Yeah, but there&#39;s a SHIT-TON more evidence of Jewish ritual-abuse then there is evidence for the Holo-hoax.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, you&#39;d stammer and attempt to use another logical-fallacy and do anything but even attempt to disprove the truth I&#39;ve spoken. </p>

<p>The fact that you HAVE to resort to this type of rhetoric is very telling, indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I understand you perfectly... What you&#39;re saying is, that we should not believe anyone telling us the holocaust happened on any talk-shows, either, by that same logic. Because, talk-shows, like Oprah, has the &quot;same authentic&quot; as WWE, according to you.</p>

<p>Never mind that permission for these rituals are explicitly laid out in the Talmud... have openly been expressed by several Rabbis... and this is one of the primary reasons (((they))) have been kicked out of various nations, going back hundreds of years.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, by your logic, if someone says 1+1=2 on Oprah, you would consider it false, even if it can be independently-verified... as the case was with the Jewish, child-sacrificing, chick on Oprah (You can literally read about the reports she made to the Chicago police)... </p>

If Oprah tells me 2+2=4 it doesn&#39;t matter to me because I don&#39;t see her as a source for information. I can verify information from people who have a reason to be trusted as sources. Again, just to drive this home. I do not care about whether YOUR claims are true or false, this has nothing to do with YOUR claims.

<p>Tophet: &quot;In the Hebrew Bible, Tophet or Topheth (Hebrew: תוֹפֶת‎; Greek: Ταφεθ; Latin: Topheth) was a location in Jerusalem in the Gehinnom where worshipers influenced by the ancient Canaanite religion engaged in the human sacrifice of children to the gods Moloch and Baal by burning them alive. Tophet became a theological or poetic synonym for hell within Christendom.&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tophet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tophet</a></p>

<p>Also from Wikipedia, we find: </p>

<p>1823–35 Velizh blood libel: After a Christian child was found murdered outside of this small Russian town in 1823, accusations by a drunk prostitute led to the imprisonment of many local Jews. Some were not released until 1835.
1840 Damascus affair: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant disappeared. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus.
1840 Rhodes blood libel: The Jews of Rhodes, under the Ottoman Empire, were accused of murdering a Greek Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.
In 1840, David Drach, the son of the Head Rabbi of Paris and a convert to Christianity, wrote in his book De L’harmonie Entre L’eglise et la Synagogue, that a Catholic priest in Damascus in that year had been ritually killed and the murder covered up by powerful Jews in Europe.
In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to Kutaisi, Georgia to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): &quot;While periodicals as diverse in tendency as Herald of Europe and Saint Petersburg Notices expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, New Times hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices.&quot;[60] The trial ended in acquittal, and the orientalist Daniel Chwolson published a refutation of the blood libel.
1882 Tiszaeszlár blood libel: The Jews of the village of Tiszaeszlár, Hungary were accused of the ritual murder of a fourteen-year-old Christian girl, Eszter Solymosi. The case was one of the main causes of the rise of antisemitism in the country. The accused persons were eventually acquitted.
In 1899 Hilsner Affair: Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagabond, was accused of murdering a nineteen-year-old Christian woman, Anežka Hrůzová, with a slash to the throat. Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in Austria-Hungary, Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death. He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman. In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Tomáš Masaryk, a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of Czechoslovakia, spearheaded Hilsner&#39;s defense. He was later blamed by Czech media because of this. In March 1918, Hilsner was pardoned by Austrian emperor Charles I. He was never exonerated, and the true guilty parties were never found.</p>

<p>The 1903 Kishinev pogrom, an anti-Jewish revolt, started when an anti-Semitic newspaper wrote that a Christian Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of Dubossary, alleging that the Jews killed him in order to use the blood in preparation of matzo. Around 49 Jews were killed and hundreds were wounded, with over 700 houses being looted and destroyed.
In the 1910 Shiraz blood libel, the Jews of Shiraz, Iran, were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged; the pogrom left 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.</p>

<p>Antisemitic flier in Kiev, 1915: &quot;Christians, take care of your children!!! It will be Jewish Passover on 17 March.&quot;
In Kiev, a Jewish factory manager, Menahem Mendel Beilis, was accused of murdering Andrei Yushchinsky, a Christian child, and using his blood in matzos. He was acquitted by an all-Christian jury after a sensational trial in 1913.[61]
In 1928, the Jews of Massena, New York, were falsely accused of kidnapping and killing a Christian girl in the Massena blood libel.
Jews were frequently accused of the ritual murder of Christians for their blood in Der Stürmer, an antisemitic newspaper published in Nazi Germany. The infamous May 1934 issue of the paper was later banned by the Nazi authorities, because it went so far as to compare alleged Jewish ritual murder with the Christian rite of communion.[62]
In 1938 the British fascist politician and veterinarian Arnold Leese published an antisemitic booklet in defense of the Blood Libel titled My Irrelevant Defense: Meditations inside Gaol and Out on Jewish Ritual Murder.
The 1944–1946 Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, which according to some estimates killed as many as 1000–2000 Jews (237 documented cases)[63]), involved, among other elements, accusations of blood libel, especially in the case of the 1946 Kielce pogrom.
King Faisal of Saudi Arabia (r. 1964–1975) made accusations against Parisian Jews that took the form of a blood libel.[64]
The Matzah Of Zion was written by the Syrian Defense Minister, Mustafa Tlass in 1986. The book concentrates on two issues: renewed ritual murder accusations against the Jews in the Damascus affair of 1840, and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.[65] The book was cited at a United Nations conference in 1991 by a Syrian delegate. On 21 October 2002, the London-based Arabic paper Al-Hayat reported that the book The Matzah of Zion was undergoing its eighth reprinting and was being translated into English, French and Italian.[citation needed] Egyptian filmmaker Munir Radhi has announced plans to adapt the book into a film.[66]
In 2003, a private Syrian film company created a 29-part television series Ash-Shatat (&quot;The Diaspora&quot;). This series originally aired in Lebanon in late 2003 and it was subsequently broadcast by Al-Manar, a satellite television network owned by Hezbollah. This TV series, based on the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, shows the Jewish people engaging in a conspiracy to rule the world, and it also presents Jews as people who murder the children of Christians, drain their blood and use this blood to bake matzah.[citation needed]
In early January 2005, some 20 members of the Russian State Duma publicly made a blood libel accusation against the Jewish people. They approached the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office and demanded that Russia &quot;ban all Jewish organizations.&quot; They accused all Jewish groups of being extremist, &quot;anti-Christian and inhumane, and even accused them of practices that include ritual murders.&quot; Alluding to previous antisemitic Russian court decrees that accused the Jews of ritual murder, they wrote that &quot;Many facts of such religious extremism were proven in courts.&quot; The accusation included traditional antisemitic canards, such as &quot;the whole democratic world today is under the financial and political control of international Jewry. And we do not want our Russia to be among such unfree countries&quot;. This demand was published as an open letter to the prosecutor general, in Rus Pravoslavnaya (Русь православная, &quot;Orthodox Russia&quot;), a national-conservative newspaper. This group consisted of members of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats, the Communist faction, and the nationalist Motherland party, with some 500 supporters. The mentioned document is known as &quot;The Letter of Five Hundred&quot; (&quot;Письмо пятисот&quot;).[67][68] Their supporters included editors of nationalist newspapers as well as journalists. By the end of the month, this group was strongly criticized, and it retracted its demand in response.</p>

<p>I mean...I guess understanding history and simply telling you what (((they))) have done historically makes me an anti-Semite, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, sure you don&#39;t care... That&#39;s why you&#39;re working so hard to discredit it, while purporting not to be. Typical... </p>

<p>You are attempting to straw-man my argument with your claims that this Oprah show was &quot;scripted&quot;, then you leaned on a bandwagon-appeal when you implied that everyone knows all of these shows are scripted, which is verifiably-false. And, you can&#39;t show that it is &quot;scripted&quot;, because you made a assumption based on nothing but speculation pulled out of your ass.</p>

<p>And, you don&#39;t seem to realize that your assumption about this show being &quot;scripted&quot;, is irrelevant, given the mountains of evidence substantiating exactly what she is saying (some of which I shared above). </p>

<p>But, let me just make sure I understand your stance on this Oprah Winfrey show clearly... So, you&#39;re saying that the Oprah Winfrey that&#39;s great friends with Harvey Weinstein and countless other Jews, intentionally ran a scripted show attempting to convince the world that Jews (her friends) were engaging in child-sacrifice on a mass-scale, by handing some actor a script and telling her to just go-hard on trashing the Jewish-reputation, &#39;cause fuck it?... And then she went on to have a successful career in the almost entirely Jewish-owned media.</p>

<p>Yeah, that seems rational... I can tell you&#39;re not a dumb person. And that you just have difficulty thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blood ritual has existed for millennia in dozens of different countries across the world. It&#39;s one of the main reasons Jews have been kicked out of hundreds of countries, sometimes twice! It would be foolish to dismiss every single case entirely throughout thousands of years as &quot;Antisemitism.&quot;</p>

<p>In their own Holy Bible, it chronicles the extensive conflict between the Canaanite-inspired blood ritualists who &quot;make their children pass through the fire,&quot; and the Torah-observant Hebrews who only wanted to sacrifice animals, and the occasional head or foreskin of a conquered nation. The Oprah clip is but one modern example. See the &#39;80s daycare crisis across the nation for more; especially at the military day cares. Look at recent Hollywood sex abuses and cults like Nexium. Ritual abuse continues to flourish. MK-Ultra was an effort to scientifically codify these methods. The similarities between Ewen Cameron&#39;s psychic driving experiments, Satanic Ritual Abuse, and Jewish Blood Ritual are striking; they are all versions of the same thing that traces back its origins to the ancient pagan and monotheistic world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, he&#39;s just trolling you guys. Ignore this poster.</p>

<p>In reality, the Israel-Palestinian complex is very complex, with a lot of dark, complicated history, lots of blame on both sides, and anyone genuinely interested should take the time to read up on it. If Israel didn&#39;t at least have a strong military presence, they would be destroyed. I don&#39;t think you can say the same thing in reverse- Israel does in fact have the power to annihilate the Palestinians, but they choose not to. That&#39;s said, there&#39;s a rising far-right racist movement in Israel that&#39;s extremely troubling. It already existed on the Arab side.</p>

<p>I think this is a dubious statement. Many may have &#39;officially&#39; declared to be Christian, but that was almost a requirement to be elected.</p>

<p>Among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_affiliations_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States#List_of_Presidents_by_religious_affiliation">list of Presidential religious affiliations</a> you will find 4 Unitarians and 2 Quakers, which do not follow the traditional Christian doctrines. I suspect that a President proclaiming those affiliations is a way for atheist/agnostics to claim something without upsetting the populace.</p>

<p>At least 4 Presidents are known to be Deist in their private lives, having a belief in a &#39;god&#39; but not accepting any doctrine.</p>

<p>And a few Presidents that have declared a religious affiliation have no evidence that they have ever actively practice in their churches.</p>

<p>I may have even overstepped by saying almost. There was no almost about it. You had to declare Christian faith to get elected. Of course, an overwhelming majority of Americans have been devote Christians until recent times, so it makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this 100%. I&#39;d honestly say that the the tiny percentage of people/families that have accumulated the majority of wealth and power on this planet would love us to believe that &quot;it&#39;s all the Jews fault!&quot;.</p>

<p>I do not agree with the actions of Israel, I am aware that a lot of the media is owned by Jewish families - but does that really make all Jews bad? Does that really justify the hatred for all Jews? To me this is just absolute insanity and making the case for &quot;all Jews being bad&quot; is being totally intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>If we look at the occult practices these people engage in and the beliefs they have, they seem far more &quot;satanic&quot; than Jewish. I do not think the cabal actually identify themselves as Jewish - in public perhaps, but in private most certainly not.</p>

<p>I personally know Jews that are good people and I have never ever met a Jew that is a bad person. There is no doubt they exist, but come on, blaming all the Jews for a minority of them (or those that appear Jewish in public) are doing is the worst thing you could do to help save this planet and our society. It literally leads to the hatred of an entire people, an entire culture and it casts the blame on the little people that have no fucking idea what the powerful cabal are even up to - they are just living their ordinary lives. They were born in Jewish families and grew up as Jews, but does that somehow make the complicit in what the cabal are doing? Please, give me a break.</p>

<p>If you stand up to them you are labeled a Nazi or a Racist. WW2 was funded by the banks. The war was allowed to happen.  The nazi death camps.  Everything in WW2 can be blamed on the banking Cabal. Its sick that the people that caused the near destruction of the jewish people hide behind the term Jew. If you criticize them or speak the truth about then you are publicly destroyed. </p>

<p>The Israeli people are wonderful people.  They love God and share much of the beliefs that we share. Palestine was a shithole until the Jewish people restored the land.  They deserve a place in the world.  I think POTUS wants to set them free from the banking cabal. The recognition of Jerusalem was a sign to tbe people there. They love President Trump. They will support him when he deystroys the Cabal which has nothing to do with Israel. The Rothchilds only really care about power and wealth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One learns much more quickly about those things in which one has a genuine curiosity and makes the effort to educate oneself.  Asking others to educate you will not satisfy you if you have a genuine curiosity.  The history of Zionism, its motives, its tactics and its aims is readily available across the Internet.  If you have followed the news out of Israel in the past few weeks you are aware that Zionist snipers have killed or wounded over 12,000 Palestinian people protesting their imprisonment in Gaza.  If you ask yourself why this has happened then you have taken the first step toward understanding why Zionists are enemies to humanity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the Zionists. Chief Rabbi Josef in Israel says that Goy (non-Jews) are on Earth to serve the Jews, that it&#39;s OK for a Jew to kill a Goy and shouldn&#39;t be punished. He also calls Black people monkeys. This is a prevalent theme in Judaism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of it being more discussed, I don’t know how old you are but for me it happened before I was born. I’ve heard about it before but not a whole lot, and I don’t think that’s that weird. I just looked up coups that took place in the 90s and I know almost nothing about any of them. I just looked up people assassinated in the 90s and the same thing, I know pretty few of them. Apparently the Algerian, Liberian, Sinhalese, Burundian, Chechen, and Nigerian presidents were all killed and I don’t know any of them. </p>

<p>Maybe I’m just an idiot, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard people talk about any of them either. The only killed president I recognize was Rwanda’s and that’s because of its role in the subsequent genocide. Maybe I’ll be called a Zionist shill working for Soros, but people generally don’t seem to give a shit about the past, including but definitely not limited to Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination,  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ann frank is a very very hard comparison to make given how completely, entirely, unbelievably, immensely different both of them were as well as the also incredibly different circumstances of their deaths were (I can elaborate if you want). I have also heard of Yitzhak Rabin before, even if only occasionally, which is more than I can say for either the Nigerian or Chechen presidents. Admittedly Sri Lanka, Liberia, and Algeria really aren’t that important, but Nigeria is a massive country and Chechnya, although small, has been pretty important on the world stage over the last few decades. </p>

<p>At the time of Yitzhak’s assassination, it was a pretty huge deal. Given the peace talks that had been happening as well as the factors you stated, it got a lot of attention. I just think the world moves fast and there is so much tragedy that people can’t/don’t attach themselves emotionally to stories of things like assassinated leaders and, by extension, quickly forget about them or just stop caring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you have 5 upvotes shakes my faith in humanity. Yes, we can be divided into groups. Genetically, even. Visually. Behaviorally. Jews are a genetically different creature than Blacks. Blacks are a genetically different creature than Whites. Whites are a genetically different creature than Asians. Let me ask you this, do you know what the subspecies line is? You have to be members of the same species, meaning that you can interbreed and produce viable offspring, but also have distinct morphological characteristics. For example, Labradors and Poodles. They can interbreed and produce a viable offspring, but also have distinct morphological characteristics. Therefore, while both equally being dogs, we can recognize that they are two different breeds.</p>

<p>In the same way with humans, Whites and Blacks, for example, can interbreed and produce viable offspring. This means that we are the same species. We also have distinct morphological characteristics. Which mean that we are two different subspecies of that species. Which we colloquially refer to as race. Now, you must admit that there is a utility in understanding the different temperaments and abilities of the different dog breeds. Pit bulls are physically strong, and can sometimes be aggressive. Retrievers are gentle and loyal. These are real differences, meaningful differences between the breeds. Does that invalidate that they are all one species? No. But to say that there is no finer, smaller division than the species line is ideological, moralistic, and frankly naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Race isn&#39;t genetic, it&#39;s a cultural construct</p>

<p>Obviously two Chinese people share more genes with each other if they come from the same geographic region, but two &quot;Asians&quot; might share less genetic information with each other and more with a white or black person. For instance, a Tibetan might be more genetically similar to an Italian than to a Japanese person. There isn&#39;t just one &quot;Asian&quot; gene.</p>

<p>Asia is huge. Africa is huge. There is so much genetic diversity throughout the world, it&#39;s borderline impossible to group everyone by their ethnicity. It&#39;s not as simple as you make it seem, you would have thousands of ethnic groups if you group people by how much genetic information they share. It wouldn&#39;t just be one huge group of Blacks for the continent of Africa, or Whites for Europe. There would be too much overlap, too many complications, because guess what? Humans aren&#39;t fuckin dogs that are artificially bred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Jewish history is defined by their systematic oppression”. You read a little bit too much mainstream history there. The last few hundred years have been defined by Jewish dominance. Any time any force threatens their world hegemony, all their controlled countries descend on that force and wipe it out. Meanwhile, White society is getting genocided right now, Whites are becoming minorities in all of our keystone countries, due to Jewish led mass immigration, while they don’t immigrate anyone into their own country. While Jews know they are safe from any reprisal, due to the backing of the UK, and the USA, their militaries, and the IMF, all of which they control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;White society is getting genocided right now&quot;... seriously? What do you think genocide means? </p>

<p>And whatever you believe about what small group of people hold the actual power in society, you understand that it&#39;s just those people with the power, not everyone with the same religion or skin colour or heritage, right? Those people, the ordinary powerless people, are the ones that have been expelled from countries, deprived of property, and sent to camps. Has that ever happened to white people? Was there ever a time that white people were not only blamed as a group for the actions of a few individuals, but were LEGALLY deprived of property, freedom, and life itself, just for being white?</p>

<p>That&#39;s my point, that regardless of who holds the actual power, Jews have more reason to be worried when people start blaming the Jews than white people do when people start blaming white people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree. Throughout Europe, the heavy influx of migrants from Africa has led to an explosion of sexual violence against native women, and many countries are facing areas where police don&#39;t go alone. Muslim criminal gangs have taken over cities in Sweden among others. The natives who point it out are castigated as hateful bigots.</p>

<p>If the trend doesn&#39;t change, the future of Europe is demographic replacement of the native people by immigrants and their descendants.</p>

<p>Tommy Robinson&#39;s arrest was not motivated by upholding the rule of law. If the system were interested in that, the grooming gang problem wouldn&#39;t have gone ignored for so long and Tommy Robinson wouldn&#39;t be noteable public figure. Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner for shedding light on problems the system hides. They&#39;re more concerned about alleged racism than dealing with sexual abuse of minors.</p>

Just because SOME people think Jews are evil and rule the world doesn&#39;t mean every single person who posts here does, or even a majority. And lately? People have been saying that shit for years. More like this is just more divide and conquer rhetoric. Make people focus on fighting each other instead of actual talking about conspiratorial topics, we gotta waste our time defending ourselves against the actions of assholes.</p>

<p>Small groups of elites control the world, be they Zionist Jews, Vatican Catholics, Saudi royal family Muslims.  And above them all, cults dedicated to the advancement of humanity into a new form through the crucible of chaos/natural selection.  Some would call them Luciferians.  They were the original stewards of Eden, somewhere in Africa (the Horn, possibly) but when the slave humans rebelled (this is the story told in the old testament) they decided to hold their power in the shadows.  Hoarding allowed power to be maintained not in acute displays of gold, but accumulated in displays of gold--since we have had things to hoard, they have been hoarding them.  because the Jews are older than other religions, Jewish elites have likely been controlled by this group by longer.  But make no mistake, the control of the world runs deeper than any organized religion.  It is organized religion itself that keeps this slavery going.</p>

<p>For example, anyone else think it&#39;s weird that the longtime capital of Christianity is in the very empire that slaughtered Christ?  Yeah, thought so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for this post. It gives me home for this subreddit, it&#39;s one of the last true places for free speech and I don&#39;t want that to mean it becomes a safe space for Nazis. That kind of divide and conquer rhetoric is exactly what the powers that be perpetuate in society to keep us all against each other. I have so many Jewish friends who speak out against the crimes of Israel, and to blame them for Zionists is just as shitty as blaming all Muslims for ISIS, but more than being a shitty thing to do to other people, it weakens YOUR position because now you have less allies against the elites of the world. We gotta stick the fuck together, no matter HOW hard the media tries to convince you that there is an &quot;other&quot; that you have to hate and fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article31835.htm">I think Manny Friedman says it best:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We’re a driven group, and not just in regards to the art world. We have, for example, AIPAC, which  was essentially constructed just to drive agenda in Washington DC. And it succeeds admirably. And we brag about it. Again, it’s just what we do.</p>

<p>But the funny part is when any anti-Semite or anti-Israel person starts to spout stuff like, “The Jews control the media!” and “The Jews control Washington!”</p>

<p>Suddenly we’re up in arms. We create huge campaigns to take these people down. We do what we can to put them out of work. We publish articles. We’ve created entire organizations that exist just to tell everyone that the Jews don’t control nothin’. No, we don’t control the media, we don’t have any more sway in DC than anyone else. No, no, no, we swear: We’re just like everybody else!</p>

<p>Does anyone else (who’s not a bigot) see the irony of this?</p>

<p>Let’s be honest with ourselves, here, fellow Jews. We do control the media. We’ve got so many dudes up in the executive offices in all the big movie production companies it’s almost obscene. Just about every movie or TV show, whether it be “Tropic Thunder” or “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” is rife with actors, directors, and writers who are Jewish. Did you know that all eight major film studios are run by Jews?</p>

<p>But that’s not all. We also control the ads that go on those TV shows.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget AIPAC, every anti-Semite’s favorite punching bag. We’re talking an organization that’s practically the equivalent of the Elders of Zion. I’ll never forget when I was involved in Israeli advocacy in college and being at one of the many AIPAC conventions. A man literally stood in front of us and told us that their whole goal was to only work with top-50 school graduate students because they would eventually be the people making changes in the government. Here I am, an idealistic little kid that goes to a bottom 50 school (ASU) who wants to do some grassroots advocacy, and these guys are literally talking about infiltrating the government. Intense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a fundamentally different outlook. We aren’t just one species, all together. We are a bunch of co-evolving hominid subspecies. Different ethnic groups have different rational self interests. The Jews are very conscious of their rational self interest, and they nepotistically act towards it. This is something that you have to acknowledge, not just for Jews, but for every group. The question is, though, do Jews have the right to control Western, White countries, like England, Sweden, Germany, America, and Canada? In my opinion, this is beyond their jurisdiction.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to discredit forums by poisoning them with racist and anti-Semitic content. I suspect that some organizations are trying to push this anti-Jew narrative to paint this community in a bad light. <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> was front and center in calling out all of the funny business that revolved around the 2016 primaries and it became a battle ground for astroturfers ever since. It wasn&#39;t about Hillary or Trump, it was about Bernie. He was a the most credible threat to the powers that be in a very long time and this community was key in figuring out just how much the scales were tilted. Even people who didn&#39;t support him as a candidate could see that our democracy was broken if one of the two major parties in this county were allowed to rig their primary. The effort drew people from all walks of life to stand up for their rights as voters and shine light on those who were working to take away their voice. This community got very large during that time and it became a threat to the powers that be on both sides of the aisle.  Ever since then we&#39;ve seen people trying to discredit it, trying to divide us, trying to pin us down as pro-GOP or pro--DNC, trying to make us seem racist or intolerant.  In reality, a bunch of different bad actors are trying to stop us from seeing though the lies that our government tells us, trying to stop us from reclaiming power for the people, trying to stop us from realizing that the financial elite have successfully orchestrated a coup on our democracy.  But most importantly that are trying to highlight our differences so that we refuse to work together, because if we work together then their grip on power will start to slip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judaism is a religion. The jews who came from fudal europe to control financial, law, and banking systems are the problem. They were a problem beofre the industrial revolution becuase that financial and banking exploitation created a massive devide between the rich and the poor as well as isolate societies within societies. </p>

<p>Moving on, yes we dont need to hate on all jews just as we dont need to hate on all muslims because based on their religious ideations. But you cant put it past that there are bad people who cradle themselfs with like minded bad people and ruin it for everyone. The whole CNN is like 90% jews at the top of the company. And look at what propogandistic trash they are churning out atm. So the problem isnt the religion or the wage earners, it is the rich and elite and zionist, corporatist pigs, who are also psychopathic in nature. (Its what capitalism promotes, buissness at the expence of humnaity and all). </p>

For any one topic about Jews as a people, look a little longer and further, and you could find the opposite. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of complexity.

<p>Zionism ultimately IMO is some kind of anglo-american colonial project which utilized refugees from WWII in order to push is global cold war agenda. They could have made peace in the 70s but the usual gang of suspects decided to put a bullet in the head of anyone who wanted peace, and commit us to another 30-40 of endless bloodshed for wtvr reason. </p>

<p>Its obvious zionism has been used to undermine judaism, just like the Saudi/wahhabi/alqaeda/isis thing (another anglo creation, see lawr of arabia) is lterally doing he exact same thing to destroy and undermine islam. And we all know how upside down christianity has become in some corners of the world. Its obvious the true culprits have no faith and worship only themselves and the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blood ritual has existed for millennia in dozens of different countries across the world. It&#39;s one of the main reasons Jews have been kicked out of hundreds of countries, sometimes twice! It would be foolish to dismiss every single case entirely throughout thousands of years as &quot;Antisemitism.&quot;</p>

<p>In their own Holy Bible, it chronicles the extensive conflict between the Canaanite-inspired blood ritualists who &quot;make their children pass through the fire,&quot; and the Torah-observant Hebrews who only wanted to sacrifice animals, and the occasional head or foreskin of a conquered nation. The Oprah clip is but one modern example. See the &#39;80s daycare crisis across the nation for more; especially at the military day cares. Look at recent Hollywood sex abuses and cults like Nexium. Ritual abuse continues to flourish. MK-Ultra was an effort to scientifically codify these methods. The similarities between Ewen Cameron&#39;s psychic driving experiments, Satanic Ritual Abuse, and Jewish Blood Ritual are striking; they are all versions of the same thing that traces back its origins to the ancient pagan and monotheistic world.</p>
