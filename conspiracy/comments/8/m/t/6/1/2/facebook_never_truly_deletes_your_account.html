       When I opted out of Fb in 2012 I had to contact fb equivalent of customer service numerous times and basically beg them to stop all communications and harassment . Daily emails trying to get me to come back , also had to beg to get my pictures off other people’s account as I felt it was a complete invasion of privacy to be tagged in photos (without my permission) on other peoples accounts . It took about 6 months to get them to stop harassing and stalking me

       I deleted my account about two years ago. On March 1st I received an email from Facebook saying that my account had been reactivated. First of all, reactivation should be impossible if my account was truly deleted after the 30 days it stated. Secondly, I did not reactivate my account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to log back in to see what the hell was going on, but I had to confirm my identity which it did not let me do. I received an error, if my memory serves correctly. The workaround would be me having to send Facebook a scan of an actual form of ID, which I'm obviously not going to do. My friend told me that I was not visible in any searches, so I just ignored the biweekly emails from Facebook about people I may know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just now did I try logging in via mobile and was successful. Unfortunately, I had to confirm my email along with my cellphone number. This really fucking pisses me off. I am forced to give them my information, which includes location as I am not on a mobile VPN, just in order to "delete" my account a second time.
      </p>
      <p>
       A weird part is that the people who Facebook recommended were mostly Chinese, with names written in Chinese. I am white and maybe had two Chinese people on my old friend's list however; I now work at a Chinese restaurant with several Chinese people who speak Cantonese and have Chinese Facebook friends who write in Chinese. I've also moved cities since I first deleted my account. I have not asked my coworkers if they know anyone that Facebook is recommending me. Maybe it's a coincidence, but I find it odd that Facebook would recommend me a bunch of Chinese people when I start working at a Chinese restaurant. If my coworkers do indeed know some of the people who Facebook is recommending me, I'll be sure to create a post and let people here know. It would imply that they are constantly keeping track of your location via cellphone even while not logged in.

       I believe that FB suggests friends based on location. If you're working in a building 5 days per week, you will start to see your coworkers who work in the same building come up as recommended friends.

       We know this. Facebook and Google actually have a. Vertual account of you without your permission. Where they track, analysose and save data on your browsing and searches etc. Thats tracking even if you dont have an account to begin with on sites thatbarent even affiliated with either company. They exploit us at every turn.

       Deactivated mine. Didnt log in for over a year. Everyone I talked to had full access to my feed. Nothing changed. Then I recieved an email telling me someone attempted to login to my account and that I should change my password. Unreal. Faceturd.

       Because deactivation =/= deletion. To permanently delete your facebook you have to find a link that is not available on settings (just google: "How to permanently delete facebook" and you'll find it in a couple of sites). Follow the steps and wait for 14 days. After 14 days you no longer have access to your account and after 90 days everything should be deleted from their servers. I deleted mine and when I  tried to log in after the 14 days to corroborate I effectively couldn't access my account.
