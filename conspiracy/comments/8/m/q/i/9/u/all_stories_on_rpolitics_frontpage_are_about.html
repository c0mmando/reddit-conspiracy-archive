<p>It used to be that there was only the JFK conspiracy and as long as you didn&#39;t mention that, there weren&#39;t any other conspiracies to worry about. </p>

<p>Now, we are expected to just accept that the president owes money to other countries, has public meetings with billionaires he is beholden to, has photo shoots with the king of saudi arabia holding some mystic orb, the pentagon is missing trillions of dollars, we have secret special forces at secret locations in a permanent invasion of syria and all of our internal security surveillance is handed over to israel, a country of religiousu fanatics thousuands of miles away.  </p>

<p>And then if you say you believe there are conspiracies, the &#39;mainstream&#39; says something about bigfoot or chupacabra and everyone laughs and back to talking about how the president used his connections with a foreign country to help him win an election while draping himself in the flag.  </p>

<p>What A Joke</p>

<p>This aversion to considering conspiracies is now a veritable, potentially fatal hole in the american consciousness.  </p>

<p>LBJ and Bush thought they were just killing a president, but they fucking labotomized the country, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.  A nation of 300 million people fully incapable of understanding how the world actually works, believing a fairy tale of history that none of the other 7 billion inhabitants of the planet believes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent observation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s abundantly clear that the conspiracy/alternative research movement was growing too powerful and it had to be coopted. </p>

<p>Trump, whether or not he&#39;s aware of it, provided the perfect catalyst for these efforts, the results of which you&#39;ve deftly pointed out.</p>

<p>As if calling bullshit on many aspects of the current MSM Russia conspiracy is the same as supporting Trump. You even double down on this garbage by your latter statement.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve literally seen <em>maybe</em> a handful of actual Trump apologists. Every single other person firmly belongs to the group I described above. This is especially true about journalists who talk about these same things.</p>
