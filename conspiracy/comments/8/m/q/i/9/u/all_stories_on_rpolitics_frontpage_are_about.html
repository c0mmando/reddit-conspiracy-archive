       Is anyone besides me seeing these shifting goalposts?

       It used to be that there was only the JFK conspiracy and as long as you didn't mention that, there weren't any other conspiracies to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we are expected to just accept that the president owes money to other countries, has public meetings with billionaires he is beholden to, has photo shoots with the king of saudi arabia holding some mystic orb, the pentagon is missing trillions of dollars, we have secret special forces at secret locations in a permanent invasion of syria and all of our internal security surveillance is handed over to israel, a country of religiousu fanatics thousuands of miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then if you say you believe there are conspiracies, the 'mainstream' says something about bigfoot or chupacabra and everyone laughs and back to talking about how the president used his connections with a foreign country to help him win an election while draping himself in the flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       What A Joke
      </p>
      <p>
       This aversion to considering conspiracies is now a veritable, potentially fatal hole in the american consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       LBJ and Bush thought they were just killing a president, but they fucking labotomized the country, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.  A nation of 300 million people fully incapable of understanding how the world actually works, believing a fairy tale of history that none of the other 7 billion inhabitants of the planet believes.

       SS: I am pointing out with this post the tremendous, ever-more-obvious contradiction in the idea that r/politics and r/conspiracy are considered such vastly different spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
       What many here consider simple research and study as an approach to understanding the world, is considered by some self-defined 'mainstream' to be a mental illness while they themselves claim to believe some naive story that is falling to shreds.

       Excellent observation.

       It's abundantly clear that the conspiracy/alternative research movement was growing too powerful and it had to be coopted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, whether or not he's aware of it, provided the perfect catalyst for these efforts, the results of which you've deftly pointed out.

       Lots of conspiracies start with a political bias and work backwards from there. That's why you also see a lot of Trump supporters around here think Trump hasn't done anything suspicious at all, and the only conspiracies worth believing are the ones where other people are just trying to make him look bad.

       As if calling bullshit on many aspects of the current MSM Russia conspiracy is the same as supporting Trump. You even double down on this garbage by your latter statement.

       I've literally seen
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       a handful of actual Trump apologists. Every single other person firmly belongs to the group I described above. This is especially true about journalists who talk about these same things.

       the only reason you see those stories on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is because they are anti trump. That subreddit is just about being pro democrat and attacking trump. Almost every post is a trump attack post. You won't ever see conspiracies that look bad for democrats.

       I've said this before, 2018 is the year Conspiracy Theory becomes mainstream.  Get ready for a whole new wave of normies wanting to know the truth.

       Not to worry people. Just tack
       <strong>
        Theory
       </strong>
       after any usage of the word "conspiracy". This will de-activate the loathsome content. Fall back position, refer to tinfoil hats, and "little green aliens". If that fails, ask for "sources" or "evidence" while pretending to wear a lab coat, you know, scientific-ish.

       Yup. I’ve said exactly this. R/politics has become r/conspiracy and r/conspiracy has become r/politics.
