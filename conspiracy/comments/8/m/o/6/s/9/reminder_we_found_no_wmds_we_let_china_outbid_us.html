<p>China is colonizing Africa right now, but they do it in a smart way: Land-leases, guaranteed rights to resource deposits, full control over the infrastructure etc. etc.</p>

<p>All American bullshit made in good ol&#39; USA by Uncle Dubya. How this single politician (GWB/Dubya) basically destroyed the entire country is beyond any scientific explanation.</p>

Sme with the middle east----- let those idiots fight amongst themselves until there are none left, it doesn&#39;t concern me and it shouldnt concern the US ingeneral. Its all about big oil and big business. They have been using our soldiers as private armies for decades. Until we quit sending soldiers to die because wall street investors are afraid of losing 3 points in their stocks we are nothing.  Our soldiers and vets deserve better. We deserve better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought this was especially sad about the whole thing. The USA created a reason for war. Sadly, by the time the end of the war had come and it was time to enjoy the spoils of said war, fracking had exploded on the scene!  This changed the calculus for everything and instead of America&#39;s long slow demise for its oil industry, it&#39;s suddenly now generating more oil than ever.</p>

<p>The idiots in charge had their &#39;need&#39; for the war obsoleted before they could even finishing toppling Iraq. And did anyone in America get publicly pissed off at the sheer incompetence of it all?  Not that I&#39;m aware of.  The people that think America righteous for warring with smaller weaker nations all over the world over the past seven decades never once stopped to consider just how especially terrible it was to fight a war that wasn&#39;t even necessary by the end of said war.  And those who hate war in general never really viably made the point that not only was it &#39;wrong&#39; morally, it was wrong strategically.</p>

<p>The rest of the world must really really hate America.</p>

<p>Oh, there were a lot of pissed off people (and still are), but our MilitaryIndustrialPropagandaComplex made it happen anyway. The NeoCons had massively destructive &quot;shock and awe&quot; media &amp; military tactical campaign plans but no political strategy after victory. The CIA and FBI &amp; Pentagon fed the MSM their talking points, and the House &amp; Senate rubber-stamped the whole horror show. There&#39;s a list of those who voted against it. </p>

<p>The dramatic, much-debated vote on Joint Resolution 114 was taken on October 11, 2002. It passed the Senate by a vote of 77 to 23, and the House of Representatives by a vote of 296 to 133.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where does this meme come from??  US profited plenty from Iraq oil fields.   Exxon under Tillerson even explored and developed new oil fields in Northern Iraq, and is working on the 2nd largest oilfield in the country.  </p>

<p>In addition many of these multinational corporations, are owned by international hedge funds, with plenty of American institutional investors, and have Americans on their board of directors. </p>

<p>Take for example BP, which is devolving the Rumaila oil field in Iraq.  It&#39;s board of directors has plenty of Americans on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/who-we-are/board-and-executive-management/the-board.html">https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/who-we-are/board-and-executive-management/the-board.html</a></p>

<p>We are not even going to talk about the fact that the primary beneficiaries of the Iraq war have been American private contractors. </p>

<p>There is a new book that just came out, called &quot;Iraq and the Politics of Oil: An Insider&#39;s Perspective&quot;, from Gary Vogler.  He claims in it that the war was about a pipeline that was supposed to go from Iraq to.... surprise, surprise... Israel.  Highly recommended. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the soldiers who died and were maimed may have believed it was for a grand purpose. But to the Empire rulers they were just cannon fodder. Their families are compensated by  receiving hero worship.
