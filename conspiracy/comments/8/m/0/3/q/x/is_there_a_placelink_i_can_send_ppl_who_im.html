       The whole Q phenom is "qontroversial" to put it mildly, and you're probably gonna get some shit from this subreddit for even bringing it up. Which is weird for a conspiracy forum, but that's nature of our discourse these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I'd direct people to
       <a href="https://twitter.com/prayingmedic">
        Praying Medic's Twitter Feed
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>

       He's not perfect, but it's the best analysis out there for "normies" and "newbies".
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helps.

       Q is an anonymous 4chan poster that has been leaving clues that kinda make sense and he claims trump it taking out empire and is going to save everyone. He posts stuff only a member of trumps inner circle would know, pics, predictions.
I think it’s obviously a cia psyop.

       Thanks, no one wants to talk to me about this. I can see why, but I’m really curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       What clues? And pics? And predictions? Does he say that everything’s going to be OK? Or that the public needs to do anything?

       Finally, how can I see the info? If anyone is doing surveillance on this comment, please note that while I am often called an SJW, I am really open to hearing different perspectives and because I’m a Reagan baby I don’t believe anything the government says, ever, including Obama.

       you need to spend your own time gathering the proof. Its easy for me to say this because ive been following it since mid november, but i can imagine how daunting of a task it would be for someone just picking it up. If you know all of the things that Q has confirmed to us that right there is half the battle, the other half as i state in the begining is gather proof. At this point in time if you have friends that you really care about i would suggest you dont try telling them about Q right now, wait for the EO to come out and for the letters to match up with the picture Q posted, as long as you wait for that and you have a bunch of other pieces of evidence to back you up there should be no doubting his validity at that point.

       EO stands for executive order. The president is the one who is supposed to create and sign them. I will give you links to pieces of evidence ive collected over the months, please make sure to save them. The main thing we are looking for is when a relatively important EO that has to do with the current issues that we are seeing on corruption comes up. the first link im posting is the picture of the EO Q gave us.

       look in the bottom right corner of that picture, you can see letters there, they appear to be the letters rti and a, if the EO comes out with those same letters in that same position that is absolute proof that Q is legit.

       there might be a summary somewhere online compiling predictions but i havent seen one yet. honestly as of now this is the only way to do this, collect the evidence on your own and show it to people when the time is right. I gave you the EO that Q showed us, as well as a bunch of coincidences below that. just save everything and wait for the EO to come out, if it matches up like i explained there is no way you wont hear about it.

       Yes, freed would be an understatement but yes. now that you have those pictures, it will be up to you to do research online to find everything online about what Q has been telling us. I would advise you steer away from youtube as people on there are giving out blatant disinformation, either on purpose or accident. I would post everything hes told us here but it is quite allot, something more fitting for an actuall thread topic.

       Well i cant claim to know exactly what is being planned, i know at the very least the aim is to root out all sources of corruption in the world. I honestly cant imagine that genocide would be on the menu though, if such a thing occured while a decent amount of the population knew about Q there would be riots for sure, something that the Q team definitely wants to avoid. The thing you can expect for sure if this all turns out to be real, allot of conspiracies theories will start getting validated, and something is going to be done about all of it. Oh also... when the EO comes out and it displays flawlessly Q's legitimacy, make sure not to talk about the conspiracy theories surrounding the jews and israel. The bare minimum i would discuss about that is "Q said this one time israel is being saved for last" but dont tell them anything else, act dumb untill more drops come from Q on the JQ. You can talk about the Rothschilds and Soros though, not really too much risk there when the main argument is just about who they are and what they have done.

       yea, the main reason why you would want to avoid it is because of all the antisemitsim attached to it. while that isnt what the JQ is about at its core, that is what most people will percieve it as, unless of course Q is the one to break it down for us later on.

       Ok, I’ve been thinking all day. I realize I still don’t understand this very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, people think Q will validate their conspiracy theories. There are no specifics, which suggests to me that Q doesn’t want to take  sides on conspiracies. Rather he is marketing the idea to all conspiracist theorists that one day, their perspectives will be validated, whatever they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you mind responding to this admittedly naive observation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, are there any conspiracies that Q refutes?

       there is one conspiracy i remember Q denouncing, back when there was that weird pentagon story involving a secret ufo black project, they even had a video internally in a pilots cockpit where they are observing a few unidentified flying objects. people were asking Q if aliens were in fact real or if they had visited earth. Q responded with "how far away is the closest star to mankind?" 4.24 light years, an absolutly absurd amount of distance, then he said "what do you think" implying that aliens at the very least have never visited our planet. Now i know this is going off on a tangent here, but consider how explosive it would be if undeniable proof surfaced showing aliens had actually visited our planet. I feel that even though Q told us essentially that it has never happened, that he would never really come out and tell us it has happened either.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway back on topic. It isnt that he isnt discussing specifics, Q is pointing us to open source information in order to confirm with us that these things actually exist, its only happened a handfull of times where Q specifically has went out of his way to tell us something that wasnt open source. So while with most things Q doesnt directly come out and say xyz is real, he is pointing us in that direction as well as responding to anons posts to confirm with us that that anon got it correct. the main point right now though is focusing on whats happening with the russia investigation and how its completely fallen apart, and now the new spygate thats being talked about allot in news in this past week. focus on revelations involving the clinton foundation as well as revelations regarding pizzagate. It will all come out in time.
