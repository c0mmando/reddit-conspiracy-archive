    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       So I am sick and tired of this very specific conversation:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "pizzagate is real"
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        "oh so you think Hillary raped and tortured countless children in a pizzaplace in Washington DC? Yeah sure man"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       NO. For fucks sake, no one ever said that in the first place, and no one actually believes this kind a statement at all. "The Washington Post mentioned that in their article once news about pizzagate broke free, and that's when all this stuff began to become badmouthed as a conspiracy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's get the facts straight:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In the Podesta Mails, some anons found weird wordings and phrases. These phrases were said to be code for pedophiles, which could most likely be fake. HOWEVER:
       </li>
       <li>
        These mails mentioned Comet Ping Pong as a place, where one could meet up. This made a few anons study this very specific pizza place.
       </li>
       <li>
        They found the owner of this very specific pizza place, James Alefantis, to have been posting some rather
        <strong>
         weird pictures
        </strong>
        of children.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some of them were taped to a table, and didn't look too happy
       </li>
       <li>
        Some pics of babies were titled as "whore"
       </li>
       <li>
        Some other weird pics from that instagram page raised a few anons eyebrow.
       </li>
       <li>
        an allegedly leaked FBI document of pedophile symbols did lead to a inspection of the symbols of each shop around that pizza place, after these very symbols were found within the logo and menu of comet ping pong.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         wether these symbols are real or not, doesn't matter for this place to at least having had left a weird impression on the anons doing the research
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -Satanic symbols were found in a room within comet ping-pong and the logo, too.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The "Finders", "Dutroux Affair" alongside the "Franklin Coverup" came to the mind of anons. All these cases were
         <strong>
          proven to be an appearance in the past of pedophilia connected to satanism and politicians or at least elitist members of the society
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         *
         <em>
          Any further research from this point should have not been discredited in the way we actually have seen it been to. *
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       TL;DR: pizzagate is not about Hillary raping children in a basement of a pizzaplace, but this very specific pizza place was found to be lead by a person that posted photos of children in relation to sexual meanings, as well as photos of children that didn't look very comfortable taped on a table. While one can argue about the symbolism, these facts alone should have legalized any further research without any doubt, as this is an absolutely improper behavior towards minors.

       Thank you for the read.

       "Pizzagate" is a term that undermines the mass harvesting of innocents. This term was given to you, if reflects the image of a goofy conspiracy claiming nut. The ancient aliens fellow comes to mind.

       No, that’s what you want everyone to believe but that is simply not the case. I want to also mention that James Alefantis is not on the up and up. Here we have a man who was pronounced the 49th most powerful man in Washington DC by GQ magazine. His occupation? Pizza restaurant owner, and for most of the week the kitchen is open for 4 hours a day. Now let’s say you think there is nothing wrong with his disgusting instagram posts. Fine. However, there was found to be a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/TnW7OT6Dkuw">
        protected section on the Comet Ping Pong website
       </a>
       . What was on that protected section? According to Titus Frost (real name Dean Fougere) and the hacker Bigfish, there was “Cheese Pizza” aka Child Pornography on that website.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/HTRewHDOr90">
        In this video, you can see the e-mails that we’re sent to the Washington DC police department officer Marcus Stevens, and he shows that Officer Marcus Stevens confirmed receipt of the e-mail as well.
       </a>
       And to the naysayers who will inevitably come out of the woodwork to say that there is no real proof to what I am saying and that the e-mails could have been fabricated, as could evidence of the protected section of the Comet Ping Pong website, I would like to remind you that falsely accusing someone of possessing and distributing child pornography is an extremely serious crime which would almost certainly result in jail time if James Alefantis were to persue a lawsuit against Dean Fougere andthr hacker Bigfish, so if you honestly think that these men would risk their freedom by making up this whole story in order to get more views on their YouTube video or whatever motive you can come up with, you’re out of your mind.

       It certainly looks like you just put a bunch of links in there to give the
       <em>
        appearance
       </em>
       of sourcing your claims, when really your references are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A post from 4chan (ironically enough)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A web archive to the password protected page itself (which doesn't show menus of any kind)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       3 and 4. The incident report from when the kid went in with an AR to "investigate"... which is 100% irrelevant to the comment you replied to.

       I linked the police report because parent linked to a video talking about speaking to an officer in DC. Yes that happened but the only files released had nothing to do with pedophillia just the comet shooter which is the only crime with any evidence that's occurred at comet.

       I've been around this community for quite some time. Are you trying to present some blogger making completely unverified and unsubstantiated claims as "proof" of someone lying?

      <p>
       Again, that has absolutely nothing to do with the video posted by
       <a href="/u/GoddamnFreemasons">
        /u/GoddamnFreemasons
       </a>
       . The video shows the email correspondence of the evidence from the password protected section being submitted to Officer Stevens. The fact that you're trying to link the unrelated police report of a separate incident is suspicious.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I linked 4chan because a user there in the original investigation thread identified the password protected area as a normal Web template.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sooooo... your proof is literally "this random person on 4chan said so"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it both ironic and troubling that everyone seems to say there's "no evidence for p-gate" and "it's all from random people on 4chan, no actual evidence!" when that's completely untrue... meanwhile, you're "evidence" for it being fake is based on literally the
       <strong>
        opinions
       </strong>
       of a random blogger, and a random 4chan poster, with no real evidence whatsoever.

       It is. This is a well doing shill. Instead of arguing the meaning of the concerns made, he goes as simple as pointing out spelling differences. He doesn't provide any evidence against, he just demands evidence (such as videos of a kid being killed and raped, easy huh?), and points out random mistakes by his advocate, refusing to even try to understand our message.

       Like, what do you think about the world of politics?  That politics is NOT power?  As if that power doesn't cause certain groups to go to any and all lengths to achieve power?  You think JFK was actually killed by the lone nut Oswald?

       hilary herself may not be directly mixed up in the pizzagate issue but John Podesta was her guy for the primaries.  The connections there are maybe circumstantial but these people all work in the same cicles in DC.  Even if hilary was aware but not connected, should she not be a decent person and get these people arrested?  Does that not make her part of the problem?

       probably it was and i'm sorry, i have no sense of humour on reddit bc everyone's so horrible lmao.  i am interested though in learning more about the whole thing...but im not sure where to start.  for instance from what i think i know, israel conquered palestine many years ago, and israel are zionists right?  so britain and the us do deals with israel all the time...and they are in agreement with palestine being attacked still?

       Not saying he is, but think for one second as to why a ping pong pizza shop might be on the list. Probly not for delicious food. But anyway I remember you arguing with a guy early, not arguing with a guy with your history. Not saying he's a pedo, but there may be something going on.

       dont worry its all bubbling up to the surface. look at the backlash to that movie "showdogs" that teaches kids to go to their "zen place" (read dissociation) while strangers fondle their genitals.

       Oh boy... you said the P word. Prepare for mass downvotes in a couple of hours (ya know, once
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       make it into the office)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another hilarious tactic that you’ll constantly see, is they’ll use the kid who went in to CPP and “shot it up” (aka shot 1 bullet through a hard drive) as justification for not wanting to discuss the idea any further because “look what it made someone do to this poor innocent pizza shop owner! These people are insane!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Then if you try to bring up the suspicious moving of traffic cams just before the shooting, or the shooters weird family government connections, they’ll just stop responding to you, but the downvotes will keep coming.
      </p>

       Good post. Very interested to see how this thread will play out (don’t have very high hopes for you though).

       There was more than one shot fired, that is another lie propagated by certain actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the hard drive was not hit directly, the bullet went through the cd drive/top of the pc tower.

        The camera was moved because 4chan found it and were hammering the stream.

       Seems rather convenient that it went down less than 24 hours before the shooting.

       Yeah, they moved the camera shortly before the shooting because too many people were viewing the steam, and then moved it back soon after the shooting. Riiiiight.

       I was going to point that part out too, but I had trouble finding any proof that it was moved back a day or two after the shooting to back up my claim. And when you look at the camera now, it's aimed in a completely different direction.
      </p>

       Got a source for the moving back part? Because that's how I remember it too, but I couldn't find anything.

       Thanks for the primary sources.  However, to your last point regarding Besta Pizza, their logo couldn't have been any more spot-on to one of the pedophilic symbols from the FBI page.  It understandably raised some eyebrows at the time considering their neighbor Comet's Instagram and the theory that tunnels were in use.

       There are many people that think the abuse could be taking place underground. This is due to the multiple Comet Ping Pong Instagram pictures where construction is being down to the floors. They're digging into the floors. Also when I'm not on mobile I'm going to link a document where the owner of DuPont underground personally thanks James Alefantis for helping him with a project. I believe he also thanks Dr. Pong who is related to Pizzagate via Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but you really don't know what you're talking about with regard to many aspects of Pizzagate.

       Also again, when I'm not on mobile, I'm posting the 2007 video by Frank Winstead where a child can he heard yelling for help. The sound is coming from Comet Ping Pong. What's even more peculiar is that the child screams the loudest for help as a family walks over the manhole in front of Comet Ping Pong

       The first few days after the CPP instagram page was introduced to 4chan there were theories discussed regarding tunnels stemming from a couple of the posts of basement renovations (#killroom) and a YouTube video that a random guy had uploaded years prior that sounded like a child yelling for help from under the street outside CPP.

       None of it turned into anything solid, but at the time there was enough smoke that deserved to be looked into further.

       I have a footage of an alleged Comet Ping Pong employee saying that there was only 1 shot. I'll post it when I'm not on mobile. If this was a false flag, why wouldn't they be able to tamper with the incident report and say there was more than one shot

       It's interesting how in the early posts there was also discussion of these underground WiFi hotpots in Hawaii that were somehow related and how selling art was used to launder money - now it transpires some shady guys around Trump broke the world record buying art as if it were the most brazen money laundering in history.

       Yeah man, I still believe that was a false flag. No logical person that was researching into it would ever shoot a suspect's computer as it could have destroyed extremely valuable evidence.

       I don't believe someone snapped; I believe it was planned in an attempt to discredit the conspiracy and possibly to destroy evidence.

       You obviously have no clue how the law works if you think those flimsy connections you made somehow are enough for a police force to go in a privately owned business and sweep the place for pedophilia. Let's not act like pizzagate didn't start with the handkerchief with a picture of a pizza and an email talking a playing dominoes high on cheese. Both of those were taking from the hacks of Jon Podesta email accounts. Then 4chan in true neckbeard fashion took all context out of those statements said the cheese and pizza he's referring to are code words for pedophilia and a bunch of ignorant right wingers believed it and a bunch of malicius right wingers saw it as an opportunity to paint the then dem presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, as a either a pedophile or knowingly works to get them children

       It could be but I don't make assumptions about what people are trying to say. If somebody puts legalized I'm not going to assume they actually meant legitimized. Also how do you legitimize research that started on 4chan?

       There's ways to legitimize it. Usually, it will start with

       I could see that as being legalized research, I suppose. I never really thought of it that way. Well, I'm not going to argue with you there. All of it is circumstantial. Then again, most conspiracies stem from circumstantial evidence, so while I don't demonize the people involved, I can't quite discount the circumstances surrounding the allegations.

       I just think it's foolish to investigate a crime that no victim has come forward for. Plus it's pretty apparent this was an attempt to paint Hilarys campaign as being ran by a pedophile. You would have to investigate every weird thing people do if you keep taking circumstantial evidence and assume it's a crime yet there's never been a victim

       You are demanding a proof. What kind of evidence do you want? Are you totally retarded to discard a conspiracy because it's lacking evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is actually the meaning of having a theory involving several actors without having a concrete evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's literally what this sub is about, one can't start an actual discussion around facts, as there are people like you that want to have evidence for the theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was about concrete evidence, then this would be a news board, not a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state of this sub is beyond ridiculous, and I definitely will try to change that.

       Listen to yourself. You're saying it ridiculous people ask for evidence. A victim,an eye witness, some physical evidence, a camera picking up children being led somewhere,. Anything other than cheese pizza and a handkerchief with a picture of pizza on it. At least with ufos there's some footage and other government conspiracies have plenty of evidence to point to as factual. Theories presented with no evidence can be dismissed with no evidence

       When in reality there is a basement under Comet Ping Pong but the entrance is on Buck's Fishing and Camping side which he also happens to own. It's not rocket science but these people are playing dumb in order to derail convos

       Again, that was pointed out during Pizzagate, that very same interview to prove that he in fact did have a basement

       I would actually love to have a discussion with you, but now I have the absolute proof that you are not interested in debunking anything, you are interested in pointing out mistakes made by each of the poster within their statements, neglecting the actual message behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is actually brilliant, but it doesn't work. It makes you just look like incredible narrow minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Les Entfants and Alefantis doesn't sound similar because of two n?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be narrow minded, but for it to be close to an anagram, it should be sufficient

       I pointed out an obvious flaw in the anagram theory.

      <p>
       That's not ignoring evidence, it's proving that piece of evidence doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

       Lots of words sound similar. It's not evidence someone is a pedophile.

       how is this the same? Is James Alefantis a parent? Are his friends really the parent types? No theyre gay males calling the babys whores and making pedo references in other photographs. If you dont see something wrong with all those photo's you are in a very severe case of denial. Or you are intentional disinfo

       Oh ok, the one that read like an advertisement for the luzatto kids who we still have yet to hear from. Saying spend some time with her now, raw and uncut. Yes very much what you said. I wrote a blog post concerning some of this a while ago. Feel free to read.

       Here's an old comment I saved about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a blog of cute baby pictures with a few videos. Tamera Luzzatto did not run the blog, Evie's father did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a little bit archived here:
       <a href="http://archive.is/3nW3z">
        http://archive.is/3nW3z
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There were more pictures archived on sli.mg but that site has been down since mid-January.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, there's nothing unusual about the photos
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there's something sinister about the phrase "raw and uncut", but that's just the way he writes.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Well, after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the biggest group of pictures:
       <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">
        https://archive.is/2g30Y
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, there's nothing suspicious about
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="https://archive.is/8PZDn">
        here is the first post on the blog:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is where the magic happens!
       </p>
       <p>
        Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie's blog! And our friends should thank us---by indulging ourselves with this web portal we are NOT filling your inboxes with large files of pictures and videos!
       </p>
       <p>
        Enjoy and we will look forward to your comments....
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="https://archive.is/Gm498">
        another one from that day:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Evie's first day
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is Dad the night I was born. Very glad he didn't make it through Organic Chemistry to become a doctor, this site doesn't inspire confidence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, it is the father who made the site.

       This website is anything from normal. Nothing unusual at all. Accept a picture of James Alefantis at the birth, when prior to this they had no known connection. And the sketchy email by the Luzattattos was something completely unrelated w John podesta. I read your comment. Read my blog post

       pizzagate/pedogate is bigger than the real or imagined basement of a single pizza joint.  Pedophiles exist.  Some ascend to positions of power and authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labeling pizzagate as "hillary clinton raped and murdered kids in a dc pizza parlor" is simply a damage control tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The PG investigation has sparked interest in many people and led to countless arrests and removal of harmful content on the internet.

       I agree.

       My point is none of the pizzagate evidence suggests James, John, Tony, Hillary or Bill or anyone else mentioned is a pedophile.

       Agree, great post. One correction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI symbols is not alleged. You can view the document on the FBI website. It is a fact that pedos use those symbols to communicated to other pedos.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also very good evidence that "cheese pizza" is a common euphemism /code word for child porn. Chicken is another term. There are other terms that are validated by law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer list that 4chan cited from the emails, including maps, dominoes, and walnut sauce, is very questionable, however.

      <p>
       This is a bit vague. If you actually look at the emails such as the handkerchief email or the outdoor pool email John Podesta doesn't use any of the alleged code. The words are used by a real estate agent and Susan Sandler, a family friend.

       Can you cite this email? Podesta and Alefantis held a few publicity events at Comet to raise money for the dem campaign.

       So? Raised eyebrows about a public instagram post aren't evidence someone is a pedophile.

      <p>
       The FBI symbols were not part of the comet logo although there may have been a spiral on the menu somewhere. Spirals are a very common shape.

      <p>
       That's fine but once again a weird feeling because of a shape on a pizza menu isn't evidence Alefantis is a pedophile.

      <p>
       What facts? Nothing you have posted is evidence much less evidence of a pedophile ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with pizzagate is it starts at the end (child abuse happens) then tries to insert these various innocuous details the paint this evil picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate was an organised political smear campaign - that's the real conspiracy.

       You can research the symbolism for satanism in almost any library on earth, they are known and proven to be used by Satanic cults. One of them is displayed quite accurately in the comet ping-pong logo, however even if that's not important, those pictures and comments were.

Don't try to distract, I said many times symbolism might be random and without any meaningful message.

       If you did accept the fact that each of these cases deals with pedophilia and satanism by elitist members, then yes, this is exactly what would have been in common with James Alefantis, rich member of the society, molesting children while showing appreciation to occultism.

       Where I come from playing with kids is popular. James didn't call a child hotard, his friend in the comments on instagram used the hashtag hotard and then James used it back in another comment. So he was talking to his friend, regardless leaving such a comment isn't evidence of pedophillia.

       Its obvious he's a pedophile or something similar maybe a fanboy. That's absolutely disgusting. I don't get why pedophile is a common denominator in many elite circles such as the Catholic Church, English Parliament and Afgan government. But any time it's mentioned here it's downvoted and told that it's all lies.

       The 2nd photo shows a friend of James posting on instagram. James doesn't comment on the post as far as I can see. How is that evidence podesta and Alefantis are pedophiles?
      </p>
      <p>
       The image from a message board claiming pizza parlours are used by pedophiles is just that - a post by a random on a message board. It's not evidence James is a pedophile, as you say.

Your right, I must've grabbed the wrong link. But while we are on the topic of instagram, why is/was James' profile pic Antinous? That's odd behavior like yours.

        What does this Robertson guys arrest have to do with James? Guilt by association? That's not convincing me that James is a pedophile.

       I don't think you understand. We aren't here giving proof that James is a pedophile. We are pointing out things that are weird. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's probably a duck.

       Regardless, even if James did mean the "lover of underage males" meaning - it could simply be a joke in poor taste. The sort of thing you share with friends until 1000 4chan users message you telling you you're a pedophile.

       It's just to easy for all of this stuff to be confirmation bias for me to believe any part of it. So collectively I think it's just this hodge podge of unconnected stuff that doesn't mean any th9.

Like a duck. And because this feels like a duck feather we should try and ruin someone's life, because feelings are apparently truth now

       Let's not forget Alefantis' pal literally makes child sized coffins and has a concrete floor in his box van. He also refers to Alefantis as his boss. He posted an instagram pic of a coffin titled "KILL ROOM"...

       Actually that absolutely deserves attention. It was a deliberate choice that the Disney animators or whoever greenlighted that idea had to make. Disney has inserted a lot of other hidden sexual messages into their movies in the past as well. I think you are in denial about all of this. To not be able to see any kind of pattern when you clearly know about many of the examples of these sorts of things which are getting people riled up. But you seem to be very passionate about explaining everything away and telling everyone that they are crazy for thinking it’s a conspiracy and that there is really nothing to see here.

       So nothing about the content of his post? Just gonna talk about post history? Is that because you have nothing to say to dispute what he says? That’s what we’ll assume until you post otherwise.

      <p>
       I'm from Belgium and trust me on this , the Dutroux affair wasn't properly investigated at all. Many, many people will tell you the whole thing stinks to high hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, 27 people that were supposed to testify on this network or that had information pointing in that direction ended up dead before they could get in front of an officer or judge, the judge that got the case first decided to go on a vacation and failed to pass along the case, causing the missing girls to be found weeks later than necessary, some cops burnt a box of videos found at Dutroux's place before they could be used in court because "we watched them and there wasn't anything on them", judges and prosecutors were shuffled around and some failed to act competently seemingly on purpose, Dutroux's escape, the first prosecutor of the case fully believed in the network theory and today still argues that there was much more that his predecessor failed to look into. The guy that replaced him was a rookie btw, it was his first case. Look into it man, the Dutroux affair might've been exactly what Dutroux himself claims it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       We even changed our entire police system and passed some major reforms because the people had lost all faith in our justice system. Plenty of people still remember.

       It's tape and not acid, a kid can have tape on their hands and think that is fun. Do you consider tape a dangerous weapon? can you explain how having tape on your hands is automatically sexual? Honestly that sounds like a personal problem you've got there.

       I’ve already proved you wrong, kids play with tape on a regular basis across the country in arts and crafts. Playing with tape is the opposite of weird by definition because most kids do it. You’ve addressed none of my points and this is a pretty poor pivot so I assume you’ve got nothing here. Resume your baseless pearl clutching,

       Okay kiddo, keep using mental gymnastics to try to and defend pedophilia.  Note, there is no way for you to come out looking like a good guy in this.
      </p>

       For all your talk, you think very little. Maybe next time keep your mouth closed and not prove your idiocy by opening it so the world can watch you defend and try and normalize degeneracy.

       Yo bruh. I saw a fair few Instagram pictures from accounts that were friends and part of Alefantis' Instagram circle jerk. ALOT were all fucked up. The most fucked one was a lil boy, very young, being fingered by the devil.

       If that's not weird then nothing is. Do not care what you say if you post that on your account. You a monster.

       I know pizzagate is real because the subreddit was shut down without warning due to the research people were doing.   People were finding out some shit and connecting big names.   It seems Washington DC is ripe with pedophilia.  Only idiots who listen to the news and paid shills believe Hilary was raping kids in the restaurant basement.   It’s all done on purpose to make us look like lunatics.  I’ve never EVER seen such an effort from shills to discredit this theory.   Not even for the craziest conspiracies.  Not even for stuff like 9/11.  But politicians being involved with trafficking and satanic ritual abuse is out of the question.   That’s how I know it’s real.

       I saw your ten paragraph comment on this post....this is what I mean, the effort you people go through to shun pizzagate is fucking ridiculous and suspect.   Imagine if you spent half as much time looking into it instead of picking every little thing apart.  Most of your points were rubbish anyway.   I don’t recall any doxxing and I was there.  Nothing.  It didn’t happen.   It’s another way to discredit us.   It was shut down because of the information people were finding about JA, Pegasus museum, Podesta etc but mostly JA.

       Do you think creating a website for your toddler and listing the footage as “raw and uncut” is normal?  I certainly don’t.  What about all the paintings of abused kids in Tony Podesta’s Home?  Normal to you?  Or the pictures of babies on JA’s instagram with the disgusting captions??  It may be circumstantial but it’s a conspiracy sub.  This is what we have to go off.  It’s acceptable for literally EVERY other conspiracy but not PG.  Why?  Because people are paid to discredit it? YES.

       Which is fine, which is why I am providing a counter point to your claims. I don't fear questions about the subject but you seem eager to shut down discussions which don't agree with your preconceived narrative.

       You don't think it's weird for Luzzatto to have Uber deliver her kids (ages 11, 9 and almost 7) to a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere to serve as "entertainment" for a bunch of middle-aged men?

       Newborn baby is even weirder.  Let’s put our child all over the internet with a dodgy caption about access to her videos.  That sounds like something off a porn site not one about kids. Don’t gimme bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh the paintings were fine to you? If you went to someone’s house and saw paintings of half naked kids who are clearly traumatised, together with a bronze statue of a murder victim....you would think that was normal?
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re not providing a counter point you’re coming onto pizzagate arguments so you can trash talk it.  Defending pedophilia isn’t a counter argument believe it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s nothing normal about the arguments I presented to you yet you’re behaving as if it is the norm.  It’s not.   Go on Instagram and see how many people have pictures of random kids on there.  Not many.  And it wasn’t just one picture of his goddaughter (a goddaughter that had noticeable bags under her eyes which sure isn’t ok for a child) it was many pictures of kids and babies.  One was calling a baby a slut.  The other said chicken hawk which is a derogatory term.  Fuck you for defending these pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding your other point, I am not pushing any narrative or forcing people to believe the opposite, that’s what people like you and shills do.  I just find myself getting increasingly frustrated with this god awful website and speaking to people like you who seems to think JA is OK.  he is not and neither are you.  Fuck off now will you

       Baby blogs are quite common, or they were a few years ago before everyone was in Facebook. The blog even explained its purpose was so they didn't clog up people's inboxes with baby photos.

       </p>

      <p>
       What paintings are you referring to specifically? Paintings are imaginary and the Biljana Djurdjevic paintings I think you're referring to aren't based on real life.

And it wasn’t just one picture of his goddaughter (a goddaughter that had noticeable bags under her eyes which sure isn’t ok for a child) it was many pictures of kids and babies.  One was calling a baby a slut.  The other said chicken hawk which is a derogatory term.  Fuck you for defending these pedophiles.

       There are

        lots of images of children on instagram

       of course they're not random, and the ones James posted are known to him and his friends too.

       You talk about James calling a baby a slut but that is fabricated. Can you source it?

       i typed out a whole thing and deleted it because it's not worth it.  the downvotes, the shills, the defensive comments, i'm tired of it.  i've been arguing with pedo sympathisers since this whole thing started.  i'm really tired of it tbh.  the same arguments over and over again because people are too thick to realise what's normal and what's not.  you are defending a pedophile and ultimately you will have to answer to that someday.

       you've won, honestly.  you're right.  i've changed my mind about the whole thing.  there's nothing shady about james alefantis or his friends at all.  hrc.  john podesta.  they are all fine.  nothing means anything.  we were all just bored.

       It's not about winning, it's about the truth. You believe these people (who?) are pedophiles when no one has presented evidence they are.

       How many children do you think the pizzagate investigation has protected? I'd say zero. This time could have been spent actually protecting some of the thousands of trafficked children in the US, alas here we are discussing 5 year old emails about handkerchiefs.

       Pizzagate is about a lot more than that pizza shop. Its about the very real evidence that exists that implicates people in positions of power. Elites, politicians, etc. In the practice of satanice ritual abuse and pedophilia. This is a very real thing regardless of what you think of pizzagate. So maybe pizzagate is a psyop, to group all these other theories into the same crazy box. But once you become more familiar with the subject its really hard to completely dismiss. And spending your time trying to debunk such theories in the manner you are is not only futile but counterproductive. If you truly have an interest in debunking the heart of these theories heres some places to start. Heres the first BBC documentary Conspiracy of Silence, which was pulled by unknown forces days before it aired in 94. Lucky for humanity a copy was leaked out.

       You could call this next one the sequel. They both deal with unbelievable corruption in very high places. Satanic Ritual Abuse. And pedophile raquets in very high places. Might make you think before you dismiss these other theories so easily.

       witch hunt?  or....looking at the evidence and going from that.  as far as i know, hilary clinton is living free and well.  same as john podesta.  james alefantis is probably still getting hard over toddlers. 
so if it is a witch hunt.  it's not really a good one.

       I'm on your side! Like you said, it may all be circumstantial, but people have to admit that it is all very odd and suspicious.

      <p>
       Okay, if any of my friends were posting pictures of children duct taped on their instagram or other social media, I would be a little alarmed and concerned. Very odd to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all the art in my home is quite normal and tame. All pictures of either "horse racing scenes" (husband loves horse racing), landscape pictures with flowers, and some art of local buildings/scenery by a local artist. All very normal to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of my friends have normal art in their homes too. If I ever went to somebody's house or office and they had the art that the Podesta's have, I wouldn't go back to their house. I also wouldn't be friends with them. I would distance myself from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that website with the "raw and uncut" footage is very weird and not normal.

       It should be known that the actual triangular spiral symbol was never found anywhere in or on Comet Ping Pong. However there was a shop called Besta Pizza a few stores down that used the symbol. All Comet Ping Pong had was some strange and eccentric artwork and the instagram pictures of the owner you referred to. It should Also be noted thst Tony Podesta had a home magazine take pictures inside his Kalorama Heights mansion in D.C. There were some very violent and disturbing images on the walls and sculptures aswell as children dolls around his and his wife's bed.

       A band that played at Comet several times had the pedo spiral triangle in their music video. There were also performances at Comet where someone disguised as Majestic Ape makes creepy pedo jokes. More people need to see these affiliations.

       Pizzagate is real. Child trafficking among the elites is fucking real. They're all going to rot in prison. They'll get gangraped in the ass so many times their asshole is going to need stitches all the way up to their neck. Pedophilia is one of the worst possible crimes you could ever commit. These people should be burned at the stake or other public execution.

       I'm sick of this conversation:

      <p>
       "Pizzagate isn't real."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh so you think pizzagate is literally Hillary raping and eating babies at Comet Ping Pong?"
      </p>
      <p>
       No, pizzagate is bullshit because it's entirely based on the willingness to believe. The theory was born because people were so desperate to find something wrong in those emails they decided that "eating pizza" means "fucking children"
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that there are pizzagaters who think Hillary and others performed satanic human sacrifices at Comet Ping Pong and other locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "actually pizzagate isn't Hillary raping babies in a pizza parlor basement" argument is so transparent, it doesn't make the theory less ridiculous it just says the ridiculous elements don't piece together in that exact way.

       No, the reason people like you have such a problem with Pizzagate is that you feel like its attacking "your team" mostly because much of it came from John Podesta's leaked emails. Its sad that some people are so partisan that they violently reject any conspiracy that might make "their team" look bad.

      </p>
      <p>
       NO PERSON INVESTIGATING PIZZAGATE THOUGHT THAT WAS REAL OR CREDIBLE.  IT IS A WAY FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THE MEDIA TO DISCREDIT US BY MAKING US LOOK LIKE MENTALISTS
      </p>
      <p>
       so show me who said that.
      </p>
      <p>
       pizzagate...is not based on the willingness to believe......where do you people even get this fucking shit.  people have not made up that CHILD PORN = CHEESE PIZZA.  that's a real thing on the dark web and dating back to the 90s.

       Sacrifice by the political elite isn't a new conspiracy theory; it goes back YEARS, originally it was believed (and many still do) that sacrifices took place at the Bohemian Grove.
      </p>

       Yet it's inconceivable to you once you alter the location?

       It actually goes back to Antinous, Hadrian's supposed lover who was sacrificed on the Nile. I would be wary of anyone making reference to both occultic sacrifice and Antinous.

       I think the most basic thing that can be agreed upon is that child sex rings are thriving and they need to be stopped. after that one begins to question the validity of the the path they have taken to fight this evil. In the example of Pizzagate, for some, the evidence is proficient to accuse. For others it is not. Because of this, the question arises: "when do our efforts to expose and incriminate predatory sex offenders actually hinder our ability to do so?" Of course chasing empty leads is wasted time, which could have been spent actually exposing child sex rings. Yet, one of the greatest moments of shame in the pursuit of Justice is when an abandoned lead actually lead somewhere, and if only you had kept pushing you would have found what you were looking for. Equally so for false accusations... anywho, I'm excited to be able to participate in the conversation.

       Well done, this is solid work!

      <p>
       Lets not forget a couple more eyebrow raisers:
      </p>
      <p>
       -the likely false flag attack on cpp to play them as the victims in the media and further discredit our tireless investigative findings
      </p>
      <p>
       -the media in general bad mouthing pizzagate truthers
      </p>
      <p>
       -reddit closing down the now defunct r/pizzagate and forcing the conversation to continue over on voat
      </p>
      <p>
       -Alefantis and associates made many bizarre posts including showing what appears to be a kill room, and references to satanic worship
      </p>
      <p>
       -the neighborhood that pizzagate happens to be. Estimated 90% of govt (CIA employees)
      </p>
      <p>
       -the "artwork" displayed in cpp and flyers for "all ages shows" hosted there. Wholesome acts such as "the sex stains"
      </p>
      <p>
       -alefantis connections with the Democrats and Obama whitehouse/visits to the whitehouse
      </p>
      <p>
       -the audio/video that surfaced on that strange website that appeared to feature that worm Podesta (skippy) saying "say my name" repeatedly to a victim
      </p>

       One very important detail that is being left out here in terms of evidence is MAJESTIC APE a.k.a. AMANDA KLEINMAN, from the band HEAVY BREATHING who play at CPP. She sounds either transgender or like a gay man which leads many to believe it is actually JA under the mask and wig.
       <br/>
       Seriously, look at their website. Watch their videos, where majestic ape speaks of Jared Fogle being a regular "down there" and when the crowd shouts that he likes kids, "We all have preferences!! teehee!!" ... There is a lot of disturbing innuendo used and a lot of it is pretty blatant but also cryptic enough to not expose what their real intentions are. Look up the video for The Neutered Noel.
      </p>
      <p>
       CPP features a lot of weird band posters too with subtle pedophilic symbols included in the designs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There you go, actual creepy empirical evidence of weird fuckery.

       The Dutroux affair and Pizzagate are definitely real but don't fall into the trap of thinking Republicans are going to save you. Trump was tight with both Epstein and the Clintons, flew on the lolita express, had a pedophile for a campaign worker (Tim Nolan) and another pedophile for a financial backer (Senator Ralph Shorty). `100% of politicians are compromised and can't be trusted to clean things up. Stop looking to the system to save you from the system.

       "Weird" and "didn't look too happy" are entirely subjective. "Said to be" and "allegedly" are not evidence.
      </p>

       If you want to ruin someone's life with accusations of pedophilia and trafficking, you need to have a hell of a lot more behind you than "weird" and "allegedly."

       This very same pizza place where the owner is one of the top 50 most influential/powerful/connected people in DC? Weird... And the shooting incident at the pizza joint by a dude that is an actor with family in politics.

       No, that’s what you want everyone to believe but that is simply not the case. I want to also mention that James Alefantis is not on the up and up. Here we have a man who was pronounced the 49th most powerful man in Washington DC by GQ magazine. His occupation? Pizza restaurant owner, and for most of the week the kitchen is open for 4 hours a day. Now let’s say you think there is nothing wrong with his disgusting instagram posts. Fine. However, there was found to be a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/TnW7OT6Dkuw">
        protected section on the Comet Ping Pong website
       </a>
       . What was on that protected section? According to Titus Frost (real name Dean Fougere) and the hacker Bigfish, there was “Cheese Pizza” aka Child Pornography on that website.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/HTRewHDOr90">
        In this video, you can see the e-mails that we’re sent to the Washington DC police department officer Marcus Stevens, and he shows that Officer Marcus Stevens confirmed receipt of the e-mail as well.
       </a>
       And to the naysayers who will inevitably come out of the woodwork to say that there is no real proof to what I am saying and that the e-mails could have been fabricated, as could evidence of the protected section of the Comet Ping Pong website, I would like to remind you that falsely accusing someone of possessing and distributing child pornography is an extremely serious crime which would almost certainly result in jail time if James Alefantis were to persue a lawsuit against Dean Fougere andthr hacker Bigfish, so if you honestly think that these men would risk their freedom by making up this whole story in order to get more views on their YouTube video or whatever motive you can come up with, you’re out of your mind.

       witch hunt?  or....looking at the evidence and going from that.  as far as i know, hilary clinton is living free and well.  same as john podesta.  james alefantis is probably still getting hard over toddlers. 
so if it is a witch hunt.  it's not really a good one.
