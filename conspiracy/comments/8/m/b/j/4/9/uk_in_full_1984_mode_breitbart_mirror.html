    <div class="md"><p>It wasn’t a farce, it was just short lived. Twice after the Revolution, the “British” re-established control over America by hanging a central bank on us, The First Bank of the United States, and The Second Bank of the United States. Which Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson each spent their presidencies rooting out. The third time they wised up and called it the Federal Resere, disguising it as a government institution, in 1913. We’ve been back under “UK” control since then. I’ll let you interpret what I mean by the quotation marks </p>

<p>Tommy doesnt sell Nukes, he isnt trying to steal the moon or trying to release a universal cancer cure.</p>

<p>Hes just a dude, not a supervillain. this reaction from the UK is Extreme...but not only now. It always has been..which i find odd. Since when you actually listen to the man, he is one of the conservatives...there are far more extreme people with far more followers then him...doing fine...but he is constantly getting the short end.</p>

<p>The Mirror, Birmingham Mail, Daily Record are all owned by the same company (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_plc">Reach PLC formally known as Trinity Mirror</a>). Just look at the 404 pages. For whatever reason, they decided to delete the story and it hit all their sites. Breitbart and RT would normally be all over a story like this, so weird that they have deleted it when other media in the UK is about reporting it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Breitbart and Russia Today both have a business presence in the UK, which would render them liable to prosecution for contempt of court in that jurisdiction. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why they have also sensibly followed the line taken by other British media outlets that have pulled the story. Nothing more spooky than that.</p>

<p>Although I have to say, it is incredible that the &quot;pulled&quot; stories were ever published to begin with. The reporting restrictions currently in force were imposed during Robinson&#39;s court appearance, not as some kind of afterthought. This gives you some indication of how slapdash Trinity Mirror is, as a company.</p>

<p>(Seriously, Trinity Mirror is the most incompetent publisher in Britain, and they were Piers Morgan&#39;s employer when he had to be sacked for printing a pack of lies on the front page of the Daily Mirror, that he -- the editor! -- simply hadn&#39;t bothered to check. That is the only reason that he is now a z-list celebrity. He has quite literally done nothing worth note.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FFS. There is a temporary reporting restriction in place on the details of Tommy Robinson&#39;s latest court appearance. </p>

<p><strong>The restriction expires on June 25th.</strong></p>

<p>In the meantime, an editor who published details of Robinson&#39;s court appearance would be in contempt of court and liable for a hefty fine or (in the most serious scenario) imprisonment.</p>

<p>The reason there is a <strong>temporary</strong> reporting restriction is because Robinson&#39;s court appearance involved discussion of another court case, which is still ongoing. It&#39;s the court case that he was livestreaming his illegal video about.</p>

<p>When that court case is concluded, there will no longer be any risk of committing contempt and the details of Robinson&#39;s summary trial will be published.</p>

<p>This is not at all unusual. Details of court reporting are temporarily withheld like this all the time, due to the complexities of trying to run related trials simultaneously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is, as ever, talking unadulterated shit straight from his vast sweaty arse, and his own personal army of &quot;sheeple&quot; are licking it up because he told them it was ice-cream.</p>

<p>A &quot;D-Notice&quot; is a communication about National Security, that is issued to newspapers in times of war or at other periods of high-alert. Complying with a D-Notice is <strong>completely voluntary.</strong></p>

<p>There is <em>no penalty whatsoever</em> for ignoring a D-Notice, because the system -- not unreasonably -- is based on the presumption that newspaper editors do not wish to harm the nation that they live in. By and large, it works.</p>

<p>But, and this is the crucial bit, no D-Notice has been issued in relation to Tommy Robinson or the grooming/child rape trial that he was attempting to disrupt. </p>

<p>The reporting restrictions are due to a temporary orders that expire on June 25th and were issued by the Judges overseeing each case.</p>

<p>TL;DR - you got sold a pup by an infamous huckster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that. The website does indeed give insight into what a D-notice is and why it might be issued. As you say, it&#39;s a voluntary system and predicated on the (fairly uncontroversial) idea that national security trumps selling newspapers. But why would the contempt of court of a small-time racist be a matter of national security? This I really do not understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that the laws are easily abused for an Orwellian effect, which they were. It’s why laws like this are put in place, to be selectively enforced and to silence those who the government wants silenced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plausible deniability, nothing more. Livestreaming a video outside a courtroom does nothing to harm justice, in fact it does the opposite. It prevents a perverted justice system from sweeping these things under the rug.</p>
