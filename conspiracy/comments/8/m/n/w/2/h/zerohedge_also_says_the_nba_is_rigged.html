<p>Source?</p>

<p>And if you know anything about major sports you should know that the risks of getting caught greatly outweigh any marginal benefits of rigging games. The Tim Donaghy scandal (which wasn&#39;t a top-down NBA rigging) left a black mark on the league that has taken over a decade to move forward from. </p>

<p>You also have to take into account the fact that the league is not owned by one person. The NBA for example is owned by 30 people, all with competing interests. You think any of them are just going to lie down and be okay with getting screwed out of profits?</p>

<p>In the NBA there is some profit sharing, but the vast majority of profit is team specific, otherwise owners wouldn&#39;t give a shit how the team is performing. </p>

<p>Keeping it simple, 7 games instead of 4 or 5 means more games to profit from and the games later in the series gets more views. A 7-game series might earn double or more compared to a 4-game sweep.</p>

<p>Nope, not even close. Feels are subject to all kinds of biases due to preconceived notions. Statistics aren&#39;t perfect without context, but they&#39;re infinitely more valuable than &quot;eye-tests&quot;. Why do think stat-heads run professional sports operations now? The eye-test will fail you again and again.</p>

<p>And 2002 is evidence that rigging from refs <em>can</em> happen, not evidence that rigging <em>is</em> currently happening. </p>

<p>Then they rig to get certain teams into the playoffs. That was blatant in 2013 when they dragged the truly awful Superteam Lakers into the playoffs. You know the one with Kobe, Howard, Nash and Gasol which played like utter chicken shit. </p>

<p>Lebron&#39;s win in 2016 also smells funny to me which was only possible because they suspended Green. I don&#39;t care for neither team.</p>

<p>2012-2013 also looked weird because to me it didn&#39;t look like Miami won it but that Spurs lost it. I&#39;m not sure if it was rigged or that Spurs just ran out of juice in the end. Their team that year was better than their 2013-14 version.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the sports leagues should be scared s**tless over the idea of prop bets in the new legal sports gambling. A pitcher can impact millions of dollars in prop betting over whether he throws a ball or strike in the first pitch of a big game, or throws versus runs in a RPO on the first play of a football game?</p>

<p>Common sense</p>

<p>That&#39;s not really evidence when anyone can claim anything is common sense. I would say it&#39;s common sense that the opposite is true given how the NBA is structured.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the link in the post</p>

<p>The Zerohedge article provides no substantive evidence - just speculation and theorizing. It doesn&#39;t differentiate between blown calls (some of which I would argue aren&#39;t even blown calls) and intentional gaming. It doesn&#39;t even take evidence to the contrary into account given how the Rockets straight up got outplayed after the first quarter in every facet of the game. </p>

<p>Also, a lot of people out here don&#39;t understand how gambling works. The oddsmakers can tell fraud bets and suspicious bets. They&#39;re not idiots. They know their craft. Sports books can and do hold suspicious bets for investigation, especially when there&#39;s lots of money involved. </p>

Some of that is just inflation, some is ad revenue rates increased (plus non TV ad revenue like online / youtube).  Also the cost of tickets and merchandise has increased dramatically too, as well as international sales. ....so its based total team revenue not just TV ratings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been able to watch the NBA seriously for years.  I was really into it in the 90&#39;s but the early 2000&#39;s really turned me off.  The 2002 Kings/Lakers is the well known one, but the 2001 Bucks/Sixers was probably as bad.  I&#39;d be hard pressed to remember all the particulars, but remember that the Bucks lost a player to suspension for Game 7 after the league upgraded the severity of a foul.  I also remember that Dikembe Mutumbo had a crazy low amount of fouls.  I think he only had 5 or 6 total fouls despite playing almost every minute of the 7 game series.  Then the Mavs/Heat of 2006 was about the last straw. The Kings, Bucks, and Mavs were all similar in that they didn&#39;t really have a &quot;marketable face of the league&quot; like their opponents did.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s rigged per se, but it feels like the biggest issues are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mega-superstar favoritism</li>
<li>League office influence on how games are called: tight/loose, or focusing on certain violations</li>
</ul>

<p>This can create situations where a refs might be &quot;letting them play&quot; for a good portion of the game.  However, at some point you&#39;ll have the superstar get a couple cheap free throw line trips, and then not long after the other team doesn&#39;t get a similar call and then gets called for something ticky tack like an off the ball foul or slight moving screen.  Now the team that has been wronged edges toward the boiling point of getting T&#39;ed up or drawing a flagrant.  </p>

<p>For example he’s been talking about how this year‘s NBA playoffs are all about the theme “The King is Dead”...Who’s down 3-0 in the NBA finals against #30?   “King James”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how many times has the Finals gone to 7, especially with LeBron? </p>

<p>In the 90s and early 2000s, the Finals was usually wrapped up in 6. </p>

<p>All of a sudden LeBron comes in, chokes in crunch time, and the NBA bails him out by pushing the series to 7 games. </p>

<p>Most of LeBron’s playoff series that aren’t the first and/or second round go to 7 games. </p>
