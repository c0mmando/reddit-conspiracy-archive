       why would anyone intentionally give their life to a state?  so they can have a joint funeral with other people who made the same stupid decision?  joining the military is a scam.  it's propaganda fed to everyone so as to confuse the idiots into dying on purpose.  basically the same technique used in islam and suicide bombers.  everything will be better when you are in heaven because heaven is filled with all kinds of luxuries.  you'll become a martyr.  they should change the name from memorial day to martyr day.

       some people believe they are under attack and need to defend their country at all costs.. others are poor and need the money/are tricked.  still others are family obligated.   either way, it's not a rational decision to join.

       i don't hate the military.  i think it's a very healthy thing for all the alzheimer baby boomers to attempt to remember.  it gives them a sense of self regardless of how little they are able to connect to it.  outside of my grandparents being able to relate to any part of reality, the military is utterly useless.  a bunch of young people who blindly commit their time, energy and efforts to what exactly?  fake wars?  unecessary wars?  how many people died in the autistic wars america waged that were not in the military?  way more than military losses.  i don't see how murder is an option in a functional normal life.

       I feel like you’re a bit too cynical. The standing army was created over a thousand years ago as a deterrent against invasion. Sure right now the US isn’t in open global conflict but they weren’t in on December 1, 1942, a couple days before Japan attacked pearl harbour. And with the instability in the world right now you really think North Korea wouldn’t attack your US if you didn’t have an army? Or they Russia wouldn’t? The standing army is recognized as a cornerstone in the evolution of civilization. It’s an insurance policy and if it’s giving young men and women work then let them. They know the risks why do you care?

       I love history.  I really do. I love it so much that I became the historian for the town that I used to live in.  HOWEVER, you're correct, I am cynical.  why do you think people are cynical?  Have you ever wondered?  Cynicism is a cultural need.

       I think armies used to matter hundreds of years ago.  armies are not necessary.  maybe the army should consider educating the young people who come to them instead of teaching them to be useless martyrs.  Why can't all that military money be spent on education? instead of death.  it's gross.

       I sometimes regret not joining when I was younger. Something about the lifelong fraternity of a unit is surprisingly appealing to me later in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if I had joined it would have been in the early-mid 90’s, post Gulf war 1, so  in retrospect I wouldn’t have been in any danger whatsoever, even in a combat specialty.

       i feel the same way about not joining a sorority.  had i joined a sorority, i'd still have had anonymous penises but at least i'd have the credentials of getting a job at at some shitty company and after a decade at that shit job i'd probably end up cheating on my loser husband and moving to tuscany.  it's never too late.

       Veteran here, and I did it because I didn’t want to attend college out of high school, wanted to learn a trade, wanted a steady income, needed to learn discipline, and wanted to see the world - and the military checked all of those boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was active duty USMC, and deployed to the gulf twice out of Camp Pendleton, and can tell you that most of the people I served with weren’t bloodthirsty murderers (in fact, those types were rare), and were regular people like you and I, just showing up to work every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       My time in the military provided me with the foundation for everything I’ve achieved thus far both personally and professionally. No regrets.

       So maybe the military should revamp itself.  instead of being a kill machine, maybe an education machine.  a vessel for young people to travel the world and be educated.  I'll never disagree with that.

       Not to mention that the entirety of human history has shown us that pacifism isn't really a viable long term strategy for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequently ask myself, if 100 years went by where there totalled zero military confrontations around the world, would that be long enough to trust that we could abandon national militaries?  For me, I say no.  But what about 1000 years of uninterrupted peace?  Enough?  Maybe, maybe then.

       They do learn all those things. Each person has a military occupation. They aren’t all door kickers and killing people. Maybe not enough people know the inter workings of the military. Just do an online search for what people in the military do.. medics.. electricians.. helicopter repair.. mechanics.. truck drivers.. communication specialist.. they have all that stuff. It’s very intricate

       The past four people I’ve met who served were doing so because of school. One was in debt and joined to get it paid off so he could return to college. The other three did it from the start in order to go to college with out taking out loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imo, I think a majority of the current generation joins for the free college. Although it is arguably not free at all. Which brings me to my next point, college is also a scam. Force everyone to go to college in order to get a decent job. Sure, you can get a decent job with out college but that require either a lot of dedication and work, or luck through connections. Everyone is told for their entire K-12 life that you’ll end up working at wal-mart or McDonald’s if you don’t go to college. People from a wealthy family might not stress that because their family will pay for it. Some kids will perform well in school and get scholarships/grants/etc. Others will only have the choice of taking on massive debt or joining the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many jobs out there that want you to have a degree, but in all honesty could be performed fine by someone with out one. Society forces you to have a degree to sit in an office and do menial tasks for mediocre money. Sure you could go to a trade school and learn to work some shitty job like welding for decent money, but who the fuck honestly wants to do that?

       I agree with you 100%.  I feel so disturbed about the rhetoric that is spewed to the youth of really any country that doesn't have paid education.  if you take all the kids who did the right thing, the thing told to them by their parents and their own governments, they did the right thing.  they went to school, they got good grades.  they graduated and then what?  then what?  they got fucked.  no jobs, no nothing but debt.  the whole thing was a very complex and extensive scam against the people who "did the right thing".  that is wrong.  that is so wrong.  everyone gets fucked and scammed in life at some point, but it most definitely should not be right after you accomplished goals you were supposed to accomplish and not after you accumulated a massive amount of debt by doing so.  the youth, across the globe have been shat on and taken advantage of i the worst way.  their futures were robbed of them.

       They do learn all those things. Each person has a military occupation. They aren’t all door kickers and killing people. Maybe not enough people know the inter workings of the military. Just do an online search for what people in the military do.. medics.. electricians.. helicopter repair.. mechanics.. truck drivers.. communication specialist.. they have all that stuff. It’s very intricate

       Seems like fund allocation for education is important but not as expensive for research and design to keep the soldiers safer with protection and weapons. Makes sense.. just takes food, shelter and already trained instructors to teach skills.. takes a lot more money to let’s say build newer missiles to make sure we can shoot down incoming missiles from other countries.. very vague response but it’s just a lot more expensive to pay for the logistics of keeping up in the arms race versus training and teacher soldiers skills

       The military is a 100% viable option for those who dont want to go to college, can't afford college or any other type of training, or want a stable career path that boards, feeds, educates, and trains you. The connections from whatever branch you serve might lead you to better options too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all people even see combat. One of my roommates in college did 4 years, was stationed in South Korea for a little bit, and afterwards, his college education was 100% paid for and he had no plans of going back in. Good deal if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be thankful for the people who are willing to serve regardless of your opinions of America's interference in other affairs. Because if it weren't them, then it'd probably be randomized in the form of a draft or something.

      <p>
       This is such an ignorant statement.You mean same technique used in Islam,Christianity,Judaism and almost every ideology out there.Also Muslims are not the only ones doing suicide attacks.Go out and learn before making such ignorant statements.

       that's excellent.  but perhaps instead of the military paying for your education, the government could just literally pay for your education.  instead of forcing you through the military to earn it by invading countries you've never been invited to and are not welcomed in.  military industrial complex.  you're apart of it.

       They do learn all those things. Each person has a military occupation. They aren’t all door kickers and killing people. Maybe not enough people know the inter workings of the military. Just do an online search for what people in the military do.. medics.. electricians.. helicopter repair.. mechanics.. truck drivers.. communication specialist.. they have all that stuff. It’s very intricate
