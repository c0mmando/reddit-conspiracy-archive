        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: I use google search frequently. Most of it for work and education - not conspiracy. I have noticed a striking and rapid deterioration in the results I am getting over the last month or so. </p>

<p>Example: I use google to search Stackoverflow.com to help me remember how the muck around and program up web servers, etc. The details are intense, and unless you do it every day you forget. So I used to get 3 whole pages about this detailed type of stuff, but now I get complete junk - a few bad hits and then a bunch of totally unrelated business ads, etc. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not just this particular use case - I find all my searches bring back a listing that is just seriously inferior to what I have come to expect, across the board!</p>

<p>This has already been discussed in an earlier post, but I think it warrants more attention. We have seen how the so-called &quot;fake flag shooters&quot; somehow precipitated huge changes to Youtube searches. Now we have more changes that are supposed to be the result of the European Union&#39;s GDPR law. And on another front, we have seen how closely manipulated Wikipedia can be. It just feels like something bigger is happening. Your thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the post that blew up 5 days ago here:</p>

<p>Google does such an fantastic job partly because it is basically the biggest aggregator of personal data worldwide. DDG, while not being an unknown, simply lacks the amount of information about <em>your</em> last searches. </p>

<p>Any fair comparison between the two has to be run from anonymized machines. There will always be a tradeoff between accuracy (of search) and privacy. </p>

<p>Possibly, but I proposed a use case where the main search target was stackoverflow to find the same snippet of code 1,000 other coders are also trying to find, and had no problem before a few weeks ago. The issue of what I look at online, or ate this morning, or how old I am, simply does not matter to the efficiency of the search.

<p>But the problem is we are not talking about the things your superiority applies to. We are collecting a number of warning signals and wondering what they might mean.</p>

<p>If the lights in your house start blinking on and off, at random, you might suspect something is seriously wrong whether you are an electrician or not. And you might immediately allocate two possibilities to explore - is the phenomenon occurring because the wiring in your house is bad, or is the electric supply system being disrupted. To gauge that, you might walk over to your neighbors houses and ask them.</p>

<p>If a good many stated that they were seeing the same phenomenon with their lights, you wouldn&#39;t insist that they should check their wiring. The wiring is clearly not what&#39;s wrong. The supply is what&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>Using the lights example: I you presume that the electricity company is fixing your voltage and therefore the rooms are now dimmer you will find a <em>lot</em> of biased responses.</p>

<p>You see worse results while searching stackexchange which is probably one of the areas where an advertisment selling search engine will always shine because it is hard to find a reason why google should degrade their search results and yet you jump from a technical problem straight to a political one.

<p>In both threads i presented possibilities why search results could degrade depending on a chaneg of data on the user, and ignoring the very real possibility of it being a technical error of some kind (hard to say as there is no verifyable data except the impression of a few users) i can throw two more into the fray: </p>

<p>a) A deep learning neural network went astray. 
b) google will push for a code sharing plattfrom soon. </p>

<p>I actually thought about that factor when I entered it. But given that some 50% of posts could be considered as distractions, this one seemed worthwhile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>jump from a technical problem straight to a political one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. That&#39;s essentially the mission of the conspiracy sub - to basically over-react to possible major, or at least interesting movements in society <em>which appear to be shrouded and mysterious</em>. Again I thought this qualified. And it&#39;s why I pushed for your higher level analysis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>deep learning neural network went astray
google ... code sharing platform</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you. These are exactly what I was wanting - both very intriguing possibilities. I think you wanted to avoid jumping to conclusions. But I want to create such a list quickly (see above) almost as a type of documentation. If the problem goes away tomorrow, I&#39;d apologize for wasting your time, but then maybe it comes back... Seems like conditions inside this sub vary consistently, and it seems worth our while to think about why that&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>checking the supply in the one case (a house) is actually easy and in the other (google&#39;s search configuration) near impossible.</p>

<p>Unless of course someone spills something of interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don’t think people in the west, specifically the United States, are concerned enough about censorship / totalitarianism because they think it won’t happen in the United States.  It’s never happened in the United States so they think it’ll always stay that way.  More importantly, they don’t know how to read the signs.  The metaphorical frog in a pot of water of which the temperature is slowly being turned up until the point of no return is more applicable now than ever.  But, honestly, in regards to this discussion... I have no idea.  I think people trust these large corporations (including the government, which is also a corporation) way too much.  If a company acts cool and hip people don’t care what the company does behind the scenes.  This much was evident during Obama’s presidency when everyone loved him because he was highly relatable on talk shows.. yet, they didn’t question anything he did he was “cool”.  How have we devolved from
 the 1960s to where we are now?  It’s very sad.</p>
