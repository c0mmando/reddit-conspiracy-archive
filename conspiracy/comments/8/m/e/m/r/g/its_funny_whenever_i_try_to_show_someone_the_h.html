       What evidence do you have to support that? Comey lost the election for Hilary by announcing she was under investigation while keeping the fact Trump was under investigation a secret, mueller is a war hero, a Bush appointee and by all accounts loyal to know one but America and is technically a Trump appointee through Rosenstein (another Trump Appointee), Lynch recused herself from the investigation and has been out of government for ~2 years, McCain is a Republican, you’re making assumptions about scary “three letter agencies”, I mean come on. Do you have any evidence to support you claims or is it just conjecture?

       So we’ve gone from “she has people high in the government that does things for her” to “she got debate questions early”? Really? Quite moving the goal post and provide some sources for you’re claims of “mueller, Comey, a judge, Lynch, McCain and some unnamed higher ups from “three letter organizations” working for Clinton with no regard for our constitution”

       I feel this is a little disingenuous. She went after Trump for his temperament and mental stability and he went after her for being unhealthy. Now two years later sharing a picture alleging she’s unhealthy does nothing to prove past conspiracies. Continuing to hammer away on Clinton does nothing to keep the people currently in power in check. Be vigilant my brothers and don’t be distracted by non issues like Hilary’s health. It doesn’t matter if she has aids and is dying. SHES NOT THE PRESIDENT AND HAS ZERO POWER IN OUR GOVERNMENT.

       And I feel like you're projecting. Everyone has power to manipulate public opinion and push agendas. She and Obama and Comey, and their peanut gallery of supporters have been traveling around trying to skew public perceptions of Trump to try to limit his authority, and to attempt to give more authority to the people in power that they have ties to. I think it's fine to question this woman, her past and her current actions.

       So what has she done since Trump was inaugurated to “limit Trumps power”. I’m not a Hilary supporter so I’m not projecting. I’m trying to figure out why a large portion of the population is consumed with an elderly lady with no power? If she has power like you claim, what is it? Who is doing her dirty work? There are lots of theories about her but I’ve seen no solid evidence of it. She just appears to be a boogie man for the right.

       I’m trying to understand why this narrative is being pushed when it’s already been settled. Who cares if she’s unhealthy, what effect does that have on our government? When does the Hilary circle jerk end? There is no conspiracy with an elderly women getting sick.

       God forbid you provide a source to back up your claims. Refusing to provide sourcing doesn’t make you look full of shit at all.

       Because she is a public figure who is a crook, pedo operative, satanist, and destroyed Libya which is now going to cause the destruction of Europe. This demon should be in Gitmo

       What evidence do you have to support that? Comey lost the election for Hilary by announcing she was under investigation while keeping the fact Trump was under investigation a secret, mueller is a war hero, a Bush appointee and by all accounts loyal to know one but America and is technically a Trump appointee through Rosenstein (another Trump Appointee), Lynch recused herself from the investigation and has been out of government for ~2 years, McCain is a Republican, you’re making assumptions about scary “three letter agencies”, I mean come on. Do you have any evidence to support you claims or is it just conjecture?
