        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a swede and this is just my theory, it&#39;s not fact or anything like that. </p>

<p>Reasons why i think Sweden will start a war:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sweden is very anti-russian, especially since russia has several times &quot;invaded&quot; Sweden and recently they had a bomb drill against two Swedish targets.
(The article is in Swedish) <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/amne/Ryssland%20%C3%B6vade%20anfall%20mot%20Sverige">https://www.svt.se/nyheter/amne/Ryssland%20Ã¶vade%20anfall%20mot%20Sverige</a></p></li>
<li><p>Sweden has stated they are releasing their &quot;om kriget kommer&quot;/&quot;if the war comes&quot; pamphlet (which is about war, terrorism, crisis etc not only war) they stopped releasing it 1991 when the cold war ended which might be an indication about the Swedish future.</p></li>
<li><p>Sweden has raised their military&#39;s budget and announced several new high-tec inventions, especially the new &quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; Archer which is a very good weapon system for the Swedish terrain. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>My theory: I think Sweden will either openly denounce russia very soon, or join NATO which is very bad in the Sweden-Russia relationship. Russia is practising close to Swedens borders &amp; flying over Sweden, i think Sweden will soon demand they stop or they will be met with force. </p>

<p>Sweden knows we have 0% chance of winning vs Russia but we can make it very costly for Russia for invading Sweden if it were to happen. Sweden has openly said &amp; informed the citizens that if we were to be invaded our strategy would be to Hit &amp; Run when ever we can(ARCHER). </p>

<p>The Sweden-Russian relationship is at an alltime low and i think Sweden wants to show Russia that we are willing to protect our country if they continue coming into sweden with planes/subs.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think Sweden will start a war or that they dare to threaten Russia but i do think our government wants to do something and is prepared to go to war if things go south. </p>

<p>Since the pamphlet &quot;if the war comes&quot; ended in 1991 and is coming back now i&#39;m pretty sure the government is prepared for something big.</p>

<p>Before someone says &quot;but the pamphlet is about war, weather disaster, it attacks, terrorism &amp; crisis not war only!&quot; Yes, it is. However i doubt they would go back to the &quot;if the war comes&quot; if it wasn&#39;t for something major, like a war. Otherwise they would&#39;ve brought it back after Gudrun, swedens worst storm 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s funny that when Russia knocks at their door they will stand up for themselves, but if the people threatening their country are brown they donâ€™t do anything out of fear of being racist </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it probably is imminent, Russia is completely cornered short of China, the only saving grace is its strong defensive army and the fact that its democracy can probably rigged as well as any other via media control... where it gets interesting is that some, including in the nato camp theorize that Russia could blitzkrieg Europe in a couple days, much faster than nato could react... it&#39;s potentially their best bet at this point, they need nato further off their western border, and some more allies in Europe... with the facture pro-anti EU at its height, it&#39;s not all that crazy, they can setup friendlier government as easily as the US setup friendly governments after WWII hehehe....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course Russia can Blitzkreig Europe, europes only defense is either hit &amp; run or rely on allied (NATO) forces, it would be very similiar to norway during ww2. If they want to they can take at least scandinavia but most countries would react upon that.</p>

<p>Swedes are the biggest cucks on the planet and are an embarassment to the former might of their Viking ancestors.</p>

<p>Perhaps all of the Viking blood died off in WW2 and WW1, leaving only the cuck blood to reproduce, who went on to open the borders and throw welcome parties for their own genocide and replacement.</p>

<p>If Putin annexed Sweden it would be for their own good--a mercy to protect them from themselves before they destroy themselves.</p>

<p>Hopefully thousands of tough Russian men can re-infuse the old Viking strength into the wombs of Sweden.</p>
