      <p>
       I'm a swede and this is just my theory, it's not fact or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons why i think Sweden will start a war:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sweden is very anti-russian, especially since russia has several times "invaded" Sweden and recently they had a bomb drill against two Swedish targets.
(The article is in Swedish)
         <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/amne/Ryssland%20%C3%B6vade%20anfall%20mot%20Sverige">
          https://www.svt.se/nyheter/amne/Ryssland%20övade%20anfall%20mot%20Sverige
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sweden has stated they are releasing their "om kriget kommer"/"if the war comes" pamphlet (which is about war, terrorism, crisis etc not only war) they stopped releasing it 1991 when the cold war ended which might be an indication about the Swedish future.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sweden has raised their military's budget and announced several new high-tec inventions, especially the new "Hit &amp; Run" Archer which is a very good weapon system for the Swedish terrain.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       My theory: I think Sweden will either openly denounce russia very soon, or join NATO which is very bad in the Sweden-Russia relationship. Russia is practising close to Swedens borders &amp; flying over Sweden, i think Sweden will soon demand they stop or they will be met with force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sweden knows we have 0% chance of winning vs Russia but we can make it very costly for Russia for invading Sweden if it were to happen. Sweden has openly said &amp; informed the citizens that if we were to be invaded our strategy would be to Hit &amp; Run when ever we can(ARCHER).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sweden-Russian relationship is at an alltime low and i think Sweden wants to show Russia that we are willing to protect our country if they continue coming into sweden with planes/subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really think Sweden will start a war or that they dare to threaten Russia but i do think our government wants to do something and is prepared to go to war if things go south.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the pamphlet "if the war comes" ended in 1991 and is coming back now i'm pretty sure the government is prepared for something big.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before someone says "but the pamphlet is about war, weather disaster, it attacks, terrorism &amp; crisis not war only!" Yes, it is. However i doubt they would go back to the "if the war comes" if it wasn't for something major, like a war. Otherwise they would've brought it back after Gudrun, swedens worst storm 10 years ago.

       Sweden is already eating themselves alive from the inside out with all the Muslim migrants they are taking in. They already didn’t stand a chance against Russia, now they double don’t stand a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s funny that when Russia knocks at their door they will stand up for themselves, but if the people threatening their country are brown they don’t do anything out of fear of being racist

       Why not just enlist the migrants to do the fighting for them? Many won't return alive, but you know, that's war.

       Enlisting them would only make it worse. If Sweden wanted them gone all they have to do is remove free housing, free welfare and free dental care. They would leave the country in masses

       Russia isn't going to invade Sweden, unless NATO's attack was imminent. Question is, do you wanna fuck with the Russia? Because if you do, they might end up making some meatballs out of you. Just ask Germans how they faired with their attack.

       Like i said, i don't think russia will invade sweden without a reason. I think Sweden are about to give an ultimatum to russia, or actually start defending sweden.

       Well it probably is imminent, Russia is completely cornered short of China, the only saving grace is its strong defensive army and the fact that its democracy can probably rigged as well as any other via media control... where it gets interesting is that some, including in the nato camp theorize that Russia could blitzkrieg Europe in a couple days, much faster than nato could react... it's potentially their best bet at this point, they need nato further off their western border, and some more allies in Europe... with the facture pro-anti EU at its height, it's not all that crazy, they can setup friendlier government as easily as the US setup friendly governments after WWII hehehe....

       Of course Russia can Blitzkreig Europe, europes only defense is either hit &amp; run or rely on allied (NATO) forces, it would be very similiar to norway during ww2. If they want to they can take at least scandinavia but most countries would react upon that.

       (Since we have no clue about secret inventions) from the official point of view i think sweden has better systems, weapons &amp; training - however, that wouldn't matter at all russia would within a heartbeat take Sweden if it came to it.

       I said "invade" as in entering swedish cities with submarines &amp; flying bomb planes &amp; jet planes over Sweden, imagine if a russian jet was caught flying over NYC that'd be an act of war. In Sweden it's a common thing.

       Just a month ago russia had a big battleship exercise right outside of swedish waters, showing their military might &amp; telling sweden to stand back, russia is constantly showing up to Sweden... "I honestly don’t think Russia gives a fuck about Sweden." True, they don't give a sht about our borders but russia is very hostile vs sweden mate

       I’m pretty sure Russia has a their main fleet in the Baltic Sea, where else should they be doing their exercises? Can’t Finland make the same claim?

       They do.. if you read up on it the 4th of april latvia &amp; sweden complained about it. Finland is mostly complaining about airspace &amp; ground troop exercises. Russia even fired robots while in Swedish airspace &amp; waters.

       Would not surprise me if the cabal leaders in the EU used a compromised country like swedistan to drag Russia into a world war. Too many backwards white christians not influenced by destructive leftist ideology, no other choice but to murder millions like the cabal did in previous world wars.

       The norwegian series "Ockupationen" is a great example of how i'd look like. Russia would invade but Eu/Us wouldn't do anything in fear of a full scale war.

       If you haven't already, look into Russian Nuclear De-Escalation, a post-Ukraine doctrine change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically outlines their willingness to hit a country with nukes to discourage ("de-escalate") broader retaliatory action by 3rd parties.

       I hope Putin really does pull a Hitler and annexes Sweden and I would hoot and holler if Russian tanks rolled down the streets of Stockholm and if Spetznad teams went house to house clearing the Muzz out of Malmo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swedes are the biggest cucks on the planet and are an embarassment to the former might of their Viking ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps all of the Viking blood died off in WW2 and WW1, leaving only the cuck blood to reproduce, who went on to open the borders and throw welcome parties for their own genocide and replacement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Putin annexed Sweden it would be for their own good--a mercy to protect them from themselves before they destroy themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully thousands of tough Russian men can re-infuse the old Viking strength into the wombs of Sweden.

       Though i do think i'd be a blessing from above to rid Sweden of our current PC government I wouldn't say all swedes are cucks. Almost every single guy i know hates our government. For Sweden it's mostly women (my dad, brother &amp; me is against illegal immigration while my sister &amp; mom thinks it's "humanitarian" the women mostly support these shits just to cause themselfs harm) and trust me, if you dare say something like "i don't think muslims are able to adapt to our culture" you can be fired, publically humiliated &amp; arrested for hate speech if the wrong person hears you. I don't think immigration us wrong but we need a culture that's similiar to ours not a complete 360.. so no, i don't think most swedes are cucks and those who are are the loudest. However like i said, most people don't want to commit public suicide. We are literally brainwashed to do this

       (Since we have no clue about secret inventions) from the official point of view i think sweden has better systems, weapons &amp; training - however, that wouldn't matter at all russia would within a heartbeat take Sweden if it came to it.
