        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/Nsddrz">Here is a picture of convicted pedophile George Nader with President Donald Trump</a>.  Do you know how much Trump got paid for this picture?  <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/convicted-paedophile-george-nader-got-photo-with-donald-trump-for-189000-donation-a3846426.html">$189,000</a>.  Why so much money?  Because Trump himself is a diddler and is involved with a global pedo ring the likes of which we&#39;ve never seen.  And why would he take the picture with <strong>CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER</strong> George Nader?  So that all the other pedos will see the picture and know who to contact to solicit sex from little kids.  The evidence is clearly there.  And they thought we were sheep who would follow their FAKE bread crumbs.  It&#39;s pretty obvious in hindsight.  Why else would Trump hang out with a creep like Stephen Miller?  Have you seen the guy?  He looks like the creepy math teacher who looks down his female students shirts.  And this whole so called Russian investigation is actually an investigation into a deep state pedo ring headed by Trump.  This deep state worked to get Trump elected so that they could have one of their own pedos in charge.  Why do you think Trump attacks the Washington Post so much?  Because they are preparing a story to out his allegiance to this secret pedo ring and he wants to discredit them so all his sheep won&#39;t believe it.  And why do you think he pulled out of the North Korea summit?  It&#39;s because China found out about it and told Kim Jung Un about it and he threatened Trump with it.  Trump was running scared.  Why else would he pull out of something that would guarantee him a Nobel Peace Prize?  And remember how Stormy Daniels said someone threatened her daughter?  That was someone trying to stop knowledge from getting out because Stormy knew about it.  It all makes sense.  All the pieces are fitting into the puzzle.  Just look at all the creepy stuff he has said about little girls and his own daughter.</p>

Julian &quot;Motherfucking&quot; Assange, who leaked the emails that helped elect Trump.  And who communicated with Assange and visited him in the embassy?  Roger Stone, the man who worked closely with the Trump Campaign.  That&#39;s how the deep state found out about Rich.  He went to Assange who passed the message to Stone who passed it to Trump who possibly ordered the hit on Rich.</p>

He knew about it.  That&#39;s why Trump wanted Comey&#39;s loyalty.  And Comey told him that he wouldn&#39;t protect a molester.  Comey&#39;s left us hints, too.  Notice how many times Comey has called Trump a creep in interviews.  That&#39;s him telling us what&#39;s up in the best way he can because he&#39;s been sworn to secrecy while Mueller investigates in order to not tip Trump off.  But Trump&#39;s afraid that Mueller knows which is why he doesn&#39;t want the investigation to continue.  He&#39;s calling a witch hunt.  Yeah it&#39;s a witch hunt.  And it&#39;s hunting a bunch of pedophile witches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why would trump sign a bill making it law to freeze all assets of people involved in human trafficking?</p>

<p>That would ruin his own business if what you are saying is true.  </p>

<p>And why would all these pedophile rings and rapists be getting busted now under a Trump administration and protected under Bush, clinton, bush again, and Barry Soetoro?</p>

<p>Why does Trump have a hot wife? He&#39;s not a pedophile...</p>

<p>Why does Obama&#39;s wife have a penis?  </p>

<p>Why does Bush&#39;s wife look like a man?</p>

<p>Your theory makes no sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;How can Trump fire Comey if Comey has the videos or pictures?&quot;  </p>

<p>After pizzagate broke, we all researched Trump&#39;s connection to it.  We never found anything to indicate that videos or pictures of Trump having sex with children exist.  There is no doubt that Trump was targeted by Epstein, the CIA, and the Mossad, but they did not catch him doing anything.  </p>

<p>If the CIA or FBI had proof that Trump did something illegal, then they would use it to control him.  The CIA and FBI cannot control Trump.  The conclusion from this is very logical.   </p>

<p>&quot;All hail the God emperor and his harem of children!&quot;  Where is your proof?   The pizzagate people would love to know.   </p>

But without the leaked emails, we wouldn&#39;t even be having this discussion. We wouldn&#39;t be digging as deep. Why would the government purposely hint that there is a pedo ring, knowing that it would cause people to begin investigating. why would they want us talking about it in tbe first place. You should be able to see what im saying by know. You know that the government doesn&#39;t want us asking questions. So why would they make a false flag with the same issue. How can you be so drunk to think that they would use a pedophilia false flag to cover up actual pedophiles?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is a photo with a kitty toucher worse than a photo with a convicted Cartel drug trafficker megadonor?</p>

<p>This is Jose Cabrera with Hillary Clinton, after he donated $200,000 to her and after he purchased a sleep over in the Lincoln bedroom in the White Hotel.</p>

<p>3 weeks after that photo, Cabrera was arrested for smuggling 6,000 keys of coke through the Florida Keys. Poor Jose, if only he had used the CIA&#39;s Mena connect, none of that would have happened. Jose recently got out of prison by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t you read?  They do!  That&#39;s why Trump fired Comey and wants to fire Mueller.  They know about the evidence and are working to bring down the ring.  Haven&#39;t you noticed that he&#39;s been getting rid of people in National Security who aren&#39;t 100% loyal to him and replacing them with his sycophants?  It&#39;s because the noose is tightening around his neck.</p>
