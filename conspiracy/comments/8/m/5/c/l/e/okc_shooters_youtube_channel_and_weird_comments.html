        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Somebody linked me to the Lake Hefner shooter&#39;s youtube page and I&#39;ve been going down a rabbit hole every since watching the weirdest videos and reading some of the strangest conversations in the comments. This is the original video that got me started:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohwn7rNIaPg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohwn7rNIaPg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>There is CLEARLY something wrong with this guy. He talks about being under demonic attack and how he needs to meet real people. If you read the comments on the video it gets even weirder.</p>

<p>We have an exchange between him and a female youtuber named Wild Style about two weeks ago:</p>

<p><strong>Wild Style:</strong> Just keep sharing your experiences, we can prey for you. I want to hear more please. I love this stuff. Maybe can help. 💚💚💚💚🌈🐰🤷‍♀️✌️﻿
<strong>Shooter:</strong> thanks appreciate it, where are u from? well im pretty isolated, wouldn&#39;t mind moving in with someone, cant stand living alone, im going nuts with all this demonic attack against me.﻿</p>

<p>So he just wants to move in with some random lady commenter on a youtube video? And her typo (is it?) with the word “prey” instead of “pray” is pretty damn weird. </p>

<p>Later this exchange happens:</p>

<p><strong>Wild Style:</strong> Just subscribed 👍🙏🙏🦋😘💋 good stuff!  Will share comments with you too in surpport.﻿
<strong>Shooter:</strong> appreciate it, your channel is very interesting.﻿
<strong>Wild Style:</strong> I see you subscribed to my enemies. So I take that back. Don&#39;t know what games you think you are playing. But karma is a bitch.</p>

<p>What the hell right? What an odd exchange for two people who just met each other. Look at how many weird ass videos this guy has on his page:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDYWxRa6pGAq-al2R4GEOAw/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDYWxRa6pGAq-al2R4GEOAw/videos</a></p>

<p>So then I clicked on her channel (Wild Style), which is full of weird videos about satan, the NWO, veganism, urine therapy and other weird stuff. Here is the main page:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLW6NEPd6IA6RdQpxjQAofg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLW6NEPd6IA6RdQpxjQAofg</a></p>

<p>But check out some of these videos though:

<p>WTF right?</p>

They hear things in their heads torturing them if they aren&#39;t on the meds. Voices, sounds, demons.

    <div class="md"><p>no shit right?</p>

<p>This guy was a decent friend of mine. We would stay up late at night, talking about aliens, government conspiracy, the crooked cops being lap dogs for TPTB. All of that stuff. We were steeped in it. Had some deep meaningful conversations. Great guy. He was one of the only people I could talk about this stuff with in the 90&#39;s without him thinking I was nuts. He <em>understood</em>. </p>

<p>Fast forward to them coming to take him to the mental hospital because he got violent when he stopped taking the meds. My friend, looking at me from the back of a car, begging me to stop them from taking him. </p>

<p>That was a major mind fuck. Here I am, am I insane too? The only person who knew what the hell I was talking about just got taken away to the mental hospital. </p>

<p>He would call me weekly, asking me to spring him when he would hide his meds and didn&#39;t take them. Last time I saw him he was parked outside my apartment. He used to have a full beard but now he was clean shaven. He was in the car with the handlers from the institution. He was there just staring at me, i waved but he didn&#39;t speak. </p>

<p>I never saw Bill again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could very well be schizophrenia or a psychotic break.  So many things can alter one&#39;s thinking.   </p>

<p>Sadly, it sounds very much like schizophrenia.  </p>

<p>This is what I don&#39;t understand. That people truly don&#39;t see that  the &quot;gun&quot; crisis is actually a VIOLENCE crisis rooted in the poor mental health &amp; spiritual health  in our country &amp;  everyone treating it like the pink elephant in the room.  Everyone can see it or has been touched by it. But, we refuse to bring it up.  </p>

<p>This dude needed to be put away &amp; treated.  Obviously,  he wasn&#39;t &amp; that&#39;s sad. Very sad.</p>

<p>This crap is gonna keep on  happening  until we (as a country) come to a reckoning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isnt true for every case of schizophrenia but a lot of times the hallucinations are extremely negative (ie voices that tell you to kill yourself, youre worthless, etc) and not too far removed from hallucinating demons and or interpretating the voices as demons.

<p>Consider your mental state if you are targeted by this technology.  Constant speech, no sleep, whispers, shouting, demonic mumbling, random noises etc.  Any person would go insane.  For example, David Berkowitz (Son of Sam) said he heard voices.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Apocalypse the Destroyer might be the guy with another account talking to himself. He makes a video on transsexuals and appears to have some sort of issues with transexuals. This character &quot;Apocalypse The Destroyer&quot; seems to follow him around (before the shooting) taunting him. In one video, that has nothing to do with transexuals he says:</p>

<p>Apocalypse The Destroyer

Girl, you sound crazy. LMAO 😂﻿</p>

<p>That account has 0 content of any kind though. Do you guys think he was talking to himself or someone say how mentally ill he was and thought messing with him would be fun? I think it might be possible he felt like a woman and was having a meltdown over it talking to himself online?</p>

<p>no such thing in most of the USA, shot down by LEOs for some real or imagined street offence, or arrested and put in prison for years to be abused.</p>

<p>Also, in the confrontation video the manager says at least twice &quot;When you came to this planet you were assigned a name, weren&#39;t you?&quot;.</p>

<p>For some reason this language sounds cultish.  Is this something a scientologist might say?</p>

<p>do you have any links to more detailed official (lol) accounts of what happened?  I&#39;m only finding the cbs news story that has almost 0 details besides 2 people were killed and the shooter was shot by an armed citizen in the parking lot.  </p>

<p>(which is almost like the reporters didn&#39;t even ask any questions at all whatsoever, typical)</p>
