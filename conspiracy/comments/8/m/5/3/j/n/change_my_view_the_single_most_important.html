    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be helpful if you put the basic relevant fact under each one (and the years) and listed them in order of importance/strength for the theory (I understand you have with some already) and pushed some of the more vague ones to the bottom of the pile listed under &quot;for further consideration&quot; or something. Or even a write-up of a couple of paragraphs with the biggest gems.</p>

<p>Some of these items seem to cover a very broad range. Genghis Khan lived 800 years ago, some of these are from the 19th century, some the 20th. Did the single catastrophe take decades/centuries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People need to realize the it was just 26 years ago that the iron curtain was lifted and russian/soviet people could read non-soviet sources. And it wasn&#39;t until much more recent that the average russian citizen could get on the internet and compare and contrast their experiences and history with that of the rest of the world. this comparison and subsequent critique is what you are witnessing.</p>
