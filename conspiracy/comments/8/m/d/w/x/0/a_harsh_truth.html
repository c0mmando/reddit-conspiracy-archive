        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been on this site for years now, mostly as a lurker. My account says a redditor for 5 years, and I&#39;ve been surfing longer than that. After the Boston Marathon fiasco, I began to visit this sub in particular more often, and then even more so during the 2016 election. And I&#39;ve watched <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> actively devolve. Call it what you want: maybe there are shills, maybe there are bots, maybe I&#39;m even one of them. But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t issues that are holding us back (as a community and as a species) that we need to discuss. I&#39;m sure if anyone disagrees with what I have to say, plenty of people will hurl those accusations. But that&#39;s part of the problem. If you immediately box off any voice from outside of the echoing chamber as a &quot;shill&quot; and stop listening, <em>you are killing discourse just as effectively as any shills.</em></p>

<p>The first thing that immediately sticks out is the blind, feverish loyalty some of you have to the President, or almost as ridiculously, the Q posts. In a sub of alleged free thinkers, a healthy dose of skepticism should be maintained about <strong>any</strong> figure that claims authority. Believe me, I understand the need to feel like someone Up There is looking out for us. But greater than that need is the need to look out for ourselves. <em>The System cannot fix itself.</em> And this may be a hard pill to swallow, but DJT is as System as System gets. He straight up hired the CEO of Exxon-Mobil as his Secretary of State. Tillerson then went to the Middle East for a little while, and suddenly our gas prices climbed 40 cents per gallon. By the way, when he left Exxon-Mobil for politics, he had a clause in his contract that would let him come back when he&#39;s ready to do so. Again: the CEO of one of the most profitable companies in the world was given the position of Secretary of State and then dispatched to the exact place in the world where so much of his company&#39;s profits originate from. Destability is more profitable than the alternative. Trump also passed an enormous tax cut (that doesn&#39;t expire in a few years like ours does) for the incredibly wealthy. He&#39;s doing the exact same stuff in the Middle East that has been going on for literal decades, same as his predecessors. He also gave more power and money to the military-industrial complex. </p>

<p>Watch him on WWE, or read The Art of the Deal, or even The Art of War, which serves as the inspiration not just for Trump&#39;s business book but also as the inspiration for countless military strategies and political negotiations that have followed the work&#39;s 2500 year history. The strategies being employed (divide and conquer, distraction as a weapon, &quot;appear weak if you are strong, appear strong if you are weak,&quot; etc) are all taken straight from those two books, and they&#39;re all tried-n-true.</p>

<p>Going back to WWE, pay attention to the character the man is playing. Or those of any other performer, really. They&#39;re all working within a script. Sure, there&#39;s some freedom for a flashy move or a snappy taunt. And maybe sometimes someone actually goes off script; you can&#39;t account for everything that&#39;ll happen in the ring. But so much of it is choreographed in order to extract the maximum amount of involvement (entertainment) from the audience. Read <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/insider-terms-that-change-way-you-see-wrestling/">this article</a> on Cracked and replace every occurrence of the word &quot;wrestling&quot; with &quot;politics.&quot; Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not the author and I don&#39;t benefit at all from you clicking that link. If you still don&#39;t trust me, I&#39;ll break down some terms here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kayfabe: the overall story of the wrestling world. The scripted drama, planned out months in advance to keep the audience hooked. On the edge of their seats and shouting</li>
</ul>

<p>*Working yourself into a shoot: the afore-mentioned off-script moments. It happens, dealing with human personality in a high-exposure environment. It can be fighting for real, or talking about real stuff, or anything that isn&#39;t quite locked down. Even just getting too into character can throw a person off script. Humans and human emotions can be unpredictable, but all that matters is keeping the audience watching.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Canned Heat: when the audience isn&#39;t excited enough, the performers will use pre-recorded boos or cheers to drum up enthusiasm and whip the crowd back into a frenzy</p></li>
<li><p>Mouthpiece: when a performer lacks charisma or adequate language skills, a mouthpiece can be used. A mouthpiece is just another performer; this one doesn&#39;t necessarily wrestle, he or she just speaks into the microphone and yells things that will manipulate the crowd to his performer&#39;s side, or against the performer, or both. Whatever the script calls for.</p></li>
<li><p>Heel: The &quot;bad guy&quot;. The guy who shouts a lot, perhaps is vulgar, and just generally gets the crowd riled up and angry.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice how many of these terms revolve around manipulating the emotions of those watching the performance. Trump knows all about this system; he&#39;s admittedly a fan of wrestling, and of course he&#39;s been on WWE numerous times. He&#39;s playing a character when he plays against Vince McMahon (the &quot;Man&quot; in WWE). He&#39;ll talk about how much he likes the guy when he&#39;s not on script. Now think about it: how much are you being manipulated? How much is scripted, and how much is organic? The clearest example of cognitive dissonance I can imagine is this: that somehow, a person can wholly believe that there&#39;s a deep state that infiltrates and controls the entire political system and yet somehow allowed an anti-establishment figure to be voted in. Vince McMahon wouldn&#39;t invite anyone onto his show--into his media empire, into his family, into his inner circle--if he didn&#39;t like him. Never mind that DJT won the electoral college but that Clinton won the popular vote. It doesn&#39;t matter who wins the election, because if it mattered, these apparently omniscient and ever-present government spooks wouldn&#39;t let us do it. We wouldn&#39;t be allowed to &quot;choose&quot;. <em>There is no such thing as an anti-establishment candidate.</em></p>

<p>I feel like this sub considers itself &quot;above the sheeple,&quot; &quot;woke,&quot; &quot;aware,&quot; &quot;skeptical,&quot; and I know that I sometimes fall into the same trap. But we&#39;re falling for the same tricks that everyone else is. We&#39;re falling for the same distractions and mostly ignoring the fact that <em>just 5 people control more wealth than the 3.5 BILLION people at the bottom.</em> This is a numbers game, and the Elite know that we have an immense population advantage. But while we may outnumber them, they have something better. A Trump card: they&#39;re (mostly) unified and focused, and we&#39;re not. And a unified and focused minority can govern a fragmented and distracted population many, many times its own size. What good is being woke if you won&#39;t get out of bed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post.</p>

<p>My only thing about trump is that he went to Military/Prep school where they beat Patriotism into you, and there are interviews with him from the 80&#39;s/90&#39;s about tariffs/economic policies that he&#39;s doing now, and all the media is against him, the same media that the Feds tell what to report so take that how you will.</p>

<p>Anyhow, regardless of what you think of him, Unfortunately I think 2024 will be Hulk Hogan/Kid Rock vs The Rock/Kim Kardashian</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fundamentally disagree with the idea of a TL;DR. It&#39;s part of the cultural decline. If a few paragraphs and a bulleted list is too much for you to read, I don&#39;t want you to read my post. That is my TL;DR. Society is where we&#39;re at now because we cater to the lowest common denominator. </p>

<p>Trump is a symptom, not the disease. Reread my post; Trump is referenced a lot, but he&#39;s not the focus of what I&#39;m saying. I specifically typed &quot;The President&quot; instead of &quot;Trump&quot; when I was talking about feverish loyalty.  I&#39;m saying that blind subservience to Authority is the enemy, whether you agree or disagree with the &quot;party values&quot; that are being used at the time to obscure the true face. I don&#39;t care what mask it&#39;s wearing, or what party is in charge at any given time. It&#39;s the same dragon.</p>

<p>As for proof, how about you read the books I suggested? Spend some time paying attention to human nature. Think about effective ways for the Few to stay in power over the Many. Think about ways that wealth can be transferred from the many up to the few. Most importantly, <em>think about how you&#39;re enslaving yourself</em>. These are the questions you should be asking yourself in this day and age, not whether anything is true or false. We&#39;re firmly in the age of propaganda now. Nothing is 100% true or 100% false anymore</p>

<p>That&#39;s a joke right? Any type of academic discourse is headlined with an abstract or summary. TLDR&#39;s aren&#39;t really for not reading the article, it&#39;s for referencing what the purpose is while you read it. For one who says a whole subreddit is full of &quot;above the sheeples&quot;, you sure do think that of yourself if you think a simple convenience is part of a mass cultural decline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is also my philosophy on light vs darkness.</p>

<p>Darkness is focused, while light is everywhere. Darkness can beat light by being constantly focused on it&#39;s &#39;goal/agenda&#39;, but that is only due to the passivity of light and the general nature of it being fragmented everywhere. But light will always be more powerful than darkness when focused.</p>

<p>One must always jump on the opportunity to do good and bring light into focus when presented with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All public speaking is rooted in the art of deception. Putting on airs, establishing a confident persona, hiding one&#39;s fears. The same techniques used by politicians to deceive the masses are the exact same ones used by showmen and preachers, for the exact same reasons. The trouble is when you start expecting honesty and transparency in your politics. In the present system, it&#39;s impossible, really. The truth is far too inflammatory. It could start wars. I think it bears asking, what sort of civilization have we created, where merely telling the truth is an unthinkable transgression?</p>

No matter what technology they have or what reach they have, they&#39;re still humans with human limitations. But come on, now. Scroll through some comments on some of these posts.

Every shooting, every weather phenomenon, every comment that they happen to disagree with (look in this very post for an example of this one, people automatically default to calling me a shill and don&#39;t even think about what I&#39;m saying), every bit of scandal that comes out of the political and entertainment spheres. All of it, you&#39;ll find various people who are <em>absolutely certain</em> that it&#39;s an inside job. And that&#39;s ludicrous enough on its own.

Am I saying you should trust the government? Fuck no. Am I saying you should believe the narrative? Fuck no. Am I saying the government is telling us the truth? Fuck no. But the whole idea of a deep state is that it&#39;s a network. People with money and connections that they know how to use in order to accomplish their goals. Not every single event is the deep state flexing its muscles, but you can bet your ass or your life or anything else you own that the Big Things (like 9/11, or <em>which person is actively allowed to be the face of the most powerful government in the world</em>) are scripted. And if you still cling to the idea that Candidate A in Party Y is anti-establishment and has a chance to wrestle the power from pro-establishment Candidate B and his villainous Party X, you&#39;re not paying attention.

<p>This is a fair and good point and something that I think we should always consider. The fact is Trump is absolutely the most divisive figure in history. Lack of trust in the media was an issue far before he came to office. The 4D chess might be being played on us. </p>

<p>As always the record is everything and prOmises from Q that seem too good to be true, may be just that.  They know we don&#39;t have the balls to actually do anything so who cares if they lie to a few people. </p>

<p>That being said if it is all a psyop I&#39;m still glad it&#39;s not the alternative, because I do not believe Clinton would be governing in the same way that Trump has thus far... I think... </p>

<p>Not true at all. We just have too many people that <em>believe</em> this and don&#39;t take any action in the real world. We cannot have a perfect existence in this physical realm, but we can have an exponentially better one. But will we? I suppose that&#39;s all a matter of how hard we fight to manifest it, because it will require a fight.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you are eating what the authorities in power are selling you hook, line and sinker.</p>

<p>I can agree to disagree, but save your arrogance. If you&#39;re in line with what the corporate media is <em>desperate</em> for everyone to believe, chances are you&#39;re on the wrong side. If literally everyone in power passionately hates Trump, is actively pushing propaganda on every subject possible, puts out <em>known lies</em> about him, then maybe you should consider that there is a reason that the most evil people in this country hate him. Passionately.</p>

In my opinion if an overarching organisation of people really wanted to keep a population controlled, introducing an anti establishment and anti media figure to pose as a “threat” to half the country and a saviour to the other half is a perfect way to keep control of the entire population rather than just one side who was inevitably getting exhausted of the Democrats and starting to want change, humans will always come to want change sooner or later so they either had to give this to the country and be in control of it or let it turn into revolutions. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve known this for a year and a half (including the fact that Trump was spied on). It&#39;s spread across dozens of little pieces of information that eventually give you a picture of what was going on. Honestly, I was about to bypass this question because it&#39;s just too damn hard to explain to people who haven&#39;t been following it all. You can&#39;t truly believe the scope of it all until you see it for yourself.</p>

<p>But lo! I just saw Judge Jeanine do an opening for her show that was utterly devastating on all this. This is a good &quot;masses level&quot; red pill. It&#39;s so much worse than this. But it&#39;s been coming apart so badly for the deep state that their stories are completely shredding, and there&#39;s enough at the mainstream level to see the smoke clearly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=270&amp;amp;v=UqdN_ZnxxpY">Watch this</a></p>

<p>By the way, I&#39;m not trying to sound like an arrogant asshole with the &quot;red pill&quot; shit. I was just as asleep as everyone else. It&#39;s fucking hard to wake up when we&#39;re in a propaganda war. It happens to different people at different times. Nobody wants to believe it really got <em>that bad</em>, and it took fucking Donald Trump (DONALD FUCKING TRUMP) to save the world. It&#39;s beyond belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I’m going to start from the beginning here and you feel free to argue with me on any point you would like. </p>

<p>1.) When the President tweeted about wiretapping he explicitly stated that Obama himself ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower and his phone. That’s not at all what happened. The DOJ wiretapped Paul Manafort because of his connections to Russia. There is no evidence that Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump. That is a lie by the President. </p>

<p>2.) Then she just blatantly says that there was a spy in the campaign. There is NO evidence for that. The only evidence she brings to the table is Comey and that other guy saying that there is no evidence and it didn’t happen. Then she brings in Clapper saying that they weren’t spying on Trump they were spying on the Russians and insinuates that that somehow proves her point? The only point that proves is that you equate spying on Russians with spying on Donald Trump. </p>

<p>3.) The “deep state” did no such thing with Hillary to help her win the election. They did not let her skate and they did not create any kind of false criminal narrative around Trump. If you’ll remember 11 days before the election James Comey reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton. A move that many democrats consider the reason Hillary lost. If Comey was a part of this deep state why would he make a move so obviously in Trumps favor? Also there was not a criminal narrative when Trump was running for President. At that point I don’t remember (but correct me if I’m wrong) anyone trying to say that Trump was colluding with Russia. Especially no one in the mainstream media. There were concerns about his history of sexual assault, but we have actual recorded evidence of him admitting to sexually assaulting women. So that’s not creating a false narrative. Also, there was concern over his businesses and how he would ethically handle all his money and his foreign ties when assuming the Presidency. But that is something any millionaire would be asked if they won the Presidency. No false narrative. </p>

<p>4.) She is correct that Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired Fusion GPS to do research into Trump that eventually led to the Steele dossier. I would also like to point out though that a Republican was paying for the research before the democrats began paying for it in April 2016. In addition it’s important to remember that just because one party paid for the research doesn’t mean it’s inherently untrue. And opposition research is not uncommon during an election. And even if they did use that as a reason to look into the Trump campaign shouldn’t we be okay with that? If we want to hold people accountable we need to investigate everything that has the possibility of being the truth. Like all of the investigations into Hillary Clinton.. To say that it shouldn’t have been looked into is to say you just believe Trump is innocent without any evidence that he is. You’ve taken his word over intelligence agencies. Which is a dangerous game to play. </p>

<p>5.) I’m not even going to get in to her chart at the end because to be honest I’m sure that all those people did lie at some point. I’m not here to tell you government officials love the truth. But to use that as evidence is absolute bullshit. The Trump administration lies CONSTANTLY about everything from the inauguration size to the tax cuts. Trying to frame either side as carriers of t he truth is incredibly naive and you’re falling right into the propaganda trap. </p>

<p>I didn’t come here to argue with you, I was seriously trying to understand. But I can’t have someone tell me that I need to wake up and then site Fox News as the reason. You wanna talk about propaganda rewatch that Judge Jeanine clip. That IS propaganda. You are not being given facts you are being given barely connected storylines that they attempt to baselessly weave together to create a broader narrative. </p>

<p>I’m not saying either side is right or righteous, but jesus man you say you’ve woken up but you’re letting them tell you what to think and not looking into it for yourself at all. That’s not waking up you’ve fallen asleep at the goddamn wheel and when you wake up we’re going to be in a world where nothing is truth only partisan fucking politics. Question what’s being given to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect that you truly believe all that to be true, and I understand why you think it&#39;s true. All I will say is that you should keep your mind open that things may not be what they seem, and to brace yourself to have your reality shaken at what gets released in the future. Because a hell of a lot more is coming.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with this. Let&#39;s side aside Trump. All things being equal, I&#39;d say we should be against known bad guys, right? Because chances are, they&#39;re connected to the corruption we both want to get ripped out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/07/31/obama-should-fire-john-brennan/?utm_term=.a1b796cd4282">John Brennan&#39;s CIA hacked our Senate&#39;s computers</a>. And Brennan lied about it <em>under oath</em>. Really roll that around in your head: OUR SENATE WAS HACKED BY OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. <em>And suffered no consequences for it</em>.</p>

<p>Was he punished by Obama? What do you think? Does anybody remember and bring this up when Brennan is all over the news? What do you think?</p>

<p>This only the tiniest <em>taste</em> of how corrupt everything is. Like I said, don&#39;t fixate on Trump. That&#39;s what <em>they</em> want you to do, because he&#39;s such a polarizing character. Learn how corrupt everything is, <em>both</em> Democrats and Republicans. Start there, and then decide what&#39;s true and false.</p>

<p>Like I said, I respect everything you wrote. I completely understand why you think it&#39;s true. I thought the same thing. There&#39;s a much bigger picture to find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I enjoyed reading that, it was very reasonable and makes sense!</p>

<p>I will just explain why I support trump:  it seems like his election has led to some actual strife within the ruling class and some changes.  For now, the fighting seems to be real, but we will see if any higher figures get in trouble.  There does seem to be a real change in how abusers and human traffickers are being pursued by law enforcement.  A lot remains the same, with his Goldman Sachs cabinet, Tillerson, etc.  I just like the fighting, which seems genuine, and the possibility of changes. To me he&#39;s better than the bush/Clinton/Obama group which would gain by his removal.  It seems almost like CIA vs DOD struggling for dominance, while the masters of the central banks continue to do whatever  they wish, uninterrupted.</p>

<p>If you want to read an interesting take on the changes in store, read Pepe Escobar.  He writes a lot of great articles for Asia Times.  <a href="http://thesaker.is/heres-how-the-trump-presidency-will-play-out27909-2/">This one supposedly details why trump was allowed to become president.</a></p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Masters made money out of transfer of industry to Asia (Bain Capital specialized in this), and Wall Street made money from the lower interest rates on the recycled dollars from the trade deficits. But now, the issue is strategic; and they will make money on the return of industries scaling down their investments in Asia and returning them to the United States as we rebuild production here.”</p>

<p>When you have frosted yourself telling someone the sea is wet and sky blue that they have vehemently denied and called you deluded and crazy in the meantime.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump vs the Deep State is a battle that was created in order to institute the next stage of whatever the real evil forces of the world have planned. Both sides are not on the side of the citizen and they both are corrupt. They are on their own sides. Q is brainwashing people to engage in this battle on Trumps side and will incite civil uprisings once the fire gets too hot from Mueller&#39;s investigation. The battle taking place is all that matters to Satan. Whoever takes the reigns when the dust has settled is going to be able to demonize Republicans and Christians because they fought for Trump so vehemently and caused a civil war. The Republican party will essentially be dead. They&#39;ll take our guns too because of this battle that was only possible because of the 2nd amendment. Most of the American people will willingly give them up because of this and we&#39;re already seeing the tide changing due to using those kids as spoke people for the anti gun movement. This has all been set up, move by move. Satan used Christianity as a weapon against itself. By attaching conservativism and Christianity to Trump, he&#39;ll take them both down with him when the full extent of his corruption is exposed. They&#39;ll never recover from that. And everyone who believed enough in those things to fight for them will be dead due to the battle. This is a full scale deception worthy of Satan himself. The only one&#39;s on the people&#39;s side are the people themselves. The rest is pro wrestling. A predetermined match meant to distract us where we suspend disbelief in order to get invested in the outcome. It&#39;s a ruse. The outcome is already known and we, the citizens, are the ones who are going to lose.</p>

<p>Hegelian Dialectic manipulation of political events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2  </p>

<p>Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.  </p>

<p>And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like the rebellion is happening now with this whole Trump vs Deep State thing and the &quot;now you know what is holding him back&quot; part is referring to the belief in Christianity. If my theory is true, whoever emerges out of this as the leader of America will try to usher in peace by demonizing anything associated with Trump, including Christianity. Probably even using the information about the aliens, using it in a way to fool people into trusting the wrong side. They&#39;ll tell everyone about this stuff and then claim to be on humanities side but really be the evil ones. Satan presents himself as an angel of light. This will most likely involve the Antichrist. If Trump survives the Mueller investigation and the coming civil war, he is the AntiChrist. The evidence for it is piling up but I&#39;m not going to believe it unless he gets out of this Russia scandal unscathed. There&#39;s so much dirt, the only way he survives is some sort of supernatural interference or some absolutely brilliant plan that&#39;s been set up for decades. FBI corruption could derail the whole thing and the story will shift from &quot;Is Trump guilty?&quot; to &quot;The FBI and US government is corrupt&quot;. Forgetting the fact that both could be true. I think that&#39;s the true genius of this plan, there are no innocent or good forces at play here. Just two evil sides our citizens are split on who to support. They got the anti-government right wingers to support one of the most corrupt presidents ever and got them willing to go to war to protect his presidency. They used these right wingers knowledge of their plan and their own arrogance and self righteousness against them. Instead of bringing about the civil war themselves, they got the right wingers to do it. Obama was a red herring to get Trump in office.</p>

Is it governments of other countries, or maybe Trump is dividing and conquering his political opponents, and the show is for them.

    <div class="md"><p>Overall, this sub is now nothing but a political tool. Most posts are just politics, not even talking about any kind of conspiracy (or with one pretty much shoehorned in), and depending on topic/source/poster/brigading are either worthy of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to politics I&#39;d love my views to get challenged, to talk with people making real points so that I&#39;d reconsider my positions. Instead whenever politics are involved (so, 90%+ of threads atm), it&#39;s either &quot;lol angry librul&quot; or &quot;lol Trump dumb&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly dreadful to see <em>the</em> sub that should question everything fall right into the trap of current politics, which is basically turning US (and slowly global) politics into nothing but a sports show. People are slowly being turned into zombies with zero interest in truth anymore, all that matter is that their &quot;team&quot; said it.</p>

<p>&gt;If you immediately box off any voice from outside of the echoing chamber as a &quot;shill&quot; and stop listening, <em>you are killing discourse just as effectively as any shills.</em></p>

<p>*chans seem to be suffering from this the most, along with any user community, this included, that becomes a little too big and united for the comfort level of TPTB. Hurling shill accusations left and right seems to be <em>the</em> way to cause cracks in the trust among the users, and disintegrate them. If you truly suspect someone of being a shill, the best thing would be to ignore them, or perhaps leave a simple counter-argument for other readers and move on.</p>

<p>In addition to the &quot;canned heat,&quot; I&#39;d also like to add just &quot;heat,&quot; which I think is the fundamental property that the whole political theatre of the West and, of course, pro-wrestling revolves around. Keeping the masses emotionally charged, or <em>hot</em>, makes it easy to manipulate them (for $ and dominance, the latter being psychologically/biologically rewarding) and wards off any logical, critical thoughts that might challenge the position of those at the top.</p>

<p>If you as a reader come to these conclusions as well, the first step to the only solution I can think of is to stop playing ball and not vote; refuse to partake in this hojiggery.</p>

<p>Agreed. But there are many dimensions of this situation that are larger than any social media presence or manipulation. For instance, it really matters that the &quot;middle class&quot; and the &quot;lower class&quot; get unified. Think of the issues that divide them (like immigration). It also matters that people refuse to accept the divisions based on genetic and cultural backgrounds.

The media coverage has also been unbelievably negative on Trump to the extreme. It&#39;s a strange reality when supporting the president is counter culture. The fervant support you observe is a push back against this. Personally i think Trump has done a lot of good. But what most people never discuss because really it has bipartisan support is the state of government spending. The us is running a 100 billion dollar a month deficit which is unpresidented. The economy could blow up before his term is over which will pave the way for some kind of socialist nightmare.</p>

If a few paragraphs and a bulleted list is too much for you to read, I don&#39;t want you to read my post. That is my TL;DR. Society is where we&#39;re at now because we cater to the lowest common denominator. </p>

<p>Trump is a symptom, not the disease. Reread my post; Trump is referenced a lot, but he&#39;s not the focus of what I&#39;m saying. I specifically typed &quot;The President&quot; instead of &quot;Trump&quot; when I was talking about feverish loyalty.  I&#39;m saying that blind subservience to Authority is the enemy, whether you agree or disagree with the &quot;party values&quot; that are being used at the time to obscure the true face. I don&#39;t care what mask it&#39;s wearing, or what party is in charge at any given time. It&#39;s the same dragon.</p>

<p>As for proof, how about you read the books I suggested? Spend some time paying attention to human nature. Think about effective ways for the Few to stay in power over the Many. Think about ways that wealth can be transferred from the many up to the few. Most importantly, <em>think about how you&#39;re enslaving yourself</em>. These are the questions you should be asking yourself in this day and age, not whether anything is true or false. We&#39;re firmly in the age of propaganda now. Nothing is 100% true or 100% false anymore</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. You figured it out. Congratulations. You are the winner, and it only took cherry picking a single phrase to dismiss everything I said. Lmao. This is why I sometimes doubt the whole shill theory. Why would they need to hire shills or trolls? Regain the narrative? They&#39;ve never lost it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, that time will come. When we make it come. Not one second before. I&#39;m exaggerating when I say omniscient--obviously the elites aren&#39;t All-Knowing, All-Seeing eyes. I shouldn&#39;t have to explain this, but we&#39;re talking about very human individuals. No matter what technology they have or what reach they have, they&#39;re still humans with human limitations. But come on, now. Scroll through some comments on some of these posts. Every event that happens is part of the conspiracy. Every shooting, every weather phenomenon, every comment that they happen to disagree with (look in this very post for an example of this one, people automatically default to calling me a shill and don&#39;t even think about what I&#39;m saying), every bit of scandal that comes out of the political and entertainment spheres. All of it, you&#39;ll find various people who are <em>absolutely certain</em> that it&#39;s an inside job. And that&#39;s ludicrous enough on its own. But couple that with the idea that this shadowy, sinister government would let a candidate that actually threatens it sit in the Big Chair? Hilarious. Our civilization has deified the Establishment. Some people hate and fear it, others love and trust it. But we&#39;re all worshipping it. Maybe it&#39;s time to start questioning what our gods are really doing for us instead</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I’m going to start from the beginning here and you feel free to argue with me on any point you would like. </p>

<p>1.) When the President tweeted about wiretapping he explicitly stated that Obama himself ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower and his phone. That’s not at all what happened. The DOJ wiretapped Paul Manafort because of his connections to Russia. There is no evidence that Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump. That is a lie by the President. </p>

<p>2.) Then she just blatantly says that there was a spy in the campaign. There is NO evidence for that. The only evidence she brings to the table is Comey and that other guy saying that there is no evidence and it didn’t happen. Then she brings in Clapper saying that they weren’t spying on Trump they were spying on the Russians and insinuates that that somehow proves her point? The only point that proves is that you equate spying on Russians with spying on Donald Trump. </p>

<p>3.) The “deep state” did no such thing with Hillary to help her win the election. They did not let her skate and they did not create any kind of false criminal narrative around Trump. If you’ll remember 11 days before the election James Comey reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton. A move that many democrats consider the reason Hillary lost. If Comey was a part of this deep state why would he make a move so obviously in Trumps favor? Also there was not a criminal narrative when Trump was running for President. At that point I don’t remember (but correct me if I’m wrong) anyone trying to say that Trump was colluding with Russia. Especially no one in the mainstream media. There were concerns about his history of sexual assault, but we have actual recorded evidence of him admitting to sexually assaulting women. So that’s not creating a false narrative. Also, there was concern over his businesses and how he would ethically handle all his money and his foreign ties when assuming the Presidency. But that is something any millionaire would be asked if they won the Presidency. No false narrative. </p>

<p>4.) She is correct that Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired Fusion GPS to do research into Trump that eventually led to the Steele dossier. I would also like to point out though that a Republican was paying for the research before the democrats began paying for it in April 2016. In addition it’s important to remember that just because one party paid for the research doesn’t mean it’s inherently untrue. And opposition research is not uncommon during an election. And even if they did use that as a reason to look into the Trump campaign shouldn’t we be okay with that? If we want to hold people accountable we need to investigate everything that has the possibility of being the truth. Like all of the investigations into Hillary Clinton.. To say that it shouldn’t have been looked into is to say you just believe Trump is innocent without any evidence that he is. You’ve taken his word over intelligence agencies. Which is a dangerous game to play. </p>

<p>5.) I’m not even going to get in to her chart at the end because to be honest I’m sure that all those people did lie at some point. I’m not here to tell you government officials love the truth. But to use that as evidence is absolute bullshit. The Trump administration lies CONSTANTLY about everything from the inauguration size to the tax cuts. Trying to frame either side as carriers of t he truth is incredibly naive and you’re falling right into the propaganda trap. </p>

<p>I didn’t come here to argue with you, I was seriously trying to understand. But I can’t have someone tell me that I need to wake up and then site Fox News as the reason. You wanna talk about propaganda rewatch that Judge Jeanine clip. That IS propaganda. You are not being given facts you are being given barely connected storylines that they attempt to baselessly weave together to create a broader narrative. </p>

<p>I’m not saying either side is right or righteous, but jesus man you say you’ve woken up but you’re letting them tell you what to think and not looking into it for yourself at all. That’s not waking up you’ve fallen asleep at the goddamn wheel and when you wake up we’re going to be in a world where nothing is truth only partisan fucking politics. Question what’s being given to you. </p>
