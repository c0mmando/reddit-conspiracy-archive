<p>It&#39;s almost as if Trump is a stooge to gaslight/discredit conspiracy theorists, if I&#39;m saying that right. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have been sounding the alarm over the Deep State since the time of Eisenhower&#39;s grim warning and even before, and yet all of the sudden we&#39;ve &quot;made it up&quot; because of a stooge as POTUS?</p>

<p>Did you just make that up?</p>

<p>Anyway, my problem is when we start attacking all the 3 million people that make up the government as deep state or when bad actors use the term to try and get out of the shitty stuff they&#39;ve done (Trump).  It really hurts the true work to make government less corrupt when the corrupt use it like the boy who cried wolf. </p>

<p>Keep using that TD brush tho...bro. As long as you believe it that&#39;s all that matters..right? Or do you just use that as a pathetic distraction to avoid addressing the fact that you have no room to talk when it comes to defining what and who the deep state is.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the point.  I never said I wasn&#39;t partisan.  I just can&#39;t stand it when people try to pretend they&#39;re not while carrying the water for that side.  Just admit it and we can can the false indignation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also posted enough unpopular opinions to notice. There are shill accounts tearing down some comments <strong><em>mere moments</em></strong> after they&#39;re posted, so quickly it&#39;s obvious the comment wasn&#39;t even read thoroughly before responding.  </p>

I know a lot of people that aren&#39;t quite aware of the whole identity politics thing and aren&#39;t sure what to think of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; but even they accept the idea of a deep state as a matter of fact. They may have done a good job in keeping a lot of the dirty secrets regarding rich people involved in this whole mess away from the public, but their control of people&#39;s minds isn&#39;t as big as they think it is.

<p>Trump copied Sanders speech verbatim &amp; added &#39;the wall&#39; shit then the media pumped him 247 while ignoring Sanders multiple mile long rallies cross country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK man you really might be going of the wall a bit. I was just reading an Elsagate thread and read your comments and man do you really think Disney are controlling society and are linked <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or anything? Or that we&#39;re actually in a bizarro timeline? Like I can give some room for people being into conspiracies but do you really think TLJ is a key thing for the deep state/illuminati, and is powered by forces of satanic evil?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know if you&#39;re joking, talking in hyperbole or metaphors, believe it or what. But try to stay tethered to Earth, it can be all to easy to lose your head in the clouds. I don&#39;t know, just try to talk to people about normal stuff too. As someone just stumbling on this stuff, you honestly do come across a bit, well</p>

<p>Trying to, in tandem with other media entities and dark forces, for sure</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Could be. Not sure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yup.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depends on the comment/post. Probably all of the above at one time or another.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think I don&#39;t?</p>

<p>It&#39;s totally up to you what you do with my material. Ignore it at your will and possible peril. </p>

<p>Your writing suggests you&#39;re fairly young and your passion is video gaming, not research. If you want to continue to take the world on face value and not think there are spiritual forces in play and conflict, that&#39;s your choice. But I assure you that you are missing the big picture in a big way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna unravel that ball of thread, but all I&#39;m saying is to be cynical of your own cynical ideas too. I can get behind holding what we&#39;re told to scrutiny, but it&#39;s good to do to the things we come up with also. Have a good day man. :)</p>

<p>Pretty good songs by the way.</p>

<p>Public schools are bad and should be privatized: teachers would get better wages because competition and students better education. Plus I mean they cant be federally indoctrinated.</p>
