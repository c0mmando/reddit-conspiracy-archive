    <div class="md"><p>Why not add to the discussion? OK said even world news, implying that although it&#39;s full of bullshit they still recognise it. </p>

<p>I despise these types of comments on conspiracy. It should be about open discussion and debate, not just absolutely shutting it down. </p>

<p>I think with Musk its the fact he&#39;s done some things in the past that were pretty dickish. The whole early PayPal thing and taking peoples balances was a douche bag move and he got very rich from it. </p>

<p>I think alot of people focus on current assets to determine tesla/space x and completely disregard the fact that the investors are investing in the future and not for a quick pay back.</p>

<p>Then after allllll the publicity he got he became more vocal and eccentric which gave people ammunition to attack his character. </p>

<p>This is ofcourse just my opinion, but it&#39;s how I view it. I dont understand the hatred for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to hate the fact that if Trump supporters end up liking something it cause this entire fucking site to declare jihad on the individuals lol.</p>

<p>The fact that the political goons on either side hate each other with such immense fervor means that actual reddit users are drowned out through all their vote manipulation and bullshit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s reactionary and pointless, who gives a fuck if the people you hate like someone, on either side? Is it some sacred duty to tear their credibility to shreds because some individuals view their new found fans as evidence of some malign action by said individuals.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pure lunacy.</p>

<p>Lol. This season The Flash villain The Thinker was even from South Africa.</p>
