<p>It’s a good thing Scott Pruitt doesn’t buy into the globalist agenda. What irks me the most about the rabid climate lobby is their refusal to consider nuclear energy. </p>

<p>Should the dude just be cool with not having a say in the matter? I feel like it&#39;s a bit more than cum when that child is basically part of him to, since it&#39;s something they mutually created together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes they are though, poor couples who cannot afford a child have to make a difficult choice. One that shouldn&#39;t leave one member completely shut out of it. It happens so much in my state that there are specialized attorneys for men just for that and that our state is very soft on the wife&#39;s side.</p>

<p>Final say belongs to the woman, sure. However the man should have some argumentative power in a situation, especially since the reasons for abortion can be varied from individual to individual. I don&#39;t go for this &quot;no matter what&quot; style of argument by the way, usually it ends with you casting an insult, which you delivered.</p>

<p>Now, saying that. I don&#39;t mean abusive situations, dangerous pregnancy, and etc. It&#39;s all separate issues that lead to abortion, but it&#39;s not the only issues.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not equating the two. I&#39;m acknowledging that there could be mental turmoil that spreads to both participating parties that should be acknowledged in the abortion process.</p>

<p>Try to discuss the ideas instead of resorting to insults please, I won&#39;t reason or attempt to respond if you continue down that path. It&#39;s not worth it to deal with angry ideologues :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting. I always listen to both sides, my flags go up when an argument is laden with; 1. Emotional triggers- like someone trying to get me emotional though hate, or disgust, or fear; 2. Trying to prove things are not provable, rather than observe fact; 3. Trying to get me to disbelieve in the scientific method, as in the science used to determine climate change is the same science used to refine oil; 4. Redirecting an argument into some other premise, like a conversation about acting responsibly for the environment&#39;s benefit, turns into a discussion about how and why climate change is happening, rather than what to do about it; 5. Using extremes as excuse-  Somehow it doesn&#39;t matter because its nature. As in, we can pollute the crap out of the ocean and we don&#39;t need to stop because climate change is not caused by man. These are all tactics I watch for.... usually the truth lies somewhere outside of these flags.</p>

FACT:  carbon/methane only makes up .3% of the atmosphere &amp; we dont really know if this is good or bad.  Anyone claiming to know is lying.  FACT:  carbon in the air is currently at 400 parts per million &amp; it was closer to 200 mil before we started burning fossil fuels.  When brainwashed libtards start doing what it takes to get back to pre burning fossil fuel days then maybe i’ll consider chipping in but as long as these hypocrites continue their love affair with consumerism then so will i.

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll dig for the source but I remember reading a study about three years ago regarding an ice core study done in Antarctica. Ice cores are much like tree rings except they encapsulate the atmospheric make up of that time period. They allow us to view what was in our atmosphere thousands of years ago. They had drilled deep enough to go “back in time” to the last ice age. During the last ice age the atmospheric make up of greenhouse gases was multiples greater than they are currently.  This should suggest the exact opposite of an ice age, or conversely, we should currently be in a deep ice age. </p>

<p>Having said that we are raping our planet. I don’t believe global warming is a man made event but anything that helps curb/delays the destruction of our planet I’m behind.  As stated, look for an edit if I can find the source link. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atmospheric science is complicated and multifactorial. Milankovitch cycles, albedo, variations in insolation all have an effect, amongst other things. No one denies that massive climate change occurred before man, but that does not preclude anthropogenic climate change.</p>

<p>The problem is, you can&#39;t boil the explanation of anthropogenic climate change down to an easily digestible form. People latch on to what they see as conflicting evidence but it&#39;s all easily refutable. High CO2 levels and cold temperatures do not mean that CO2 does not cause warming - that is a complete falsehood as there are so many other variables.</p>

<p>I wish people who can&#39;t accept the fact that humanity is fucking up the planet would go and learn how to read evidence with a critical eye. This does not mean making up your mind first and looking for supporting evidence. That is the opposite of science.</p>

<p>If not, they should come to terms with the fact that maybe, just maybe, the people who have made this issue their life&#39;s work might possibly grasp it a little better than their community college educated dumb ass can. Trying to pick &quot;holes&quot; that have already been explained just makes people look moronic.</p>

<p>I mean, I don&#39;t understand how the smartphone I&#39;m typing this on works but do I deny its existence? Or pretend I know better than the engineers and programmers that created it? What kind of arrogant fool would do that?</p>

<p>Dumb ass here. We studied this intensively. Prior to the late 1990&#39;s it was accepted that &quot;Solar Forcing&quot; was the major determining factor that controls our climate. Of course there were other factors as well, notably volcanic aerosols. Man-made factors were also considered.</p>

<p>What happened when the Climate Scientists got into the controlling position was just incredibly weird and deceptive. They used massive computer models which nobody could understand to predict massive climate effects from CO2 which then were never correct! These are the people you are calling &quot;the engineers and programmers that created it&quot; (Climate Science). </p>

<p>Meanwhile, many old-timers tried to stick it out, researching and proving that Solar influences far outweighed Man-made, but all sorts of political pressure was felt. Also, scientists in related fields such as Physics, Geology, Oceanography, Paleo-Climate, and others tried to enter this debate but because they were not self-proclaimed &quot;Climate Scientists&quot;, they were largely ignored.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t shower me with &quot;prove it&quot; - what I&#39;m claiming is well documented if you look. The ordinary citizens who doubt are not denying scientists, they are doubting a very specific politically motivated group of self-appointed &quot;Change agents&quot;.</p>

<p>No. The worst scenarios involve a known-unknown astronomical threat, related to the sun spot anomaly currently underway, not some gradual man-made temperature plateau.  Everything is not at all what it seems. I&#39;m being frank.</p>

<p>How? The point is not which scientists are better, it&#39;s why this issue matters. The point is not whether climate can change, it&#39;s how and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, and thanks for being so civil.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that blind acceptance is the way to go, but most people lack the tools to critically appraise evidence. When I have done so in the past, I have always found the case for man made climate change to be compelling, while claims to the contrary are often riddled with flaws.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m on the fence about whether we should just accept that climate change is unlikely to be stopped now, and focus our efforts on adaptation/new climate modifying technologies rather than CO2 reduction.</p>

<p>...is the only way to have productive disagreement. Underneath all the foam of partisanship is a cultural negotiation that pertains to our essential identity as a society made up of very differently thinking individuals.</p>

<p>If we had time, I would gladly go deeper. From our conversation you probably would not realize that I am a life-long environmentalist, and I studied and practiced environmental science with the goal of helping the world survive destruction by corporate greed, ignorance, and blindness.</p>
