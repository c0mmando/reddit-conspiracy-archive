<p>that shelf life becomes exponentially shorter every day that she&#39;s not prosecuted.  in fact, it may have passed because I&#39;m not relieved over her loss right now but rather irritated with the continued shitty meme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well...  when you mention the name Hillary Clinton is also brings to mind other campaign promises concerning her prosecution.</p>

<p>you&#39;re going to get diminishing returns on the &quot;hillary didn&#39;t win&quot; meme because while her loss is diminishing into the past, the fact that she remains free from prosecution is refreshed every day that she isn&#39;t prosecuted in contravention of one of Trump&#39;s campaign promises.  </p>

<p>eventually, without prosecution, her name will just be a reminder of his failure to prosecute...  hence... shelf life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Iran situation would have already escalated far beyond what it currently is. </p>

<p>I believe NK were pressured by Russia/China, as escalation with NK would surely mean conflict in Iran. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump fan but I think that fact that he does things a little different, is the reason NK are calming down a little.</p>

<p>Imagine Hillary trying to deal with Kim Jung-un :O</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary&#39;s problem at the time of the election was more about what she had done wrong, rather than what she would have done wrong as president.</p>

<p>From the time she was First Lady for 8 years, icily surviving Bill&#39;s pecadillos, I think she came across as haughty and elitist - more so than Bill who was a great schmoozer. Then she waltzed into a prepared Senate seat in New York - everyone was like - exactly why did she deserve that? Favors? Then as Sec of State her performance was just awful, unless you were a Zionist, militarist, oil-driven Mideast regime change fan - then she was just great... </p>

<p>Speaking of great, she showed her special Favor-filling strategies well by defeating Sanders in the rugged 2016 primary.</p>

<p>She could not even form an energizing constituency in the traditionally democratic black and hispanic communities. Yes the ones that voted mostly voted for her, but the ones that stayed home... did not. That&#39;s a story you never got at the time.</p>

<p>So after all that Clinton-hating from a fairly progressive viewpoint, I think her policies would have been fairly similar to what we have done - probably a heavier hand in the Mideast, but not by much. Probably worse economy. Probably better race relations and also possibly a better tech outlook. Oh, and the UFO thing... she did promise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well trump went with the &quot;draining the swamp&quot; conspiracy theory, and it resonated with people.  If Hillary had been more vocal about UFO disclosure, do you think that would have hurt or helped her?  Maybe wrangle a few conspiracy theorists to her side?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also heard more about the Clinton UFO disclosure promise after than before the election - and I think she had too many problems for that to counterbalance them even with conspiracy nuts. But I also believe strongly we need to have a viable 3rd-party that will investigate the status quo corporatocracy and figure out why... everything is f*ed up so bad.</p>
