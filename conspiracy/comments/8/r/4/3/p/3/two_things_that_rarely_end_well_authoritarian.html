<p>It&#39;s clear by now that the Trump administration is both of these. Even some members of the GOP can&#39;t ignore the Jim Jones-ian fervor some of their brethren have for the president. </p>

<p>The question now is, how does it all end? Do we have a simple election loss in 2020, with Trump going through the niceities of a one-term president handing the reins to his vanquisher? Does it end in impeachment and removal? Resignation in disgrace? Or maybe it doesn&#39;t end, and Trump declares himself President for Life, passing the torch on to Ivanka with nobody looking up from their phones to notice and a collective shrug from Congress?</p>

<p>And how will the most fervent of the believers react if/when it does all go to hell? Will they lash out in violence, ala Japanese officers at the end of World War II? Will they quietly bite down on a capsule while clutching a portrait of the Great One, ala Nazi true believers? </p>

<p>Or will they go on with their infotainment scams and racial resentment just like they did before this all started?</p>

<p>This is bigger than Trump, but since you asked. How about this: </p>

<p>1) Trump is <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/the-gop-is-a-trump-cult-boasts-donald-trump-jr.html">building a cult</a> that questions the <a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/jun/22/ainsley-earhardt/following-trump-voter-fraud-allegations-claim-57-m/">legitamicy of our democracy.</a> While at the same time <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2017/12/27/former_federal_judge_trump_is_packing">packing the courts with unqualified, sympathizers.</a> You combine that with his attempt to <a href="http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/02/golden_how_trump_is_trying_to_delegitimize_the_fre.html">delegitimize the free press</a>, and it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s following the authoritarian recipe to a tee. </p>

<p>From claiming he can pardon himself to clear emolument clause violations, he&#39;s putting our democracy to the test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1,2, and 4 are opinions and are not really backed up with any real legal concerns with regards to Trump actually breaking from the rules of the Constitution.  3 is what every president tries to do, and is one of the key reasons that the parties push to get their side in the Oval Office.  5 only makes sense if people accept all of your points in the way you want them to, so, like, your opinion.  When the Congress and Courts start making moves that change the law to allow Trump (or any president for that matter) to gain or retain legal powers for longer than we currently accept, is when i will actually start worrying about your initial statement.</p>

<p>This is one of the biggest problems in our country is facing now. I would love nothing more than to see the 6 new conglomerates broken up, so we returned to a media landscape that was closer to how it looked pre-90&#39;s. </p>

<p>What would you all news to be state propaganda like Fox news? or Would you like to see the big corporations broken up?</p>

<p>Trump borrowed Joseph Stalin&#39;s line and has called the news media &quot;the enemy of the people&quot; and has tried to abuse his power to go after them <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/10/trump-is-going-after-legal-protections-for-journalists/">http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/10/trump-is-going-after-legal-protections-for-journalists/</a></p>

<p>Emoluments clause:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 is kind of a poorly made argument and poorly titled article (re click bait).  The article itself even points out that the justice department is acting within its legal boundaries.  The issue is all about leaking and publishing classified information that may put intelligence or military people in harms way.  It&#39;s not about taking away the rights of the press.</p>

<p>2 I agree is a mistaken point made by the president in a lot of ways, but is also the way that the police and legal system work: if there is a possible threat of violence, the police generally disarm all parties until the situation is resolved in real time and in the courts.  The main concerns arise around when the decision can be made to disarm someone in the myriad cases where violence came after someone was discovered to have concerning activities or motivations.</p>

<ol>
<li> A valid concern but doesn&#39;t actually play into the initial argument that he&#39;s trying to become some sort of dictator</li>

<p>The only people who proclaim proudly that they are authoritarian are incel losers who are angry at the world that they have no social life, can&#39;t get laid, and contribute so little to society that if they died tonight it would take the neighbors complaining months later about a smell coming from the basement nextdoor just to find the body. </p>

<p>They jerk their tiny dick to fantasies about rounding people up and ruling over others because it makes them feel strong and significant thinking about showing everyone what they get for not including them in their social circles. These type of people will never be anything to anyone and so they dream about being powerful and forcing everyone to fear them. 
But, that&#39;s totally not you though right? You&#39;re the OTHER kind of authoritarian.</p>

<p>You want a king. I want us to take power back from the corporations that have taken over our democracy. We don&#39;t need a king, especially one who <a href="https://wamu.org/story/18/04/12/checking-trumps-washington-hotel-emoluments-kleptocrats-pennsylvania-avenue/">only looks out for his self interests.</a> We we need to end Citizens Untied and end regulatory capture. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame anyone for voting for him. Hillary sucks, and he was an unknown, but after seeing him in office I just don&#39;t know how anyone could think he&#39;s doing a good job. But even though it&#39;s kind of dumb to still support him it&#39;s nothing compared to the people commenting here saying he should be president for life. That&#39;s beyond fucking stupid, it&#39;s treasonous and unamerican. We fought hard to build a country free from kings and family dynasties, and if you don&#39;t understand that then you don&#39;t understand what it means to be an American.</p>

<p>Another one: every modern president has taken great pains to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of self-enrichment. Carter sold his peanut farm. The Reagans donated their TV and film residuals to charity while in office. Even Obama donated his Nobel Prize winnings to various charities.</p>

<p>Contrast that with Donald Trump, who has aggressively profited from the presidency, has not disentangled himself from his businesses in any meaningful way, and continues to push himself as a luxury brand, even during negotiations with the leaders of other countries.</p>

<p>Trump is far better than the alternatives, but a truly great President would abolish the Fed, destroy the ZOG and hang the traitors. It should be pretty obvious that Donald &quot;my kids are yids&quot; Trump isn&#39;t planning on doing that.</p>

<p>What would you all news to be state propaganda like Fox news? or Would you like to see the big corporations broken up?</p>

<p>There have been a few proven isolated cases, but by and by there is no proof of this on a scale large enough to influence elections. </p>
