        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have to go to work in a few hours so I&#39;ll make this very quick. I&#39;m using a throwaway account as well so please excuse me. </p>

<p>I recently started working for a progressive political fundraising call center and things were looking good. I believed in the cause and was squeezing everyone I called to get some money for the democrats running for election. Last week I got a new client to call for. <strong>21st Century Democrats</strong>. This is a superpac designed to push more &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;Leftist&quot; candidates vs more moderate democrats. </p>

<p>I called a gentlemen to ask him for money and support for the <strong>21st Century Democrats</strong> and he started to tell me how the money wasn&#39;t going to candidates and most of it was getting pocketed but I didn&#39;t believe him. At least pretended to cause my boss was listening to my calls. </p>

<p>Today I started researching <strong>21st Century Democrats</strong> and found this very interesting article by Washington Examiner:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/most-troubled-pac-in-history-flies-under-radar-squanders-democratic-donors-cash/article/2543936">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/most-troubled-pac-in-history-flies-under-radar-squanders-democratic-donors-cash/article/2543936</a></p>

<p>The very interesting part of the article is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the only significant recipient of the PAC&#39;s funds was Integral Resources, a Cambridge, Mass. dial-for-dollars telemarketing firm that received nearly $2 million since 2009.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IRI - the people I work for - have been raising funds for 21st Century for a while now, we still do. a quick look at OpenSecrets.org shows that 21st Century paid IRI in 2018 around $650,000</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2018&amp;amp;cmte=C00230342">https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2018&amp;amp;cmte=C00230342</a></p>

<p>That kinda made me feel uneasy because our work environment is terrible. We are using Windows XP machines running DOS to call senior citizens and ask them for petty donations. Meanwhile all the managers keep complaining that the company is broke. The job is a job I don&#39;t really care at this point but I dug deeper.</p>

<p>The CEO of IRI is Ronald Rosenblith. He founded the company in 1985 to use telemarketing tactics for fundraising. His ingenious idea was to group every democratic cause together and mass fundraiser all throughout the year. That means if you donate to either a <strong>NON-POLITICAL</strong> charitable cause or a political one, you will be called by every organization and committee out there looking for donations. What&#39;s very interesting is that 21st Century was also established in 1985 and Ron and Tim Harkin were close friends.</p>

<p>in 2008 IRI got in trouble because an organization at the time called Women&#39;s Voices Womens Vote, sent out a suspicious call to NC voters, urging them to register to vote with a packet that was in the mail for them, even though the deadline for registration was over 5 days ago. Heres the kicker, The CEO of WVWV is married to Ronald Rosenblith. It&#39;s allegeded that they were trying to suppress black voters in Hilary Vs. Obama.</p>

<p>in 2013 they got banned from calling Iowa for five years because of their predatory practices - I can attest to that very predatory indeed - which is the only other thing I found on the news from them that was recent.</p>

<p><a href="https://legalnewsline.com/stories/510516370-fundraiser-barred-from-iowa-for-five-years">https://legalnewsline.com/stories/510516370-fundraiser-barred-from-iowa-for-five-years</a></p>

<p>The rest of my investigation didn&#39;t net any results. Most of our clients are reputable but the amount of money we are raising is unfathomable:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2018&amp;amp;vendor=Integral+Resources">https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2018&amp;amp;vendor=Integral+Resources</a></p>

<p>Close to $10 million in around a year and some months. I can answer any questions you have regarding fundraising operations. Any sort of info you guys have to help me complete this picture would be appreciated as well. </p>
