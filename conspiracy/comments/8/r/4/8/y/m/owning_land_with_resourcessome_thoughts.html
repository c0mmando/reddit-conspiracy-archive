        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is just some random thoughts to stir some conversation. So what do you all think of ownership of land with resources on it, I tend to subscribe to libertarian views. But ownership of resources seems like an interesting topic to discuss.  The state allows some person/corp to have access to some land that lets say has a bunch of gold underneath. Is it truly capitalistic to allow one/person to hold that land forever and to profit of it? I consider water a community resource and one of the few reasons we should have governance, but how are other resources different?  What kind of system do you think would be better? I think there should be a limit on a site, say 20 years, at that point, the state should allow bidders to take over the site if they can show they will manage the site better than the current operator in terms on environmental and community impact... this is just an idea...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think whoever currently owns the land should own the mineral rights as well. My family owns 10 acres here in Oklahoma and has for the last 26 years that weve lived here, most likely sitting on oil with all the pumps going up all over the neighborhood, and yet now that the last remaining, locally living, member of the family who owned the land probably 50 years ago before it became a neighborhood has died somebody elsewhere is reaping all the profits, with the natural gas water and oil there is a lot to be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never advocated for a state at all. Talking pure socialism baby, for the people by the people. Whoever wants to run this hypothetical lithium mine runs it. Whoever wants to oversee it oversees it.  Whoever wants to watch dog the people running it watches them and reports to the rest of the people. Whoever wants to work it works it. Keep everything transparent and I honestly don’t believe anything would go terribly wrong. Companies fuck over workers currently because it will make the heads more money. If there’s no one to get ahead of, this problem takes care of itself.
The end question is just left to their devices (and not educated by media/elementary programming etc) whether you think people are selfish or would work for the whole.</p>

Intentionally in many cases, it was cheaper not to dispose of waste products correctly.
Why aren’t those companies being held responsible?
Thats the million dollar question, oh wait, they have offices full of million dollar lawyers
Why were they even allowed to practice irresponsibly in the first place?
Generally no one looked or they hid their practices intentionally

    <div class="md"><p>The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He&#39;s got esprit up to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night. His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air. A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest. Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.</p>

<p>When they gave him the job, they gave him a gun. The Deliverator never deals in cash, but someone might come after him anyway-might want his car, or his cargo. The gun is tiny, aero-styled, lightweight, the kind of a gun a fashion designer would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times the velocity of an SR-71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have to plug it into the cigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.</p>

<p>The Deliverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear. He pulled it once in Gila Highlands. Some punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted themselves a delivery, and they didn&#39;t want to pay for it. Thought they would impress the Deliverator with a baseball bat. The Deliverator took out his gun, centered its laser doohickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired it. The recoil was immense, as though the weapon had blown up in his hand. The middle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust accelerating in all directions like a bursting star. Punk ended up holding this bat handle with milky smoke pouring out the end. Stupid look on his face. Didn&#39;t get nothing but trouble from the Deliverator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NorCal is fairly Libertarian and property rights and resource right/control via the citizen is viewed as a positive.  Any state incursion is a negative.</p>

<p>Cops, Sheriff, and other state actors are very much devalued.  Those entities won&#39;t enter private property during harvest season.  Generally these are accessed via dirt roads and are well off the paved streets so approaching vehicles are easy to spot/hear, especially with eyes out during harvest, and they will be shot at.</p>

<p>Generally, they are also alerted which dirt roads are guarded, etc, as cops are also cousins, uncles, and neighbors.</p>

<p>Basically, Hella F No to any state&#39;s right over resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the very first problems any system of governance has is that not everybody wants to be governed the same way, if at all.  so right off the bad you&#39;re talking about a spectrum/plurality of governance models that you&#39;ll want, and probably some sort of overarching meta model of governance over this spectrum.  otherwise you&#39;ll always be trying to cram everyone into a single ill-fitting model - and this just doesn&#39;t work sustainably, nor would you want to achieve it if you even could because it would come at the cost of individual capability for original thought. </p>

<p>so that&#39;s the first hurdle.  figuring out how to fract people to systems of governance via the means of self-selection.</p>

<p>and then on top of this comes the realization that you&#39;ll want to adapt your rules as time goes on, in your governing system (that is part of a bunch of them, covering everybody).  again, the same problem pops up.  how do you account for differences of opinion when you mutate your rules?  using the same approach you enable self-selection out of those systems if the rules are mutated to be no longer acceptable.  or alternately enable the &quot;old cohort&quot; to fork to a spectrum of cohorts depending on where they are relative to the new rule mutation.  in other words, if you&#39;re gonna make a large breaking change in your gov, you may want to consider forking your gov at this point and letting people go to the one they want.</p>

<p>self-selection is the key here because you minimize the complaints of coercion.  it&#39;s also the means by which you&#39;d evolve your gov.  you need a market of govs.</p>

<p>anyway, as this relates to land and property ownership, if you wanted that model then everyone else in that area would have to want it to.  same deal with surface mining rights, water rights, etc.  it seems self-evident to me that these are of &quot;the commons&quot; and i&#39;d prefer to be governed by rules that consider them that.   </p>

Putting artificial time limits on things is risky business.  We as a whole are best service by preventing monopolies (so that a single or small number of entities don&#39;t own all the minerals) and taxes with moderate social programs so that everyone benefits from the extraction of the resources.</p>
