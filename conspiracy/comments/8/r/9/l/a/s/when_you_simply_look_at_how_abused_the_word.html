       I'm not so sure peaceful and religion go together. Maybe buddhism or something but definitely not christianity or Islam. War and hate is pretty much their middle name. Even though they like to pretend to be benevolent and peaceful.. history will tell you otherwise. You can cherry pick very good bible or Quran verses to sound all nice and dandy but in the end they are still books full of hatred, oppression, and supremacy.

       Check out the Rohingya Genocide occurring right now and I believe you would question your assumption on Buddhism being entirely peaceful, at least I think. Agreed on all the rest. That and there are varying ratios of good and bad eggs in every carton.

       I'm gonna go ahead and compare both of those religion's track records for violence as well as the behavior of Muslims towards non-Muslims. This would lead me to believe that they'd have to have done something to bring Buddhists to violence. Not that either side is in the right but that this particular street is probably a two-way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Islam might have "modernized" and sorted out it's violence problems had they not had such a high rate of 1st cousin marriages. Well, that and had they not artificially created such stupid nations and then left them alone. Iran wouldn't be nearly the way it is today without the U.S. backed meddling.

       You know the Quran literally says you aren't allowed to kill innocent people? And that other religions like Christianity are still ok because it's the same God? And that the stereotype you are promoting was inculcated in you since the beginning of this century with an endless stream of hoax Muslim terror attacks including 9/11 perpetrated by Zionists?

       I linked you to literally the first generation of Islam and its adherents conquest of North Africa and Europe, and you're like "Hurr durrr, ancient history is ancient.  Islam is the religion of peace."

       Since I’m not a shitlib, I’m not going to do what any shitlib would do at this point by spamming a bunch of bloody Christian conquests from history; I’m not trying to defend Islam since to me it might as well be the Religion of I Don’t Give a Shit as much as the religion of peace.

       No, they're not committed at all. No one died in San Bernardino or Boston. Or Nice. Or Berlin. Or Manchester. Etc., etc. But you probably still think 19 Arabs did 9/11 as well.

       Yeah yeah, Islam is the religion of peace.

       Muhammed pressured his followers to rape married women.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at Ibn Kathir and the Hadith, we get the following story:
      </p>
      <p>
       -Muhammad's own followers initially refused to rape kidnapped married women.
      </p>
      <p>
       -As a result of this refusal, Muhammad reveals verse 4:24 which encourages raping married women "your right hands possess" i.e. kidnapped.
      </p>

       Ibn Kathir says:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Ayah means, you are prohibited from marrying women who are already married,
       <strong>
        except
       </strong>
       those whom your right hands possess,
       <strong>
        except
       </strong>
       those whom you acquire through war, for you are allowed such women after making sure they are not pregnant. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, "We
       <strong>
        captured
       </strong>
       some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them
       <strong>
        because they already had husbands.
       </strong>
       So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and
       <strong>
        this Ayah was revealed
       </strong>
       , Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess.
       <strong>
        Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.
       </strong>
       "

       Exactly, within their own religion they fight each other for the sake of which sect to believe in. In the US, we agree to disagree. In majority Muslim countries there are mass shootings, explosions, and fighting between each other. There is so much hate they’re tripping over themselves and cannot complete their goals. Mohammad forcing men to rape married women just goes to show you the nature of things in those areas. It has been a domination religion since the start. Praise Allah (their way) or die.

       Highly disagree that Christian nations are most warring.  Agreed we have destabilised the middle east in many ways, but at least nations built on traditional Christian values are able to look after themselves and their citizens as well as accomplishing a lot scientifically etc.  Just look at countries with strict Islamic values and tell me what’s more advanced

       It's not about being advanced or not, it's about being peaceful or not. And it's not about opinion either, the facts are the facts so just look at f.ex invasions since WWII.

       well if it's about being peaceful then islamic culture is definitely one of the most peaceful,  as long as you're not a woman or a young boy (baccha bazi)  or a homosexual,   or a free-thinker, or someone who wants to leave the religion (funny i don't know the christian version of apostasy)  o and idk where you live but if you hate your country so much and prefer islam then go live in a middle eastern country and see how you get on :D
      </p>
      <p>
       or just come live inner city britain, plenty of islamic culture

       I have actually lived in a middle eastern country.

       I am not saying it is better or worse, imo all religion is shit. Just purely pointing out that it is not the Islamic countries that makes all the wars on this planet... food for thought.

       Whether the religion is peaceful or not, there is no entity on this planet that currently fits the definition of
       <em>
        terrorist
       </em>
       better than the U.S. military.
       <br/>
       They are global terrorists in every sense.
       <br/>
       This is yet another situation in history in which the bad guys think they're the good guys because they've been told so over &amp; over again.

       Right, no Muslims ever attack anyone. They're all conveniently false flags committed by non-Muslims.
