The piece was clearly a purchased ad, but it read like an article. It laid out a clear argument (whether legit or not) that LBJ had JFK killed so that he could become president. I&#39;d love to read it again and learn about the author. </p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give a fuck, because Infowars is a heavily biased website run by a right-wing, racist, xenophobic, misogynist nut job with terrible credibility. Perhaps the information presented by such a site is legit once in a while, but the site&#39;s reputation overshadows such a generous interpretation. Imagine the news source that you trust least in the world, whether that be FOX, NBC, Hannity, NPR, Maddow, etc.--would you not be suspicious of the guests that the hosts invites and the conclusions reached by the hosts? </p>

<p>I would be, and I am. I&#39;m glad to have watched this video, but by dint of being broadcast on Infowars I doubt the veracity of all involved. You may call that paranoia or tribalism or blindness or whatever. I call it being a discerning consumer of media. I&#39;m happy to have been exposed to this video. I learned from it. And I also doubt it. What could possibly be more <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> than that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree, which is why I&#39;m following up on every recommendation in this thread. </p>

<p>But, given the need to disbelieve <em>so</em> many people allegedly involved in the assassination, why would you place total trust in any one individual? Even if they say things that are apparently self-incriminating, there could be many motivations for such actions. A politically-motivated move to change the conversation, a desire for public acclaim, the person being paid off by a political organization, delusion, PR, wanting to impress ones family and friends, being part of a propaganda machine, political jealousy, desire for fame, wanting to be part of a huge historical event, etc. </p>

<p>Maybe the Watergate burglar was telling the truth. Maybe not. It takes more evidence than &quot;you should fucking listen&quot; to make me take any testimony at face value. And, btw, if someone confesses to JFK&#39;s murder on SNL, I would assume that it&#39;s a comedy routine and not a genuine confession. I&#39;m confused by your SNL example. </p>

<p>The secret service fumbled their guns and one of them went off and hit JFK at close range.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info! Based on your two sentences, this does not sound like enough evidence for me to support this theory. Do you know of any reputable sources that have investigated this issue? I voted for Hillary, and I would do it again, but that doesn&#39;t mean I trust her intentions and actions. I&#39;d really like to become better informed about the HRC/JFKj connection. </p>

<p>Aside from motive, is there any other evidence? I mean, every politician running for a seat has the motivation to kill their rival. What makes this case more solid than pure speculation?</p>
