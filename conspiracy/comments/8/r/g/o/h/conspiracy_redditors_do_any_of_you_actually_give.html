    <div class="md"><p>David Icke is often ridiculed as the most outlandish of the conspiracy theorists. Shape shifting inter dimensional reptilians controling a global empire, no wonder they laugh. </p>

<p>OK, I&#39;ll admit it, I think his books are great. It will at least get you thinking. Who cares if he&#39;s totally right. He tells a hell of a story.</p>

<p>He also has a very spititual bent to his approach. He went down to the Amazon and did the very psychedelic ayahuasca tea. Big plus as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

<p>At the risk of being ridiculed myself, I don&#39;t mind saying David Icke is one of my favorites. Don&#39;t listen to what others say about him or his theories. Pick up one of his books. Decide for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His spiritual experience are mostly derived from his experiences with Ayahuasca. So I would look at that a little differently that a typical Christian sort of believer. But that&#39;s up to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can try, but probably no one will listen. I remember when Kerry and Bush were running for president and no one thought it was a problem that both were Skull n Bones. Because no on understands what Skull n Bones is. Tim Russert was the only one to ask the question and both guys laughed and said they couldn&#39;t talk about it because it was secret. And Russert just went on to the next softball question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point. He was the only one to even ask about it. When they laughed him off, he quickly moved on. But you&#39;re right. It wasn&#39;t long after words he was suddenly gone. And I thought I was a hopeless conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>Many of the posts make very good points about some of the seemingly crazy aspects of the David Icke story. And I have to admit I understand and I agree that we all need to be skeptical. Maybe he is nuts and maybe he is another disinformation agent. But I do think there is some substance to his material. I never looked at the 6:00 news in the same way after reading a David Icke book. And when I see Council on Foreign Relations, I know when and how they started and who was behind their creation. So I guess I don&#39;t care if he&#39;s wacky or wrong about some things. I think his material is worthy of consideration with a critical eye and that&#39;s enough for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a really, really big difference between someone being part of a fraternity with links to the elite and someone being a hybrid of humans and extraterrestrial lizards controlled by a &quot;Luciferous Consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>If you do try to make a good case for this, you are correct in saying that no one will listen, with good reason.  It is one thing to stress spirituality and to suggest that there are controlling forces which shape world events.  It is another entirely to promote beliefs which read like a bad sci-fi novel (or &quot;V&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, all I can say is to check out his material first hand. Don&#39;t rely on the interpertations of others. Skull n bones is much more than a fraternity, but don&#39;t take my word for that either. There is plenty of documentation if you look for it. Same with Project for New American Century. You can choose to just dismiss it or say I have not supplied sufficient evidence if you like. </p>

<p>But if you say &quot;If you do try to make a good case for this, you are correct in saying that no one will listen, with good reason&quot; then you have already made up your mind. Then there is no reason to look into it any futher.</p>

<p>But consider this, one mans terrorist is another man freedom fighter. The British considered the founding fathers as terrorists. If you are convinced David Icke is a nut then that&#39;s up to you. I would suggest reading one of his book if you want to understand what his position is. this is about much more than who he said he was 30 years ago. Look at the material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, not really questioning most of his illuminati stuff, that&#39;s all pretty standard.  Keep in mind that I am only basing my questions on quotes which Mr. Icke spoke at some point, not on any interpretations of others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read Truth Vibrations, and found it pretty interesting, but that was more of an autobiography than anything else.  </p>

<p>My cynicism regarding Icke isn&#39;t related to his views on the power of the media, etc.  I begin to question someone&#39;s sanity when they claim, &quot;&quot;I am a channel for the Christ spirit. The title was given to me very recently by the Godhead.&quot; </p>

<p>Within a few months of this he publicly declared he was the son of god.  </p>

<p>And the whole extraterrestrial lizard-people thing just completely throws me for a loop.</p>

<p>I just have a hard time taking anyone seriously who truly believes that stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly understand the resistance to some of his ideas. I&#39;ve read several of his books and listened to videos of him speaking, I never heard him declare he was a channel for the Christ spirit. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t really believe he said that. I would think he would say the Christ spirit is within us all. And that he declared he is the Son of God. You&#39;d have to show me that one too. There are alot of people who work very hard to discredit Icke. That sounds like disinformation. He would say we are all Sons of God, but never that he was exclusivly the son of God. That sounds like more disinformation and second hand stuff. With all due respect to you. I&#39;d have to see were he said thoes things before I&#39;d beleive he say it. You only have to listen to him speak to see he&#39;s not delusional. He may not be right about everything, but he&#39;s not nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just googled &quot;david icke declares himself the son of god&quot; I saw several blogs that said he said it, but no clips or articles of him saying that. I think it&#39;s a rumor of a rumor. He would say we are all sons of god. He would say we are all connected to infinity. He would say the concept of David Icke is an illusion. He would never say he is exclusivly the son of god. But if you can find the interview I would love to read it. I&#39;ve have been wrong before. I&#39;ve been wrong in the last 10 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I heard it. Well actually I heard him try to respond to a question about the statement. Which by the way he never got the chance to explain the statement. This reminds me of when John Lennon said the Beatles were more popular than Jesus. Same reaction. It really hits an a Christian taboo. I still think he was saying I am a son of god, not that he exclusivly is the son of god and you&#39;re not. I&#39;m sure if you asked him the question now, he would say we are all the sons of god. I think people latched on to the statment and used it to ridicule him. I havn&#39;t gotten through the entire video, but much of his material is being misrepresented. I just heard a lady say the 12 ft lizards are code for Jews. Total misrepresentation. Trying to paint him as anti semetic. In the first link with him being interviewed on Wagon show, he was trying to talk about The Project for a New American Centrury. The interviewer knew nothing about it and still refused to listen. He just wanted to drive the point home, David Icke is a nut. You can look up the PNAC. It was developed by all the guys who became the neocons while Clinton was in office. It completely outlines the Bush foreign policy years before it happened. It even talked about the need for a &quot;Pearl Harbor type event&quot; needing to occur for people to get onboard.</p>

<p>I think if you actually read his books and listen to him speak, insted of listening how other people misrepresent his material, you might get a different impression of what is being said. His book &quot;Infinite Love is the Only Truth&quot; outlines his &quot;spiritual&quot; views. There is nothing suggesting he thinks he is exclusivly The son of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when you call a press conference (in 1991) specifically to declare, &quot;I am a channel for the Christ spirit. The title was given to me very recently by the Godhead.&quot;, and then follow this up by declaring yourself the son of god on a talk show, people are probably going to find issues with your statement.  </p>

<p>Icke did provide explanations (although not for a few years) for those statements, and essentially said what you suggested he would.  That does not change what he initially said, however.</p>

<p>In terms of the supposed anti-semitism, I think that&#39;s just a side effect of his whole &quot;illuminati&quot; push.  In the early days of his craziness, he referred seriously to the &quot;protocols of the elders of zion,&quot; which has been very, very thoroughly debunked as propaganda.  He quickly stopped referring to that, but most illuminati conspiracy theories are pretty zionism heavy, so people automatically assume anti-semitism.  </p>

<p>In terms of the PNAC, I am very familiar with it, quite the interesting read, especially in how it correlates to the Bush policies.  </p>

<p>In terms of Icke&#39;s works, I&#39;ve read Truth Vibrations and generally found it to be a good read, although it was more of an autobiography framed in recent hallucinogenic spiritual experiences than anything else; he didn&#39;t really go full-crazy until after it was published.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t take issue with any of what Icke says on spirituality, and he doesn&#39;t say anything particularly unusual regarding the general idea of illuminati conspiracy.  What I take issue with is his whole extraterrestrial lizard thing.  Am I to understand that you think he makes a good case for Satanic extraterrestrial lizard hybrids controlling the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would say there are many things I don&#39;t really know the answer to. This certainly fits into that category. I prefer to say I don&#39;t know than to say definately yes or no to something. </p>

<p>I think his theories are interesting. It&#39;s very difficult to know if everything he says is exactly correct. I just think it&#39;s better to look at different possibilities than to dismiss them because someone else dosn&#39;t think it&#39;s possible. </p>

<p>You can take any conspiracy, like the Kennedy assination or UFOs. There are a lot of people who will dismiss anything other than the official story. They will ridicule anyone who even suggests another possibility. I&#39;m not saying believe every theoryor every story on UFOs. There are a lot of wild stories. Most are probably wrong. But should we say there can not be UFOs or intellegent on any planet? I don&#39;t like the idea of Reptilians controling things on Earth. But I wouldn&#39;t say it can&#39;t be true because I don&#39;t like the idea or because no one has suffieiently proved it to me. </p>

<p>It is ironic that many people who will just dismiss all conspiracy theories are also Christians who believe that story without question. I prefer not to believe anything with out question. I&#39;m comfortable with saying I don&#39;t now yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Israel/Rothschild connection is part of the public record, and is easily verifiable.  </p>

<p>Then from there it&#39;s pretty straightforward to look at the role Israel plays on the world&#39;s stage, and within our own government, and after you&#39;ve connected one or two dots, it&#39;s hard to not come to similar conclusions.</p>

<p>I assume you&#39;re probably talking about the alien reptiles though.  I haven&#39;t read his book on that subject, but I would be interested to read it to know why he would make such statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Israel connection is pretty standard Illuminati fare, but some of his other claims jump out at me, namely:</p>

<p>-His claims that he has been in contact with the spirit world.</p>

<p>-His claim in 1991 that he is &quot;...a channel for the Christ spirit. The title was given to me very recently by the Godhead.&quot;</p>

<p>-His claim in 1991 that he is &quot;the son of god,&quot; and that Britain would be beset by earthquakes and tidal waves that year.</p>

<p>-His claim that the world is ruled by extraterrestrial lizards from the constellation Draco, who have cross-bred with humans to create shape-shifting hybrids which hold positions of power in the world.</p>

<p>-His claim that &quot;A pyramidal structure of human beings has been created under the influence and design of the extraterrestrial Prison Warders and their overall master, the Luciferic Consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>I am just curious to see if people actually give credence to any of this and why; I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my first impression of David Icke was from years and years ago when I watched online a local news reporter (from Britain I believe) interview him. What seemed believable was his motives and the story of how he came to this occupation if you will. Since at the time he was barely making a living, yet he had packed up and left his previous career as a well-paid sports announcer. And as the others mentioned the very public connections of the ruling elite as David puts it is easily documented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://public.youtranscript.com/zs/880.html">Interesting interview</a> with Wogan, a host who was once the Letterman of Britain.  </p>

<p>When Icke initially went lala (back in the 80s?) Wogan interviewed him and made him a laughing stock.  The show I linked to was taken more recently, after the time when many of Icke&#39;s dire predictions had come to pass.  Hence Wogan has to eat a little humble pie.</p>

<p>No mention of lizards though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got this from a Guardian article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In January 1999, he wrote that &quot;between 2000 and 2002, the United States will suffer a major attack on a large city&quot;. In his 1990 paperback, Truth Vibrations, he declared: &quot;The years after the millennium will see gathering conflict all over the world to the point where the United Nations will be overwhelmed.&quot; And in the same book he predicted severe hurricanes around the Gulf of Mexico and New Orleans after 2000. &quot;People think I&#39;m some kind of prophet but I&#39;m not someone who gets my information from the ether,&quot; says Icke. &quot;I&#39;ve been given the coordinates about how things work.&quot;</p>

<p>Crazy guy... but it seems the crazies are becoming more accurate these days, especially if you look at the CTers who cover financial matters.</p>

<p>We can all throw out vague predictions, and eventually they will probably &quot;come true&quot; if we leave them vague enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US has been ripe for some kind of attack for many years.</p>

<p>The UN hasn&#39;t been overwhelmed yet.  </p>

<p>Hurricanes happen every year in the Gulf.  Severe ones happen every few years.  </p>

<p>A lot of what Nostradamus wrote has &quot;come true,&quot; because he was so vague and people interpret later events in the context of those predictions, so they fit. </p>

<p>Icke make a shotgun blast of vague predictions.  Some were bound to &quot;come true&quot; in the sense that we could fit an event into them.  What about all of his dire predictions which have not come to pass?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His research into secret societies and the anglo-american establishment is very solid. 95% of his material is agreement with other conspiracy researchers such as Alex Jones and Alan Watt.</p>

<p>His nature of consciousness stuff is interesting and is in agreement with other researchers such as Terrence McKenna and Timothy Leary.</p>

<p>The reptilian speculation is a little out there, but his evidence of snake and dragon symbolism in connection with the elite/priest class throughout history is very well researched. Noone can argue with the prevalence of snake and dragon symbolism throughout history, but we can definitely argue with his interpretation.</p>

<p>Anyone who has sat through a 6-hour David Icke lecture will agree that he is entirely sane and reasonable, and that his arguments are coherent and persuasive. </p>

<p>If you keep an open mind about the spiritual and extra-terrestrial aspects of his research, you&#39;ll find the rest of his conspiracy research to be very enlightening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Icke seems to me to have switched off his baloney detector, and hence his lectures are a tour-de-force of conspiracies and occultism without any critical appraisal or hedging. Fanciful connections are stated as facts. He seems oblivious to the fact that if you go around saying that George Bush is shapeshifting, human-alien hybrid, who thrives on drinking the blood of children killed in satanic ritual, then some lunatic might actually believe you and see it as a moral duty to rid the world of our alien overlords. </p>

<p>Because Icke is so uncritical, he has left himself open to persuasion by people with very hostile agendas towards certain groups. Hence, Icke accepts The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as legitimate, possibly because extreme right-wing groups saw him as a public figure with a wide audience and deluged him with propaganda.</p>

<p>What bothers me most about David Icke is the pure hypocrisy. He had an experience taking ayahuasca where he realised that &quot;Love is the only reality, everything else is illusion&quot;, and wrote a book with that title. Subsequently, however, I have seen Icke being extremely rude and insulting to people with genuine, honest, scholarly questions about his claims and acting in what I consider to be a singularly unloving way. This makes me much less inclined to lend him my ear.</p>
