       Being a good CT, I notice patterns and inconsistencies. It seems like something fishy is going on here with three gilded submissions on the front page today. They are political submissions.  Are we being manipulated?

       I see that sentiment a lot here, do you not think that can be exploited in a community like this? If people immediately write off or disbelieve anything that happens to be gilded, why couldn't someone with a few extra dollars just give gold to posts they want discredited?

       I hope that people have noticed that in the main/default subs gilding posts is used as a reward or even public beacon to award those who fit the mainstream agenda.

       Reddit admins probably via a bot is golding comments and posts all over the place so that the market awareness of this feature becomes saturated throughout the users and they will then in the future, reach for the gold without thinking.

       This reminds me of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8ml994/reddit_trained_users_to_click_on_ads_right_before/">
        this really interesting post
       </a>
       I saw here a few weeks ago. I was surprised it didn't really take off much because I had also been noticing way more gilded posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       right around the time the redesign was rolled out. I've since gone back to the old reddit design so I don't notice as much, but it definitely seems very intentional with the new layout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not long after that was posted, there was a question that hit
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       from
       <a href="/r/OutOfTheLoop">
        /r/OutOfTheLoop
       </a>
       asking about all the front page gildings and the official answer was that it was a promotional thing Jeff Goldblum was doing for an AMA or something. Okay, but that still doesn't explain why there were (and still are) noticeably more front page gilded posts than there were a month or two ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, in this community in particular, I think so many users here have expressed that they automatically distrust gilded posts that people have started gilding posts as a way to discredit them.

       If you check into my history about this very topic, you'll find I have been thoroughly been downvoted in the 2 digit range in order to show just how unpopular it is to think such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not consider reddit gold as a bad thing or a way to fuel to the beast.  You should know that as a reddit user in good standing, reddit gold is a thing from heaven and should be regarded as such regardless of your true feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so very much attached to this benevolent idea that they're willing to defend such an idea to the death even though their current reddit skills/experience are still in the 3 month period.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, consider OP's topic and ask what the benefit would be or even the message that would prevail.  That message being that reddit, the social manipulation capital of our internet is still manipulating you and at the very least, making money off you doing such things.

       Not sure, but reddit did go down for about a half hour at 1 PM today. All comments were locked but you could still click on sub Reddit’s and look at the thumbnails for all the posts. But commenting was strictly turned off for literally everything.Anybody got any idea what happened? Lots of big stories coming to light today, especially the broken heart story. Wondering if Reddit conveniently went down because of conversations being had in the comments that might’ve made certain powers that be nervous or what.

       OP got downvoted heavily at first and he wondered why he was getting downvoted I replied that it was because there was nothing to see here and got gilded for it

       reason I said that was because there is a lot of alts on this sub, always has been really for some reason

       Almost certain something fishy is going on lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at my comment history, I'm politically left leaning but on a thread discussing Hilary Clinton and me talking about how Hilary was heard laughing in a recording, twice, about a sex offender who raped a 12 year old girl. When I talked about this in the comment and called her out all of my comments have been downvoted to oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) People on here are really touchy and because I didn't know how US lawyers worked people have downvoted all my comments which seems very unfair to downvote someone for lacking knowledge of something and openly admitting that.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) People on here just presumed I was far-right politically and downvoted me to oblivion which again isn't the case I'm very liberal and politically left leaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       C) There's clear manipulation going on and anyone talking bad or negatively about Clinton's is downvoted to hell and clear vote manipulation is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd actually like to think it's the latter because if not then we have a very narrow minded and short sited community which normally isn't the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know but like you said, something doesn't smell right.

       If you get Reddit enhancement suite you can tag users. Start tagging people with a descriptor about the type of activity you've observed from them.

       It's always worth looking at a person's post history...
      </p>
      <p>
       If the chans are the factory of the Internet (ugly, industrial, raw, but where "Internet culture" gets made), then I suppose Reddit thinks of itself as the shop window.  People come here to buy "products" of information and take them to display in their own Internet houses (Facebook, Instagram etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Control of the narrative matters and the Internet scares the hell out of those that want to shape the product that emerges: it is, at times, chaotic, unpredictable, and even (gasp) occasionally democratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the shills on both sides (and bot commanders) are paid, some are zealots, some are misinformed.  But it's telling how all will try to steer discussion away from critical thinking and civilised debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real generals are not intersted in "red" vs "blue", of course.  It is about distraction, dilution, confusion and all the usual techniques to prevent people from waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suspect most of the users here in this sub, derailed as it has become, know all of this already.

       Look at the upvote percentage.  I feel like for a rather benign, apolitical, un-opinionated post, that is a pretty low percentage.

       Typically shit posts of no value get ignored, not downvoted.  This is certainly an interesting phenomenon.

       Desperate times, means desperate measures. Blatant and obvious /submit manipulations in order to come off as normal /sub behavior, but as of lately the freethinker subscribe has slowed down a bit, so now the tweaking of various ↑ ↓ topics escalate, and to come off as real, they are starting to throw in a little bit of gold, in order to mix it up to distract, herd mentality stuff.

       The gilded posts are 1. shitting on snopes (im sure most here would call it msm), 2. attacking trump's support for israel cuz israel is killing innocent people (posted here multiple times), and 3. a blockbuster revelation in an investigation alleging a real conspiracy regarding the President of the U.S.
      </p>

       A post about Israel and the Mueller investigation were gilded this month.

       The attack on snopes is pretty normal considering how much this sub attacks any mainstream media source.

       You can verify this yourself by sorting the conspiracy subreddit front page from "hot" (default for me) to "gilded".

       Feel like there's a massive brigade against this sub. Half the comments are agreeing with the official story and attacking anyone who dares disagree with the official narrative in a conspiracy sub.

       Post is Gilded and everyone is attacking OP asking where's the conspiracy.. And when you look up the people attacking OP, it's their first time posting to this sub.

       Further proof, back in the day a thread like this would've been upvoted.. Not downvoted.

       If you have been on reddit for more than a few years and dont realize it has been taken over, your either completely oblivious or dont care.

       This site is run by the Zionist control that grips the media and America in so many ways.  Once a site gets enough traction they have to move in to control dissent.  This place is so different than what it started out as and its because our overlords have gained control of the convo and what we can say.

       There should be a concern. I feel like there is a better place to discuss conspiracies than a sub on Reddit right? where anybody can look/post?
