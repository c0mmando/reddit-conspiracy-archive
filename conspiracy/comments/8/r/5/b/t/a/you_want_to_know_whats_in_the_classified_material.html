<p>The ramifications of that go far beyond anything being talked about. </p>

<p>Laugh all you want. Just remember, National Security equals Continuity of Government.</p>

<p>When pretty much the same thing happens with the Mueller investigation maybe you&#39;ll finally stop and think...maybe not.</p>

<p>Do you not think that a study/report of what might happen if Trump is impeached hasn&#39;t been done?</p>

<p>Do you not think that the same kind of study/report was done if Hillary Clinton was found guilty of gross negligence right before the election?</p>

<p>How could you not believe they didn&#39;t? In what world would they not decide that the security/stability of the nation was more important than its citizens knowing the actual truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still not clear on something...the OIG specifically states on their website that there is a difference between audits and investigations...I&#39;ve looked and looked, but I cannot get a did answer as to which this was...</p>

<p>In the header of the report released today...it says &quot;Review&quot;...so far, judging from Horowitz&#39;s terminology used in the past...he separates the words Review and Investigation as in this example...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, also rembmer, that on multiple occassions, Comey claims that he did what he did in Oct. 2016 because if he hadn&#39;t, and HRC had actually won the election, she would be &quot;illegitimate the moment she was elected&quot;.</p>

<p>Here:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Protecting the Legitimacy of a Clinton Presidency</li>
</ol>

<p>Comey told us that he was concerned about the perceived illegitimacy of a
Clinton presidency that would follow from a failure to make the October 28
disclosure. Comey stated:
I don’t remember thinking this explicitly, but I’m sure I was operating
in an environment where she was going to be the next president, and* I
was in a position to have her be an illegitimate president the moment
she was elected because I would have concealed a material
development in her investigation.* <strong>And the moment she took office,
the FBI is dead, the Department of Justice is dead and she’s dead as
president....</strong></p>

<p>FBI Attorney 1 expressed similar concerns to us, but said she did not express
them at the time. FBI Attorney 1 stated:
I also think it would have been detrimental.... I was careful not to
discuss this. But in my mind, it was detrimental...<em>if Secretary Clinton
was elected president, then...it would have come out. It would have
definitely come out that we had done the search warrant. And then,
then it would have been an illegitimate, like it would have been
grounds for, you know, you couldn’t have elected her. She was under
investigation. All of those sorts of things that would have...had more
of an impact if you didn’t say anything.</em></p>
