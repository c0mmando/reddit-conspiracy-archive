       And you'll be hearing this term "continuity of government" real soon...
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you do...remember this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember I told you what was in those classified sections of all those reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ramifications of that go far beyond anything being talked about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laugh all you want. Just remember, National Security equals Continuity of Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       When pretty much the same thing happens with the Mueller investigation maybe you'll finally stop and think...maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think that a study/report of what might happen if Trump is impeached hasn't been done?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think that the same kind of study/report was done if Hillary Clinton was found guilty of gross negligence right before the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       How could you not believe they didn't? In what world would they not decide that the security/stability of the nation was more important than its citizens knowing the actual truth?

Lol, it's a report, not a pregnancy test
Also there's seem pretty damaging stuff in there, if you actually read the executive summary (the recommendations are superfluous and not taken seriously by the DOJ). Not looking good for quite a few folks.

       I'm still not clear on something...the OIG specifically states on their website that there is a difference between audits and investigations...I've looked and looked, but I cannot get a did answer as to which this was...
      </p>
      <p>
       In the header of the report released today...it says "Review"...so far, judging from Horowitz's terminology used in the past...he separates the words Review and Investigation as in this example...

       OP, also rembmer, that on multiple occassions, Comey claims that he did what he did in Oct. 2016 because if he hadn't, and HRC had actually won the election, she would be "illegitimate the moment she was elected".
      </p>
      <p>
       Here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Protecting the Legitimacy of a Clinton Presidency
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Comey told us that he was concerned about the perceived illegitimacy of a
Clinton presidency that would follow from a failure to make the October 28
disclosure. Comey stated:
I don’t remember thinking this explicitly, but I’m sure I was operating
in an environment where she was going to be the next president, and* I
was in a position to have her be an illegitimate president the moment
she was elected because I would have concealed a material
development in her investigation.*
        <strong>
         And the moment she took office,
the FBI is dead, the Department of Justice is dead and she’s dead as
president....
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        FBI Attorney 1 expressed similar concerns to us, but said she did not express
them at the time. FBI Attorney 1 stated:
I also think it would have been detrimental.... I was careful not to
discuss this. But in my mind, it was detrimental...
        <em>
         if Secretary Clinton
was elected president, then...it would have come out. It would have
definitely come out that we had done the search warrant. And then,
then it would have been an illegitimate, like it would have been
grounds for, you know, you couldn’t have elected her. She was under
investigation. All of those sorts of things that would have...had more
of an impact if you didn’t say anything.
        </em>

       It is the responsibility of any diligent intelligence analyst to explore all potential outcomes. It's the only way best prepare for various scenarios. Risk assessment firms are paid exorbitant sums of money to do this constantly. To think there is no financial or power gain from anticipating the future is naive. Not a place for soothsayers, clerics or practitioners of superstition, but for general preparedness. Wouldn't that be a fun job.

       The Qpocaplyse was a bit underwhelming.  Apparently the new explanation is a super secret version that Trump has, and he can just decide to release it on his own, but he isn't releasing it for ... no reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion is that Trump is a key member of the deep state that Trump is fighting against.

       The Continuity of Government and it's relation to the Deep State runs back decades. It is a parallel Government that has little or no concern about who is or isn't in the White House. Public politics is just a circus; entertainment for a gullible public. It's not too difficult to follow the money and see the military/intelligence complex and the banks control the US (and the US empire controls the world).
