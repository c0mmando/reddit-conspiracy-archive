        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rule 13 states that a submission statement is required within twenty minutes of a post or a bot will remove it. In this example of a <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> brigade, a post was made without a submission statement and predictably the post was removed:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8ijzy2/bombshell_hillary_illegally_laundered_84_million">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8ijzy2/bombshell_hillary_illegally_laundered_84_million</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/NDvql">http://archive.is/NDvql</a></p>

<p>Notice anything off about this post? You can see the bot removed it for no submission statement and can check the public mod logs and see it was never approved. It was visable for only 20 minutes, yet it has 87 comments.</p>

<p>How can it have so many comments in such a short amount of time when it couldn&#39;t be seen by this community? This is how:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8ik4t7/cnncom_banned_but_conservativeteamtrumpxyz_is_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/8ik4t7/cnncom_banned_but_conservativeteamtrumpxyz_is_a/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/1f2w3">http://archive.is/1f2w3</a></p>

<p>This is clearly a brigade, which is against reddit&#39;s policy: </p>

<p><em>Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user&#39;s posts, posts from a domain, etc.</em></p>

<p>What can you do with an obvious brigade like this? Go to the admins? It looks like a mod here went to <a href="/r/ModSupport">/r/ModSupport</a> to find out:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/LQUtj">http://archive.is/LQUtj</a></p>

<p>Wow.. Not only did the admins not offer any real support, they removed the post..</p>

<p>Why would the admins do this? Dig a little deeper and you can find a sub called <a href="/r/PartyParrot">/r/PartyParrot</a>. What is this sub about? I have no idea but it has 90k subscribers and 120 mods.</p>

<p>Looking at the mod list, a <a href="/r/TopMindOfReddit">/r/TopMindOfReddit</a> mod, <a href="/u/siouxsie_siouxv2">/u/siouxsie_siouxv2</a>, is listed as the #3 mod there, along with Reddit&#39;s CEO, <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>, four other Reddit admins and power users like <a href="/u/gallowboob">/u/gallowboob</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of TMoR&#39;s mods, I think this gives some context to what they are about pertaining to this sub. This is a deleted comment from a <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> mod. Going back for years, his account was filled with statements about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> like this but a few days after he wiped all his comments, he deleted his account. He was added back as a mod under <a href="/u/Dr_ShillGood">/u/Dr_ShillGood</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I and my pals got started about 2 years ago now. We tried to help the /con goons, but to no avail. They seem to like things precisely how they are. As far as Queen Bee goes, that is of my own doing. They would have never branched off if I didn&#39;t supposedly &quot;go off the rails&quot; in participating here in this sub. I don&#39;t give a shit, my mission is far larger and more just than these feelgood cultists can even fathom.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going anywhere until various goals are met, and it has very little to do with my sub. They WILL be met, and my time investment will have payoff. I&#39;ll beat the shit out of people until 2030 if that&#39;s what it takes.</p>

<p>These easily led fools are incapable of thinking bigger, which is why I&#39;ll win. I&#39;ve always been ahead, they just didn&#39;t know it. For shame I say, because I/we gave them a chance. Now we play for blood, Johnny Ringo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democratic and Republican ideals do tend to shift magnetic poles every so often, though, it seems, ie Republicans once being the party of (most would consider) modern equivalent of liberalism, and vice versa. I think it&#39;s important to keep historical evolution of the parties in mind. The Democratic Party of today is peopled by significantly more left of center folks than the Democratic Party of 2008 and earlier. Boomers who voted Democrat and identified as Democrats their entire lives are now identifying more with Republicans because earlier Democratic ideals were more &quot;centrist&quot; than contemporary leftism. </p>

<p>My point here is that I think Party labels are relative to the times in which we live, and while it may be easy for younger people like millennials to identify clearly with current Democratic Party policies, it is probably harder for older generations to do so even if they considered themselves lifelong dems - not because they are curmudgeonly old people, but because it means something else now to be a Democrat than it did 40 years ago. </p>

<p>AssuredlyAThrowAway moderates (squats) far too many subs for me to consider normal behavior. Also helped shut down Pizzagate threads during its prime. Power grabber with a Jesuit education.</p>

<p>Flytape was a mod here, but tried pulling a coup on the rest of the mods. Bit of an asshole, but overt about his right leaning bias. Overall less troublesome than the other two.</p>

<p>Are you apologizing for some reason? Pretending like an obvious joke is a literal red penning of your spelling is a brilliant comeback.  Way to back up my statement and make it more clear than it already was.  If you desire a literal red penning then I must point out that your sentence structure is below average for someone who implicitly &quot;took enough English&quot;.</p>

<p>TMOR are the Lawrence O&#39;Donnell, Al Sharpton and Melissa Harris Perry&#39;s of Reddit and their only purpose is to degrade, insult and shame people who don&#39;t agree with their message.</p>

<p>To top it off the only way they can make any headway is to lie, cheat and steal the same way Debbie washerman Schultz did everything in her power to rig the primaries and election to no avail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are just shills for the people running the patriarchy, I’ll sound like a conspiracist since I’m pretty new to this bs but the truth is getting around and the people that want to keep us suppressed know.  If you are reading this and you haven’t prepped emergency readiness bags and seriously considered the idea that the problem could come to your doorstep at any moment than in my opinion you really must not be paying attention.
Its time for us to stop listening to what people tell us about our world and start figuring it out for ourselves. We are educated enough to read and ideally we should be reading older non republished text because they’ve been indoctrinating us for centuries with altered text that fits their agenda which is mostly suppression of the truth and male hierarchy which has quite clearly failed us miserably in results so far; as people of the earth experience widespread suffering everyday we have to start working together diplomatically on a global scale, all freethinkers do because they will try something and I know it. Right now ‘they’ (who the fuck knows who I’m really referring to in the long run) are scrambling really hard to keep a wrap on things and they are realizing they might not be able to stop the noise but whats a good way to distract us so they can mop of up some ‘messes’, earn them more money and weaken the global status quo for people. World War or even just war in general.
I know I’m thinking of the worst but I believe we really could stand to be more diplomatic about a shift in power to the people because if we aren’t it’ll just bring us more suffering. Good luck and peace be with you.</p>

<p>Used to be conspiracies were about asking questions. Was Lee Harvey Oswald alone? What&#39;s going on in Area 51? etc.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s more about asserting that you already know the truth because you&#39;re a super genius who can see the clues everyone else is missing, and you scorn anyone who dares ask you to apply even a modicum of fucking critical thinking to your assertion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about keeping you from asking about things like the VOP in Tucson or pizzagate. It&#39;s about seeing if you have answers to basic fucking questions, or if you just believe shit just to believe it.</p>

I have however seen that hillary LOVES pedos. I mean, ignoring that she is one, lets presume she&#39;s not. So as a completely sane and rational woman, why is she surrounded by that many pedophiles? It&#39;s quite a list of kiddy fucking friends she has. So, yeah, I don&#39;t like that pedo sympathiser, to put it mildly. I&#39;m interested to know why you think she seemingly loves all these pedos all around her though, genuinely. Any ideas? I mean, if it was 1, fair enough. But it aint. ITS A LOT.</p>

<p>&quot;Literal concentration camps&quot; You&#39;re comparing a holding cell to a genocidal death camp. I&#39;m not gonna resort to calling names, but fucking hell, man, c&#39;mon. Use your head for more than regurgitating the news you&#39;ve been fed.</p>

<p>Speaking of news, maybe the media is no longer allowed for how they use images completely out of context. And I thought politicians weren&#39;t pedos? Make up your mind. Oh wait. The politicians You don&#39;t like are the pedos! I get it. If you have any info on Pence, i&#39;d love to hear though. I hate all pedos, regardless of their immigration policy y&#39;see.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say your view of liberals vs fascists is clouding all judgement to have any sense of a rational conversation here. It&#39;s weird, but not rare or unique. A shame. You&#39;d think someone on conspiracy would see through such petty divides as libs vs fasc / white vs black, etc.</p>

<p>This is literally exactly what I&#39;m talking about. Earlier you claim that conspiracy theorists should be against all government, now you defend actual government-run child prisons that ban the public, the press, and democratically elected officials. You&#39;re totally fine with the Deep State if it other people are the ones threatened by it.</p>

<p>I think you need to read about what happened in concentration camps. Comparing holding cells to a genocidal death camp is fucking insane. Do they have gas chambers? Mass graves? Bodies burning 24/7? No, so drop the stupid fuckin comparison. </p>

<p>Again, no. I&#39;m ok with governments detaining people who enter any country illegally. As i&#39;m ok with governments detaining people who commit any crime. They call them prisons. They&#39;re global. You break the law, you go there. I&#39;m not defending every law, many are retarded, many get arrested for things they shouldn&#39;t, many go to prison for crimes they didn&#39;t commit. The system isn&#39;t perfect. But it works.

<p>Re: your question about TMOR vs. Conspiracy</p>

<p>from TheGhostOfDusty sent 4 hours ago</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am an ex-conspiracy moderator who quit in protest after months of trying to reason with my co-mods to not be biased, hyper-partisan hypocrites. Two other long-standing mods quit in disgust soon after I did. This left the Trumpaganda mods in full control of the subreddit starting in January 2017.</p>

<p>See my post history there: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Author%3Atheghostofdusty">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=Author%3Atheghostofdusty</a></p>

<p>I was banned about a month after leaving the mod team. I was not ever given a reason for the ban, just insults and animosity after politely asking for over a week why I was banned. Then the mods &quot;mute&quot; you so you can&#39;t use modmail again for 72 hours.</p>

<p>I was conspicuously banned soon after posting screenshots of the public mod log in threads, showing rogue mods in action undermining and ignoring the rules. At this point I felt fully justified, and obligated by a sense of duty, to let the community know that the mods were corrupt.</p>

<p>See: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5v16lz/rconspiracy_modmail_leak_and_collection_of_public/">https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5v16lz/rconspiracy_modmail_leak_and_collection_of_public/</a></p>

<p>To answer your question: TMoR began as an offshoot of the actual bigoted hate group <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a>. The mod team there (who went on to start the infamous <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> became too openly homophobic and toxic so everyone migrated to TMoR.</p>

<p>For the next couple of years they were just jerks mocking people they found weird. Then, beginning in late 2016, the Conspiracy mods started unjustly and routinely banning popular users who were critics of Trump and alt-right propaganda. The general population of TMoR quickly became dominated by rational and pissed off conspiracy theorists who were spitefully banned by the thin-skinned Trump zealot mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr - TMoR these days is a group of justifiably resentful conspiracy theorist who weren&#39;t stupid/gullible enough to unquestioningly believe alt-right defamation propaganda like &quot;pizzagate&quot; being dressed up as &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; and got banned by the mod team for not toeing the line.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, and please feel free to share this explanation in that stickied thread if you think it will help others grasp the current situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you guys have differences of opinions and nobody controls anyone else (and that&#39;s a good thing! I&#39;d be worried if you guys all agreed all the time), but is there any way you guys could have a discussion, or vote, about either allowing it all the time or banning it altogether?</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t care either way (though I do agree with you that it does seem to cause more bickering and getting off topic when it is allowed in threads), but this whole argument over whether it should be allowed, banned, or allowed to be unbanned sometimes is causing even <em>more</em> bickering.</p>

<p>Perhaps allow a community vote of some sort so there will be less bitching on either side about mods.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#39;d ask. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if TMOR <em>wait</em> for totes to be allowed on certain threads just so they can go to those threads and have a hissyfit about the mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people are gonna find things to bicker about no matter what but to me this is basically a non-issue and not worth wasting too much time on (at least in my opinion).  The overall stance is that totes is banned but if certain mods want to approve the comments in certain threads who am I to say they&#39;re wrong for doing so?  Doesn&#39;t seem like something that&#39;s worth having a huge, in-depth discussion about.  There are bigger fish to fry here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are trying. The problem is the only way to stop an account&#39;s vote counting is to ban them. The political shiteaters you see talking are quite literally the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of the votes coming in are likely from botnet accounts run by those same shiteater accounts that actually comment. These accounts will never speak, rendering them effectively invisible to us. And when we ban the control account, they just bring up one of their bots as a new control. Ad infinitum.</p>

<p>The best we can do is frustrate them. And I think we are starting to do a better job of that. But I think sometimes when they care a lot about a subject, they point the botnets they use regularly to control <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and just <em>blow</em> <em>us</em> <em>the</em> <em>fuck</em> <em>up</em>. We will never be able to defend that. But luckily when they <em>do</em> do that, it is blatantly obvious, and maybe with the exception of the external traffic generated from /all, it doesn&#39;t fool anyone.</p>

<p>Admins deny us the tools we need to identify these malignant accounts. Probably because those tools would include traffic statistics and user behavior metrics, which is where I think reddit actually makes their money. That&#39;s their real product, behavioural data. Plus the admins have made it pretty clear we are on our own. If something egregious happe ns, that doesn&#39;t involve TMOR or any of the other bot swarming hate subs, they will throw us a bone. But nothing that would actually improve our experience.</p>

<p>But, at least all this meta stuff is kinda interesting. And if you think about it, there are groups spending a great deal of money trying to ruin our day...and yet we continue to have our fun. </p>

<p>It was at that point that Assuredly and aleister were cool enough to step in.</p>

<p>Seriously though, I asked you four days ago which comment was a Rule 10 violation and when the ban would be lifted. </p>

<p>Though you did respond, you linked to a comment where I insulted a TMoR mod (not a violation of Rule 10) and conveniently ignored the part about when the ban would be lifted.</p>

<p>But anyway, like I said, I&#39;m sure it was an honest mistake.   I see you taking flak in here so I was really just giving you a sardonic (but friendly) poke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I see it now. Sorry man. First off, all my bans are permanent. I prefer to have happen exactly what happened. I ban, you complain, other mods review my decisio ...and it goes from there. Sometimes the baby gets thrown out with the bathwater. And you were the baby here, apologies.</p>

<p>Also, with abusive comments, I don&#39;t generally check context. They appear all by themselves in the mod queue. And I moderate based on that. I don&#39;t care if it was a tmor mod. I mean, I would crack on a tmor mod too, but I just have zero tolorance for abusive comments now. And you probably had the unfortunate luck of being at the tail end of me seeing dozens of other users being shitty at each other.</p>

<p>Glad it worked out, and I hope you understand. Outside of reddit my life was kind of turned upside down and I wasnt firing on all cylinders. I will try to be more conscientious in the future.</p>

<p>Peace</p>

<p>Imo the root cause is due to the indiscriminate use of bans by overzealous mods. If they could not permanently ban someone then there would be little need for a sub to link to threads. </p>

<p>Of course you would have very disruptive users but honesty they can be ignored or downvotes by users that are sensitive to their comments. The way it should be - no censorship except at the personal level. </p>

<p>Users are typically banned here because they harass and disparage conspiracy believers, the main focus of the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fun activity is to dig through <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/topmindsofreddit">http://np.reddit.com/r/topmindsofreddit</a> and see what sort of topics they are attempting to &quot;debate&quot; (i.e., ridicule and shameless shit all over) - then to go investigate those topics.  Where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire.</p>

<p>The list:</p>

<p>Vaccines
Space
Flat Earth
Secret Societies
Reddit / Media Corruption
Climate Change
Holocaust</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s how it was in years gone by.  Now even TMOR is mostly politically charged nonsense headlines about political celebs and &quot;story of the week&quot; drivel designed to distract and divide people - because reddit is so heavily saturated with this type of nonsense content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that it used to be usable as a way to trace propaganda efforts, but now the propaganda is so far removed from useful and actionable intelligence that it no longer serves that purpose.

<p>Secondly, and 99.9% of people reading this will be put off, but I am a actual legit FLAT EARTHER. Yes for over a year now I&#39;ve been researching the subject. It&#39;s truly fascinating how the biggest conspiracy there can be, that encompasses all other conspiracies, is not allowed to be talked about here. Not even a thing about it in &quot;Related Subreddits&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want a conspiracy about this sub google “reddit conspiracy” </p>

<p>Any other search “reddit ___” will get you the sub. Conspiracy is not in the results at all. I first noticed it after the election. (Clinton/ trump) and the Pizza stuff was blowing up. (I don t really believe it just saying it started late nov. / dec that year.) the sub moved down from the first result and Finland conspiracy replaced it which makes flat earth look like a good idea. Then as articles were written by press about the dangers of conspiracy theory. Those articles slowly replace the sub all together. Until today where it is buried at least 3 pages deep (I didn’t look any farther) in the results. I have no doubt that shills manipulate this site. But this is proof some one with more time should look into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this post a lot, usually analyses of TMoR here end up becoming absurd and suggesting TMoR are under orders from TPTB to destroy r/conspiracy because this sub is just too much of a threat to them.</p>

<p>The reality is much more mundane, they&#39;re just another meta sub that inevitably became a brigade sub. This is a huge problem, not just for us but for the whole of Reddit. And it&#39;s not just limited to meta subs.</p>

<p>The admins never do anything unless bad publicity is involved. r/StopAdvertising are employing a great tactic to force change from the admins, however brigading isn&#39;t a sexy issue we can wave in front of media outlets and advertisers, so we&#39;re sort of on our own. All we can do is pressure the admins when we have the opportunity and stay vigilant in the meantime.</p>

<p>This post detailed, factual and eye-opening, I wish I could upvote it twice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like it’s a way for banned folks to link to a discussion that they are interested in and continue a parallel discussion. That’s the idealistic reason. In reality it’s a rallying cry to disrupt. </p>

<p>Imo the root cause is due to the indiscriminate use of bans by overzealous mods. If they could not permanently ban someone then there would be little need for a sub to link to threads. </p>

<p>Of course you would have very disruptive users but honesty they can be ignored or downvotes by users that are sensitive to their comments. The way it should be - no censorship except at the personal level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the other article you posted, it is a small margin. When you have the Tucson thing popping up for days here non-stop, and a bunch of other related content, the skeptics of course are going to ask for more sufficient evidence than whatever people type in in the chans. I&#39;d say after the election, a large percentage of this sub was brigaded by r/The_Donald and later people from subs like r/greatawakening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are trying. The problem is the only way to stop an account&#39;s vote counting is to ban them. The political shiteaters you see talking are quite literally the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of the votes coming in are likely from botnet accounts run by those same shiteater accounts that actually comment. These accounts will never speak, rendering them effectively invisible to us. And when we ban the control account, they just bring up one of their bots as a new control. Ad infinitum.</p>

<p>The best we can do is frustrate them. And I think we are starting to do a better job of that. But I think sometimes when they care a lot about a subject, they point the botnets they use regularly to control <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and just <em>blow</em> <em>us</em> <em>the</em> <em>fuck</em> <em>up</em>. We will never be able to defend that. But luckily when they <em>do</em> do that, it is blatantly obvious, and maybe with the exception of the external traffic generated from /all, it doesn&#39;t fool anyone.</p>

<p>Admins deny us the tools we need to identify these malignant accounts. Probably because those tools would include traffic statistics and user behavior metrics, which is where I think reddit actually makes their money. That&#39;s their real product, behavioural data. Plus the admins have made it pretty clear we are on our own. If something egregious happe ns, that doesn&#39;t involve TMOR or any of the other bot swarming hate subs, they will throw us a bone. But nothing that would actually improve our experience.</p>

<p>But, at least all this meta stuff is kinda interesting. And if you think about it, there are groups spending a great deal of money trying to ruin our day...and yet we continue to have our fun. </p>

<p>So as a completely sane and rational woman, why is she surrounded by that many pedophiles? </p>

<p>Such as...?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Literal concentration camps&quot; You&#39;re comparing a holding cell to a genocidal death camp. I&#39;m not gonna resort to calling names, but fucking hell, man, c&#39;mon. Use your head for more than regurgitating the news you&#39;ve been fed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fits the definition bud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of news, maybe the media is no longer allowed for how they use images completely out of context. And I thought politicians weren&#39;t pedos? Make up your mind. Oh wait. The politicians You don&#39;t like are the pedos! I get it. If you have any info on Pence, i&#39;d love to hear though. I hate all pedos, regardless of their immigration policy y&#39;see.
I&#39;d say your view of liberals vs fascists is clouding all judgement to have any sense of a rational conversation here. It&#39;s weird, but not rare or unique. A shame. You&#39;d think someone on conspiracy would see through such petty divides as libs vs fasc / white vs black, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is literally exactly what I&#39;m talking about. Earlier you claim that conspiracy theorists should be against all government, now you defend actual government-run child prisons that ban the public, the press, and democratically elected officials. You&#39;re totally fine with the Deep State if it other people are the ones threatened by it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I see it now. Sorry man. First off, all my bans are permanent. I prefer to have happen exactly what happened. I ban, you complain, other mods review my decisio ...and it goes from there. Sometimes the baby gets thrown out with the bathwater. And you were the baby here, apologies.</p>

<p>Also, with abusive comments, I don&#39;t generally check context. They appear all by themselves in the mod queue. And I moderate based on that. I don&#39;t care if it was a tmor mod. I mean, I would crack on a tmor mod too, but I just have zero tolorance for abusive comments now. And you probably had the unfortunate luck of being at the tail end of me seeing dozens of other users being shitty at each other.</p>

<p>Glad it worked out, and I hope you understand. Outside of reddit my life was kind of turned upside down and I wasnt firing on all cylinders. I will try to be more conscientious in the future.</p>

<p>Peace</p>
