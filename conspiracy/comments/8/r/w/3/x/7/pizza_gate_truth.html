       Was "pizza gate" a false flag op run by the Trump administration in order to distract people from the truth that they were the real paedophiles? Is the Trump administration using immigration are a tool to separate children from there families because they are involved in an international child sex ring?

       I guess it's easier to believe in a child sex cult run out of the basement of a pizza parlor that doesn't have a basement since Hillary was supposedly involved than it is to believe that a government that would separate children from their mothers and put them behind cages because it's run by the billionaire totally not a globalist Donald Trump.

       And so is DJT and his people......could it be......brace for it......they are all the same? I think the biggest thing this community needs to agree on, is the elite are the elite. Just because one uses grey poupon, and the other eats big Mac’s, doesn’t mean they both don’t serve the same masters.

       You’re dead on, but the show must go on for most people still putting their faith in (D) / (R).  Frustrating as it is, we can’t drag them out of their partisan cave to see the sunrise.

       As far as your angle goes, I haven't heard that proposed yet, nor have I seen anything that would even remotely support it, so that's gonna be a no from me, dawg.

       The fact that people still don't think that Donald Trump is one of the globalist elites cracks me up. The United States government is separating children from their families. If any one thinks that that is OK in any way shape or form, they have serious problems. If it's supposedly Obamas fault, then Donald Trump could today sign an executive order stopping it. Or he could've done in the last year and a half. Do you think that he cares about these children? If he did he would've done something about it. Why not let the children stay with their mothers? Are these violent criminals who are fleeing their countries? Or are they just poor people trying to find a better life? Do they need to be separated from their babies? What kind of monster allows this to happen.

      <p>
       I don’t think anyone is using that to discredit the broader subject of elite trafficking rings entirely, I think they are using it to discredit the pizzagate theory very specifically, I know the pizzagate die bards have expanded the term to basically mean any an all elitist child trafficking activity, but they can’t pretend the term once meant a very very specific theory, and sometimes when people like OP use the term “pizzagate” they are referring to the one original theory and not the broader subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a skeptic calling out the flaws in the pizzagate theory doesn’t mean they don’t believe elitist trafficking rings don’t exist, it’s just saying that specific aspect of that specific theory doesn’t add up.....
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be like saying anyone who thinks a photo of a clear blue cloudless sky doesn’t show any signs or support of chem trails, must mean they don’t think chem trails exist at all..... no they never said that, they just think that one photo doesn’t prove anything.....

       When are you people going to just give up? Trump is the most popular president since Ronald Reagan, and he’s better than Reagan. Do you want to know why people love Trump? It’s becuase they believe him him when he says “America First.” And not just that, his actions speak even louder than his words. Economy up, joblessness down, ISIS vanquished, Russia is behaving, China is getting tariffs, NK is destroying nuclear facilities, and that’s just off the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just stop your mindless whinging already. It’s embarrassing for all of us.

       This post made me check to see if we are in the conspiracy sub, or the other sub that I have been permanently banned from. DJT is popular among his party, and is historically unpopular among the majority of the citizens. Either way, go rally on the other sub, that is not what we are here for.

       We know Clinton is. We have lots of circumstantial evidence, and plenty of speculation from whistleblowers over the years. Trump is probably somewhere involved. He was in the Lolita at one point

       Man I wish this were true.  Unfortunately I don't think anything is going to happen to any of these people.  Everyone's too damn corrupt in Washington and they all cover for one another.  At this point I believe the only way to fix it is for the people of America to forcibly take our country back.  We need to march on Washington by the millions and hang every corrupt politician in that town from a lamp post.

       I’m still pretty shocked when people still deny pizzagate, after seeing what was on alefantis’s Instagram the weird artwork, creepy bands that play their. Definitely not “kid friendly” I’ve seen to much to think it was all just a coincidence.

       Conversely, I'm still pretty shocked at how people can still argue pizzagate based on those same photos and bands. Just because it's not the art you enjoy doesn't inherently mean it's 'pedophilia based', no matter how many times one wants to claim otherwise.

       Grown men don’t have weird paintings of children in their home (children who are clearly unhappy) and if they do they’re extremely weird.   You can make as many excuses as you want but the art that the Podestas have is not normal whatsoever.   Doesn’t matter about taste or interpretation.  It’s just not right and they know it and comments like this is further helping them get away with it.

       Obama started keeping those kids at those make-shift walmart detention centers years ago. Tump kicked the whole thing into overdrive. Shit i bet they are not just sex trafficking; I bet they are harvesting organs and selling the remaining skin and meat to the slaughter house. The rich pedos need organs too...look at how long they live.

       Pizzagate was a result of raw data derived from the DNC and Podesta emails published by Wikileaks.  It matched FBI symbols and vocabulary used by pedophiles. It connected many ppl involved in very obvious collusion, to say the least. The fact it has been actively attacked from the highest levels of power is very suspicious. If it is false, what is there to hide?
