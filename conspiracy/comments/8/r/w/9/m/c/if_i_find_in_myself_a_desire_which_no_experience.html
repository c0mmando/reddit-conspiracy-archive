        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1670, Blaise Pascal published Pensées, which was a defense of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>In that book, he has a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself.” 
- Blaise Pascal, Pensées VII(425)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deep down inside of mankind we all feel this emptiness.  We all try and fill this emptiness in one way or another.  Some of us become believers in some type of religion (fanatic or not), some of us try and satisfy this emptiness with drugs or alcohol, some of us try with money and success.  The thing is, it&#39;s still there.  It always resurfaces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I openly admit that I have not found &#39;my purpose&#39; in life.</p>

<p>What amuses me is how few people around me can do the same.</p>

<p>Is it so hard to be honest with oneself? With others?</p>

<p>I once looked into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xny7p87_tH4">the theory that ancient history is fabricated</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, none of us have read books more than a couple hundred years old.</p>

<p>Sure, we all seem to believe with 100% certainty that &#39;ancient Greece&#39; was real.</p>

<p>Sure, there is an obvious disconnect between our confidence, and our evidence.</p>

<p>But ultimately, perhaps we need to believe silly stories to give us meaning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sentences 2 and 3 I&#39;ve wondered all of my life. It&#39;s as if nobody has any intellectual curiosity about themselves and how it fits into existence. They seem oblivious in the most natural sense. I guess &quot;natural&quot; is the best way to describe them.</p>

<p>Any time at a family reunion type thing, it&#39;s just a bunch of people asking each other &quot;so what are you doing (work) now?&quot; Work is the entire scope of existence to people. It&#39;s so empty. I have a hard time working and it&#39;s not because I&#39;m lazy, but because I see no enduring purpose to what I might be doing, however glamorous it may be or appear, it seems empty. It doesn&#39;t matter if your name is Einstein or not.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve concluded the search for meaning and prime truth is my purpose and that I will almost certainly be unsuccessful in my purpose before my time is up. I don&#39;t mean to sound arrogant, as I&#39;m part of humanity, but I feel like humanity in general is foolish and empty.</p>

<p>I have no concrete beliefs on God(s), religions, or what it all means or whether there&#39;s nothing out there, but I&#39;m surely open to anything. I also believe that religion is good for the 99.9% of the population out there who does not possess the same philosophical rigor as I do.</p>

<p>I feel like people who can build absolute beliefs on such speculative questions which require a lifetime(s) of observation, introspection, enduring wonder, and admission of unbearable ignorance are the epitome of ignorance. And I believe that especially of atheists. At least people who claim a religion can have a claim of faith.</p>

<p>I try to never confuse what I want to be true with what I suspect is true.</p>

<p>i think everyone in this thread should just learn meditation </p>

<p>at the very top, which started this line of thinking, u/Zap_Powerz says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the unbearableness of being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But your Beingness, or tapping into just Being, can uncover a myriad of treasures and spiritual faculties that can help us in existence.</p>

<p>When you go to sleep at night, and you let go of the B.S. of the day, of what tomorrow brings, of your identification with the body, the ego, etc, you look forward to it, and let go into the sleep experience.</p>

<p>What you are actually doing, is letting go and surrendering into the depths of &quot;Being&quot; but doing so in a manner of losing consciousness into Being.</p>

<p>In mediation, you are consciously awarenessing yourself into the depths of Being and mapping out the territory, settling in, getting to know your own depths, and I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>In fact, this why so many people have so many issues. There is a tendency in the West and the Digital age to be addicted to seeking and doing, but not enough letting go and just Being.</p>

<p>In Enlightenment traditions, consciously plunging into the depths of your being and heart is how Enlightenment eventually manifests</p>

I&#39;m obviously not saying you can turn on or turn off your emotions.</p>

<p>Seriously some of you pedantic folks really come out during the day and it has me irritated. See that emotion? Being irritated?

    <div class="md"><p>IMO</p>

<p>An information based, technological society leads to <strong>the suppression and destruction of the purest type of freedom there is, our spirituality and willful search for the meaning of life</strong>...an answer to the ultimate question - why am I here? It&#39;s a question we can&#39;t answer within our limited view of an unlimited reality; rather it is reality that proposes the question with a grin. We used to celebrate this, but now we deny it and make up scientific reasons for why it&#39;s an illness or a fantasy. We pretend like philosophy isn&#39;t as profound as physics. We act like hallucinations are a negative side effect. We don&#39;t consider dreams important at all. We suck down the science dogmas of angry, spiritually lackluster informational hand-me-downs like Dawkins and Tyson.</p>

<p>We become nihilists when that&#39;s like, the opposite of what we&#39;re here for dude. But who am I to say!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested in the dream world I really recommend you investigate it on your own. The reason being is that it&#39;s an extremely subjective experience and people tend to over-analyse dreams and try to bring some objectivity to it.</p>

<p>As well, there&#39;s nothing that will compare to actually being awake in the dream world.</p>

<p>Have you ever been able to lucid dream, which is the state of being consciously awake while our body remains asleep? If you haven&#39;t, I really recommend you practice towards making it a natural occurrence for you, so you start lucid dreaming more nights than not.</p>

<p>Once you start spending hours a week in the dream world, you can form your own opinion on what it all means. But even in the end you think its nothing more than dreaming, it&#39;s still a surreal experience and worth the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of different methods, but I&#39;d say the first step should be meditation. Once you have that down, look up a WILD guide, or Wake Induced Lucid Dream. </p>

<p>A WILD is when you wake up some time in the middle of your night&#39;s rest a specific amount of time after you first fall asleep. This specific amount of time is different for everyone, iirc mine was around 4.5-5 hours. Once you have your time, when you wake up then, you&#39;ll be waking out of your main block of REM sleep, which is when your dreams occur. Now this time when you go to fall asleep, relax your body as much as possible and get into a position that you won&#39;t move at all. Instead of normally falling asleep, begin to meditate while your body falls asleep. The goal is to do this to the point where your body is completely asleep and you&#39;re able to meditate yourself back into your dreams with your consciousness. </p>

<p>It might feel like it&#39;s taking an eternity to meditate beyond a certain point, or you might reach a point where you can&#39;t continue. That&#39;s normal with trying to lucid dream and it just means that try was a dud and you&#39;ll have to try again the next night.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re willing to put in the time and effort to learn, it&#39;s definitely worth it, but it isn&#39;t easy. I tried this method a few times and couldn&#39;t break through the sound barrier into the dream. It would build up and just go black for me. Good luck, and eating apples help make your dreams more vivid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep. astral projection and lucid dreaming satisfy this feeling for me.  </p>

<p>I get pretty depressed if i don&#39;t astral project and manifest reality with intention alone.  </p>

<p>That is what i think we are in this world to eventually learn how to do.  Turn earth into a thick lucid dream... </p>

<p>Some evidence of that...  I know this could be faked but I think humanity is headed in a direction most people will refuse to believe.  </p>

<p>Truth is this is a lucid dream, a very very thick and hard to control one.  Through mediation you can expand your awareness/electromagnetic energy field, and manipulate matter through conscious thought.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well when i astral project i feel myself separate from my body, i see myself in my bed, the room looks exactly the way i left it, there&#39;s no weird people i somehow know. the list goes on.  You can just tell it is not a lucid dream, you can fly and walk through walls and what not, but it is the same world as the physical.<br/>
Lucid dreams you kinda just &quot;wake up&quot; in whatever reality your consciousness is projecting at the moment and realize that your mind is creating everything and have control over it.</p>

<p>You can astral project from a lucid dream, or travel to different realities and conscious realms that have no resemblance to earth what so ever. 
Like 20 hour DMT trip lands that in reality last 1 hour.  </p>

<p>basically once your in the non physical, it is a matter of how well you can maintain and direct your focus, energy, and awareness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm interesting. I was asking because I never talked to somebody who claimed to do both.</p>

<p>Most people either lucid dream OR project. I thought maybe it&#39;s just people interpreting the same thing differently. Some call it dream, some think it&#39;s reality. Something like that. </p>

<p>Was only a thought I wanted to prove/ disprove for some time now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really sceptical about astral projection. Not in denial, just having trouble imagine this to be true and most people who claimed to ap didn&#39;t really help since most of them were not very prone for logical thinking so I couldn&#39;t take their word on anything serious.</p>

<p>How about you? xD </p>

<p>Just wondering if you&#39;d like to tell me how did you prove to yourself, that you are really ap&#39;ing/ seeing the real world as it is now and that it isn&#39;t just the best guess your brain can deliver about how that certain spot could look like atm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to do both naturally. I started out lucid dreaming as a young child. I just thought of it as the “real” dreaming (lucid) versus the “cloudy” dreaming (normal storyline dreaming). I think lucid dreaming and astral projection are connected abilities. Like, if someone can run run well, they can probably jump farther. Lucid dreaming is like running, and astroprojection is like jumping. Someone who can do one, should be able to do both.  But I’ve never much tried to do either, it just happened. Starting in my early teens, I had sleep paralysis episodes, and that’s also connected. I learned to escape the sleep paralysis, and found I could have a clear choice between waking up, or going into a lucid dream, or astral projecting. But I learned all of this independently, and I later found out that it was something other people did, and what their words for it were. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know one can use sleep paralysis as a trigger to become lucid.
I suffered from sp for few years, only had few real lucid dreams and never managed to use sp as ld trigger, but at least I managed to get rid of sp.</p>

<p>But ld and sp are rather lame psychological phenomena for me compared to what astral projection/ remote alledgedly is.
Would you like to answer to what I asked hylozics before?</p>

<p>&quot;how did you prove to yourself, that you are really ap&#39;ing/ seeing the real world as it is now and that it isn&#39;t just the best guess your brain can deliver about how that certain spot could look like atm?&quot;</p>

<p>Or am I getting this wrong? You do claim you can see the REAL world as it really is, no dream version of it, right? Or is that still a difference between remote viewing and astral projection?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not educated so much in the remote viewing, certainly not formally. Initially, I have done none of this deliberately, not the way some other people do. If I allow myself to sleep in a certain way it just happens. Mostly returns if I quit drinking alcohol, caffine, smoking pot, watching TV, playing screen games (of which I include redditing) or anything else that disturbs my sleep cycle. </p>

<p>I do not have proof that astral projection is seeing the world as it really is, but I’ve also never seeked such proof. I do not generally seek out astral projection because hanging around at my house, while not being able to do anything, has never been very interesting. It makes me wake up and start doing things. As in I see the dishes in the sink and the dust on the sill so I wake up so I can clean. I imagine such a test could be done, but you would need a couple people to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah dude, I mean, I do believe you, but It&#39;s hard for me to imagine, that you never got curious if you got some real superpowers or only advanced dreaming skills.</p>

<p>I mean the one thing would imply a world of never thought possibilitys, the other thing not so much.</p>

<p>I remember the second thing I did when I was luzid for the first time was testing If I get real information from where I am.</p>

<p>I was in a place I didn&#39;t know. A room with a window and outside the window was a city. I flew out the window and as soon as I saw a bus stop, my first thought was to have a look what is the name of that busstop and which busline drives here, so I could later when I&#39;m awake check if that combination of bus line and bus stop exists in reality. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t work though. When I was trying to read anything the letters would just start moving and mixing. same for when I tried to look at the licenceplate of a car for similar reasons.</p>

<p>I figured it&#39;s just luzid DREAMING and nothing more. My brain couldn&#39;t give me informations I couldn&#39;t naturally recieve.</p>

<p>All you&#39;d have to do, to test would be asking somebody to draw some picture you don&#39;t see and place it somewhere in front of your house and then ask you project there and tell what you saw later...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there have been a couple astral projections where I project and look for objects in my room that i normally wouldn&#39;t have seen.  Then I will wake up immediately and see if they are in those spots.  A couple of times they have been in the right spot which was a ton of confirmation for me.  I know it&#39;s not complete absolute proof but it is pretty close in my opinion.  </p>

<p>One time i astral projected, my goal was to heal my knee injury.  When i got out of body i looked around the room to make sure it was real, i saw my sleeping body in my bed and i blasted my injured knee with a ton of energy. It felt like my leg was being electrocuted and i stopped when it got to the point where it hurt.  I continued my projection, and eventually woke up.  My knee was completely fine, before i healed it it was hard to walk on and constantly painful.  This was definitely proof that it was real to me.  </p>

<p>About the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection:</p>

<p>There is so much to learn still and experiment with I don&#39;t want to come off as saying I&#39;m 100&amp;#37; correct.  But i think the difference is a level of conscious awareness you can maintain.  </p>

<p>During a lucid dream you start out unconscious and eventually notice something out of the ordinary that doesn&#39;t fit right and say &quot;hey im dreaming.&quot;.  From before that point you have been unconsciously wandering through a reality you have no idea how you got into.   Somehow your consciousness created this reality or somehow jumped into it and now you get to explore it as a being who has mastered that density of reality already.  </p>

<p>During an astral projection you stay conscious while your physical body is falling asleep.  You are 100&amp;#37; consciously aware of your soul/astralbody/consciousness  (whatever it is, might actually be accessing different areas/levels of non your physical self)  separating from your body and remain conscious the entire time.   This keeps your mind from losing focus and manifesting things that aren&#39;t there in physical reality.  </p>

<p>I posted this in the astral projection forum a while back, but this is an amazing interview i happen to agree with just about everything he says.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-9sA4Phs20">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-9sA4Phs20</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah it probably could.  I think most dis eases happen on the spiritual level first, then the physical, like when you build something.  You think of it and picture it before you build it.  </p>

<p>I think the subconscious is doing this in a lot of cases with physical problems.  </p>

<p>So yeah astrally blasting it with energy should work if you do it right i guess...</p>

<p>What you can do for arthritis is drink distilled water though, it is negatively charged so it eats away at the calcium deposits which cause arthritis.   Do some research and come to your own conclusions, but i have been drinking distilled water for years now, i rarely get sick, and i have noticed my two arthritic fingers feel 100 x better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some verried experiences and I wonder what you think of it.  Lucidness in the dream is something I usually experience from the very beginning of the dream. Sometimes there is a previous dream that I will be able to remember having, while interacting with at least some degree of lucidly in a new dream.  Trying to think too much about the previous dream can cause me wake up. I can also enter lucid dreaming from sleep paralysis, or directly as I fall asleep. Although, I think I do i go through a mild/deliberate sleep paralysis stage on the way to dreamland. I’ve been lucid in dreams and then fallen back into regular dreaming, or dreamless sleep, with a transition that is just blackness and no body, no sound, no sensations, just void. </p>

<p>I’ve woken up from dreaming to rise and look down at myself sleeping. The first time this happened to me, I kept trying to wake myself up and was very frustrated because I thought I was late for school. I kept trying to shake my body, but then I would just end up back in it, and end up standing back up out of it. I kept trying to get dressed, but I couldn’t affect anything physically, not the way I could in lucid dreams that I’ve been having most my life.  I could not open doors, though I eventually did get outside, but then everything got very dark. Probably because it was night and cloudy there were no lights outside. To dream totally stressed me out, after I’ve been trying to wake up from it at least a dozen times, going as far as to slap myself. Of course I’d never heard of astral projection or lucid dreaming at this point in my life, I had just been lusid dreaming and had sleep paralysis for most of it. So this was some new terrifying thing to me that is both boring, and seem like a trap. I got frustrated and started to cry. That snaped some kind of a bubble and let me actually wake up. I felt very groggy when I woke, it was early morning, and I had to wait for other people to wake up to see if I had returned to base reality or not. I really wasn’t certain. I found the experience very confusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely some interesting experiences.  </p>

<p>I can see how thinking of a previous dream inside a dream can cause you to wake up.  This is probably because to remain in the lucid dream you have to be fully present and conscious and thinking of another dream probably caused you to lose awareness.  </p>

<p>Sometimes when i mediate i end up in the void.  It&#39;s like 3d blackness you are just peacefully floating in.  In Monroes Institute it is known as Focus 11 I believe.  You might find this link very interesting.  It describes the different levels of focus we are experiencing in the conscious continuum.  This dude Frank Kepple was an amazing psychonaut and wrote a lot of what he experienced into this forum a long time ago.  <a href="http://www.astralpulse.com/frankkepple.html">http://www.astralpulse.com/frankkepple.html</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a very similar experience as the last one you describe but i had purposely astral projected and couldn&#39;t make it back.  I had like 15 false awakenings.  I got super frustrated because I thought I was late to go snowboarding.  </p>

<p>I kept waking up into what i thought was real life but definitely wasn&#39;t, then something crazy would happen and i would realize it was a dream and try to wake up.  </p>

<p>I think my problem was i was too anxious to be back in my body and I wasn&#39;t really back yet.  I guess i was &quot;waking up&quot; before actually settling back into my body.  </p>

<p>Most of the time i&#39;ll do that on purpose though.  When i astral project if i find myself sucked back to my body i will make sure not to move my body and just pop out again into another projection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That first video is hilarious, dude just makes whooshing noises as the wind picks up.</p>

<p>Anyways I understand what you&#39;re getting at, I lucid dream lots and you definitely feel like you should be able to have the same control in the waking world as the dreaming world. But we don&#39;t. There isn&#39;t even the slightest proof consciousness can alter anything on a macro scale.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think there is some form of progression, that if you got 10 million people to focus their intent on moving a pebble a nano-meter you&#39;d be successful. But you never see any of the &quot;mass focused intent&quot; things work. However people will still point to the double-slit experiment as a basis to prove consciousness interacts with matter, and they&#39;re not entirely wrong.</p>

<p>So what is it all really? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Honestly the biggest thing I&#39;ve learned from lucid dreaming is to not covet the physical. Once you spend hours and hours in dreams doing whatever the hell you want (with the physical), it eventually gets boring. Yeah for the first while it&#39;s awesome having whatever you want at your finger tips, but it&#39;s a novelty that wears off. Really what you end up going back for is that euphoric feeling of belonging, the interaction with &#39;other people&#39; (whatever you believe dream characters to be), and overall just learning more about everything.</p>

<p>So I just take that back to the physical life here and apply that. You realise your desire for physical items is just a novelty, and what really keeps you happy is a sense of belonging and love from others.</p>

<p>But to completely dismiss the physical is absurd too. We are here in it, and we have to work with it. I think for whatever reason we are in this physical world, we were meant to be here and to be a slave to it. Kind of like a lesson of how the physical takes up so much of our attention and in the end its completely pointless.</p>

<p>Anyways this is too long already, but just my view of things. You just see how easy life could be if it were like a lucid dream, and the only differences is the lack of the physical, as well as the lack of other consciousnesses in your dreams. It&#39;s that latter part that really makes me think about this still.</p>

there are a lot of others who are learning as we speak.
second, i see lucid dreaming and astral projection and dreams in general as a nightly death. A place where we are gods.  On earth we have a safe zone, our physical body, where we can come back to anytime we get too afraid of the conscious realms we can explore.  A place where we can easily exchange and remember ideas to convey to other psychonauts.  </p>

<p>I understand what you mean our purpose is to be a slave here in the physical.  I used to think that too. But i honestly think we are living an a very very good illusion. The best scientists in the world have said the world is an illusiuon. It is  a denser illusion than dream/astral that our consciousness has to train itself to manipulate.   I think some of us may have come here to show others that your purpose is not to be a slave, but to break humanity out of that mentality and wake them up to the realization that they are literal gods.  </p>

<p>I also think training for astral projection, telekinesis, and telepathy are far from boring and are very rewarding when you see proof of it happening and you are the one doing it.<br/>
yes i agree life would be easy if it were more similar to a lucid dream, but it&#39;s the path we take to that destination that makes it exciting.  There is another world with all new physics waiting for us when once we can control this reality.</p>

<p>Also lacking the physical is the wrong state of mind.  What you are doing is gaining more access and awareness to the physical. You literally feel (and smell and taste) more of the world and people.  </p>

<p>Also i think the people in my dreams are real (maybe some are dreaming humans) but are less advanced/powerful consciousnesses on the same journey we are on.  They are just a different level in the video game.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve gone from hovering to flying. When I was a little kid, I flew from jumping out of windows, or off of buildings or trees or clifs.  I got older and worried that maybe I would confuse reality for dream, and looked for other ways to fly. Hovering eventually worked up into  flying. Jumping did not. Sometimes I just start out in bird form in the air. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah you are pretty much lucid dreaming.   You just have to consciously know that your physical body is asleep and you have complete control over everything in your dream because your consciousness is projecting that reality.  </p>

<p>next time your flying or making fire ask yourself, is this a dream?  You will notice it is and you will have more control.  The key is to abolish your beliefs that you can&#39;t fly or do whatever you want.   </p>

<p>Even when you are completely lucid and know 100&amp;#37; that you are dreaming it takes a little warming up (trusting your mind and abolishing the beliefs that are holding you back) to be able to fly really fast.  </p>

<p>I usually start by just hovering off the ground, then slowly i will pinpoint the spots in my consciousness that are holding me back and let them go.  Sometimes it helps to imagine jets under your feet propelling your faster or that you are in a current of water that is controlled by your mind.  Sometimes i&#39;ll need an object in the dream that i can put my belief into that will help me fly.  </p>

<p>You have to give your mind &quot;mental permission slips&quot; to allow it to overcome physics sometimes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all feel that from time to time, some more than others. I would suggest nothing is easy, life is a pain in the butts, you get out what you give (somehow somewhere.. maybe), keep pushing, try new things, get some new clothes, new hair cut, grow a beard.... shave you beard, shave your balls, get a sun tan, pay up to visit a pool, get a pool membership, drink... drink less..., try new food, take some vitamins...do something different.</p>

<p>One thing you (or anyone) does not want to do is join up someone, anyone, any club, cult or religion which promises they will fill your emptiness.  I guarantee that is scam. Many people who have felt empty and searched found... well... you know the deal.</p>

<p>Nothing that is worthwhile in the long comes easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the vast majority of ppl are distracted and consumed with the business and busyness of surviving.  Who has the resources to find “no experience can satisfy” a vague “desire?”  Well, there is King Solomon, who wrote Ecclesiastes. And yet his paradigm included God, even though he pointedly discussed all his musings as related to “under the sun” —in this world (as opposed to something else?)  </p>

<p>But for those that reach this place of questioning our existence, it seems more driven by adversity, injustice and the incongruity of death.  It seems such a grievous thing death is part of our world. Maybe it is bec we were created to be eternal, so death is a major shock to our psyche.  Our souls also react with indignation at evil we witness and experience.  Maybe these instinctual distresses do flow from being created in God’s image and having acquired a deadly knowledge of evil. </p>

<p>However, these thoughts are only part of the reasoning that infers God’s existence is more than probable.  There are scriptures full of history, prophecies, scientific allusions (not a science text), miracles (including the resurrection of Jesus), and otherwise unexplainable circumstances. You seem to think ppl who choose to believe God do so blindly, out of weakness. You are wrong in that conclusion. </p>

<p>That was my first thought after looking at the title. It sounds like one of those sponsorship messages from Welcome to Nightvale. </p>

<p>In all seriousness though, I&#39;m at peace with hunger. I eat some food, and then I&#39;m feeling pretty good. If I eat the same things I get bored, so I seek out some variety. I keep trying new things. I experiment. I try to eat things that are good for me. Sometimes I eat things that I later regret. This goes on until I die. I don&#39;t whine about all of the past meals not filling me up forever. Purpose and fulfillment are the same. Everything that promises to make you happy forever is a lie. We find satisfaction in growing to overcome challenges, and then we seek out new challenges. I embrace that that eternal dissatisfaction is there to drive us to do ever more with our lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That first video is hilarious, dude just makes whooshing noises as the wind picks up.</p>

<p>Anyways I understand what you&#39;re getting at, I lucid dream lots and you definitely feel like you should be able to have the same control in the waking world as the dreaming world. But we don&#39;t. There isn&#39;t even the slightest proof consciousness can alter anything on a macro scale.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think there is some form of progression, that if you got 10 million people to focus their intent on moving a pebble a nano-meter you&#39;d be successful. But you never see any of the &quot;mass focused intent&quot; things work. However people will still point to the double-slit experiment as a basis to prove consciousness interacts with matter, and they&#39;re not entirely wrong.</p>

<p>So what is it all really? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Honestly the biggest thing I&#39;ve learned from lucid dreaming is to not covet the physical. Once you spend hours and hours in dreams doing whatever the hell you want (with the physical), it eventually gets boring. Yeah for the first while it&#39;s awesome having whatever you want at your finger tips, but it&#39;s a novelty that wears off. Really what you end up going back for is that euphoric feeling of belonging, the interaction with &#39;other people&#39; (whatever you believe dream characters to be), and overall just learning more about everything.</p>

<p>So I just take that back to the physical life here and apply that. You realise your desire for physical items is just a novelty, and what really keeps you happy is a sense of belonging and love from others.</p>

<p>But to completely dismiss the physical is absurd too. We are here in it, and we have to work with it. I think for whatever reason we are in this physical world, we were meant to be here and to be a slave to it. Kind of like a lesson of how the physical takes up so much of our attention and in the end its completely pointless.</p>

<p>Anyways this is too long already, but just my view of things. You just see how easy life could be if it were like a lucid dream, and the only differences is the lack of the physical, as well as the lack of other consciousnesses in your dreams. It&#39;s that latter part that really makes me think about this still.</p>
