       My siblings &amp; i grew up in poverty.  So did my mother.  My fathers family wasnt wealthy but my grandfather became an electrician after WW2 so they were not exactly poor.  College degrees can help get you better jobs than those that dont have them.  But i have met many very financially successful people that dont have them.  Financial success is largely determined by desire, effort, and home much you are willing to risk.  My sister is now a millionaire.  I am not but i’m not in poverty anymore either.  You can be a financially successful drug dealer if you are willing to take the risk - i am happy with what i have with the work i’ve pit in to get here... i am not willing to give up all of my free time as my sister did to obtain her wealth.  Anyone can do it but if you think someone is going to hand you 50K a year just for having a college degree in the field of your study the majority of you will end up greatly disappointed.  This isnt the governments fault either.  You have to fight for whatever it is you want &amp; believe you can do it.

       I'm a programmer. I studied Management Information Systems, which is all about relational databases and how they work. I chose to take some application development classes as my electives and learned a couple programming languages. I put the projects from those classes on my resume and had a really solid interview at my company. I make 60k, and I enjoy what I do wholeheartedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this after bouncing around from major to major for 3 years. It took a little bit of research. I wanted to know what I was interested in and what I could accomplish within 2 years. I wasn't going to spend more than 5 years in school. With that criteria, I chose the one that i was most interested and made a lot of money and took it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I left with 63,000 in student loans, but after about a year, I've paid off 13k of it. I could've paid off more, but there were too many impulse purchases. There are high paying jobs out there. You just can't expect to immediately get them with an art or marketing degree.

       Your degree taught you a valuable skill.  You worked hard to learn the skill.  There are many people that are not willing to put in the effort that is required to learn your skill.  Programming isnt easy &amp; not everyone is gifted with the genetic makeup you have that allowed you to learn how to do it.  If it were easy then everyone would do it &amp; you wouldnt be making as much.  Many are not willing to take on the obstacles you encountered to get where you are.  Congrats!

       I was talking about myself when i wrote that.  I went to college initially because i wanted to be a programmer.  I took a full year of C++.  I didnt learn shit from my professors.  I spent that year studying with my peers outside of class.  I would write code &amp; put it through the compiler &amp; it wouldnt do what it was supposed to do.  My peers would look at the code &amp; tell me it should work as they couldnt find any mistakes.  They recommended i go to my professors with it.  I did &amp; the response i got was “i dont know where you’ve made a mistake but if its not working after you put it in the compiler i cant pass your for this”. This didnt happen every time but frequently enough that i gave up on that degree.  It’s my fault i gave up.  I dont make as much as you do now but i’m still ok.  It’s not your fault i make less than you.  You deserve everything you got because you stuck with it.  I dont believe a utopia where we are all making 6 figures is possible.  We would have already made it happen if it was.

       Mine didn't. Not it's fault though, I didn't like the field I studied. I went on to many different jobs and am currently an inventory analyst for a health care provider. I am a broke husband with about 10k in debt and 2 step kids and a wife. I'm mostly happy, except for living check to check now.

       Yes, but it was a short honeymoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly the fact that I was lied to about some training that was required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I regret it? Absolutely, but it has been 21 years (that's the depressing part, I could have retired this year). But had I stuck with it, I wouldn't be who I am, made the friends, met the wife and hundreds of other things I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've learned that  I am who I am and I'm not easy to be around sometimes. But I can always make you laugh when you're down, smile when you're ready to smack me and I'll be there when you need me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a lot left in me and a lot left to do with myself.  Follow your dreams when you can, do what makes you happy. And for your sanity, try to live with in your means (I'm working on fixing this part of my life).

       There is most definitely a conspiracy by the professors who are there to guide you.  If they dont keep misleading people they dont have their tenure &amp; jobs.  They are doing this out of greed while hurting others.  Someone from scotland said they go to college for free... so why do we have to go imto debt for the same knowledge?

       I have my bachelors in criminal justice and never had a problem getting a job in my field, UNTIL 2 years ago when I got a misdemeanor 3 and it was like a death sentence. National honor society, bachelors degree all trumped becuase of a stupid mistake

       A degree provides you a better opportunity of obtaining a job in your field of study.  It doesnt matter what job you get - maintaining it once you get it is the hard part.  Sorry that happened to you.

       Yeah I agree. And it def. Opens up a lot more opportunities. It's all over the place though. Multiple friends of mine that literally did nothing in highschool and didn't go to college are making 35 dollars an hr at sam Adams brewery. I was a crisis counselor for the county i live in in PA and got a whopping 13.50 an hr... and being a crisis counselor in a county destroyed by opiates is one of the most demanding jobs anyone can have and got paid shit

       I had a friend that got her masters in social work from Columbia.  In nyc she got decent pay but cost of living in NYC made that not mean shit.  She moved back to the southeast &amp; doesnt make as much but shit is cheaper.  Very challenging field.  She sees really fucked up shit the jobs just dont have really high pay.

       Exactly. I ducked up to doing criminal justice. I always wanted to be a state trooper and make it a career but life happened and average pay I made with different jobs in social work is about 15. 12 being lowest 18.50 being highest. And I see all these other jobs people making 40 an hr barely doing anything and get a little jealous haha

       I fucking get it dude.  My sister got a degree in criminal justice.  She made $70k her first year out of college refinancing mortgages.  She did that for a few years then grew to hate it &amp; quit &amp; went to law school.  Now shes an attorney.  Lawyers have completely saturated the field &amp; now there are ppl she went to law school with that couldnt find a job &amp; are now real estate agents.  This shit can definitely be frustrating but i know you can recover from this.  Probably going to have to bust your ass to make it happen though. It seems easier for others but i’m not sure it really is.

       And you know what's even more frustrating. I have no problem getting interviews and then do really well at them and then even get an offer but for some reason then they decide to run the backround and them they get turned off. All I have is a damn misdemeanor 3 from college like att haha.

       Dude, you should try having a felony.  I've got one from twenty years ago and I went back to college, got my shit in order.  I've now got 3 degrees in computer science and have been doing residential construction for almost 2 years now.  It's horrible.  I can't tell you how frustrated I am.  In the last 4 months I've put in 187 resumes (Indeed tracks them).

       I would have thought computer science would have been a more forgiving line of work. I can see getting locked out of a career in criminal justice if you are a felon, a career in teaching if u fuxk woth kods, or a career as a pilot if you have 4 duis but there is something wrong with you not getting a chance when your past doesnt impact your present. Sorry to hear this, and I hope you keep trying someone will have been in your shoes, see your resume, and take a chance on you. I certainly would if I wasnt in the process of getting out of the field

       Thank  you so much for your kind words my friend.  I think I've gotten locked out cause my felony years ago was related to computers and embezzlement.  I'm great at hacking pretty much anything or anyone and that got me into trouble.  I love trying to break into systems and mistakes I made long ago thinking there wouldn't be repercussions has screwed me. I'm hoping one day someone will hire me for my skillset and not my past.

       Have you looked into expungement? 20 years should be enough time for qualifying just about anywhere, unless it happened in an area that doesn’t allow expunging records.

       I've gotten all my rights back except for gun rights.  I've gotten bonded etc.  I want to get it expunged but it's very expensive.  I've still got to pay some restitution for what I embezzled etc so it's not really over I guess.  I was young, good with computers and stupid on consequences.

       There is most definitely a conspiracy by the professors who are there to guide you.  If they dont keep misleading people they dont have their tenure &amp; jobs.  They are doing this out of greed while hurting others.  Someone from scotland said they go to college for free... so why do we have to go imto debt for the same knowledge?
