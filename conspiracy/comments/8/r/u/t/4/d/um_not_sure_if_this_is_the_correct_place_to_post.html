        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I really don&#39;t know where to post this but I thought I&#39;d put it here. If this is the wrong place, I am really sorry. This has played on my mind for years and years. I have brought it up with counselors and psychologists and therapists and no one has listened really. I would like to know if anyone has a similar experience or if this was the workings of a child&#39;s imagination? I am so confused. It still haunts me.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one particular memory (at least that&#39;s what I believe it to be), something I also used to have a recurring dream about when I was about 10/11. Basically, I remember entering a house on my own. It was on a street full of terraced houses. I walked up the stairs that were directly in front of the door. Half way up the stairs, there was a very small landing. On the wall of that landing was a flag, I guess that would be the best way to describe it, it was made from some kind of cloth like material and it had the symbol of a goats head in a pentagram. The light in this hall was red, so everything had this reddish glow about it. </p>

<p>Then I turned to the right and continued up only a couple more stairs which led to a closed door. I can&#39;t remember what the colour of the door was but it was closed. At this point, I was filled with anxiety but it was like I was on autopilot, my body kept going even though inside I was hyperventilating.  </p>

<p>I open the door and inside the first thing I notice is how black it is. There are no windows. Everything is black, the floors are painted black, the walls are black. I can&#39;t see some of the walls because the room is so dark. The only thing lighting the room are a few candles. </p>

<p>People are sat on the floor in a circle (with the candles between or in front of them). They are all wearing hoods. They do not look up when I enter and I am filled with fear. This is where I go blank. </p>

<p>I used to dream of this all the time as a kid. I had terrible insomnia partly due to nightmares such as this. It feels so real. I can&#39;t explain it. I just wonder if perhaps I had an overactive imagination. I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>I would love to know your thoughts, even if just to put my mind at ease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did watch horror movies, there was kind of a free reign in that area. My mother&#39;s best friend was deeply into occultism, I spent much of my childhood around this kind of stuff, probably from around the age of 3/4. Maybe all of that influenced it? The only thing that really gets me is the feeling of anxiety and terror. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were around this stuff and knew what it was, then it could just be your imagination and a recurring dream. But the fact that your Mom&#39;s best friend was deeply into occultism bothers me. Have you asked your Mom about this recurring dream???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would make sense. When I was 11 I saw a psychologist and I didn&#39;t go into detail but I told her that I knew the devil was real and ghosts and she said something like &quot;well, I like cake so it makes sense that I would imagine cake.&quot; I thought she was a bitch at the time but she might have been on to something. </p>

<p>Yeah, she was a really strange woman. She taught me about this &quot;game&quot; where each night in your sleep you knock on different doors until you reach satan&#39;s door? She would teach me and her daughter spells. I haven&#39;t thought about her for years. </p>

<p>I told my mum this a few years back and she just said it was strange. I didn&#39;t press any further as I think I&#39;m mad enough lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concur with the other poster. Don&#39;t jump to any scary conclusions. The most likely and logical explanation is a recurring dream that your young  imagination made up. In remember having recurring nightmares and they can be awful. Because it&#39;s the same dream it seems worse somehow.</p>

<p>Do you have big periods of time that you can&#39;t account for from the past? Any big phobias? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that does seem the most logical. I think that that&#39;s the first and only recurring nightmare so maybe that&#39;s why it feels so real? They are so awful, it&#39;s the emotions the evoke. Sorry to hear you&#39;ve had them too. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember much of my childhood, especially before the age of about 10 or so. There are traumatic memories that I have glimpses of, and a few other memories but for the most part is is black. Phobias? I don&#39;t think so. The only thing that comes to mind is vomit but again, that seems pretty logical</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a little strange that you have parts of your childhood you don&#39;t remember. You may be repressing memories. Have you been to a therapist as an adult? I don&#39;t know if you want to delve into your past with someone, but if the nightmare still troubles you and/or if you feel there are some issues in your current life that are related to your childhood maybe you can find a therapist to talk to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am currently seeing a therapist, however, the emphasis is very much on the here and now. We don&#39;t delve into the past, suppose it&#39;s more about learning skills to cope. 
I&#39;ve always wondered if it was normal not to remember your childhood? Maybe in the future when I&#39;m a bit stronger I will go deeper into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have trouble recalling my childhood except for random, usually negative events, ie, ones in which I was frightened or traumatized.   I have had similar experiences but they happened when I was awake, and it seemed I surrounded by evil entities who were trying to take over my mind, body and soul.  It was beyond terrifying. It stopped happening in my thirties and hasn&#39;t repeated in many years.  Not sure what it means, but it does leave you wondering. In your case, I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s related to your mom&#39;s strange friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s so strange, it&#39;s the same for me. I do have a few good memories, with friends and stuff but mostly they are the kinds of memories you&#39;ve described. It&#39;s weird, not remember a large portion of your own life.
That sounds absolutely terrifying. Did you do anything to stop them or did it go away its own?
Yeah, she was very shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mum hasn&#39;t, however, my dad was into a lot of shady shit when I was little. I didn&#39;t live with him and I am not in contact with him now but his family have told me stories of him being &quot;attacked by demons.&quot; His side of the family are odd, religious nuts, almost cult like. My uncle was a Free Mason. There&#39;s so much I&#39;m remembering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not intimately familiar with this stuff, but from what I&#39;ve heard/researched, those who practice dark forces, do so on children, taking them into deep hypnosis and preforming their ceremonies. Have a listen to Jay Parker, on higher side chats. <a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/jay-parker-satanic-ritual-abuse">https://www.thehighersidechats.com/jay-parker-satanic-ritual-abuse</a>    Since you have had no luck with traditional therapies, I would look into hypnosis regression. This will use your subconscious to bring you back to that point in your life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EMDR is a coping mechanism, if I understand it correctly.  Regression hypnosis goes deeper, using your subconscious mind that catelogs everything that you do. A hypnotherapist will put you in trance, and bring you back to that place/time. Your subconscious will be able to bring out many more details than what your capable of now with your concious memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I think I&#39;m starting to accept that it was just a dream, albeit a very vivid one. Seems the most logical explanation. 
I used to work for a rape crisis centre and did training in Satanic Ritual Abuse. I don&#39;t think I could have come close to what some have been through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concur with the other poster. Don&#39;t jump to any scary conclusions. The most likely and logical explanation is a recurring dream that your young  imagination made up. In remember having recurring nightmares and they can be awful. Because it&#39;s the same dream it seems worse somehow.</p>

<p>Do you have big periods of time that you can&#39;t account for from the past? Any big phobias? </p>
