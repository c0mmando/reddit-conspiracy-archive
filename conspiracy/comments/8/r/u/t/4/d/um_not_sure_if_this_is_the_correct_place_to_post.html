       I really don't know where to post this but I thought I'd put it here. If this is the wrong place, I am really sorry. This has played on my mind for years and years. I have brought it up with counselors and psychologists and therapists and no one has listened really. I would like to know if anyone has a similar experience or if this was the workings of a child's imagination? I am so confused. It still haunts me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's one particular memory (at least that's what I believe it to be), something I also used to have a recurring dream about when I was about 10/11. Basically, I remember entering a house on my own. It was on a street full of terraced houses. I walked up the stairs that were directly in front of the door. Half way up the stairs, there was a very small landing. On the wall of that landing was a flag, I guess that would be the best way to describe it, it was made from some kind of cloth like material and it had the symbol of a goats head in a pentagram. The light in this hall was red, so everything had this reddish glow about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I turned to the right and continued up only a couple more stairs which led to a closed door. I can't remember what the colour of the door was but it was closed. At this point, I was filled with anxiety but it was like I was on autopilot, my body kept going even though inside I was hyperventilating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I open the door and inside the first thing I notice is how black it is. There are no windows. Everything is black, the floors are painted black, the walls are black. I can't see some of the walls because the room is so dark. The only thing lighting the room are a few candles.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are sat on the floor in a circle (with the candles between or in front of them). They are all wearing hoods. They do not look up when I enter and I am filled with fear. This is where I go blank.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to dream of this all the time as a kid. I had terrible insomnia partly due to nightmares such as this. It feels so real. I can't explain it. I just wonder if perhaps I had an overactive imagination. I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to know your thoughts, even if just to put my mind at ease.

       When you were younger, did you watch horror movies? Just trying to see if this dream could have been from your imagination, or if it really is a memory.

       I did watch horror movies, there was kind of a free reign in that area. My mother's best friend was deeply into occultism, I spent much of my childhood around this kind of stuff, probably from around the age of 3/4. Maybe all of that influenced it? The only thing that really gets me is the feeling of anxiety and terror.

       If you were around this stuff and knew what it was, then it could just be your imagination and a recurring dream. But the fact that your Mom's best friend was deeply into occultism bothers me. Have you asked your Mom about this recurring dream???

       That would make sense. When I was 11 I saw a psychologist and I didn't go into detail but I told her that I knew the devil was real and ghosts and she said something like "well, I like cake so it makes sense that I would imagine cake." I thought she was a bitch at the time but she might have been on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, she was a really strange woman. She taught me about this "game" where each night in your sleep you knock on different doors until you reach satan's door? She would teach me and her daughter spells. I haven't thought about her for years.

       I told my mum this a few years back and she just said it was strange. I didn't press any further as I think I'm mad enough lol

       I concur with the other poster. Don't jump to any scary conclusions. The most likely and logical explanation is a recurring dream that your young  imagination made up. In remember having recurring nightmares and they can be awful. Because it's the same dream it seems worse somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have big periods of time that you can't account for from the past? Any big phobias?

       Yeah, that does seem the most logical. I think that that's the first and only recurring nightmare so maybe that's why it feels so real? They are so awful, it's the emotions the evoke. Sorry to hear you've had them too.
      </p>

       I can't remember much of my childhood, especially before the age of about 10 or so. There are traumatic memories that I have glimpses of, and a few other memories but for the most part is is black. Phobias? I don't think so. The only thing that comes to mind is vomit but again, that seems pretty logical

       It's a little strange that you have parts of your childhood you don't remember. You may be repressing memories. Have you been to a therapist as an adult? I don't know if you want to delve into your past with someone, but if the nightmare still troubles you and/or if you feel there are some issues in your current life that are related to your childhood maybe you can find a therapist to talk to.

       I am currently seeing a therapist, however, the emphasis is very much on the here and now. We don't delve into the past, suppose it's more about learning skills to cope. 
I've always wondered if it was normal not to remember your childhood? Maybe in the future when I'm a bit stronger I will go deeper into it.

       I too have trouble recalling my childhood except for random, usually negative events, ie, ones in which I was frightened or traumatized.   I have had similar experiences but they happened when I was awake, and it seemed I surrounded by evil entities who were trying to take over my mind, body and soul.  It was beyond terrifying. It stopped happening in my thirties and hasn't repeated in many years.  Not sure what it means, but it does leave you wondering. In your case, I can't help but think it's related to your mom's strange friend.

       That's so strange, it's the same for me. I do have a few good memories, with friends and stuff but mostly they are the kinds of memories you've described. It's weird, not remember a large portion of your own life.
That sounds absolutely terrifying. Did you do anything to stop them or did it go away its own?
Yeah, she was very shady.

       It's meant to be serious. There's Satanists everywhere and it probably used to be a lot more popular in the 70s and 80s. Are your parents into the occult or the occult fringe?

       That is very true. My dad may have been but I couldn't say for sure. My uncle was a free mason. I don't have contact with any of them anymore so it's hard to find out. Maybe it's just better to forget, I don't know.

       Someone was doing some shit in your house/while you were sleeping/something like that. You probably can't narrow it down to who it could've been, but it isn't uncommon, a little bit of dream manipulation, don't worry about it, someone was just fucking with you and if you haven't heard a peep until now you probably never will

       My mum hasn't, however, my dad was into a lot of shady shit when I was little. I didn't live with him and I am not in contact with him now but his family have told me stories of him being "attacked by demons." His side of the family are odd, religious nuts, almost cult like. My uncle was a Free Mason. There's so much I'm remembering.

       I'm not intimately familiar with this stuff, but from what I've heard/researched, those who practice dark forces, do so on children, taking them into deep hypnosis and preforming their ceremonies. Have a listen to Jay Parker, on higher side chats.

       Since you have had no luck with traditional therapies, I would look into hypnosis regression. This will use your subconscious to bring you back to that point in your life

       EMDR is a coping mechanism, if I understand it correctly.  Regression hypnosis goes deeper, using your subconscious mind that catelogs everything that you do. A hypnotherapist will put you in trance, and bring you back to that place/time. Your subconscious will be able to bring out many more details than what your capable of now with your concious memory.

       please remember these are speculations. I would tend to heed your dreams. Look it up in a dream dictionary. look up satanic ritual abuse if possible. May be too triggering, but sounds like it has plagued you long enough. Survivors tell similar stories.

       Thank you, I think I'm starting to accept that it was just a dream, albeit a very vivid one. Seems the most logical explanation. 
I used to work for a rape crisis centre and did training in Satanic Ritual Abuse. I don't think I could have come close to what some have been through.

       Are you a Christian? If not then you should definitely pick up a KJV Bible and read it. If these dreams are real then the only person that can help is Jesus Christ. In know that probably sounded super corny but it’s true. God bless you.

       When you were younger, did you watch horror movies? Just trying to see if this dream could have been from your imagination, or if it really is a memory.

       I concur with the other poster. Don't jump to any scary conclusions. The most likely and logical explanation is a recurring dream that your young  imagination made up. In remember having recurring nightmares and they can be awful. Because it's the same dream it seems worse somehow.
