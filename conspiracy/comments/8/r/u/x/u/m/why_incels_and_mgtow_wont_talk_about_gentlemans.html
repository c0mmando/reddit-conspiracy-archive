        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had a thought in another post and I really wanted to bring it back. But first- I want to let you guys in on this thought process before you go bashing me...</p>

<p>First... Why the fuck are so many average men always complaining about how women are degenerate, etc. They&#39;re always bashing women, etc. But they don&#39;t have that same energy for the Gentlemen&#39;s club that you see every 5 miles. The strip clubs in New York. They don&#39;t have the energy for the dudes who enable this kind of behavior from women that they do the women who are enabled from doing this.</p>

<p>When I was visiting Florida (I&#39;m from Canada)- I was so appalled to see how many Gentleman&#39;s Clubs there were. Yes we have strip clubs up here, but it&#39;s not to this degree nor is it so explicit.</p>

<p>Groups like incels, mgtow- I always see them dogging on women but there is NEVER any self-accountability (as men) of the roles we encourage women to play in society.</p>

<p>This is the problem I have with some of these groups and the so-called evils and discrepancies they stand against and criticize- and largely with r/conspiracy as well- I even saw another post about it the other day.</p>

<p>The lack of self-accountability is irritating and all too common- it just feels like a lot of people (some of them grown as hell) have this childish worldview that the evil in this world is for &quot;others&quot; to take account for and that&#39;s so... deluded and hypocritical.</p>

<p>We all enable and perpetuate the &quot;Evil&quot; every single day that we complain about... yet rarely is there, &quot;Here&#39;s what you can do instead,&quot; or &quot;here&#39;s what you can do to fight against it,&quot; &quot;here&#39;s an alternative action,&quot; but it&#39;s all about &quot;truthing&quot; and bearing crosses and I&#39;m tired of it. What &quot;truth&quot; are we spreading? Ask yourselves that. </p>

<p>In terms of r/MGTOW... I&#39;ll give you a comparison..: Anyone with common sense knows that pornography enables degenerate culture... these days- women are competing with pornstars to please men- porn is now where teenagers are learning about sex before even knowing the reality of pornography or the act of sex and that in itself is crazy.</p>

<p>Yet... if you go on r/MGTOW and search up &quot;pornography,&quot; you&#39;ll see that a lot of them love everything it represents and can do for them- So... they&#39;re consuming the culture of and supporting women selling themselves for sex- but- they&#39;re against women selling themselves for sex and criticize women for having compromised values? Excuse me?</p>

<p>At this point- that&#39;s not even mental gymnastics- that&#39;s just straight hypocrisy- borderline retardation on some modern-day Pharisee shit. I&#39;m really, really tired of the hypocrisy. I can&#39;t- and I won&#39;t stand for it.</p>

<p>Hate me all you want, but I&#39;m done acting like &quot;we&#39;re all good people, it&#39;s just the elite that&#39;s making us hate each other, etc.&quot; and the people who prop up this narrative. Fuck that. It&#39;s disingenuous and it doesn&#39;t even make sense. It takes just as much energy to do one thing as it does the other.</p>

<p>You can call out the divisiveness and criticize people who profit off inequality- but make sure you&#39;re on some kumbaya shit. You can be critical of consumerism- but don&#39;t say you aren&#39;t responsible for any of that shit when you just bought that shirt from Forever 21.</p>

<p>Too many times I&#39;ve been scrolling through this subreddit and one person is talking about elites causing tension between race and economic groups- but their post history is saying that they&#39;d be perpetuating the same bullshit if they were in that position of power.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take this as an opportunity to bash me or tell me that I&#39;m not doing shit- because I am. This is a conversation about hypocrisy- that&#39;s the real conspiracy here. Nobody wants to talk about that shit.</p>

<p>They talk about how the elites cause bullshit- and things would be so much different if one of y&#39;all became an elite, right? All of a sudden we would be holding hands, sharing food equally and everyone would be able to live the life they want... right...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Please don&#39;t take this as an opportunity to bash me or tell me that I&#39;m not doing shit- because I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to be clear that when I say this- I mean I&#39;m actually aware of the sex offenders in my region. I don&#39;t have a Facebook account. I don&#39;t complain about consumerism because my entire wardrobe is proof that I support consumerism. I&#39;m doing my part to fight against the technocracy by creating a product I believe will weaken their support system.</p>

<p>I let my actions speak louder than my words, and if I&#39;m speaking- it&#39;s not some hypocritical bullshit. Look in my post history- I speak out against racism- but there isn&#39;t a time where I will ever criticize white people <em>for wanting to</em> keep themselves elevated when I know damn well if the roles were reversed- my minority group would be acting just as bad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of people saying one thing because it sounds good or because they can take the weight of their own sins off their shoulders and putting it on someone else&#39;s back. It is unarguable that all of us here have walked past a homeless/suffering person and didn&#39;t do shit, we&#39;ve said mean shit about other people, we&#39;ve judged a different group of people-</p>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t fuck with political conspiracies being in here, because none of us can come up with the solution for a just society, or one where everyone is accounted for. Everybody has their achilles heel. Either you don&#39;t fuck with poor people. Or you&#39;re homophobic. Or some other shit. Every decision in this world has a consequence. Living in North America and taking part in this resource-abundant society- believing in this First-World Country means that the other countries out there, they&#39;re going to have to come in second and third place. If <em>you</em> were in a position of power, if <em>you</em> were president, you wouldn&#39;t be ready to give away your resources or focus on making sure people in Africa don&#39;t have to walk 5 miles to go get water or they&#39;re not dying of aids or some shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just... I&#39;m really really tired of the hypocrisy. I got the same backlash in another post- I saw someone else make a post about this being an echo chamber and he got backlash. Can we talk about Atlantis or Aliens or some esoteric shit because I&#39;m done with whatever&#39;s been going on now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have good points, but what are you recommending to do?</p>

<p>Working on our selfs for now and letting the elites role out their plans?</p>

<p>Average people/ average r/conspiracy users aren&#39;t perfect at all, but yes indeed, I think things would be better if one of those average users here would be in power, because even though we all might be imperfect, most of us aren&#39;t exactly psychopaths, sociopaths, clinical narcs, sardists or pedophiles like the bigger part of those elites are.</p>

<p>&quot;Too many times I&#39;ve been scrolling through this subreddit and one person is talking about elites causing tension between race and economic groups- but their post history is saying that they&#39;d be perpetuating the same bullshit if they were in that position of power.&quot;</p>

<p>So maybe the person was right and the elites did a good job on him as well and didn&#39;t notice yet??
Did &quot;they&quot; made him a hypocrite? :)
If so, should we be mad at him or still at them?</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is there is a conspiracy that includes social engineering and mind controll for sure and now as we all are already affected by it you see this as a reason to not fight back at all anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... Because me being able to understand the role I play in the part of all this and my attempts to rectify myself from the bullshit takes the same amount of energy as it does to perpetuate the bullshit.</p>

<p>There is a way we are as human beings that we swear up and down we&#39;re better than and that deep down we can all get along and find utopia and... it&#39;s so... immature. Not only that it&#39;s intellectual dishonesty.</p>

<p>And no- average r/conspiracy users are not better suited to be in power because most people have other people in their ear and they run with whatever they hear like they&#39;re off the shits. Like, c&#39;mon. I&#39;m not stupid. How do you think America gets its military to fight all those bullshit wars?</p>

<p>People are always going to be in each others ear, persuading one another to do some bullshit- and if they can make decisions of what they believe in because of what they read on the internet- you know damn well they&#39;re not going to be any wiser or more decisive when they have millions of people trying to tell them what&#39;s right/wrong- including those very persuasive and very resourceful psycho/sociopaths, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Lmao how are any of you &quot;fighting back?&quot; I don&#39;t see people talking about how they&#39;re trying to shut down Facebook&#39;s servers. I don&#39;t see anyone talking about how they&#39;re going to infiltrate the Clinton foundation.</p>

<p>The reality is: you can&#39;t live your life trying to fight somebody.</p>

<p>You can either choose to do one thing or another- and it takes the same amount of energy. One of the greatest things you can do is give somebody your attention. Nobody can tell me that I&#39;m playing a part in the popularizing and mass control of Facebook (one of the greatest examples of social engineering and mind control), because I don&#39;t give a fuck about them. I don&#39;t use their services. I&#39;m actually developing a software which will help people use an alternative to that social media site. So... I&#39;m doing my part.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll use an analogy, anyone here who was bullied in high-school will understand.</p>

<p>When I was in high-school, I was bullied. It was bad. It was always constant public humiliation, so everyone could see it going on. I endured two years of it and moved. Now that I&#39;ve been out of highschool for a while- whenever someone from that school would talk to me, they would say how they thought it was wrong and they would see my bully acting up and they didn&#39;t like it...</p>

<p>So these people sat there, gossiped, knew what was going on, didn&#39;t agree with it and... did nothing. In fact- they were enabling him. They partied with him and his crew, hung out with them, etc. But they never invited me anywhere, not to the parties, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why their opinions and sympathy mean shit to me. That&#39;s why what so many posts here mean shit to me. Because people don&#39;t follow through with what they say. It just lets me know not to take it seriously, because they don&#39;t take their own values seriously to DO SOMETHING about it.</p>

<p>I think there is still a difference between somebody who got brainwashed into going to war and somebody who knows exactly what he is doing and why and is doing it anyway.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in &quot;the good&quot; or &quot;the evil&quot;, yet I think there are people that are worth  being called evil while the people you describe (the hypocrites) are rather just stupid.</p>

<p>Both their actions might look the same...</p>

<p>The intention why somebody does something or why somebody thinks something is right IS important.</p>

<p>&quot;Lmao how are any of you &quot;fighting back?&quot; I don&#39;t see people talking about how they&#39;re trying to shut down Facebook&#39;s servers. I don&#39;t see anyone talking about how they&#39;re going to infiltrate the Clinton foundation.&quot;</p>

<p>You are frustrated and I really really feel you, but people are doing things and are fighting back. I don&#39;t think you are the only one who is working on real solutions.
You know that. I don&#39;t think I have to link you to people who 1) blame the &quot;evil elites&quot; and 2) are doing something about it without being a hypocrite. I mean I just could link back to you profile then, right? xD</p>

<p>So what are you mad about? That there are only so few people like you? I&#39;m mad about that as well, but why would I as a response then ask you and everyone else to stop doing the right thing?</p>

<p>And dude, it IS harder to realise you are a hypocrite and to start to work on it than to be a hypocrite and talk and do bullshit. It doesn&#39;t take the same energy. lol.
I mean it seems you went that way so you should know. </p>

<p>It taking more energy is the only reason why not more people are doing it...</p>

<p>Again you really have valid points and I just don&#39;t like the undertone of &quot;all is lost...&quot; and &quot;you are as bad as them&quot; Both isn&#39;t true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>we&#39;re being held back from being good</em></p>

<p>A talking point I like to bring up often as well. I agree with you on most what you wrote, but I also sense that those thoughts, even though mostly right, brought you to a rather wrong stance.</p>

<p>Your calculation method seems right up to the point where you get your result... You were missing one or two variables in your calculation. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is the good or the evil, nor god and devil, like said. 
People who do believe in those often act like you described, but they are right about one thing.
And that is, that every single human being, does indeed stand on one of those both sides anyway. No matter if you are a believer or not, everyone is chosing a side at some point. </p>

<p>You compared people by their actions (like most people would tell you is exactly right.)
I tell you, at this point, judge people only for the side they are placing themselfs on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if someone who means good, but is compromised by faulty ideologies does worse than some people who do evil on purpose.
There really is a part of humanity that intentionally chose to do evil, because they think it&#39;s the better choice.
Those people are the only real danger to our world. This is the real enemy.
People who mean good, but don&#39;t know better are easy to convince if the time is right, since they still have kinda the same goals. </p>

<p>But how do you convince somebody to change his behaviour, who was 100% aware of what he is doing and why but did it anyway?
Just like:
*Because me being able to understand the role I play in the part of all this and my attempts to rectify myself from the bullshit *</p>

<p>There are people on both sides that are able to see their role in all of this to full extent like you see yours and there are people on both sides, who aren&#39;t as aware of what this all implies and how they should act accordingly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny actually....</p>

<p>I DON&#39;T believe in this shit, but we are indeed fighting this epic battle between good and evil anyway.
I don&#39;t feel the need to act all like Jesus all the time though since I know it&#39;s not about being a perfect being that is never mean to anyone. If I&#39;d ever get one of &quot;them&quot;... I think I could be pretty mean. You think that makes me a hypocrite. I think it doesn&#39;t since I never felt like being in this team means you can&#39;t use anything but love as a weapon or bullshit like that. lol
It&#39;s just a psychological thing. If you see yourself as a destructive being, you will be destructive. It&#39;s that easy and there are people like this.</p>

<p><em>Like we can have conspiracies that don&#39;t have to involved a bad guy, evil, fear, doom</em></p>

<p>Dude that totally sounds like it&#39;s a hobby or a game for you. I admit I felt the same for a while, but later I became aware, that all of this is no joke.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t just chose what is going on on this planet.
If there is a conspiracy of evil evil people that will destroy everything good that is left in mankind, talking about bigfoot is no alternative to stopping them evil people...</p>

<p>I was looking for other answers/ solotions as well, but there is nothing. Researching if we might have been created by some alien race or if aliens are visiting us or if we live in a matrix or what ever will never fix anything. </p>

<p>There is nothing we could change if we learn the truth about one of those topics, so who cares?
All I care about is, there are people destroying everything good in this world bit by bit on purpose and I don&#39;t want to take it, no matter if it happens because devil says so or because aliens tell them to do, or because they are aliens themselfs or because matrix idk.</p>

<p>What ever is going on, the first thing we should touch is this undeniable conspiracy of degenerates.
And we will never do that when we hate each other for being hypocritical or what ever.
I know it starts to feel like your worst enemies are those that should actually be in support of you real quick, but it&#39;s wrong and &quot;they&quot; provoke this of course. Don&#39;t fall for it!</p>

<p>I guess where here&#39;s you and I disagree in my eyes, and I will defend why I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>I believe you can&#39;t control people. Like, people are gonna do what they want. You learn that many people who try to help sometimes actually do more damage instead. I could give you examples if you wish with links.</p>

<p>People hurt others through many different channels. I can&#39;t take on the Clinton foundation, personally. Or Putin. I&#39;m one person. When you realize you want nothing to do with this tomfoolery... it just gets easy not to care.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to articulate my own personal stance on this that seems suited for a forum. My approach to this topic may come across nihilistic, but you would just have to know me to understand that as a person, that the overall testimony I have- nothing could be further from the truth. It&#39;s like that sometimes.</p>

<p>If you really want change as a person- you&#39;ll go out and get it.</p>

<p>If you want someone to change you... that&#39;s stupid vulnerability.</p>

<p>Doing my research, developing strategies. I&#39;m that kind of person. We have to develop strategies as individuals. I think it would honestly add richness to this forum. We have to mobilize. Your perception of me is misguided. I take shit very seriously- but I&#39;m the type of person who commits to something. My voice isn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>I honestly think a lot of the youth are like that. Distressed by the way things are and itching to do something- but they don&#39;t do shit because they have nothing to stand for.</p>

<p>I think r/conspiracy should have its own interactive website. I&#39;m a designer, so I&#39;m thinking about these things. How to get our messages across the internet, if we really want our voices to be heard...</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas but unfortunately, this can&#39;t be my focus right now- I&#39;m already working on my own product as I&#39;ve mentioned, but if conspiracy ever needs a designer in the near future if I&#39;m not busy- hit me up. I&#39;ve got some mad sick ideas. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m being legit. If you need pics of my portfolio, I got you- but serious inquires only lmao.</p>

<p>But this is what I mean. I think you&#39;ve got a nice look into my head.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I believe you can&#39;t control people. Like, people are gonna do what they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about controlling someone.</p>

<p>I was comparing two kinds of people. One that acts the way you described. Who sees himself as being on &quot;team good&quot; while his actions often don&#39;t reflect this very well. Someone who acts contraproduktive ONLY because he doesn&#39;t know better.</p>

<p>And than one that is rather like you, who is fully aware of his role and acts accordingly all the time, BUT on the completely other side of the spectrum (team evil) </p>

<p>I then suggested, that the one who wants to do good, but doesn&#39;t know better and thus often fails, often acts similar to the &quot;evil&quot; one who DOES know what he is doing.</p>

<p>(exactly what you observed. the ones who claim to be team good act as bad as team evil)</p>

<p>But then I pointed out that there still is this difference,,,
You can aproach the well meaning one and must do nothing, than simply convincing him, that he will have a hard time reaching his (your/ our) goals if he acts like that. If you do that, you don&#39;t controll him and you don&#39;t change him, since like you said that&#39;d be impossible, but you just show him that according to the side he joined and to the goals he has, he doesn&#39;t act very smart. That is something a person can very well understand and act on. You don&#39;t change how he feels or what he is, you only show him a better way to express what he is. ez</p>

<p>On the other side, as I said, you can&#39;t do that with the other person I described. That is because you can&#39;t just go and show the fully aware team evil member, that he is acting wrong according to his team, because he isn&#39;t.
He&#39;s team evil, he&#39;s supposed to act like that, he doesn&#39;t make any mistakes, being evil is the right thing to do for him and as you said you can&#39;t change or controll somebody.</p>

<p>So my point was that, I think it is very wrong, to judge about the people you were talking about as being exactly the same as the people they complain about. They might often act the same, but they do it for different reasons. The one is a bad &quot;team good&quot; member the other is a GOOD &quot;team evil&quot; member.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t distinguish between their actions, look at their intentions, since that is my point, intention is key.
(even if it doesn&#39;t make any practical difference at one point, the difference is, the person that means good can still learn to really act accordingly other than the person who never even meant to do good.)</p>

<p>Again &quot;evil &quot; and &quot;good&quot; is nothing than a construct of the human mind to me, but nonetheless something that moves and divides us and will probably lead right into the epic biblical war between god and devil anyway. It&#39;s in us so we have to go through it.</p>

<p>Your op sounds so definite, so everything lost, so: there is nobody anymore acting in a legit way even on the supposed team good... Like a call to give up... that is the only thing wrong about your post. Just the tone/ what you are implying. What you observed is true and truly wrong. You are right, but the solution would be explaining that to the people in a way that might come to fruit and not in a way that paints everything as lost. But you couldn&#39;t do that because I guess, your frustration level is at that point where you start to dislike the people on your boat almost more than the real enemies. (Close before the point where you&#39;d start thinking people deserve to be enslaved and punished) look out! </p>

<p>And I&#39;m really sorry for all the &quot;good and evil&quot; stuff. I feel you. Often enough I claim your position in a conversation and try to get that idea out of peoples minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest... nothing exists in a vacuum. Nothing. Men like women who are materialistic. This is why I don&#39;t participate in discussions about gender or patriarchy or feminism shit or whatever. Men and women are mirrors of each other. Frames are different. But mirrors nonetheless.</p>

<p>Why do you believe the negative effects on our society are beginning to outweigh the positives? Do you want us (as a whole) to take a step back- or should we dare to take a step forward, then another, and another- and hope we get past what you feel we are experiencing today. You can be apart of the steps we take.</p>

<p>All things are transient. Things are just changing. Think of life like a filter. Life itself is just that. It&#39;s the materliasm. The capitalism. The short skirts. The combat boots. Grunge music. Roller-rinks. McDonalds. Walking 5 miles to get water. Getting water from your tap. Communist governments. Democratic governments. All of these things are just a filter.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true- materialism and design go hand in hand- and it affects living. </p>

<p>Imagine if we thought of materials and technology and lifestyle different.</p>

<p>I always wondered what if I could someday focus on making a great washbowls out of a fantastic natural material... and I could wash my own clothes and hang it to dry like my family used to in Jamaica instead of just using a washing machine. We had a great, big house in the countryside. A little hilly area. Tons of land. We had a computer- like, we <em>had</em> shit. But we still took the time to really &quot;take care&quot; of ourselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s those activities where I&#39;m really taking care of my life that I get to sit down and think about things. My family, my emotions, my goals, etc. It&#39;s like my meditation.</p>

<p>But here? Here in the West? things need to be fast! fast! fast! Everything efficient, everyone get&#39;s everything, everyone gets to be anyone they want! everything go! hit go and collect $200! your computer needs to be faster and faster! human processes need to be faster and faster!</p>

<p>We&#39;re all so quick to go- where?</p>

<p>Into our graves?</p>

<p>Hah.</p>

<p>Materialism. Communism. Democracy. Consumerism. Darwinism. Socialism. Whatever other &quot;isms&quot; and the pale man is still great because he is light and bright and he leads. Africans, who don&#39;t have shit are primitives. Backwards. Apes. The West innovates. The West is great for the West is great and the West&#39;s constructions are our tomorrow. Make it great AGAIN!</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling. Don&#39;t pay attention to me. We don&#39;t need to anthropolog-ize the West like we do the rest of the world. We are forwards. Our way is right. We are going to be magically blessed and just create the best solutions for humans. Yessssiirrrrreee. faster faster faster. hit go. collect $200.</p>

<p>People have skeletons in their closets and inner demons. What they may not realize is to get past them you have to take responsibility and be accountable. </p>

<p>People hide from the terrible things they&#39;ve done and been a part of and maybe no one is a saint but you need to face your own darkness so you can evolve through it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for defending yourself. I have a little more respect for the group as a whole.</p>

<p>After reading your comment I had a really sobering moment. I&#39;m sorry if I came across as judging you or your lifestyle inaccurately. My criticism of mgtow as an online space, still stands, and I won&#39;t rescind my comments on that or backtrack.</p>

<p>However, I know it is not right to judge all the individuals of one group and hold them all accountable to the images that only certain members choose to perpetuate. Of course, I&#39;m intelligent enough to approach people on an individual basis, so like blacks, whites, latinos, Christians, Muslims, atheists, gays- whatever- I&#39;m not going to hold you accountable for the image that another person chooses to perpetuate. I&#39;m not like that.</p>

<p>However, I will re-iterate, <strong>r/mgtow</strong> as an <em>online space</em> is compliant and does enable those who choose to berate, chastize and slander females, which perpetuates a very hypocritical, false ideological image. I think that statement is very fair, and I can give you examples (with links), if you&#39;d like me to back up what I am saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re comparing MGTOW, an individual lifestyle choice about relationships, with TranCons, conservatives, and other ding dongs and their &quot;degeneracy&quot; idiocy.  They infest the place.  They care about pornography and slut issues and all that religious bullshit.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that &quot;those people who are atheists....blah blah....but they aren&#39;t burning down churches.&quot;  There&#39;s no requirement other than I don&#39;t want to get married.  &#39;Nuff said.  All that other nonsense individual MGTOWs may have is their own issues.</p>

<p>As far as any &quot;elites&quot; bullshit, those, again, are a bunch of anti-semites and alt-nazi recruiters who also infest &quot;outsider&quot; subreddits trying to recruit. That&#39;s it.  They&#39;ve been mostly pushed out, but they&#39;ll still start their bullshit now and then because that&#39;s their thing.</p>

<p>Those groups, alt-right, nazis, racists, incels, and various jackasses aren&#39;t MGTOW, in fact, and since my job is tracking everything they do, they almost never post anything MGTOW content related.  They just peddle their bullshit on <a href="/r/mgtow">/r/mgtow</a> and a lot of other subreddits out there.  It&#39;s a coordinated effort.</p>

<p>Who cares about pornography?  Religious idiots?  Who cares about sluts?  Incels?  Fuck those idiots.  Sluts are good.  Slut are sources of easy sex.  Only people with a problem with sex have issues with that.</p>

<p>Evil?  Good?  Jesus crispy comments.  Now can someone be MGTOW and religious?  Sure, but the two have absolutely nothing to do with each other.  Don&#39;t fall for the propaganda trap that everyone does by conflating a lifestyle choice about relationships with all these other things that have zero to do with it.  Can you be a MGTOW and an &quot;elite&quot; nazi?  Sure, but those things have nothing to do with each other.</p>

<p>No... I don&#39;t believe I was saying <em>anything</em> to this degree, <em>at all.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m also not here to try and get into the mindset of someone hypocritical- it won&#39;t make any sense to me. I&#39;m discussing these very new, very 21st century &quot;groups&quot; and their hypocrisy- more specifically, I&#39;m critiquing their online spaces, including the ones I&#39;m involved in that I frequent at times, which is r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>I probably should have been more careful to insert my indifferent stance when it comes to how others decide to go about their lives. It&#39;s why I don&#39;t care about alt-right, nazis, racists, incels, the Clintons, the Rothschilds. I actually don&#39;t care. The way they choose to go about their lives- I couldn&#39;t... care less. I wouldn&#39;t even have enough fucks to give to roll it up and smoke it.</p>

<p>But if people are gonna be hypocritical- I&#39;m calling that shit out. Hypocrisy has no value, it makes no sense, and it&#39;s counterproductive under any circumstance. People can do what they want- like I say, time and time again, I can&#39;t control people. I&#39;m one person.</p>

<p>But, I have the right, and I can urge people to stand in their truth. Don&#39;t throw stones and hide your hands. Don&#39;t be the pot calling the kettle black. I think I&#39;m actually calling out something... fair, here. I can&#39;t imagine someone coming into these comments like, &quot;What are you talking about? Hypocrisy is <em>good!</em>&quot; Like.. that would blow my mind. I would just hit the &quot;block user&quot; button at that point and end it there.</p>

<p>But yeah... I see the hypocrisy, I think without so much of it and if people had a little more <em>resolve</em> here, it would actually add some richness to the content we see in this forum.</p>

<p>Like, even though I don&#39;t care about what an individual decides to do in their day-to-day life (and considering this is an online space, y&#39;all probably 1000 miles away from me, so idgaf AT ALL), but this <em>is</em> an online space that I, myself frequent and I think I have a place to say, &quot;Hey, I think this online space is suffering from something, I think this is how it could be improved.&quot; And we can try it out- or we can ignore it. But at the end of the day, I can only control my own voice and my own actions.</p>

The strippers are full participants who knowingly try to get as much as they can.</p>

<p>Tear down as many strip clubs as you like. I don&#39;t give a shit. I have tumblr. All the filthiest porn you could ever imagine, in picture, video &amp; gif format, accessible to me completely FREE to blog and download as I so please. What the hell do I need strip clubs for? </p>

<p>Additionally, you might want to Google what happens when men stop paying to buy drinks at a nightclub, or stop attending &#39;breasteraunts&#39; like Hooters. They go out of business, and all those sluts go out to become streetcorner prostitutes.</p>

<p>What I have a PROBLEM WITH are the dudes that bash strippers and use it as an excuse to dog on women but they don&#39;t hold the men accountable as well. It&#39;s the rampant hypocrisy I have a problem with. If YOU want to call them gender neutral clubs go right ahead. I&#39;m going to keep calling them strip clubs, thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK number one you were bashing on specifically &quot;Gentlemen&#39;s clubs.&quot; Number two you mentioned incels and MGTOW&#39;s. They are entirely different things. Incels can&#39;t get pussy, that&#39;s why they&#39;re &quot;involuntarily celibate&quot; and are angry all the time. That&#39;s also why they call many women sluts whores. They think women are fucking everyone but them. MGTOW&#39;s on the other hand don&#39;t give a fuck about sex. They know they can just pay a hooker if they want to get laid. Now they are also generally people with no filter. They call many women sluts (and whores) because, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slut">by definition</a>, a slut is someone (typically a woman) who has many sexual partners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never bashed on Gentleman&#39;s Clubs.</p>

<p>You&#39;re seeing things.</p>

<p>I only wrote that I was shocked at how many there are and how robust they are in comparison to my city and region. We have different cultures, so of course I&#39;m going to have culture shock. However- nowhere did I speak on the content of The Gentleman&#39;s Clubs  or the character on those who subscribe to that type of entertainment. After all, I&#39;ve seen a few strip clubs in Toronto, and in other surrounding regions. It is just not so accessible here as it is there.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know so many men participated in this, and women as well. When I went to America, it just sank in. I think parts of American culture is super-stimulating. Sorry. That&#39;s my opinion, and I&#39;m very observant.</p>

<p>Im not really well versed when it comes to sexual conventions tho because, I honestly... don&#39;t give a fuck what ppl are doing with their sex lives. I just know what&#39;s best for me and what&#39;s best for you are different &amp; that&#39;s okay... because I have the choice not to participate... </p>

<p>Like people act like they have to run w everything these days and if somehow something is not ur cup of tea u go run and be mad...</p>

<p>In my personal experience- a girl friend of mine wanted to go to a stripclub. We were right in the building next to it. But I honestly thought to myself, &quot;I dont think Im ready to stimulate myself with this.&quot; And Im honestly so okay w the fact I made that decision. Maybe someday I will need that stimulation- but for now I&#39;m good. If you need that stimulation. Its there, and you wanna go for it? Thats fine. If you really want something, you&#39;ll get it. That&#39;s how a good amount-If not all, humans are. That&#39;s why I said to that other guy in this thread that I can&#39;t control people</p>

<p>But nowhere did I judge anybody and say what they&#39;re doing is bad. You guys also need to look within your vernacular and get the definition and application of certain words right. &quot;Enable&quot; is a neutral verb- it has no connotation.</p>

<p>I dont know how many times I have to say it... it&#39;s like you guys want me to be petty over these little things and I&#39;m not about that shit. Y&#39;all think I&#39;m nihilistic but you&#39;re projecting. You don&#39;t know me. You don&#39;t know what I do. You don&#39;t know the daydreams I have..  I look at this sub and I see so much potential.</p>

<p>But whats crazy is I saw right through the majority of this sub.. I thought at one point there was a time everyone was talking about how the mods here couldn&#39;t be trusteddd and how people feel like they&#39;re being censoreddd here- people were just nitpicking at the mods instead of actually <em>Investigating.</em></p>

<p>I didnt see anyone who had a problem mobilizing. What wouldve really impressed me? That someone might just go, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s build our own forum.&quot; -- from that thought- a little story in my head just played out became this new UI system with a new developed search and confirmation systems... its so sick. Sorry. I&#39;m a designer and it all sounds vague but that&#39;s just cause I don&#39;t wanna anyone to steal my idea and I ramble. Sorry. But I think about these things- surely there&#39;s a coder around here with maybe a little free time? Like we could legit make this work... we DO have so much power- but why isn&#39;t anyone doing anything- you know?</p>

<p>I kid you not- I have the notes and the sketches. And not to be cocky at all but... I think it&#39;s pretty special.</p>

<p>But I just don&#39;t have the faith in this sub to do that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m coming on here to start a discussion about the possible hypocrisy in this sub and people start nitpicking on how I might view sex work? Like... I wanna see quality if I&#39;m gonna invest- and sorry, to be frank- this community has declined in it&#39;s quality in my eyes. I&#39;m always shocked at the gaslighting in the forum. It&#39;s crazy. It prevents growth. The title was supposed to provoke the thoughts of this sub and what it stands for: <em>&quot;That&#39;s why nothing will change- that&#39;s why we let people in power stay in power.&quot;</em></p>

<p>What are we doing, as conspirators- (whatever that means to You)- to gain power? If something happens- what actual power as a community do we hold? Nothing. None. If r/conspiracy gets scrubbed off the internet and banned- TOMORROW. And a mass censoring of media begins- What the fuck are we gonna do? Supposed the internet continuously starts to become as censored as some people fear- what&#39;s the back-up? How do you ever ensure you can reach as many as 3000 people in one night to tell them: &quot;hey... that community... r/conspiracy? You can trust it- were still here and I know I can trust you.&quot; I keep seeing those moments peeking out where people could really be the hero- they could just do good instead of just saying that they&#39;re good. We can all do something. </p>

<p>See- thats the Internet-Community thinking of Tomorrow. There&#39;s none of that shit today-present day. We have no power. I&#39;m not mad at this sub or the people in it- I&#39;m just disappointed. And I think that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Sorry... long read. Idk why I bared my heart like that.</p>

<p>I feel like I need to rant because so many people choose to miss the main idea. They choose to gaslight and redirect and attack my character instead of analyzing concepts and working out discussions.

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest... nothing exists in a vacuum. Nothing. Men like women who are materialistic. This is why I don&#39;t participate in discussions about gender or patriarchy or feminism shit or whatever. Men and women are mirrors of each other. Frames are different. But mirrors nonetheless.</p>

<p>Why do you believe the negative effects on our society are beginning to outweigh the positives? Do you want us (as a whole) to take a step back- or should we dare to take a step forward, then another, and another- and hope we get past what you feel we are experiencing today. You can be apart of the steps we take.</p>

<p>All things are transient. Things are just changing. Think of life like a filter. Life itself is just that. It&#39;s the materliasm. The capitalism. The short skirts. The combat boots. Grunge music. Roller-rinks. McDonalds. Walking 5 miles to get water. Getting water from your tap. Communist governments. Democratic governments. All of these things are just a filter. But deep down- things are just the same.</p>
