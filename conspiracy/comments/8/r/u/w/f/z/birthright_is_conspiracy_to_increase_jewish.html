        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Confirmed Jews get a free trip to Israel with free alcohol and access to clubs. Socialising is highly encourged. Such a trip would normally cost people many thousands of dollars, but this Jewish organisation pays for everything. This is a clear ploy to encourage Jews to fuck, reproduce, get married, increase the Jewish footprint on the earth, but especially in Israel so they have enough people to join the military and expand into their new lebensraum. They don&#39;t even care if the travelers meet and fuck on the first date, hedonism is promoted. Hasn&#39;t anyone called out this clear agenda to make Israel more populous with Jews from the USA and Europe (usually Ashkenazi)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wife is Jewish, it’s totally free.  I’m honestly amazed that you could be Jewish and not know about this - it’s called “birthright”.</p>

<p>She spent a month in Israel, flights paid for, lodging paid for, transportation and entertainment in country paid for. </p>

<p>You can’t go on birthright, but if you are Jewish, there are many organizations that will pay for your travel. I’m not Jewish, but my wife and I could go totally free.</p>

<p>As to the original post - this isn’t breaking news. Of course they want to allow every opportunity for their followers to meet, marry, and proliferate the faith. Every religion has some form of this, although probably not as lavish or well publicized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False, I signed up 2 months ago and just came back from mine. Also, can confirmed that the alcohol is most definitely NOT free and it’s also definitely NOT encouraged unless it’s after program hours and even then we were supposed to be responsible (i.e not black out drunk). If anyone is Jewish and reading this I recommend shorashim cause you get to be with the Israelis the whole time instead of part of the trip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never had enough free time to go.  Most winter breaks and summers I was either working, taking classes, or studying for graduate placement tests.  I know a ton of people who went, and I&#39;ve heard mixed reviews.  The major criticism I heard was that the schedule was super regimented, and they feel like they missed out on a lot of things.  There was a lot of time spent in the places with a lot of Jewish religious and historical significance like Galilee, Jerusalem, the desert/Masada, etc, while very little time was spent in the more general tourist spots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Masada and Jerusalem are the touristy spots. Galilee is a beautiful lake that has no religious significance that I know of. And in the desert you smoke weed around a bonfire and ride camels. The schedule is regimented because there’s a lot to do and the timings are tight but it also depends on what type of group you go with, i.e I went with older kids ( no one under 19) and it was decently chill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I called another Jew and asked about this. Yes, it is a free trip. There are many other organizations that offer this too, not just the website you listed. I have definitely heard of the Birthright trip to Israel, I just never knew it was free! It is mostly for young adults, but some organizations offer it for all ages. You only need to take spending money and a little money for food at different times.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an American Jew and married to an American Jew. Neither of us have been to Israel. Our two boys (who are old enough to qualify for this trip) have no desire to go to Israel either. So I guess that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t know all the details about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. There are a lot more positive places to visit, just because it&#39;s free doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right to validate a regime bent on eradicating Palestine. They could have truly had a two state solution in the 50s but chose expansionism over security. It&#39;s complete and utter madness as seen by any European. The blind support of Israel in the US is a US phenomenon. Please watch the debate with Dershowitz and Chomsky to have a global, objective view on this humanitarian crisis. Going and partying in Tel Aviv while you understand the disgusting conditions Palestinians are forced in will make your stomach hurt. You won&#39;t want to go visit anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ux4JU_sbB0?t=221">https://youtu.be/3ux4JU_sbB0?t=221</a></p>

<p>You should know that their goal was never coexistence, it was always driving the Jews into the sea. The Jews at least can live with coexistence, and for that they have my support, even if the orthodox can be absolute douches at times (even killing their own peace seeking leaders like rabin)</p>

<p>Hasn&#39;t anyone called out this clear agenda to make Israel more populous with Jews from the USA and Europe (usually Ashkenazi)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really see your question? They are open that their entire goal is to get Jews to live in Israel. This post is like calling out Mormons who send their kids to knock on people&#39;s doors. </p>

<p>Love it or hate it, it&#39;s not subversive tactics. They&#39;re open about their agenda. </p>

<p>Also, hedonism is not promoted by the organizations, it&#39;s actually discouraged. Overt drinking/sex/drugs will get you kicked off the trip with no help on getting home. </p>

<p>The kids are the ones who naturally are psyched to party hard as it&#39;s a free vacation in a new country where the legal drinking age is 18. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that it&#39;s not just about getting more Jews to live in Israel, it&#39;s getting more Jews to <em>exist</em> by promoting their conception, and specifically Ashkenazi Jews of the west. The conspiracy is they&#39;d like Ashkenazi Jews to be the dominant group in Israel, the more the better, even if it means producing as many as possible.</p>
