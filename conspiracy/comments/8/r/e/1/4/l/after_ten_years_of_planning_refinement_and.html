       Submission Statement: A few months after my release from prison, I came by
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to do an AMA on crowd-sourced research and the as-yet unrealized potential for mass civic collaboration via the internet. I also spoke about the platform that we're building to move the ball forward. That platform, the Pursuance System, is nearly complete, overseen by a non-profit I've established with a board of directors that includes "Family of Secrets" author and former Columbia Journalism Review member Russ Baker.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who are understandably confused, here's a fairly good early 2017 piece from Wired summarizing who I am and what I'm trying to accomplish. Here's a more recent piece from The Observer about what sorts of things one will be able to use Pursuance for when it launches (we're in alpha testing now). The main link goes to our Kickstarter, which has a short video presentation and a great deal of specifics. And I'll be answering questions here for next several days, and longer if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally, we're hoping to raise the $48,000 we need to pay specialist programmers to finish the visualized civic ecosystem and handle other assorted costs. But I also want to recruit additional participants (we have 1800 individuals and orgs so far) who are capable of dealing with ambiguity, have taken the time to study history so as to better understand the present, and care enough about the future to think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like many of the readers here, I obviously don't see
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as a single constituency, and have serious disagreements with a good portion of those who post here. But part of what makes Pursuance different from other platforms is that it's specifically designed to allow those who agree on fundamentals to gradually find each other and work to their shared ends, while still being able to reach out to other constituencies when necessary. This is vague-sounding as it is, but we have materials at the link which will better explain, and I'll be linking here to the other presentations that have thus far managed to convince an unprecedented array of both mainstream and not-so-mainstream entities to get involved.

       None of the money goes to me. But if you resent the very fact that I might be trying to raise money for a non-profit so as to better accomplish the things I've already faced down decades of prison time for, you'll be happy to know that DOJ ordered me to pay over $800,000 in restitution to the criminal black ops firm Stratfor that I had no role in hacking, that it's used that restitution order to subpoena my publisher and
       <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2017/11/03/barrett-brown-is-trying-to-write-a-book">
        force them to refrain from paying me my sole source of income for the last year
       </a>
       - requiring my mother who was also raided and charged by FBI to empty her savings to keep me in my apartment until that gets resolved - and that everything I make when I am indeed once allowed to make money legally again will be cut by 25 percent to go to that firm, even aside from taxes, and that I'm nonetheless not asking for help to deal with that. So be happy; the guy you despise is going to keep taking shit from the government in addition to you.

       I am skeptical about this and the skepticism leans political and I think your plan has the potential to be another fountain of misinformation and propaganda, and or working to that goal of only one political entity or one political voice and I prefer a little chaos, even a lot of chaos to that.

       I would be interested in the identity of the groups and organizations who have signed on.  And really I am curious enough that I saved the information from your first AMA here and just perused the links you provided from the observer and Wired. But your dismissive reply offers no encouragement.

       I didn't intend to come off as dismissive; I'm just trying to understand what you're asking me. We don't put out lists of those who have applied to participate, as these include individuals and orgs that don't want their governments knowing, but we do put out info on those orgs that have given us permission to mention them, such as Frontline Wellness, Hypothes.is, and WhoWhatWhy (Russ Baker's outlet, which'll be using some of our crowd-sourcing techniques on experimental basis early on).

       Hypothes.is does annotation for the web, allowing people to more easily comment and review things like news articles for things like crowd-sourced research. Frontline does several things relating to telemedicine, training doctors in conflict zones.

       When you say.."crowd-sourced" research...are you picturing real time events being included...kind of like a global framework for periscope and other platforms...but coordinated/structured...I mean, if the system could notify an individual of an event they are located by...and they were able to feed the "on the ground" information into the network (possibly getting paid in crypto for doing so) then you've pretty much created your own global news network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it could be gamed..but, if credibility/accuracy/longevity ratings were applied to users/submitters from the beginning...then most likely the system would do ok overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm one of many that knows when I see an event I'm interested in..."real time"...one of the most frustrating parts of understanding the situation is the limited amount of information I have to work with...the bias of the information I have to work with (filtering bias from information is labor intensive if you ask me...signal/noise)
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a network I could be part of...where, if there was an event near me...and I could be of help by collecting and transferring accurate, unbiased information to that network...and in return get the same from other users in other locations concerning events I'm interested in...I would probably join it.

       where you got the idea that this would favor certain political interests, but if you are actually here to contribute to the subreddit you should know the entire political party system is a rigged strategy of tension, and the fact that Democats have been getting caught raping children and selling national secrets more than Republican of late is mostly coincidence.

       Actually yes - indeed, more in place than with most platforms, which are content neutral. First, we populate the system ourselves initially, going through the applicants when we launch (we've got about 1800 orgs and individuals who've formally applied thus far). This in and of itself isn't a guarantee, as we're not demanding that anyone who wants to refrain from identifying themselves do so; it merely allows us to "seed" the system by putting in a great number of people who've already self-identified and whom we can generally determine to be, at the very least, not Nazis. As time proceeds, it's that initial user base that drives the growth by bringing in more participants via several different mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you'll probably have noted at this point that, as time goes on, some of those who get brought in could very well be bad actors, or people we're not excited about empowering, or actual Nazis. The kicker is that just getting in to the Pursuance ecosystem doesn't really do much; each pursuance handles its own recruitment and on-boarding based on its security needs, the level of nuance involved in the things that it assigns people to do, etc. So a collection of actual Nazis - or cops, or intelligence pros - could indeed try to infiltrate some particular group so as to monitor or disrupt it. But they're going to have a far more difficult time of doing this than they did with Anonymous, which essentially had no membrane, or even with more formal orgs that don't have a staggered permissions set-up, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more to this answer, including a lot of details that only make sense when you're looking at exactly how Pursuance functions; see the livestream I did two nights back, linked from the text portion of this post, for more on why the groups that are going to be using this are satisfied that they'll better off with us than, say, Slack, or Facebook (of course), or even with brick-and-mortar operations. And thanks for your question.

       I must have missed a place to apply,unless it was months ago when the system was first announced, I think I've only used a email though. If it's still open, my group could definitely benefit from this platform.

       Hello Barrett, quite happy to see this impromptu AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love what you're proposing, but would individual user participation open one up to exactly the rigmarole in which you found yourself with Stratfor? I have the necessary credentials and would be more than happy to participate, though I would certainly appreciate some reassurance regarding anonymity and any potential blowback for the end user if one person does something stupid enough to warrant some sort of major crackdown on the entire operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't mistake my inquiry with criticism in any way. This is conceptual dynamite.

       There's a couple of issues here I can address, and a couple that our lead developer Steve Phillips can better explain (I'm actually not technical except for what I picked up from Anonymous). End-to-end encryption is the major part of the answer. Another part has to do with the ability customize these individual entities - pursuances - in which all the work within the ecosystem is actually performed. So, if you start a pursuance to do research, you can decide if applicants to join you can be anonymous, if they have to confirm their identities to you or someone else, or how much they're able to see in terms of what's being done, etc. These permissions systems go well beyond what you'll see in current task management apps (another new discipline that I've had to read up on, since my Project PM stuff was done very amorphously, via IRC servers and with a wiki, and no hard-and-fast procedures).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, short version is, there's greater means to protect one's self, and to decide who you're willing to work with, and how, and to what extent those operations are going to be inaccessible even to other people who've joined you. Likewise, when you apply to join a pursuance, you're able to get a sense of what sort of protocols they're working under - and if they're not willing to explain, or whatever, you can look for other pursuances that are more your speed, or, of course, create your own very easily.

       Will there be a central record in which user information is stored? Can participation be in any way shielded from potential conviction if any analyses yield actionable fruit?

       Hi, Pursuance tech lead/lead developer here; good questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each Pursuance instance is independent of the others, just like every WordPress instance is independent of the other instances/installations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we've implemented server-to-server federation, enabling users to collaborate with each other as if they're on the same server, in which case servers can choose not to be fully independent of each other, but in no case is there globally centralized user info (nor globally centralized pursuances or tasks or chat messages or anything else).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm ensuring that the default server installation of Pursuance makes itself available as a Tor hidden service/Onion Service. Combine that with the fact that you don't even need an email address to use Pursuance, plus the ability to create a private pursuance that encrypts everything except a bit of metadata, netizens everywhere will be able to use Pursuance with a very high degree of anonymity -- partially due to Tor, partially due to these other security features.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and we'll eventually let pursuance creators enforce a 2FA-only policy, so that it's hard to hijack people's accounts with phishing attacks.

       There's a really cool permissions system we're building that I could talk about, which mitigates the damage an invitee can do by limiting their capabilities, but that belongs in the answer to another question :-).

       Thank you so much, I appreciate the feedback. Do you ever hope to roll out a mobile app? My schedule doesn't allow for prolonged laptop use but I've taken sufficient steps to somewhat secure phone usage and it's never out of reach.

       He'll be back with more follow ups, but that's one I can answer. Yes, we've already begun building mobile apps for this; aside from the usual reasons why this is advisable, a significant portion of our users will be operating out of countries where phones are the chief method of accessing the internet.

       You bet!  I made the Pursuance web app responsive about 2 weeks ago, so it'll work well on mobile (as well as any other web app, at least), and native mobile apps are a stretch goal for this Kickstarter. If we don't get enough funding to get there for this Kickstarter, we'll get more funding elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The (Native) Apps Shall Be Built... but we're starting with a web app that works well on both desktop and mobile.

       What kind of encryption will you be using? I'd also like to ask what your second authorization method is going to be. I hope it's not email or text message as those both have major security flaws and easily defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the whole point is privacy so having to use my email or phone number is no beuno. I took a look at the kick starter and noticed a lot of junk like shirts, hoodies and stickers as rewards for donating.
      </p>
      <p>
       May I suggest you instead offer an authenticator like yubikey, RSA or even a cheap one made for a few bucks like  the ones blizzard offers for $5. You could always roll your own built into an app but that can backfire as it's difficult to actually get true RNG.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this isn't taken the wrong way, I just think that would be much more useful (and cheaper.)  I'm sure once you add up all the costs of rewards and Kickstarter's cut, you're left with about 40-60% of the funds raised.

       You will absolutely get burnt if the government decides to target you or this service. They are already able to break TOR along with encrpytion methods like the RSA algorithm and PGP encryption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your best odds are using  a one and done, burn after posting, type service. Continuing to use the same signature/handle will eventually trip you up. For proof of this look at people such as Ross Ulbricht, Steven Chase, NSA (stutnext), GRU and countless others. They are some of the best cyber security people in the world  and they were all exposed due to simple mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like not configuring their TOR server correctly, forgetting to connect with VPN and modifying files with their PC named in a foreign language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry this got so long. I just hope a bunch of people don't get burned from this. If you ever do need to blow the whistle I suggest you read  how Snowdon did it and use his exact method. Especially since he knows exactly what tools, information and methods the NSA/Governments will employ.

       It's open-source, AGPLv3. I'm not sure what sort of "formal proofs" we could use to prove to anyone's satisfaction that this is the "best tool in existence" for those things; instead we tend to rely on our longer explanations of what those features are and how they differ from those available now; you can find these on our website at PursuanceProject.org, with specific info about features on our github page. I've asked our lead developer Steve Phillips to come by and deal with any follow-ups on that.

       They might be downvoting him because only one of those questions was good, and the other one was a  request for a "formal proof" of something that's clearly beyond the purview of what a

       Hey there, Steve Phillips here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope that the next generation of blockchains can (1) scale and (2) not require centralization to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these first-gen blockchains that everyone's using -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar -- either scale very poorly (BTC and ETH), or scale much better but use trusted servers to do so (Ripple and Stellar).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another practical issue is: what about mobile? An Ethereum-secured mobile app would require the user to download over 1TB(!) of ledger history just to get started (
       <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-has-exceeded-1tb-and-yes-its-an-issue-2b650b5f4f62">
        source
       </a>
       ) -- not exactly feasible on a smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also troubling that ~6 people control the vast majority of hashing power on the Bitcoin network, for example, which means that, while Bitcoin's
       <em>
        computation
       </em>
       is decentralized, its
       <em>
        power
       </em>
       is even more centralized than traditional banking -- not exactly the solution we're all looking for, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that all blockchain data is public, which doesn't exactly make it inherently privacy-preserving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, plus most projects using a blockchain do it to incentivize use by paying people with cryptocoins, but I'd rather spend my time building software to make groups of human beings radically more effective than fighting fraud and attracting speculators who don't actually care about the world-improving aspects of Pursuance as much as the get-rich-quick dynamic that introducing cryptocoins would foster.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth mentioning that the architecture of Ethereum is, in my view, profoundly flawed, since one popular app makes every other app on the network slower(!), as we saw recently with CryptoKitties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if whenever youtube.com got a traffic spike, that made reddit slower and Amazon slower and Google slower.
       <em>
        Obviously
       </em>
       that would be a
       <em>
        terrible
       </em>
       architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what? I just described Ethereum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that Holochain or some Proof of Stake-based system solves these problems, but as far as I know, nothing exists today that has the properties we would want for anything like Pursuance... though the thought of doing an ICO for fundraising and just using the blockchain to store people's public keys in a tamper-proof way is kind of enticing!

       Good luck with the project.  Speaking only for myself, it seems that you've become a poster child of sorts for reformation of the system, and this has been forced upon you by circumstances beyond your control.  Some are born into it, others have it thrust upon them...  I think the key to any reformation is collective involvement instead of individual heroic efforts.  Hopefully the design of this is not lost on those people, like yourself, who can speak most eloquently.  All y'all will need to enlist the help of others if you want to see any success.  I reckon too many people lose sight of this basic reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you may want to try crowdsourcing away your court-created burdens.   I think there's a lot of people who would support you there.

       I have two questions:
1)  What are your plans for Anonymous?  From what I can see Pursuance is a huge step up, but if Anonymous was brought back to its full potential it could become a driving force in its implementation and in bringing it into the public eye. (the current generation (12-20) probably doesn't remember much about the organization, let alone what our government does behind our backs)
2)  What skills would an aspiring coder need to learn to contribute to Pursuance?  And what would be a good tool to develop those skills?

       It's very hard to have discussions with like-minded people nowadays as everyone seems to be on the internet, and even thought it has benefits it also has drawbacks, both in terms of more push for propaganda and lies as well as lower access to mature and open conversations.

       " that we really have the "best" platform for civic collaboration is a great illustration of what you've just said. If you look at some of the more nuanced explanations we've put out regarding how pursuances work, and how much of this centers around self-organization, I think you'll find our project worth looking into. There are some videos in which I explain this on the Pursuance Project YouTube account. Some of these are a bit rambling, which is why I'll also be doing some shorter, more concise clips to explain various of these aspects.

      <p>
       i had a lot of bad experiences with undercover police in 2017 and decided to leave the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       a lot of my story is in my comment history especially the very beginning and also over at my steemit mindhawk acct
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe i have had numerous 'friends' who were undercovers in my life due at first with my activity against the drug war in the earlly 00's and then gradually i became involved with a number of movements that are highly surveilled by the fbi et al and also my online postings tend to be kinda sorta radical.
      </p>
      <p>
       my honda's car computer catostrophically failed twice costing a lot of money and the second time in dangerous traffic.  i encountered numerous bait situations as if i were a suspected human trafficker.  i believe they found a way to make it so i chose two undercovers as roommates.   Even in the country where I now live there are frequently strangers who fit a certain profile constantly sitting near me at pubs and setting their phone pointed at me.  I will for now omit things that scared me more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I say about this sounds a little(a lot...) crazy to people, but you are one of the only people who I have heard mention this sort of infiltration/harassment/investigation of individuals associated with any 'movement' and even as inspiration for the anon counteractions against stratfor.  (any further details about this point in time would be of great interest to me)
      </p>
      <p>
       In Laura Poitras's wikileaks documentary Jacob Appelbaum and Assange have a conversation about this type of surveilled life and Appelbaum is on record about specifics very similar to what i have experienced but only in german newspapers from what I can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is first, what is the proper and most effective way to report state surveillance of oneself?
      </p>
      <p>
       My second question, any tips on personal security?
      </p>
      <p>
       My third question, it appears to me that they are most afraid of movements and also seeking to start their own fake movements to control and poison various wells of potential civic action, and to this end anyone who looks important to a movement will always receive increasing pressure and have what amounts to an advanced persistent threat in their lives, in this atmosphere, if every potential citizen action is infiltrated on day 2, how are we ever going to get to a point where we can change this to restore the freedom of assembly?  Or can there be freedom of assembly without freedom from infiltration by your own government?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems in general some fairly large holes in the ensured rights of americans and humans is being exploited by technological advance, to the point that all of the former protections like miranda rights and posi comittatus(sp) and 'innocent until proven guilty' are being rendered quaint like they did to the geneva conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thoughts on these matters would be appreciated, as I appreciate all of your work.  Hoping to hear more podcasts personally.  Mindhawk is sort of my zoro of internet argument, I wrote a bunch over at steemit and I am open to all critique and comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best wishes

       here is some reading for you, it should shine a light on some of the methods they use and goals they have. after the wall came down Zersetzung was adopted by the wider intelligence community and now with the internet and mass surveillance its become a widespread blanket of oppression. you can be targeted for absolutely nothing and along the way start seeing things differently to the point you end up being a legitimate target in their eyes. just for your views and outlook you gained along the way.

       i did not know the vocabulary but i do know that the only place i have heard about secret police tactics being used like what i have experienced were in china and eastern bloc countries, nazi germany and the ussr, although putin uses them as well clearly.

       if you read my comment replies, i suspect 75% of my interactions on reddit are part of an attempt at zersetzung and i believe but cannot prove that when they flag you as someone worthy of this, they begin to make it difficult for people who might actually want to read or enjoy your work unable or unlikely to ever know you exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       i believe reddit, twitter and facebrak all use these techniques and are currently gaslioghting millions of people on multiple parts of the political spectrum.  i suspect however a lot of it has to due to whether or not you blindly support a certain nation whose fanatical supporters happen to own most of the american media and push all americans for permanent war.

       nothing is interesting about me besides the things i say and create, none of which are anywhere near popularity(that i know of)
      </p>
      <p>
       however i believe but cannot prove that i say and do a lot of things that would be popular if they ever were broadcast and at the same time these are things that a lot of time money and effort are spent to keep silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       however in this new era of pre-crime, you can get full time state surveillance just by being someone who might have been popular in 10 years if your life wasn't complicated by bizarro remote gaslight attacks on your car computer and having general difficulty encountering actual humans through the dense cloud of spies hovering over your shoulder or trying to trick/induce/pressure you to commit or appear to commit a crime.

       Probably not. The money is for our developers and expenses related to setting up this platform, which will be for our thousands of initial users to fight "institutionalized injustice", along with the tens of thousands that will follow as participants bring in new ones. I'll certainly be using the platform for the sort of things I've done in the past, such as experimental crowd-sourced research and campaigns to reform prisons and police, but anything I do will be a drop in the bucket, based on the orgs that have signed up even at this early point. Having written all that, it occurs to me that it's the term "institutionalized injustice" that's set you off, and that maybe this sounds like "microviolence" or something, but it means exactly what the words indicate: injustice perpetrated by institutions as a matter of course. We're mostly talking about state institutions, although naturally any number of private entities also come into play via state capture, etc.

       That's pretty cool. RPGs are very successful at keeping inmates happy and well behaved from my personal experience. Unfortunately not all the guards seen it that way and they would go out of their way to shake you down and send you to the hole for contraband.

       There are any number of online communities frequented by people who could make use of this platform, and that we have no easy way of reaching. Spreading the word to them will be helpful. Anything from forums for Eritrean exiles to local police watch orgs to large charities that do bike drives for Africa could use this to great advantage.

       I have, and we talked about some of this at the Aaron Swartz Day event last year at Internet Archive in SF. I only vaguely knew Aaron - he'd offered to do FOIAs on persona management, one of the more dangerous apparatus we came across back then - and actually knew little about him until after his death, but later I learned that he was ultimately aiming for the same thing I was in terms of truly systematizing mass collaboration. Some of his old friends have since gotten involved with this project for that very reason.

       Dude I remember watching your interview you did for Vice! I totally respect your stance and what you're trying to acconplish. I won't take up your time with a question, but I just wanted to say that it's awesome what you're trying to achieve, and even more so that you refuse to back down from what you feel is right.

       There's one interview, and a link to the first interview is in it. He also did a piece on their technology show "Motherboard" that I'm sure is pretty easy to google. You can literally type in "Barret Brown Vice" to google search and find any of the interviews I'm talking about lol.

       Firstly, Barrett, I want to say that I think you are a visionary. I think your approach to using open source collaborative technologies to create change is as a species is spot-on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that you should consider building in a cryptocurrency that gains value by the participation and projects completed by members or coop networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our challenges are both quantitative and qualitative in their conditions, and as such need cooperative solutions which address both the issues of meeting physical needs, and mentoring individuals in ways that uplift them psychologically and spiritually.
      </p>
      <p>
       In brief, I'm interested in using "Proof-Of-Value" Cryptocurrencies ( backfeed.cc) or "Proof-of-Cooperation" as found in FairCoin to encourage the digital and physical collaboration of participants in the creation of high-tech civilization-building CO-OPs which utilize the research and development capabilities of online, open-source collaborative communities and the mentorship Co-op of members, the physical benefits that the localized participation of interested members can bring to a co-op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your platform could be the collaborative tool needed to enabe coop development.
      </p>
      <p>
       A project example could be that a CIV BLD CO-OP could implement vertical , aquaponic growing systems to help us all grow food year round, tiny home construction or perhaps even develop liquid flourode thorium reactors for advanced alt-nuclear energy production-- the possibilities are only limited to the collaborative power of the open-source internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ideacould be amplified by using cryptocurrencies to bring more reciprocation and incentive for co-participation. As more members and various organizations, non-profits and coops invest in this cryptocurrency it will multiply the influence and collaborative power of coops across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of Value or Cooperation Cryptocurrencies would essentially allow members to verify the value that others provide in their participation with the coop, which creates the currency based on the incremental value added to these socially uplifting projects. Member receive the increased value of their invested currency as more members participate. Members could participate in collaborative research and development projects using an application, where Co-op members can actively communicate and participate online working towards a predetermined specified goal for that work meeting, think of this as like a Google Hangout to work on a project, where verified members log their hours, corroborating verifying and rating the participation of other active members. The value of a goal being met in a project creates the token of cryptocurrency is this Vision that I have to encourage users to participate in your online community.
      </p>
      <p>
       This model could completely change the way we view welfare, basic need sustinance, and collaboration online. We need to bring about Society 2.0. We need to make the status quo obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just getting started on this journey, and I desperately want to collaborate with people who have the technical knowledge to collaborate with me to implement a civilization building Co-op... Id love to connect with you somehow to chat more about all this! Blessings to you and your family!

       Yes, going on Anonymous Bites Back on Thursday I believe, plus doing some livestreams with Birgitta Jonsdottir and DJ Spooky over next few weeks. In July I'm going on Chris Hedge's program while I'm up in New York to speak at HOPE, where I'll be interviewed on stage by Spencer Ackermann (this should also be available on YouTube or some such immediately afterwards). And there's plenty of clips of me talking about related subjects on BBC, etc on YouTube right now.

       I'm know for assisting in the Tunisian revolution and getting spied on for it; investigating those people, spending the next year running additional research via my group Project PM so as to expose further operations, in the process revealing such things as Romas/COIN; having the FBI aggressively investigate me and getting charged with 100 years of offenses; getting most of those dropped due to international outcry; causing U.S. press freedom ranking index to thus fall like 11 places; getting thrown into the SHU over and over again for writing columns about prison abuse; winning the National Magazine Award while being held in the SHU yet again for giving interviews over the phone; getting out of prison and immediately announcing the creation of a new framework by which to make it easier and safer for others to do some of this same work; recruiting other whistleblowers and an Icelandic MP to serve on the board; getting arrested again for giving interviews to Vice and PBS; getting freed a few days later because they hadn't actually charged me because they obviously couldn't; writing about that; and then trying to raise $48,000 to pay the coders that are building this new project while I meanwhile try to deal with the DOJ's other illegal decision to
       <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2017/11/03/barrett-brown-is-trying-to-write-a-book">
        subpoena my publisher

       and force them not to pay me any of  my sole income from an upcoming book that happens to be critical of the DOJ. And those four years away from the internet were fucking magical, I can assure you.

       The Stratfor leaks are known as the Global intelligence files on wikileaks, I believe.

       Yes. The Stratfor leaks were given to Wikileaks shortly after the hack. Although you'll see mention of me in relation to Stratfor a lot, the actual search warrant - which Michael Hastings posted on Buzzfeed after I was raided - list entirely different companies, such as HBGary and Endgames Systems, that thereafter they decided they probably shouldn't be talking about. Those are the firms I was more involved with investigating and trying to warn people about, along with Palantir. That's why Wikileaks put up the HBGary e-mails as a little present for me on the day of my release in Nov 2016; we had had those up via a series of Anonymous sites, in searchable format, but then they'd simply gone down over time and I'd always wanted them easily available.

       I would be interested in the identity of the groups and organizations who have signed on.  And really I am curious enough that I saved the information from your first AMA here and just perused the links you provided from the observer and Wired. But your dismissive reply offers no encouragement.
