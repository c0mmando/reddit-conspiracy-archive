       It's essentially a U.K style blanket ban on all substances that have psychoactive effects comparable to any scheduled substances. They use vague legalese statements such as...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Any "chemical  structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a  controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and"
       </li>
       <li>
        "an actual
        <strong>
         or predicted
        </strong>
        stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous  system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant,  depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a  controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V;"
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It seems like pretty average totalitarianism that gives them the right to ban every unscheduled analogue of an illegal drug and has effects comparable to one (Caffeine would fall in this category as being stimulating in the same way Cocaine and Amphetamine is). Where they crossed the line and completely disregarded any attempt of reasonably constructing the legislation  is they used the word PREDICTED in reference to the effects a chemical has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who gets to decide what a prediction is? Can Jeff Sessions just wake up and decide Vitamin C might be psychedelic and schedule it? Can he bump his head and become deluded to the level where he can become convinced that any random substance might have some sort of no-no effect and schedule it? Can an average shitposting troll make a fancy looking blog article about why some random compound might be able to do something like a drug and influence the DEA/FDA to prohibit it for the lulz?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does this shit end? Because a blanket ban on Research Chemicals seems like it should be the end of it, but who would be able to predict if they'll eventually get inspired to crack down on gardening supplies?

       I’ve been following the bill closely. It has little to no media coverage. It’s ridiculous that it passed in the House today. It gives WAY to much power to the attorney general.

       Shit, there's Lions Mane Mushroom Extract/Concentrate, my personal favorite. I got into it looking up how to increase lucidity in dreams, look up what you want out of a nootropic + the term "nootropic". Nootropic is kindof a silly word but it brings up the forums

       don't care about what drugs people use, they care about whose drugs people use. Glyphosate is literal poison and is ubiquitous in the food supply (thanks FDA) while Marijuana is still schedule 1 (good job brave drug warriors). This legislation will be used to ban Kratom for the crime of helping curb the opioid epidemic, while a patented pharmaceutical version is developed for the coming monopoly.

       I hope it passes. This is the same kind of prohibition shit that produced the ingenuity of the 1920s. No one is going to stop using substances (ok, maybe some folks will), they will just get more creative in procuring them. This will drive more folks to cryptocurrency and venues like DNMs. In a society all rules by the almighty dollar, the entrepreneurial spirit will prevail!

       The whole point of doing RC's, aside from experimenting with differences between similar drugs, was to get a safe legal alternative and avoid criminal behavior. With the onion marketplaces, you don't know if it's a honeypot or not.

       They did this in the USA years ago. It was in response to some companies making designer drugs that were "not technically the same as(but totally the same as) street drugs. Modified heroin and coke and the like.

       They just banned certain substances that caused a ruckus, like fentanyl/spice/bath salts. If you understood what was being said in the two quotes from the bill I provided, you would know that this has not happened before. This is the final move to Ban anything that produces effects comparable to any scheduled substances (Caffeine and Cocaine are both stimulants, so this bill would give Sessions the right to scedule caffeine as a drug with a 10-15 year sentence for possessing or distributing )or that has "predicted" intoxicating effects. The word PREDICTED is where this shit disregards all integrity, because what exactly is the consensus on what evidence a prediction needs in order to back it up? None was given, so I predict that it could mean they could schedule whatever the fuck they want due to someone somewhere thinking it may or may not intoxicate you to some sort of degree we don't care enough about to confirm any validity on whoever predicted this and to what degree the presumed predictor even thought the claim was possible.

       As well as any legal compound disregarding any reason at all, all they need to do is  simply make up a prediction that something could have an effect similar to a scheduled compound or produce any sort of intoxication, and its gone. I assume caffeine will be the first to go, since stimulants are such a big factor in the drug war.

       any drugs id consider doing are already illegal so for this SITSA bill i just hope it gets rid of legal highs. they are an absolute scourge and extremely addictive yet they sell on our highstreets. everything from fake weed to fake amphetamines. the fake weed is like smoking crack and is highly addictive and kids can walk in and buy any of that shit.

       The Dangerous fake weed got banned long ago, now it's all just tobacco alternatives bunched up to resemble weed. I'm not entirely sure, but CBD can fall victim as well, as well as Kratom. Banning those two would be a fucking act of terror to people who use them as preferable alternatives to Anti-Psychotics and Opioids.

       Look up MXE, they fucking annihilated it's very existence. The highly agreed upon top choice that some people would consider tradiing their nutsack for if any was found. It's entirely gone from every entity on earth that would be willing to sell it to countries it still remains unscheduled in. The extinction of it is due to nothing other it's legal status in the USA as well as some other countries  where it was produced.
