       When the godfather of the European Union, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, published the plan for a united Europe and the ethnocide of the peoples of Europe, 
the encouragement of mass non-white immigration was central to the plot.
Since then, an unholy alliance of leftists, capitalists and Zionist supremacists has schemed
to promote immigration and miscegenation with the deliberate aim of breeding us out of existence in our homelands.
As indigenous resistance to this human genetic-modification industry grows, the criminal elite seeks new ways to camouflage their project. 
First, their immigrant pawns were temporary guest workers; then it was a multiracial experiment; then they were refugees, 
and then the answer to a shrinking population. Different excuses, different lies â€“ and asylum is just another one. But the real aim stays the same: 
the biggest genocide in human history, the final solution to the white problem.

       Kalergi was a practicing Roman Catholic. He was trained at the historically Jesuit Theresian Academy in Vienna, the same school attended by the Jesuit General during Kalergi's time - Ledochowski, easily the most influential man of the 20th century who also concocted a plan for a Central European Catholic bloc united under Hapsburg leadership and controlled by the Jesuits. This plan would come to fruition with the creation of the EU through its ideological precursors - the European movement along with the Bilderberg Group, which were created by Joseph Retinger, a Jesuit Catholic agent who met personally with Ledochowski at Zizers. Kalergi was the son of an Austrian diplomat, and the Jesuit dominion over Austria had been well-known. For this reason, Kalergi's plan was well-received by the Jesuit-controlled Hapsburg king. Kalergi received the Catholic Charlemagne Prize, which is named after Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne and is awarded for European unification pursuant to revival of the Holy Roman Empire.

       This may be an indirect result but is not the intended goal. Main reason why they allow immigration is to prevent a UNIFIED AND ARMED MAJORITY. If your an immigrient and you just came to America, last thing you want to do is stand up against the government. This is also why they keep them in a state of limbo, never fully legalizing but also not kicking them out. They want them to be in a state of fear, unable to speak up about mistreatment. Once you look at everything from the perspective of taming the inevitable revolution, it will all begin to make perfect sense.

       This may be an indirect result but is not the primary reason. Main reason why they allow immigration is to prevent a UNIFIED AND ARMED MAJORITY. If your an immigrant and you just came to America, last thing you want to do is stand up against the government or be a apart of any movement. This is also why they keep them illegals in a constant state of limbo, never fully legalizing but also not kicking them out. They want them to be in a perpetual state of fear, so when the people begin revolting, they will still go to work and abide by the rules. Once you look at everything from the perspective of taming the inevitable revolution, it will all begin to make perfect sense.

       I didn't want to believe it at first, but after reading "Practical Idealism" and seeing that the EU hands out a prize named after this Sionist racist it became clear why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The European "whites" / true Aryans bear an inhibited potential in their DNA. A potential to intelligence that outshoots all other races.
      </p>
      <p>
       It rarely works, but if it does you get the likes of Leonardo Da Vinci.
      </p>
      <p>
       This genetic potential comes from the Jewish Pharaohs of ancient Egypt which migrated to northern Europe centuries ago and mixed their race. This is why Kalergi views the "Jews" as master race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of really smart people, a people where virtually all inventions of technology came from, 99% of time you see Europe as the cradle of civilization, of true civilization, inherited from the Empires of the Sand (Egypt/Israel).
      </p>
      <p>
       Kalergi was half-Japanese, so why didn't he view "his own" Asian people as potential master race ? Because they never were smart, unlike the misconception you get hammered into your brain by the Sionist media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The South-Koreans and Japanese are viewed as "smart people", but that's just a load of bullshit, they are however the most obedient slave-race the world has ever seen, even dumber than the most primitive African tribal and the proof for that is the astronomical suicide rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people rather kill themselves than destroy the capitalist system that enslaves them. Best grades in school, but no freedom and no brain. Sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kalergis plan to destroy Europe is in full motion, politicians like Angela Merkel (B'nai B'rith / Jewish Freemason) are forerunners of this agenda. Soon Europe will be populated by a half-white, half-brown/black bastard slave race that has no culture, no religion, no wealth, low intelligence, no hope and finally no own identity. A perfect slave race after American example where nobody knows where they ancestors came from.

       No way man. That's crazy. Oh, that fleet of boats? Those are just humanitarian ships. Oh, yeah, it's crazy how many shipwrecks occur 12 miles off the coast of Libya since Gadaffi got a knife stuck up his ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       What? You'd turn away shipwrecked, refugee women and children? What do you mean 70% are adult males? Are you racist or something? You can't turn away refugees because they're a different skin color! I don't even know how it happens. We just really like going back and forth between Libya and Italy for months at a time, and it seems like every time we are near Libya we have to save hundreds of women and children escaping the violent males. So what if they're 70% Male. Are you suggesting they're violent? They're future engineers and doctors, you racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, just give them food and water while you investigate their claims. That's nothing. What do you mean the legal system makes it virtually impossible to dispute anyone's claims of being a refugee? You think someone would lie about that? What's wrong with you? Are you a white supremacist Nazi? Why aren't you giving them healthcare? And how will they ever find a job without a cell phone? You have plenty of space. At least build them camps. What do you mean 90% of them never apply for a job? You wouldn't hire them anyway, Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, it's just a few mosques. Why are you so intolerant? What's wrong with a few dozen mosques in town? One of them doesn't even openly march in favor of abolishing thousands of years of European legal advancements in favor of a centuries old religious legal system. How is it not feminist and progressive for a woman to have acid thrown in her face for showing it in public? That's just their culture, and it's beautiful.  It's not like your oppressive, misogynistic culture where women only earn 77 cents to a man's dollar. I'll bet you believe in a traditional nuclear family where a woman has to cook and clean for you. Why do you hate women?
      </p>
      <p>
       How you can say that bringing in more downtrodden refugees will result in more terrorism? Are you suggesting their countries are more violent because of their culture and not because the land has some magical property that forces them to be that way? We should put you in jail for hate speech. Cool it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you care about becoming a minority? You mean you're concerned about becoming a minority in a country full of people from countries that literally murder minorities in the thousands? Oh, like white countries haven't oppressed minorities with their EO laws and now you have a problem with your country's skin color getting a bit darker? Careful, your whiteness is showing. You've been murdering your black population for centuries now. You're so mean to them. Ooooh, 360,000 white men died freeing the slaves in the U.S. alone. I guess that makes up for those slave ships buying them off of other Africans. Nobody else owned slaves. White people are the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody wants to hear about the Barbary Slave trade of the slave auctions in Libya right now. That's completely irrelevant. You know what you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is trying to replace you. Why don't you go watch some TV. While we're talking why don't you just let me check your TV license....

       There is no "Kalergi plan." Coudenhove-Kalergi was a grand dreamer, with some far-out ideas, but he wasn't a planner. The closest he got to implementing his visions was a place on the proto-EU committee created after WWII by CIA chief Alan Dulles.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may have been enthusiastic about the hybrid/mixed race humans of the future (as he foresaw it). But he didn't propose any ideas about how this outcome could be achieved. He had about as much of a plan for "ethnocide" as I have for getting to Mars. I'd like to do it, but...

       How would you know that he was just a meaningless dreamer?

       IMHO what he said is an eugenics operation to get back the feudal times where an aristocracy rules over the peasants. This kind of "fantasy" isn't new, especially coming out of Austria and people connected to
       <em>
        House of Habsburg
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       To manufacture that you have to break the social bonds by diversify the population with incompatible ethnics, lower the school system and ultimately the intelligence of the population vs. the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Count Coudenhove Kalergi was an austrian aristocrat, therefore bound to Habsburg. This guy is seen as the mentor of the modern EU. A guy who openly promotes eugenics and the destruction of our western civilisation.

       Coudenhove-Kalergi was not connected to the Habsburgs, except by virtue of being Austrian, and I'm not sure why you think it's relevant anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, if the Hapsburgs influenced him in any way, it would have been by proving that failure to refresh the gene pool will have disastrous consequences!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say it again: Coudenhove-Kalergi had no more of an idea about how to achieve his dreams than his contemporary HG Wells had about how to create a real-life version of his invisibility potion.

       He was an Austrian

       +diplomat and who are the royals of Austria? Habsburg. Also called the "House of Austria". Like British aristocrats served the Queen the same rules applied to an Austrian aristocrat.

       Piffle. "Aristocrat" isn't a formal title, and in any case the aristocracy don't serve the monarch. They are rich and well-to-do and get on with their own lives. They might be loyal to the monarch, but that's their personal choice. I can guarantee you that most British aristocrats have never even met the Queen.
