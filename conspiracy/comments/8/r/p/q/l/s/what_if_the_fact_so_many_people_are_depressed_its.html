       Lets say depression its an undetectable virus that makes us feel sad and all other symptoms you have because of depression,I always found it weird how all of a sudden so many people on this planet are depressed and not only teenagers,its affecting older people too now,that's why I think it might be some kind of virus that affect everyone of all ages,a kind of virus that holds you back from achieving succes,I wouldn't doubt something like that to be released by someone that wants to rule the world,this is just a fictional theory so please treat it that way.

       I suffer from a complete pain in the ass illness called MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity). I can become black hole depressed at the flip of a switch from perfumes, deodorants, shampoos, scented candles, detergents... Depending on the chemical, it can affect me in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just telling you this because you might want to check your environment for chemical triggers. Even the clothes you wear, or the detergent you use, the antiperspirant, or the shampoo you use to wash you hair with, could be a trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans were not designed to live in a synthetic chemical soup. Detergents, fabric softeners and perfumes all affect your brain. I think a lot of people are affected without realizing how much these chemicals can alter your mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope it helps..not saying this is your cause, but just giving a hint that for some people it could be. I'm pretty sure black hole depression in many cases is in fact brain inflammation, or a symptom of toxic burden.

       Not sure why you were downvoted. In Scandinavia over a thousand people still suffer from Narcolepsia today, because of the 2009 flu scare and panic distrubition of the Pandemrix flu shot by our governments.

       Flu shots absolutely can affect your neurology.

       The establishment uses SJWism as a tool for divide and conquer. The elites are extremists. Don't blame normal Jews who are likely not involved in any way. Powerful zionists are partially to blame and other globalist corporatist parasites.

       Blaming Jews is a divide and conquer tactic as is SJWism. Powerful zionists might be satanists in disguise or something like that (just like I wouldn't call the peeeedo Vatican "Christian", it's probably just a front).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously not all people who identify as Jewish (ethnically or religiously) are involved in globalism and corporatism. Don't blame the innocent. Instead, go after those with the power and motive to fuck up society for self gain. Unethical oligarchs, regardless of religion or race or whatever. Especially those that bribe our government.

       I agree with you, yet the guy above you is right too because while your average Jewish person is probably not involved with any world take over plans or secret cabals, there is a faction that is. It gets complicated throughout history but the people who are at the top of this pyramid are people from that faith who have mixed it with other beliefs to become the nefarious, global slave owners we have now.

       Yeah I wondered this too. I'm not so well researched on Judaism and related stuff but I did read something about Khazaria (canaanites??) converting to Judaism.....perhaps they were satanic first (or whatever it was called back then) and then mixed the religions together. I don't really know but I'm glad you brought it up because it's not black and white.

       I feel ya. I don't think any of us regular folks really know the whole truth behind these groups of people who have controlled humanity over time. It's difficult to find truth while trying to weed out any false leads or misinformation, since none of us were alive, we just have to dig further and rely on trustworthy people who want the same truth. I like your style, my friend, we must search for the truth while keeping an open mind. Have a great day!

       This reminds me of the good old days of reddit when we would have open-minded conversations about interesting topics and help each other to find the truth, not attack each other and harass each other for sources and hard evidence for theories we're entertaining or looking in to. Let's keep this good karma going and encourage the flow of different ideas, thoughts, and theories!

       Sounds like a plan. Also bear in mind reddit is full of bots and shills so it's especially toxic now (I believe the incessant whining about Trump vs Clinton is mostly a manufactured smokescreen -- I don't give a shit about either of these Bush/Obama corporatist clones even if Trump was playing 3D chess, which currently I see little evidence for). Money remaining in politics = corrupt business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what extent is reddit fake, I cannot tell. But I agree, it costs nothing to be nice and encourage open minded talks. Almost like honest philosophers trying to destroy their own theories until the last one standing might be the right one.

       I wouldn't call it liberalism or marxism (these both have several types as far as I know). You probably mean SJWism/extreme political correctness. But even this garbage is not the biggest factor.....our corporatist far right bankster-wallstreet economics is plaguing society with poverty and stress.....far more damage than some dogmatic feminist hypocrites with no power.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all the feminists and muh "white privilege" hypocrites all changed their ways, would we be happy? The answer is an obvious no. We'd still be controlled by scum corporations who bribe our governments and infect our social programs with profiteering and cronyism. Corporatism is the disease. SJWism is a pest in comparison.

       Toxins, poverty, stress, rigged system with lack of freedom to a career you enjoy, etc. these all rob society of happiness and efficiency. All because of some retard bloodline parasites want to control humanity for some dumbass reason. Imagine all the geniuses that went to waste over thousands of years of oppression (well....I don't know how consistent the oppression was but you get what I mean, fuck empires). Holy Roman empire only "ended" in 1806 lol.

       A tv in every home and it's utilized to feed us garbage. It could show us all how to be electricians, physicists and so much more. Instead humanity is forced to serve its lowest common denominator sports, "news" and mind numbing garbage about made up people in made up situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This single piece of tech is just one out of millions we don't use the way we should. We could be so much more... But your wife wants to watch Grey's anatomy and then watch the Royals get married. And your husband wants to watch a group of men compete against another group of men to put a thing in a thing. Like watching cave men train and hone their aim to kill that mastodon. Its 2018 and we have to entertain the cave people and sell them beer shoes and trucks. They can't do that simple mental chin up and look at it all from a different view point.

       I totally agree with you. Brilliant point about the potential to use TV to teach people how to be electricians, physicists, etc. People being encouraged to do good. None of this unironic edgy "thug life" bullshit in the corrupt music industry.

       There could have been whole channels dedicated to training. Even if not literal courses and such, at least honest documentary style education without overdoing the scientist/astronaut celebrity culture, dogmatic scientism religion, half truth/disinfo and watered down crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so much filth on TV/movies. Some movies have insane amounts of disturbing gore for no reason, perhaps other than to desensitize society and traumatize it at the same time. Gruesome hyper violence normalizing sociopathic behavior. Just a suspicion of mine, as Hollywood is probably filled with propagandists, disturbed degenerates and satanists. Some TV shows are so mediocre too, you can't help but watch it as if you're drugged and the alternative is thinking about work or bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like your attitude, be angry more than depressed. But of course directed towards the elites (rather than how some people foolishly blame people with no power.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine a world where instead of murders and political two party system horseshit on the news, peoples' creative and intellectual projects are given appreciation and allowed to inspire others. "In other news, a 16 year old has just figured out how to make computers more efficient with this one weird trick!" haha. That would be interesting. I wonder how much damage the invention secrecy act has done in America alone.

       It makes me feel sorry for the YouTuber having to wrap their life around YT and their audience having to be addicted and glued to their screens, often watching stupid crap like zombie sheeple. It's a more extreme vision than I would have expected for YouTube. It's as if something short circuits in the brain's dopamine regulation. I don't have this problem with YT but maybe reddit.....reddit is boring as hell
but I keep using it! :/ Without breaks, it can make you feel sick.

       Depends man, everyone learns differently and it certainly depends also on the subject. I've noticed an improvement of stuff available over the years as new uploaders bring something fresh to the table. I couldn't stand Khan Academy years ago, now I see an improvement in how they teach. Maybe it's subjective or my learning process has changed, who knows. :P

       There are many elitist forces driving the direction of humanity to shit (probably even since ancient Babylonian times). Social engineering, food/medicine/fluoridated water poisoning, corrupt policy makers, propaganda, etc. these all degrade the quality of democratic components of society and degrade intellectual and moral progress. Far better governments have existed and even they weren't that amazing but excellent compared to the shit we have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try not to be cynical because I'm sure a large fraction of humanity is kind hearted and reasonable as I am. Ignorance can be quashed. Full psychopathy armed with money is a bit harder to stop. A few thousand corporate-banking war lords banding together doesn't change that imo. Humanity has not remotely reached it's peak. The rotten top of the pyramid just has ghastly control of the middle and bottom.

       Okay, but I don't see how you can separate anything you typed from humanity, even given that it is true. It's just part of the human condition like your perspective. There's always going to be people trying to elevate themselves for whatever purpose through whatever means.

       Well, yes. But you're just adding to my point with your statement. You can't say that because someone does something bad that they're not part of "humanity's true something." It's all part of the condition, you have to take the good with the bad. Good is no better or truer than the bad.
      </p>

       In fact, eastern philosophy would completely reject this notion that they're somehow divided or distinctly unique things. Yin and yang, can't have light without darkness, the existence of both are required. It takes both to accurately describe what humanity is.

       I agree with you. Extreme individualist ideologies are cancerous. Such as NEOliberalism/far right libertarian ideology (not the same as moderate right/centrist/center left libertarian -- I do not trust the American Libertarian party, they're extremists and Gary was pro-TPP.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course extreme collectivism might be something like serving others at the expense of yourself (being a willing slave or something) which even Jesus Christ would probably say is unnecessary. Some sort of balance is divine. The modern U.S. two party system is totally not balanced. It's a corporatist contest.

       The police aren’t annoying because some black or white racial shit. They’re annoying because they can ruin your life and waste your time. I don’t check my speed every time a cop is around because he’s going to shoot me. I check because I don’t want to waste time dealing with him or the court system he will involve me in.
      </p>
      <p>
       No ones complaining about cops shooting people who were in the act of criminal shit. They’re complaining about being shot for a tail light out. I don’t care either way because my tail lights aren’t out and I don’t engage in criminal activity, but they are annoying.

       People are depressed because of technology. You know the phrase "ignorance is bliss"? Now we have tvs and phones and computers that make sure we know every depressing detail in the world and all the bad things happening where as before most people had an easier time detaching from everything and just living in their own little bubble of life. Now everything is a comparison of social media and popularity and who has what and whos shot who where and what disease is where and its toxic information overload for our brains.

       I also see it as this, say your the best artist in your town/community.  Before the Internet you'd feel that way that you have an amazing skill and other people in your town would acknowledge that.  Now with the Internet you compare yourself with the world, and face it when you compete at a global level you are instantly brought down a huge amount as only so many get to be considered the best.  It's depressing.

       It’s the SM virus. Basically stupid people put fake profiles of a wonderful life they don’t have, copy and paste wisdom they don’t have, share opinions they don’t have. And this infects others around them that equally stupidly follow suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was at a party, it was a Halloween party, it was ok but a pretty stated affair, no one too drunk, no one shagging in the toilets, lines of coke were not snorted off anyone’s tits. Yet the next day I saw pics of this party shared on social media. I swear to god it wasn’t the party I went to, people with their tongues out drinks in hand looking like they were partying to the max, only the best costumed people photoed, v signs and, well basically it looked like a fucking good party. However it wasn’t. Yet anyone looking at those pics would wish thy were there and feel they were somehow not enjoying themselves enough, weren’t sexy enough, were getting it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a false image and I notice it really is the less intelligent that seem to be doing this, so ergo the brighter people are sucked into a stupid world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes it’s all rather depressing.

       Sounds similar to something a friend told me. He was at a bar for his “birthday” and everyone there with him where dull and lifeless.. as soon as he took out his phone and made it look like he was snapchatting the whole thing everyone just had got hype and like “AYYYEEE!!” Like they where having the times of their life.. and immediately AFTER.. back to being lifeless..

       There is still a bunch of acid out there. My group of friends and I have a tradition every year to candyflip at the local waterpark, and every halloween we have an acid horror film binge party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing to be very cautious about regarding lsd is the possibility of research chemicals. Not many people who do acid actually test. Thank god I had the common sense enough to test batches I get.

       Drugs that are chemically tweaked a little bit to skirt substance laws. However, the government finds out about these, ban them, and the companies tweak them even more. There aren't  tested, so they can potentially be very dangerous, and are sold under the strangest guises, such as plant food, bath salts(which are research chemicals) etc. There are a lot of research chemicals that fit on blotters, and are sold as LSD, where people can overdose and die.

       One time a friend of my had her shirt stuck to a kitchen drawer, and when she realized her and her friend started laughing. These two are massive cyberheads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggestively whispered in my friend's ear and said, "Wouldn't this be such a great snapchat moment,"
      </p>
      <p>
       And legit, it looked like he was having an internal battle with himself because he
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       my stance on social media, and he
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       I was purposely dogging him on. And as soon as I left the room I heard them making a commotion- he was filming my friend faking over what she had just done before (yanking her shirt back by getting it stuck on the kitchen drawer); I went back into the room immediately and the second he saw me he looked embarrassed. In my head I was like... (Really.... you're so hooked on the attention you'd even take the bait and film this fake moment?)
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't wait till my generation looks back at how we were today. It's going to be so cringey.

       It’s fear. Just fear of what others think, fear of not being good enough, fear of not fitting in. So that fear drives people to do this, and fear is contagious.

       This is the obvious result of our "selfie" based culture.

      <p>
       I've watched people all to often at social events, pose in extreme ways for effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the eventual pattern of people a hundred years ago, not smiling and just staring into the camera, vs those later on smiling, to now, people posing for ANYTHING.

        Calhoun and his researchers found that in a space-limited/resource  unlimited environment, the population of mice would explode; peak-out  and then collapse to extinction. This test was replicated several times  and it was found that these led to the same outcome each time. The  reason for this phenomenon was found to derived from social decay which  worsened with each generation. The social decay led to unrest in the  environment, which in turn led to

        Newer generations born in the now dysfunctional mouse utopia became  withdrawn, spending their days grooming obsessively and dedicating their  time solely to eating , drinking and sleeping. This generation, for all  the emphasis they placed on grooming, would not reproduce. Moreover,  these mice were noted to be unintelligent compared to previous  generations.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         “…the limit Calhoun imposed on his population [of mice]  was space — and as the population grew, this became increasingly  problematic. As the pens heaved with animals, one of his assistants  described the rodent utopia as having become hell.”

       That scene was the scene that made me want to show this to you.  Knew you'd understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my eyes, the most painful part is how blatantly obvious this piece is, its such a powerful cry for help.  There's a version with music on top saying "are you lost in the world like me?"  How have we gotten to a point in society in which it seems this artist was almost
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       to make this work?  In the post WWII era, artists hit a depression due to current events.  Now, we hide behind glitz and glamor all the depression of society.  Only a few voices dare shout into the abyss.

       Sounds like 80s song. I’m not into social media hardly at all. But I can imagine many people are in that place. I was chatting to a 14 year old yesterday who was into building Lego. He didn’t have many friends. He was a geek but not an internet geek, even the geeks used to hang around in groups playing dungeons and dragons or some stuff like that. Now they just geek out alone on the internet with their friends from South Korea or some place.

       I think the new breed of geekdom is no longer "find the others" but more just a true introversion into their geek out of choice.  I know geeks that are very into the same things, but for some reason it seems more competitive than supportive and thus they introvert more into their own thing which they feel needs to be superior or something.
      </p>

       It's all that whole false presentation thing of talking the talk without walking the walk.  Ironic that new Migos song is all about "walk it like I talk it."  Sure, show me the gold uzis you use to cook up dope that you definitely sell.

       Also a lot of girls and some guys, mostly "instagram models" editing themselves to death than waking up every morning to look in the mirror to realize they don't look remotely anything like their pictures which receive thousands of likes.

       There's monetary value to it. The more attractive you are via Photoshop/Facetune, the more subscribers and likes you get, companies start to reach out to you to promote their laxative "weight loss" teas and teeth whitening kits to your followers. Plus all those instagram likes are addicting and gives your dopamine. But they probably don't realize how deliberating it is to their mental health and self esteem.. where they can't feel good about themselves unless they reach a certain amount of likes on a picture.

       Do you think I could get Pizza Hut to sponsor me with photos of me eating last nights pizza on a hangover ?  So good it will last till morning. (Disclaimer have to have been trashed on shots of tequila and pints of beer the night before to be edible). Yep I may make an approach. Me rolling out of bed looking like Dog shit eating pizza. Can’t see how they’d refuse.  (I’ll edit out the part where I sick it up later in the morning with alcohol poisoning).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah it’s screwed up. I got used to not getting likes in the mandela effect forum so it did me some good tbh, as I can see how it’s nice to appear to have popular views. But that’s the thing. I can see people posting popular views just to get likes. Which ok maybe that’s meant to show how many people agree, but doesn’t really help us get anywhere, as all everyone is doing is trying to impress people they don’t know. It’s bad enough trying to impress people you do know tbh.

       One out of millions of parasites... But the only one that is shared by half of humanity, lives in the brain and causes psychologicall changes in other mamals and is already said to probably also change human behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Toxoplasmosis is the only one (100%) of all parasites we know that this description fits on, so I might argue it has a rather special role compared to all the other millions of parasites and that's why I don't think that at least naming it in a thread like this here wouldn't be all too wrong.

       I didn't know it was the only one we know of (so far) with behavioral changes in mammals. As a resident of France, where 81% of the population is infected compared to 20% in the US, I have to admit it makes a nice scapegoat for cultural frustrations. Sometimes I think the majority of cultural differences are due to the local parasites (/s...but not really).

       It's not the only parasite we know of that changes behaviour, but the only one that is ALSO present in every second human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a study in my country that tested (dead) car drivers who themselfs caused deadly traffic accidents while not being on drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       over 90% of all tested people who killed themselfes and others in traffic while not being drunk or on drugs tested positive for Toxoplasmosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't proof for anything, but I think it's save to say, this parasite should be viewed as one special thing and not as (only 1 of millions of parasites) since there aren't millions of parasites that actually infected 3.5 billion human brains while being known to change behaviour. It's the only one.

       Ah I see , it's the most successful one we could say. Do you know of other parasites that change behavior in mammals (even if rare)? All my research brings up insects and birds but I love learning about this stuff so any leads would be great.

       There are many studies declaring the gut is the second brain. Glad you posted this. This is something people should take very seriously, read more about it and take measures if their diet needs adjusting.

       Most people that say they are depressed aren't actually depressed. very few of them have a legitimate diagnoses, it's all self-diagnosed after a 5 minute online questionnaire.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kinds of people wear their "depression" as a badge of honour, because for some reason, depression has been romanticized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The genuinely depressed are embarrassed and ashamed of their condition, they do not tell people or joke about it because it is ruining their lives.

       Working out, taking nature walks, and spending less time when not at work on a computer really helped my depression.  I notice when I don't follow these simple ideas I also fall back into depression.  Then one quick walk through a trail of woods and I'm back to being happy again.

       People have become too apathetic and inactive. I think social media and smart phones are largely to blame. You can pull yourself out of a depressed mind state, it’s not easy, but you can do it. People just prefer to self-destruct because it’s the path of least resistance.

       Humans, especially in the west, are not living the way humans are supposed to be living. Our technology has perverted our world. Life is unfulfilling, even people who have "made it" are offing themselves.

       Ffs 'the technology' is a lazy answer, tech is an amazing thing and so much of it that you chose to ignore has made our lives far better.

       Think you missed my point. Technology is great and has advanced our world, but is it good for us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Without tech life would be much harder, but it would also be much more rewarding. Imagine being the person responsible for your survival. Hunting and gathering to make sure you have enough to get by. It would be very hard but also very satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
       What constitutes a good life varies from person to person. Some people can't imagine living without our tech, and some live without any tech at all.
      </p>

       I like technology as much as anyone but sometimes I long for the chance to live a different way.

       Personally I just can't agree with you tech is very good for us, imagine having a son who gets sick badly, you take him to a doctor who has no idea what's wrong and gives you some herbs. Or you can go to the doctors we have who will put him in a machine and literally be able to see inside of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with everything there is some tech that isn't great for us and other tech that is awesome, it's all down to how we decide to use it.

       My friend has a theory that the human brain has not evolved fast enough to process the insane uptake of information we now receive/are bombarded with on a daily basis. Kind of like when we started eating cooked meat and our digestion tracts had to catch up. It will take a few generations to catch up.
      </p>

       There is the argument that humans are natural to planet earth so therefore anything we do is natural, our cities, technology, chemicals, pollution, all part of nature, I don't buy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever been anywhere where people live a more rural lifestyle? Small farming community's? Indigenous people's of various lands? From what I have seen these people seem to be happier overall, almost like their lives are more fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you add technology and a western lifestyle to the mix and watch what happens. People become lazy, greedy, materialistic, etc very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have witnessed this 1st hand in a small farming village in central Thailand over the last 12 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say exactly how humans are supposed to be living, but the way we are living just seems off to me like something is missing that we used to have.

       The whole government invented aides or any other virus is just retarded.  We can make chemicals but making full viruses is beyond us right now.  So the idea of them being made and perfected decades ago just wouldn't have happened.

       Also depression leads to realizing how badly you're being fucked in life.  Last thing anyone in charge wants is people noticing that.  It be better to have a happy populous than a desperately depressed one.  You don't want or need things to change when your happy.

       Unless you can find evidence of scientists being able create and 'code' viruses to do what we want how we want yeah.  Most people in this sub are armchair experts on so many subjects that it's absurd. Creating a virus to do something like make people depressed just isn't something you could decide to do.  Especially before the advent of real computer power.  Go look at folding@home they use 100s of thousands of cpus to just run protein folding calculations to find potential cures.  If we could make viruses that do what we want we could make proteins or other molecules for things like cancer and mrsa.

       I've always said it has something to do with the level of stimulus that we're exposed to every single day, day in day out. (Not necessarily just depression, this line of thinking is more tied into anxiety disorders imo)
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about walking around a mall. The colors of lights, the music playing from the stores, even the smells are all designed to be the MOST attention grabbing. Based on stimuli that would have been an evolutionary advantage to notice. We've figured out how to engineer the most intense stimuli for every sense, and we get bombarded from all angles practically all day long. Sure to have some adverse effects...

       It's a huge mixed bag of things. For many it's moving away from nature and doing good inside a community.

       Modern diets will fatten you up, clog up your arteries and restrict the blood your brain gets.
Pollutants will linger in your body and end up in your brain.
Work tends to mean hours a day on a computer doing something you don't care about,
       <a href="http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/">
        bullshit jobs
       </a>
       .
Modern economies require you move 100/1000's miles away from your family/community.
You get taught from a young age that empathy is a bad thing and asking why someone is homeless gets the reply of "that's the way the world is".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you've got a media who wants to get everyone to hate everyone else. Vegans? Fuck them. Muslims? Evil, let's bomb them. Millennials? Boomers? Both evil, hate them. Fat people? Thin people? White? Black? Yanny/loreeal?
We have much more in common that what divides us but you wouldn't know it if you spoke to most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have huge potential to do great things together and we need to start living now in a way that works 7 generations down the line. Plant trees that'll we'll never see fully grown.

       Fair point, I guess mostly we are either trying to make more than we need so we can retire with savings and not have to rely on government to fund our retirement, or we have dependents that we are trying to care for so we need to earn more than we need for ourselves

       The gut is considered a second brain in a way, and it can have a great influence on mood.  Good diet and maintaining quality gut bacteria may have a positive influence.  So if there's a virus or something that could have a mild effect on that or the immune system, I don't see why this theory is implausible.  I've had some bad IBS issues lately that has greatly dropped my quality of life and I find the more I can bring those symptoms under control the more clear headed I feel.  Just something to consider.

       Lyme and Epstein Barr. Lyme can now be spread by flies, mosquitoes and sexual contact—-not just tiny ticks. Epstein Barr is the herpes virus that causes “mono” ( the kissing disease where you get fevers and feel wiped out for weeks as a young person usually.) Both are largely untreated, undiagnosed, and a bitch to cure. Lysine the amino acid along with elderberry extract can help the Epstein Barr because lysine goes after all forms of herpes. With Lyme, you’re dealing with an ebb and flow of acute infection ( which sometimes presents with fever and a bulls eye rash, but not akways) and chronic infection. Just about everyone, especially in a culture that praises young people having endless partners, friends with benefits, and the hookup culture.

       Was just talking to my brother last night about how electronic devices could be causing depression and anxiety amongst humans.  Given humans operate on such a thin spectrum/frequency, an e-device’s RF waves could be interfering with our operating system.  Since the 50s (beginning of our tech boom), depression and anxiety have been on an upswing.  Since the inception of the cell phones, more and more are being surrounded by RF waves and, surely enough, more and more cases of anxiety and depression are being announced.  Just a hypothesis...

       Trojan horse 5G....kill it with fire! Some have speculated even more nefarious uses other than damaging us more. They claim it could allow for mind control through towers. That doesn't seem too far fetched if you consider the possibility that current tech with radiation might be already making us ill/depressed like docile sheeple. "Bow down to your new dictator, you'll feel so much better". Who knows if it goes even deeper than that. Reading our minds?? I shudder to think....but the radiation itself is concern enough.

       I think this is ironic. I think we've colonized ourselves in every single way. The fact that people say shit like, "I'm

       The cause of depression is often what we put on and in our bodies. All those chemicals affect our hormones and make us unhappy. Try going organic and living healthier and you'll see how your mood hightens. Meditation and working out also changes the hormones in a good way.

       Could be, but I doubt it. People are depressed because they have no real purpose. No real reason to wake up every day. They're not in enough danger and there's not enough direct affirmation in their day-to-day activities letting them know they're doing the correct things to survive. Surviving is too easy. Everything is disposable. We have to create reasons to be upset, to rally around, everything that engages our primal instincts is based on simulation (sports). Look at leftist behavior and ideology and see how... empty it is but how much it is ruling our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can pretend they're happy with empty things. But inside, in the quiet, when it's dark and we're alone, we can't hide from the truth anymore. We pretend it's not lurking around the corner as we drift off to sleep to do it all again tomorrow.

       There's too many confounding variables. And also how would depression help a virus spread itself? Depression usually causes people to withdraw from others. Maybe if it caused people to commit suicide in a terrible way like blow their virus infested brains out on people or drown themselves in drinking water...?

       Because it's a biological glitch in the production of chemicals, it's always affected us to a certain degree, maybe more situationally in the distant past than how chronic it is in todays age, but now we have studied it enough to diagnose. Add in the increasing struggles of life as the population expands and it becomes chronic.

       It’s what society has become and what it focuses on and how most things preached that you need a happy life are unobtainable to a majority of the population.  People aren’t valued for their work in most cases and minimum wage is impossible to actually live off of. Greed and money have become the god in which most of the modern world serves. We did it all to ourselves and drive the point home harder and harder by focusing on the awful news in the world with no one offer solutions except to fill their pockets and empty the average persons.

       The ego causes ALL suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are all born into sin (ego).
      </p>
      <p>
       That which tempts, that which hijacks control, and that which believes it will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black cube a lot of you speak about is symbolic for “chaos and ignorance”. 
All of you are living within the black cube. Completely unaware of everything around you, including the many energies that can be engaged with.
This is one of the reasons as to why psychological programming exists. Keeping you operating through the ego and not through your true self.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one operates through their true self (not an archetype) such evil and selfishness would be annihilated. This is where the saying of being away from god is evil comes from. Because it truly is when you have direct experience and not second hand knowledge.
Think of it like being a baby, the baby does not understand hatred or anger, it does understand love though. Your true nature is at its least distorted self when as a baby. The brains filtering processes have yet to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of you will not understand or want to, due to your psychic structures being too solidified and your ego creating many arguments and distortions.
      </p>
      <p>
       All regions hold part of the truth. All distorted by the ego that desires to protect itself. 
When mentioning religion, I refer more to the essence within all religions and not the uneducated ways of living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is on the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cross = open cube
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus on the cross represents ascension to the higher, correction of the human and out of 3D reality. It is wise to keep in mind that all is perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want the world to change? 
Start with yourself. Be honest with yourself and accept that all humans make mistakes and most human beings, including yourself, have been hijacked by an non-real entity. It wants more and more, never satisfied. All propagated and sustained through fear. The use of fear to control the ego is how all of you are kept in check within this declining civilisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who will sacrifice their comfort and lives for a better future? The answer is most of you will not. 
Some of you will say yes but chances are you have just gone into a or several archetypes (normally the Warrior, the One). If you were not controlled by the ego, through fear, you would understand that altruism is the only meaningful thing you could be doing down here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seven deadly sins are all born out of the ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it matters not what those around you say. 
Truth through direct experience is the only way to understand. 
Several ways to get direct experience;
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditate 
Psychedelic trip (very useful when one needs to -see- the higher process’ or engage with deeper layers of reality) 
Fasting
      </p>
      <p>
       Try it. 
Don’t come up with an argument, that’s your ego again.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the worst thing that could happen meditating in a corner for 10 minutes everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those here who seek a real spiritual path: don’t talk, don’t get lost within concepts, just do the required work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If none of you believe this, that’s ok but I’ll leave you with this;
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow every thought you have backwards. Tell me, where do you find yourself?

       It's not only the physical environment people live in. It's also about how their view of the world has developed. For most people a lack of real meaning, direction, and certainty are by and large the main causes of anxiety and depression in a lot of people.

       In America, in the 1950’s, a man could work in retail or manufacturing, and earn enough money to afford a small house, car, food, and other essentials so his wife could stay home, and raise their children. The family might go on vacation once a year. The father would come home from work, after an 8-hour shift, and enjoy being with his family, maybe tossing a baseball to his kids, who played outside, until it got dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       The family would save up for large purchases, such as appliances or a new car. While healthcare wasn’t particularly advanced, most people weren’t concerned about going bankrupt because they were having a baby, needed an appendectomy or medication for a chronic illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       At one time, General Motors was the largest employer in America, paying in today’s dollars around $50 per hour. Today, the largest employer in America is Wal-Mart, which pays $7-$10 per hour with few benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Americans have always faced challenges – including in the 50’s – today’s jeopardize the welfare and contentment of great swaths of people who live in poverty (46 million Americans), have severe food insecurities (over 14% of US households), don’t have sufficient housing, and access to healthcare (including care for minor episodes of depression). They live in towns and cities of all sizes, yearning to pull themselves out of their predicaments, but unable to secure higher paying jobs, obtain additional education, afford childcare, pay-down mounting debt, recover from bankruptcies or foreclosures, and pay for necessary medical care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopelessness and depression is a way of life for these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a step up the economic ladder are people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, one calamity away from losing their home or being contacted by bill collectors. They too experience depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who are on higher rungs, are also wrought with depression, feeling the pressure to work longer hours, be available on weekends and evenings respond to work emails or learn new skills to dodge being laid-off. Maybe they already lost their jobs, and are now working for less money (and few to no benefits) as a contingent or temporary worker. They might have multiple loans to pay for education, health expenses, household and car repairs. Perhaps, they’re paying the mortgage on a house “under water.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding to peoples’ anxiety is seeing how people with more money and resources live. Dissatisfaction can lead to depression.

       I think NSC-68 is most to blame for the economic shift we have both long been interested in. Basically, during WWII, FDR was able to control the economy such that millions of women were put into the work force for the first time. At the end of the war, the military-industrial complex feared being surpassed economically by the feminist communists, who put both women and men to work. How could the United States force women to stay in the workforce? The answer was to dilute the currency so that in order to "keep up with the Jones's" and maintain the same material standard of living, women increasingly had to work outside the home. This was also the origin time of the factory-like schools that prepared workers for big companies with huge armies of employees (the model we still have that is completely failing now).

       Yes. That virus is apathy. People have no purpose. Religion and any deep personal beliefs have been destroyed with marketing. Overweight, standing in line staring at their impossibly self important and pointless text, waiting to purchase overprived caffeinated sugar dinner, which they can’t really afford but don’t realize because “hey is only 7 bucks!” People don’t realize they are filling their entire being with the wages of apathy.

       Human DNA is up to 8% (max) virus in some people. I think about viruses a lot. I think they cause a lot of problems, obviously. There are some weird NW native American herbs that will knock all viruses out of your body, but it can cause these creepy skin lesions the first time taking it.

       I agree with you, yet the guy above you is right too because while your average Jewish person is probably not involved with any world take over plans or secret cabals, there is a faction that is. It gets complicated throughout history but the people who are at the top of this pyramid are people from that faith who have mixed it with other beliefs to become the nefarious, global slave owners we have now.

       I feel ya. I don't think any of us regular folks really know the whole truth behind these groups of people who have controlled humanity over time. It's difficult to find truth while trying to weed out any false leads or misinformation, since none of us were alive, we just have to dig further and rely on trustworthy people who want the same truth. I like your style, my friend, we must search for the truth while keeping an open mind. Have a great day!
