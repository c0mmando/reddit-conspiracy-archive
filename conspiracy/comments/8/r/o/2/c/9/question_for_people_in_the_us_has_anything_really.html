       I feel like everyday I hear about how Trump is destroying our country, or how the left is destroying our country, or insert whatever polictical group is ruining our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me though nothing ever really changes idk. I mean sometimes I feel like it doesn't matter what so ever who is running our country or what, shit never really changes. No matter what movement sparks up, whatever new political ideas are the flavor of the month, nothing seems to ever really change. I'm 20, so obviously I haven't had a whole lot of life experiences, but once Trump got elected idk why I thought a bunch of shit was gonna change or something, but all that has happened is everywhere around me is hiring for some reason, and I pay less taxes on my paycheck each week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say the economy crashes, is that even something that is Trump's fault? Was it Obama's fault when the economy crashed in 08? Was it someone else's? Or is it just the nature of bubbles in the market popping and economies are bound to crash and spike and crash and spike? Are we just gonna keep progressing little by little and that's really it? I feel like unless a catastrophic natural disaster occurs, the US, and society as a whole is probably just gonna keep trucking along at a steady pace, and idk why so many people are always freaking out about the fate of humanity.

       As for now, grocery prices, up gasoline and car and car repair costs are up, housing costs are up,

       The internet has been handed over to the control of the ISPs, and more rights have been lost,

       There are persistent attacks on fact based information, our individual rights, long standing programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid not to mention the ACA.

       Thank you. "More jobs" don't mean anything if the wages aren't keeping up with the cost of living (and don't even get me started on how grocery prices aren't actually counted in inflation rates). People having to have 3 jobs to keep a roof over their head doesn't mean "better" at all.

       The rest of what you speak of is equally worse. And headed towards even more so.

       This is "their" newest tactic, often when asked to back up a claim or provide evidence - they proclaim that they know your intentions (and that they're bad or you're debating not in good faith or something similar) and that they don't want to discuss anything further.
      </p>
      <p>
       It completely shuts down conversation (meaning they don't ever have to give you that evidence or prove that claim they made), makes them feel as though they're winning, and subtly calls the other poster a shill.

       This is honestly retarded. Trump is directly responsible for appointing Pruitt, Devos, FCC Head (Ajit Pai), etc.. Obviously if you do your research you will realize that Devos is a dumbass who bought her way to the top. She is the Head of Education. Look up youtube videos. Directly appointed by Trump.

       Same can be said about the others.. We don't see change until it's too late to go back. 4-5 year from now we are going to be living in a corporate shithole with the richest controlling the poor. It's looking like a bleak future with the way things are being handled.

       LOL you think there is a coordinated effort to resist anything he does?  Maybe you dont know what the words coordinated or resist actually mean.
Trump only won because the democrats got stupid and uncoordinated, and all trump is trying to do is ride out his president keeping people uncoordinated by means of doing absolutely mentally vacant bullshit meant to get attention.
What did they resist? 
Him trying to give the leader of north korea a reach around?
       <br/>
       If anything there has been a coordinated effort by the GOParty to resist any change.  Theyve been moderately successful only because the other side is so uncoordinated.  But Trump is loser to be honest.  In fact, all Trump has managed to do is make the GOP even LESS coordinated.  They messed up pretty bad electing him because even at the worst its shifting the needle away from what decent good hardworking people actually agree with so that the GOP now looks like the serial white supremacist pedophile party who puts the country in debt again.  Nobody is resisting Trump.  He doesn't do anything.  But stupid people do stuff.  And we should resist being stupid.

       I guess I don't understand what change you want.  You said 20 years and in my last 20 years I've done grad school had a  mental breakdown and then rebuilt my life and may be approaching a sendse of happiness where I never had it before.

       And in general I've watched weed get fucking basically legalized, gay people get equal rights, technology explode and the internet arrive and a million other wonderful things.

       things change. you live in a really special time. I can look back on 2010 and be like- that was such a different fucking time from today- and its true. it was. we're about to enter the 2020s... think about that. its been two decades since we entered 2000, the 21st-frickin-century, Y2K, the twin towers- whatever symbols of the time that was.
      </p>
      <p>
       1/5th of the 21st century has passed. And you and I have been lucky enough to live through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time is a blessing. The one thing that hasnt changed is humans getting by. You're right about that- that there's this impending feeling of doom that's consistently being perpetuated in pop culture. It's like that for a reason- because of the time we live in. What can you do create a new feature. The present is full of possibilities. If you see nothing changing- do something.

       President Trump is doing the best he can, but he does have two parties plus the NWO working against him. He's already fulfilled the promises he can directly on his own and he's worked or completed other promises he made.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President is more of a figurehead position than anything else.

       I live on a military base outside the states. The commander in chief pics have changed. There is more construction happening on the base. For awhile there was a hiring freeze (3 or so months) so a lot of government agencies on base were ‘short staffed’. When the hiring freeze was lifted, budgets were also slashed. So a lot of agencies remained ‘understaffed’. I use quotes because even though these agencies’ budgets have been cut, as a civilian i can still see the frivolous nature of many of these agencies. There are about 5 or six people on the base who make about 50+k plus housing, and all the other benefits to just drive around and check there are no hazardous materials in the trash cans and dumpsters. Other changes I’ve noticed is just a general divisiveness and arrogant attitudes of friends and neighbors. Either someone feels they have to defend their beliefs or discredit another person’s beliefs. Going out to dinner with friends has become cumbersome, because before inviting friends, I have to figure out if trump had done anything controversial, who would be set off by this if it comes up in conversation, how much alcohol is involved. Other than that nothing has really changed for my family and I.

       It wouldn't be excessive if that money was used for the taxpayers' benefit. With that money we could have the best schools in the world, the best healthcare in the world, we could eliminate poverty, and so on. Instead, we pay directly into the pockets of corrupt politicians.

       Income taxes can easily be used to serve the people, but property tax is just greed. There is no ethical reason to tax somebody for something that is already bought and paid for.

       I agree with you on property but income is the same imo. The government has no right to a cut of a transaction between two independent citizens, and we were just fine without it before 1913. Also, there is a strong argument to be made that the 16th amendment is unconstitutional. Only a consumption tax can be truly ethical imo.

       If the consumption tax is high enough to serve the interests of the people then I can agree with cutting out income tax. It certainly would simplify things, anyway, and simpler is usually better in matters of finance. Bureaucracy can get needlessly expensive.

       You pay to live on the electrical grid &amp; its achoice.  You can do what my grandmother did.  You can give up your comforts.  You can grow your own food. Raise chicken.  Raise animals to kill for food.  Get on a farm away from it all.  Trade &amp; barter.  Everyone is looking for someone else to blame.  This is a choice.  My grandmother thinks the best inventions in her life are air conditioning &amp; the microwave.  If you live in the developed world your life is really easy as shit &amp; anyone that bitches is ungrateful.

       So we should all be eternally grateful to live the rest of our years and not complain because we can live a life of comfort on $200 worth of appliances? I get what you’re saying but there comes a point in human evolution where the new standard gets raised up. It’s not that people are spoiled it’s that the standard has been raised. That’s a good thing! That means things should technically just get better and if they don’t, then it’s our jobs as citizens to point out the corruption. People that live and use today’s modern conveniences aren’t all taking advantage of it and are spoiled shits.You seem like the same type of person that would argue that a person that has a smart phone clearly doesn’t need food stamps when everybody and their fucking mom now has a cell phone. Having a smart phone isn’t even an indication of wealth these days. People chop other peoples heads off in Africa in poverty stricken towns and guess what they record it on? A smart phone! Times change. It’s not bad to want better things for yourself. Yes we all need to work for these things but do we really need to spend several years of our lives paying them off? Education is one of those things to me that is highly overpriced. If there’s people that would think I’m some entitled millennial when quite frankly I just think education should be free because of how Connected we all are today. There’s literally no reason to spend millions if not billions of dollars for schools. A lot of the money we all know doesn’t even go to where it supposed to. And charging $300 a book should be criminal. to constantly think that humanity needs to put a price tag on everything is going to lead to humanities downfall. And only further hinders human progression

       That is complete fucking bullshit.  If you live in the developed world you currently live in the safest &amp; easiest period of time humanity has ever experienced.  Average life expectancy is the highest its ever been.  To suggest we somehow have it harder than we did even 30 years ago is fucking ridiculous.  My fucking parents had to work in factories that have now moved to china.  That shit wasnt fucking easy but it did pay decent.  I was the first in my family to get a college degree &amp; my life is easier than the shit my parents lived through.  I also had way more options than they did.

       When my parents were born, fewer than 5% of children were born to an unwed mother, and fewer than 10% lived with a single parent. Now more than 40% of children are born to an unwed mother, and 1/3 live with a single parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my parents were children, it was common sense that one should eat a high fat whole food diet with plenty of meat. Fewer than 1% of people had diabetes. Now our dietary guidelines are bought and paid for by sugary junk food manufacturers. Nearly 10% of people have diabetes, and obesity rates have more than doubled.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my parents were growing up, they had home cooked meals every day and their parents raised them directly. Now the norm is pre-packaged food and uninvolved parenting with daycare, schools, and the media doing most of the raising.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my parents were young adults, college was 10x cheaper than it is now, and a bachelor's degree could all but guarantee a decent job. Now there are people with master's degrees working as unskilled laborers because they can't find work in their field.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my parents were young adults, a factory job could modestly support an entire family. Now most factory jobs pay so little that they're regarded as a form of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my parents were young adults, one could walk right into an establishment and ask if they had a job opening. Now one must apply online and often compete with hundreds of others for the same position.

       We have prediabetic children, we have school shootings, we have extreme partisan politics, we have 1 in 6 people taking antidepressants, we have 6 figures of debt for the average household, we have 0.7% of our population in prison... There are certainly things that are better now, and I don't think any sane individual would argue otherwise, but the
       <em>
        overall
       </em>
       quality of life is going down.

       I'll call bullshit back! My grandmother is 95. When she was born she lived on a beautiful street in Chicago with a library and glass arboretum. Now the entire place is crawling with diversity. They took over the neighborhood and had destroyed it within a decade. Every other house was foreclosed, a brick thrown through every window of the library, the greenhouse shattered to a million pieces. The quality of life went to zero in the blink of an eye. So many people have no idea how good life was 100 years ago.

       My grandmother is in her 80’s &amp; born on a farm in southern illinois.  She didnt have running water &amp; plumbing till she moved to Cleveland in her 20’s.  This area of chicago you are referencing... pretty sure these ppl living there now are shitting in an outhouse washing their ass with their hand &amp; water when they are done.  The access to healthcare they have is still exponentionally better than my grandmother &amp; yours had access to.  You are totally brainwashed if you think its harder for anyone in the US now than it was 100 years ago.

       You're taking the criteria "harder" and applying it to all aspects of life evenly. Of course sertain things have gotten better and certain things have gotten worse. It's a matter of opinion depending on what specific things are important to you. Maybe some people aren't happy trading national homogeneity for iPads. Maybe you have a different take on it. It's all subjective.

       I think for things like Presidential impact are not able to be fully evaluated until you are removed from the time period in which that presidency occured. Most Presidents are embodied very differently after they are out of the white house and America is able to see it in retrospect. Overall, I do not believe there have been major changes since he became President. I believe there is just a lot of mass hysteria around his presidency which makes it seem like America is in flames and we are all going to die. Yet to be determined on if that is true.
      </p>

       Now on to questions I can actually answer. The economy crash of 2008 wasn't Obama's fault. It was the fault of bank lobbyists and money being funded for campaigns of senators by third party people to get legislation passed to deregulate the financial industry. You just had a lot of assholes that wanted more money to line their pockets and weren't concerned about who's livelihoods they would fuck with. It is very rarely a President's fault when something with the economy goes badly. There is generally always someone or many someones digging into money pots and ensuring bills will be passed in the senate to earn them the most money while stealing from the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for progression in America, it's hard to predict what is going to happen. Unfortunately things are so askew on television about the state of our country that it's hard to tell if we are successful or failing. I'd like to believe that things aren't as bad as they make it out to be. For the first time in history there are more job openings than there are people looking for jobs, NK is looking like there might be some hope of denuclearization, and more money is going in your pocket instead of to taxes every week. There is more good stuff too but this is just recent stuff I can remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 25 and I think there are two huge events that changed this country. 9/11 and Trump being elected. I feel Trump on some level will have an impact on the country in the sense that things will not return to normal after he is gone. Just as the country did not return to normal after the towers fell and the rubble was cleared away. You could say we took steps backwards in a lot of sense after 9/11 and we took many steps forward as well. I think the same could be said and will be said when Trump is gone. I mean, look at what it has done to this subreddit alone. We can't even talk about the moon being hollow anymore because everything has to be about Trump all the time. I can't see our social media accounts ever going back to just being pictures of cats and dogs. Will it be for better or worse, I really couldn't say.

       HSBC got caught laundering money for mexican drug cartels.  El chapo got extradited after this &amp; the bankers got fines from limp dick Obama.  Citigroup selected Obama’s cabinet b/c he was the first prez to spend 1 bil to win.  Trump spent far less than Hillary &amp; still beat her &amp; the Bush’s.  Obama was also Warren Buffett’s puppet &amp; helped Buffett/John Kerry get rich together by blocking oil pipelines so Buffett could transport the oil vis his train business.  While Kerry was Sec of State Buffett purchased a majority share of Heinz Kraft.  Kerry married a Heinz that inherited her wealth from her Heinz politician husband that died in a airplane crash when a helicopter crashed into the airplane trying to fix its landing gear.  Kerry has known Robert Mueller since they went to yuppie prep school toether &amp; played on many of the same sports teams.  Kerry was skull &amp; bones w/ GW Bush.  Kerry/Mueller helped the Bush’s cover up the BCCI banking scamdal that involved the Bushs/Bin Ladens/CIA/Hussein/Iran Contra doing real shady shit.  So either Obama was the dumbest fucking president ever &amp; doesnt know how to use the internet or he is part of the Bush/Clinton crime families... please tell me again how he isnt responsible.

       Well, banks don't appoint cabinet members for one. Michael Froman was on Obama's transition team, yes. However that is merely logical considering that the industry was breaking down at that time period. For all of Obama's fuck ups - and there were plenty - Obama knew (probably from those connections you stated previously) there were a large majority of people that wanted to see the financial system fail because they would reap HUGE benefits from it. But in knowing this he chose to help turn the economy around during his eight years. Which is why we didn't go into a depression part 2 and are doing so well today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't beat Hillary because of the money. Trump beat Hillary because she couldn't get out of her own way. The DNC tried everything they could to get her to win and she STILL couldn't do it. If Trump had to run against anyone else in that election he most likely would have lost. But that is speculation, and not relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Buffett thing is correct but that has literally zero to do with the economic collapse of 2008? Besides Buffett making a shit ton of money from it. The pipeline scamming didn't start until 2010ish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what Kerry marrying a Heinz girl has to do with anything at all, let alone 2008, or Obama. However, yes, he is a total fucking scumbag. Hunts ketchup all the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually nothing else you say at this point has anything to do with the topic at hand. Yes, Bush and Kerry were helping out each other politically. Yes, pretty much every person to ever be in the presidency, senate, cabin, etc has done horrific things that most Americans would be shocked to learn in the name of power and money. But those things aren't a new revelation and had nothing to contribute to the economic crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why bring shitty people to your administration? Mostly because there aren't any NOT shitty people in politics. That's how they got involved in politics - by being shitty people. Duh.

       Long story short, as a wise homeless man once told me: "ain't nothing changed in America but the year".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you feel like Donald was gonna change a bunch of stuff and now are let down is simple. Every politician throughout American history has advisors who tell them exactly what inspirational BS talking points to use to get people to vote. Trump was the first  president since arguably Reagan to come from outside the "political establishment", thus his BS talking points about draining the swamp had way more potential creedence than your typical candidate. In fact, I'm sure advisors told him that the growing trend of dissatisfaction with government inadequacies and corruption, compounded by growing poverty, made this election cycle specifically ripe for his brand of bullshit. There was never any real intent to deviate from the status quo, but his false promises were more promising than anyone in recent history because of his nonpolitical background. That, and he employed the use of cambridge analytica and an army of internet trolls which were designed to flood the internet with rumors that we were actually going to act on Clintons longstanding political corruption. Of course none of this was true, it was all a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of your comment...no, nothing will change with our economy, we will just keep borrowing and kicking the can down the road to continue the lifestyle to which Americans have become accustomed. Yes poverty is growing and social services are shrinking, but this will ebb and flow like everything else. The only major change is the petrodollar ceasing to be the only currency which dominates global oil trade (with Chinas petroyuan quickly becoming a rival). As it stands currently,  America can run up infinite debt because all nations around the world are forced to buy our debt to obtain US dollars before they can buy oil. China may take our place as the dominant cartel in this scheme, but it wont affect everyday Americans however. The only consequence will be that our credit rating may become downgraded and we may be forced to sell off large amounts of our infrastructure and natural resources to multinational corporations. This is why you see such a big push by trump to deregulate the energy industry, he realizes that the quicker we become energy independent and start massively exporting fossil fuels, the quicker America can get back to business as usual.
This whole petrodollar thing would be a problem for other nations (like in south America) were it not for our vast military power. This is the reason that the  predominant neoconservative strategy moving into this century was to build up as much military force as possible. (See the thinktank Project for the new American century's statement about the need for a "new pearl harbor" to catalyze the effort to "rebuild Americas defenses"). As Kissinger and Nixon showed, as long as the American people ar willing to be complicit in passively allowing the continued invasion of any country which seeks to jeopardize our financial/corporate standing in the world, America will be able to continue to borrow ad infinitum because we have such immense leverage in international negotiations due to our willingness to use our military in such coercive ways. This is why we support Saudi Arabia and the gulf states, and force regime change in any nation who seeks to change the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, nothing is gonna change.

       Little things happen all the time that affect or in the future will affect your way of life to some degree. Mostly these things go unnoticed, hence why nothing big seems to be occurring at present. The important things happen in the background with little or no mention by the msm. It’s the cumulative effect that gets you in the end.

       Trump didn't beat Hillary because of the money. Trump beat Hillary because she couldn't get out of her own way. The DNC tried everything they could to get her to win and she STILL couldn't do it. If Trump had to run against anyone else in that election he most likely would have lost. But that is speculation, and not relevant.

       The Buffett thing is correct but that has literally zero to do with the economic collapse of 2008? Besides Buffett making a shit ton of money from it. The pipeline scamming didn't start until 2010ish.

       Not sure what Kerry marrying a Heinz girl has to do with anything at all, let alone 2008, or Obama. However, yes, he is a total fucking scumbag. Hunts ketchup all the way.

       Actually nothing else you say at this point has anything to do with the topic at hand. Yes, Bush and Kerry were helping out each other politically. Yes, pretty much every person to ever be in the presidency, senate, cabin, etc has done horrific things that most Americans would be shocked to learn in the name of power and money. But those things aren't a new revelation and had nothing to contribute to the economic crisis.

       Why bring shitty people to your administration? Mostly because there aren't any NOT shitty people in politics. That's how they got involved in politics - by being shitty people. Duh.
