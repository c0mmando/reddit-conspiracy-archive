        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not suggesting that the entire thing is fake, but sometimes some of the stuff the players do don&#39;t look all that real to me.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently watching the WC Portugal v Spain. And the score was 2-1 with Portugal leading at half time.</p>

<p>The next half Spain scored two goals and were leading up until at the 88th minute Sergio Busquets came in and did a foul which really looked a bit fake. And then of course Cristiano Ronaldo scores a great curve ball.</p>

<p>And this was just one example and there are surely more.</p>

<p>I may be completely wrong in all this but it&#39;s still very interesting... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you mean that other sport where they can give the players or the ref special glasses with a cell phone style camera that can immerse the audience more into the game but they don&#39;t because you would see the choreography?,,,nooo not that thing that makes millions if not billions of dollars for top egos that have a nature of not ever leaving money making decisions to chance because of control issue....i could say yes its as fake as wrestling and american football but a sarcastic delivery is more fun to read..watch Speed Racer for the cartoony explanation but in real life ur just fuhq&#39;t..and to the responder that will say &quot;you don&#39;t really know thats conjecture based on opinion&quot;...video editor for major sports and many other things in the past..its fixed, ur watching slaves to more numbered paper than you..go fishing..even if you don&#39;t catch anything its a win because of quiet beer drinking</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the 80&#39;s and so, players would place bets in games they were playing on stuff like, time of first throw in, time of first corner ect ect.</p>

<p>Bruce Grobalar (spelling) Liverpool was caught on camera buy the Sun newspaper stating he threw games while playing in goal for liverpool.</p>

<p>George Graham of Arsenal, accepted a bung of 500k to buy a Danish Player called John Jensen, pure much so he was.</p>

<p>In today&#39;s world, look at the Likes of Barcalona and the games they should have lost in the Champions Leage, the referring decisions that were made would lead one to think the whole fucking this is fixed. Football / Soccer is my passion and without a doubt there is a huge &quot;Fixed&quot; Influence and industry, how deep it goes, who knows. </p>

<p>Sure Fifa is a corrupted as fuck, who want to see a World Cup in Qutar? A fucking shithole of a country no matter how you look at it, all $$$$$4 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can call it soccer if you want, but you are in a minority. There are many different types of football (Association Football, Rugby Union Football, Rugby League Football, Gaelic Football, Australian Rules Football, American Football etc). </p>

<p>However, the first to be codified, the most played, the most watched and the most commonly referred to &quot;football&quot; is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">Association Football</a>. American Football is a johny-come-lately member of the football family, derived closely from Rugby Union Football.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Players do dive. And there has been history of players trying to influence games (for their team to lose, as it&#39;s way easier to lose than win). </p>

<p>deGea&#39;s fumble into the net could arguably be classed as deliberate, but the Ronaldo free-kick was one of pure skill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These guys at this level are masters of their craft, both in handling and shooting the ball and drawing fouls. Nacho&#39;s foul in the box on Ronaldo (and resulting PK) was manufactured to some extent by Ronaldo thru the direction of his run and his body and leg placement. </p>

<p>These two guys just got done playing a very long, Champions League-winning, season. They know each other very well and have practiced together so much. Yet Ronaldo ensured he was placed in such a manner as to get fouled by Nacho or force the ref and VAR to make a call very early in the game because he was going down either way. </p>

<p>This is a fine showcase of Ronaldo&#39;s skill in getting fouled in meaningful places and times of the game. Just as Busquets got goaded into fouling and creating a free kick in a dangerous area. He was relatively fresh on the field and playing &#39;catch up&#39; mentally. Players tend to do &#39;dumb&#39; things in this situation and he did.</p>

<p>If you followed Real Madrid this past season you&#39;d have seen that Ronaldo hasn&#39;t hit these kinds of free kicks for crap this year. This take was very much not a sure thing based on his performance this year. I am glad that he could be a clutch player in his last world cup and nail that shot. It was sweet to see as a neutral that appreciates the beautiful parts of this game. </p>

<p>Now if you want to talk match fixing via refs, coaches and players, that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother kettle of fish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the major sports are rigged.. why would they leave something involving that much money up to chance?  Why would they let players have actual power?</p>

<p>People don&#39;t know the history, but Baseball - the first major professional sporting league - started out completely scripted, like pro-wrestling.  Check it out - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Garden-Eden-Secret-History/dp/0743294041">https://www.amazon.com/Baseball-Garden-Eden-Secret-History/dp/0743294041</a></p>

<p>If it started out totally scripted, when did it become genuine?</p>

<p>If you follow NBA closely you should be familiar with numerous scandals including playoff series fixes, referees being involved - they even openly discuss which refs are officiating games now because it has a huge impact on which teams win.</p>

<p>There are huge amounts of scandals involving fixing and scripted games in all the major sports - I would be shocked if there is any genuine competition above the collegiate level, and I venture to say it&#39;s silly to assume it&#39;s not fixed there too.</p>

<p>Speculation, but I would assume sports championships are given to cities that serve whatever the larger agenda at the time.  That&#39;s sort of how it appears at a glance in America anyway - at least from my perspective.</p>

<p>The fact they still let players get blown by the wind and roll 20 yards down the pitch is what makes the game unwatchable.
It looks silly...makes the game look cheap and reinforces players to keep doing it.
As long as they continue to let players get away with it the longer people roll their eyes and not take it seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, but god I wish I had. Didn&#39;t realize until way too late in life this is exactly the sport I would have wanted to play. Hard to explain why that is, but i&#39;m a serious runner, and the kind of goofing off I do when I run makes me think I missed my calling. I&#39;ll run like 8 miles kicking a pine cone back and forth seeing how long I can keep the thing from touching the ground, ends up being a very soccer-like activity, makes the run murderously hard too haha. I do a fair bit of parkourish stuff as I run too. I sorta get off on endurance and agility, and my feet are ridiculously coordinated. The idea of running as fast as I can doing goofy acrobatic shit to kick a ball around just sounds like the best thing ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was having the same thought after watching France-Australia. France scored first, and then, a couple of minutes later, a French player did a foul (Australian player kicked towards the goal, and French player jumps up in an attempt to stop the ball, but he did it with arms raised, as if he was the goal keeper or playing volley-ball or something). I find it hard to believe this sort of stupid things can happen at that level of the game. Next the camera was obviously zooming on that player, and his reaction looked really fake. He didn&#39;t genuinely look upset or mad with himself. </p>

<p>I would add that not long ago, we learned that some Singapore based guys were rigging the football games, including at the highest levels. Look it up on google. So, yeah, with the kind of money involved in this sport, unfortunately, you can expect little room left for randomness of results and authenticity of the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. This is just how football is. I’ve played football all my life and things happen at every level of play like this. Even 6 a side.</p>

<p>It’s hard to put into words why these things feel scripted. There’s a certain momentum to football that surpasses the physical aspect of the game. Sometimes you just know something great is going to happen, much like Ronaldos free kick. You could just feel it in the air. There was never any doubt. And anyone who had played the game has seen something like this happen. If we want to go into conspiracies, it’s probably a precognitive feeling based on a highly observed and charged emotional event (think 9/11 precognitions). </p>

<p>There’s a reason football is called the greatest drama on earth </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FIFA administration has been riddled with corruption, so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if this institutional corruption also manifested itself on the pitch. </p>

<p>The Spain-Portugal draw was a reasonable reason for both teams, as both teams are likely to qualify for the next round. However, the match looked clean to me - I really don&#39;t think it was rigged.</p>

<p>The World Cup has had match-fixing scandals over the years, however. The 1998 World Cup in France was rigged - Michel Platini acknowledged that the host team had been given an easy ride into the Final. </p>

<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/platini-admits-draw-for-1998-world-cup-was-fixed-so-france-faced-brazil-in-final-11377566">https://news.sky.com/story/platini-admits-draw-for-1998-world-cup-was-fixed-so-france-faced-brazil-in-final-11377566</a></p>

<p>However, this admission was a &quot;limited hangout&quot;. I am personally convinced the result of the final of the 1998 World Cup, in Paris, between France and Brazil was also rigged - and was probably the greatest single deception in the history of sport.</p>

<p>Brazil were the hot favourites, but France&#39;s win was pre-agreed between FIFA and the French and Brazilian football federations. France, the hosts, had never won the World Cup and were desperate for a home victory (as were FIFA, for commercial reasons). Brazil had already lifted the Trophy 4 times, and were persuaded to &quot;stand down&quot; in return for a clear run in 2002 World Cup (which they duly won) and the right to host the World Cup in the near future (actually delayed until 2014 because they weren&#39;t ready).</p>

<p>In my view, the French players weren&#39;t told of the fix in advance, but the Brazilian players were told they had to lose the match. They were naturally extremely unhappy about it, and it resulted in a very odd incident regarding the Brazil&#39;s star player, Ronaldo, which resulted in him apparently being sedated and taken to hospital the night before the match. His name was removed from the team list, but reinstated just before the match. </p>

<p>The theory is that he initially refused to go along with the charade, but was threatened by the Brazilian federation and his sponsor Nike, with repercussions if he didn&#39;t play. He did finally play, and like the rest of the team, put in a very listless, uncompetitive performance, giving France a famous victory.</p>
