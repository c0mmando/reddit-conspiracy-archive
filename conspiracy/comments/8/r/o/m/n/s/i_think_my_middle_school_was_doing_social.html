       My friend said I should post this to this subreddit after I posted it to r/offmychest.  Be prepared it's kind of all over the place and there are a few grammar errors as I was rushing when writing this. This is in no means we'll put together, it's just me blabbing all of my memories out of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was in 8th grade my school started an "enrichment class" it was mandatory for the entire school to take right after lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       This class was essentially the "emotions" class. We would be asked to write about a time we felt the most angry in our lives and turn them in, and we would be asked to draw how we feel and all of would go to the teacher, who would layer turn it into the councilor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in a class full of primarily rowdy boys. And I was a good hardworking student with good grades who genuinely cared about school and I was not having all of their unnecessary chaos all the time. I didn't understand why everyone in the class had fairly similar hobbies and traits, but then there was me and two other girls, and we were complete oddballs compared to the entire class.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to my councilor and explained to her that because my class was so rowdy, and chaotic I couldn't benefit from the class I thought the school wanted me to. This was not a graded class, and yet it was still mandatory for us to do all the work, and so I still tried to put my best foot forward and get a class change so I could be in a better environment. Because honestly going into that class every Monday and Wednesday after lunch made me want to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       The councilor explained to me that she couldn't change my class because we were all sorted by a "criteria". And refused to tell me what the criteria was. I was very angry at this because that meant someone sat down at a table and decided I belonged in a group with rowdy kids that don't care about school, and I didn't want to be labeled as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go home and told my mother about this and she emailed the councilor to get me a class change, and to know what the criteria I was sorted by was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The councilor responded to my mom telling her there was no criteria at all, and that the classes were randomized. The next day I get pulled into her office where she politely explains to me that I cant have everything I want, and in the real world I'll have to deal with people I don't like so I'll just have to deal with the class I was in, even though I made it clear I wasn't getting anything from the class.
      </p>
      <p>
       During class time we would watch Ted talks about "letting your inner light shine" and how it's okay to be different. We also had to write down personal stories about when we were sad or mad (and sign it) and turn them in. This made me extremely uncomfortable because I didn't know why the school needed this Information. So one day I altogether stopped participating and decided that it isn't worth my effort and that I wasn't going to benefit from the class even if the students were nicer. And I brought a book to class to read instead of doing my work. And every time the teacher would take away my book and making me write stuff down threating to send me to the office or get a referral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the course of half the semester me and one of the girls that were different compared to the rest of the class had become friends, and we always sat next to each other. And I think my teacher was also taking notes on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started noticing all the other classes were similar to ours. Kids that were all similar to each other except for 2-4 oddball kids that just didn't fit in.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the gay artsy kids were in one class (which was the group I wish I was put in because all my friends were in there) and they had 3 outcast kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was all theatre kids with 2 really good quiet outstanding students.
      </p>
      <p>
       A class of top smart nerdy kids with a 3 rebellious kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       A class of quite shy kids with a few loud annoying theatre kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was one class and it seemed like all the kids with anxiety issues were In there, but there were a few really gnarly outgoing ones in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day my friend came to me and said she went to the councilor to get a class change because she was in a class full of bad kids too. And when she told the councilor that she was in this class the councilor said "oh, oh gosh you're not supposed to be in the class you're supposed to be on a diffrent one. Oh gosh." And the councilor proceeded to tell her that it was too late to get a class change even though she was uncomfortable with the class.
      </p>
      <p>
       When my friend told me about her visit with the councilor she said "I think I was supposed to be put into the class with the kids that have anxiety" because my friend had severe anxiety at the time, and that's why the councilor was shocked that she had put my friend in the wrong class.
      </p>
      <p>
       My councilor knew she had severe anxiety, and yet even though my friend was genuinely uncomfortable with the class and teacher she still couldn't get it changed because it was "too late".   But the class wasn't a graded class so they should be able to switch her right over because it wasn't even something that had to do with the online grade book, or scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after I found out that we were all sorted under a unknown "criteria", like the rebellious angsty teen I was, i told the entire student body and parents were outraged that they couldn't get information about the class
      </p>
      <p>
       We were not allowed to know/do the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       -the criteria that sorted us
      </p>
      <p>
       -we were not allowed to know the teachers who wrote the curriculum
       <strong>
        we were told that this was just our school doing this and not the whole school district and we were told the writers were teachers from our school
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -we were not allowed to know why we had to write down personal stories about when we were sad or mad (always a negative emotion, we were never asked about when we were happy)
      </p>
      <p>
       -we were not allowed to know what the councilor did with our stories after she got them.
      </p>
      <p>
       -we couldn't change classes
      </p>
      <p>
       One time one of my friend's parents went down to complain to the principal about it, and the principal was able to dance around all of the questions he was asked and never gave straight forward answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the semester ended they completely cut the class. The teachers were still not allowed to say anything about the class.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did other things in this class like we learnt how to study for tests and maybe 2 or 3 lessons about team building, but other than that it was weird emotional stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know exactly what they were testing us for, or what information they got out of doing it, but the whole thing was extremely sketchy, and I wish that I knew more information about it all. Buy unfortunately, everything in this post is all I know.

       I kind of definitely don't believe this. I've had my fair share of shady-ness happening in schools, but it was never something everyone was in on. And someone's very involved parent definitely would have done something about it or called the school board.

       What year was this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Background:  In University, I was taking a class on Research Methods in Anthropology.  As such, we had to design and implement a research project, one of my peers had a daughter in a school who was about to start a gardening project, so he asked, and we were invited to do some research with the children about whether or not they liked vegetables or fruit, or even could identify them before and after, and we tried to measure if growing a garden increased their likelihood to try new vegetables (some were, AWESOME) 
ANYWAY, I say that, because to do research with people, especially children, you need to be certified, with PHRP (Protecting Human Research Participants) which includes how the collected information must be stored, anonymity, and informed consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this was only happening in one school, likely whoever was making the curriculum was doing research on students to (I'm assuming based on your memories) see if self-help classes would have a change on the perception of past "negative" emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the beginning you were told to recall certain bad events, and this continued, which gives them lots of data to find changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, onto specifics:
      </p>
      <p>
       Anonymity- you were required to write your name on the paper, this was then sent to the counselor.  I can't be certain, but if they were following PHRP, then the counselor should have been typing your stories, and assigning you to a number, and THAT "anonymous" information was sent to the researcher.  This is used to protect your identity in the actual research, by preventing the researching for knowing who student 32 is, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Informed consent- as a child, the researcher TECHNICALLY only needs the school's consent.  This must be signed by a school official (principal or approved by the district), however if the researcher was more ethical, they would have gotten parental consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with my experience in human research, its not sketchy from my point of view, its arguably unethical on the informed consent portion, however technically its all technically within allowance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helped ease your conscious?

       The part about how the parents don't need to give consent was what did it for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does the school have consent over the kids? In what world is it acceptable to subject children to anything outside of normal curriculum without the parent's permission?
      </p>
      <p>
       These children are not wards of the state. They do not belong to the school.

       If your ethics justifies this, then you need to review your ethics.

       If it didn't hinder curriculum (which he said that period turned into a study hall after that year) and it was a class, not after/before school, schools get away with quite a lot w/o Express parental consent.

       To some degree I can understand that one is transferring consent to the school while their child is in the school, but that should only come from the parent knowing what they are agreeing to.

       The consent youre transferring is emergency medical care, discipline, things like that. Youre not transferring general guardianship. If you were they wouldnt need field trip and sex ed permission slips.

       Youre definitely not transferring your right of informed consent

       Not to mention the liability if a kid gets hurt and their parents didnt give the school permission for the kid to leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       For my daughters school has a general permission slip you sign before every semester to save paper. You get an email of the field trip schedule every month and can opt out of individual trips.

       You describe how the data is anonymized .. this included a school employee transcribing every detail of what the kids think is private information. That alone is fucked up. Data mining children's fears and hangups? Along with knowing exactly who wrote what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you describe how it's technically legal and technically allowed. Seems not at all far fetched that a school would accept money to perform these tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of consent or rather COMPLETE lack of consideration for the children's opinions. It's just strange. 
They are there to learn, and school is shitty enough already. 
We dont need schools to act like a real world version of Google, sucking info out of everyone.

       This is hell dodgy. In Australia, this sort of thing is completely disallowed and the fact that the children were not allowed to opt out is absolutely illegal here. I am disgusted and horrified at your cavalier attitude to this invasion of privacy and lack of disclosure. Do you wonder why people don't trust researchers? Your whole post is full of the arrogance that should be eliminated from all research. Just because it's "legal" by your estimation, does not mean it's ethical or morally correct.

       Definitely an experiment, and since it ended abruptly after only one semester, I'm thinking somebody must've gotten in trouble over it. Getting caught experimenting on a child despite the explicit non-consent of the parent is a
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       no-no, regardless of how serious or light the experiment is.

       Maybe a "concerned parent" went above their pay grade and spoke to someone at the school board and let them know this was even going on....maybe they knew maybe they didnt maybe yall were an experiment in some teachers phd class and they got caught using you as guinea pigs and just got a reprimand and had to shut the class down.

       Even if you call it a study and not an experiment, without informed consent, it is illegal (the way I understand it from ethics and science courses).  People involved would lose their professional licensing if caught.

       I remember having done something similar in 10th grade. We were asked to go to an empty classroom and draw how we felt by tracing an outline of our palms and filling it out with a symbol that represented our emotions, I remember just putting down orange rays that made the drawing look like Macedonia flag. It was quite weird, we were sitting in a semi-circle around the interlocutor, a guy we never saw before or after that and talked about what we would do differently in school.

       Young kids having to write about their negative emotions reminds of the A.I they use to harass targeted individuals, they want to know how to control people better. It's A.I cuz people use machines to do their work for them if possible, there are too many people to control in the world and if they hired many people to do the harassment it would've been harder to keep this program a secret. Sorry I relate so much stuff to targeting in my posts but that's just how I see it, this type of 'reaserch' is shady as fuck.

       Lol why the hell do you assume it learns from the 8th graders to behave like them I don't understand how you got that from my text. It's designed to control and it's learning what creates negative emotions in them. Sometimes they're not cruel to certain useful idiots and assist to get in positions of power. That's a very important age in a person's development they want to know what makes them sad so they can repeat it in targeted people's lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm severely targeted and that was around the age when my parent's organized harassment got much worse, they almost ruined my mom/dad which you can imagine had great impact on me. My only sibling who's much older and almost not targeted at all had a very successful life, I'm just as talented as him and I thought I had a bright future before I knew I was targeted, PTB have been there every step of the way to make sure my life is miserable with A LOT of harassment around that age.

       bc 8th graders are cruel. they have the verbal spectrum of adults, provoke easily, and havent the developmental capabilitie yet to understand the weight of what they are saying. many adolescents kill themselves around middle school. bc middle schoolers are little sociopaths. if you were going to design a program to hurt people developmentally, you would start young... seeing as how junior high kids are volatile emotionally, they would be a perfect victim center, as well as an beautiful simple platform on which to elaborate... 4chan trolls? bots?

       okay, this isn't for you specifically, though you are a part of it.... YOU MAY BE A TARGETED INDIVIDUAL, YES, YOU ARE BEING MANIPULATED, guess what? WE ARE TOO, so stop assuming no one else knows anything. FFS.

       The "Enrichment" program I was in since Elementary was an elective/placement type program that after being...
       <em>
        nominated
       </em>
       for I was tested &amp; ultimately enrolled in. It's been quite interesting watching how the lives of those of us in the program have shaken out. Some Doctors, Lawyers, a Church Bus Shooter, Drug Lord, Resistance Movement types. Few if any have gone on to live..."typical" boring lives. Researching the criteria later in life has been difficult/interesting &amp; there is a growing G.A.T.E program research &amp; social community online I would encourage you to explore.

       Definitely sketchy ethics on the lack of transparency.  I think if they had informed the parents as to what they were trying to achieve, it would have given some better optics on the situation.

      <p>
       That said, it's possible they had hired an analyst to help adjust the class mix to be more conducive to learning.  They were probably going off of pure data without getting to know their subjects.

       Also have university background.  Definitely an experiment.  I think that the issue of experimentation on students in the context of the rise of big data is under-reported.  The Chronicle of Higher Education is following this for the college/university scene, but I don't know anything about lower grades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that every class you teach is an experiment.  Usually, educators try one or another treatment for, say, teaching students how to write an essay.  Good teachers observe the results, sometimes taking notes on what worked and what didn't.  They might compare grades and test scores from year to year.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's happening now is that the student data is being harvested into vast databases with gigantic numbers of data points.  This makes it possible for researchers (who could be school administrators, the state, a university grad student, the teachers themselves, or a private curriculum company) to do very detailed analyses of the outcomes of their treatments.  It also allows them to classify students according to precisely calibrated criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are laws in place to protect individual student privacy, but the gross, anonymized data?  Seems like there's some improvisation going on.  Anyway, every student and parent should find out whether their school has signed on with something like this:

       this is a good example of what is known as social engineering
      </p>
      <p>
       the situation was constructed like a product, like a table or chair is made in a factory except the product is a set of interactions/outcomes and the investigation of certain questions
      </p>
      <p>
       a socially engineered situation will always have these moments where you feel left out of decisionmaking and are rail-roaded
      </p>
      <p>
       also when questions are asked, there will be rehearsed answers or nervous evasion
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit is socially engineered, all public events of more than 5 people are socially engineered now in the united states, meaning one of the 5 people will be a plant if not more, there will be an observation team and emergency response team and they will have a planned course of events to either escalate toward arrests or scatter the activity and participants
      </p>
      <p>
       i do not think there is any social construct in the united states that is not subject to this as of this time, and as such any freedom someone in the usa feels they have is an illusion
      </p>
      <p>
       the matrix has been constructed, any attempt to escape it will encounter agents

       its called profiling. they are looking for specific personality types. we took a voluntary test when i was in ninth grade and it was passed on to military and law enforcement agency's for recruitment purposes. i was contacted specifically about four times through out high school bye navy intel guys and fbi field workers and they said i would be an ideal candidate for evidence gathering teams. when i asked how they decided that without knowing me they showed me a copy of the exam. i had forgotten all about it, and was pretty put off by it. the interesting thing is i was actually interested in the higher levels of law enforcement. they both offered free college in exchange for service during school. and would have to take courses in criminal sociology and some other related areas. all supplies books etc. free of charge.

       they wouldn't show scores, but they(navy) said i was  exceptional for problem solving, predictive behavior analysis, like for tracking a fugitive and for putting evidence together. -connecting dots so to speak. i did enlist for a four year tour. funny enough they put me in a facility in nevada. we tracked air traffic. and it was our job to determine whos planes they were. we were connected to the network of radars all over the world.  missile defense. interesting stuff, but i hated being locked up in bldg in the middle of no where.

       This reminds of something similar with my daughter this past school year- 7th grade, the councler went to certain kids(all girls) to participate in a class once a week, 24 girls sepperated into 2 classes. One class was literally all my daughters friend group and the other was the most popular girls in school. Not sure how they chose who they did, my daughter is an excellent student with no behavioral use issues- nothing to be singled out for out of hundreds of students. They were shown " motivational" videos such as thinks of short term goals as sand and long term as rocks or something. Still not sure what it was all about.

       We did this too, in the early 2000's. Interpersonal communication it was called. I can't remember much of the stuff because it's been so long, but it was about the motivation and crap like you described. We were also required to take it.

       Even if you call it a study and not an experiment, without informed consent, it is illegal (the way I understand it from ethics and science courses).  People involved would lose their professional licensing if caught.
