I honestly think the idea that an oligarch such as Trump who basically broke the business of his father and needed a bailout from the banks and the Roths would be interested in sending Hillary into prison. <a href="https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-wedding-gi.jpg">Did you guys forget that he and Hillary used to be buddies?</a> Keep this in mind all the time guys. Have huge amounts of skepticism towards powerful people, all the more politicians. The mind games that these people use on us are no joke, they are almost beautiful in their own creepy way because only a truly insane person could think in such odd ways to trick people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In March 2011 Forbes estimated Donald Trump&#39;s net worth to be $2.7 billion, with a $60 million salary. Many praise and analyze his “success” as if it were self-made, and they fail to attribute the proper credit to others in society where it is deserved. Despite what Trump may espouse, his success would have been in no way possible without his father, the general public, and the US government. Unfortunately, Trump decided to forget or selectively ignore these truths while forming his political philosophy, a sentiment made particularly clear during his brief bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.</p>

<p>Trump was born in New York City in 1946, the son of real estate tycoon Fred Trump. Fred Trump’s business success not only provided Donald Trump with a posh youth of private schools and economic security but eventually blessed him with an inheritance worth an estimated $40 million to $200 million. It is critical to note, however, that his father’s success, which granted Donald Trump such a great advantage, was enabled and buffered by governmental financing programs. In 1934, while struggling during the Great Depression, financing from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) allowed Fred Trump to revive his business and begin building a multitude of homes in Brooklyn, selling at $6,000 apiece. Furthermore, throughout World War II, Fred Trump constructed FHA-backed housing for US naval personnel near major shipyards along the East Coast.</p>

<p>In 1974 Donald Trump became president of his father’s organization. During the 15 years following his ascension, he expanded and innovated the corporation, buying and branding buildings, golf courses, hotels, casinos, and other recreational facilities. In 1980 he established The Trump Organization to oversee all of his real estate operations.</p>

<p>Trump eventually found himself in serious financial trouble. In 1990, due to excessive leveraging, The Trump Organization revealed that it was $5 billion in debt ($8.8 billion by some estimates), with $1 billion personally guaranteed by Trump himself. The survival of the company was made possible only by a bailout pact agreed upon in August of that same year by some 70 banks, allowing Trump to defer on nearly $1 billion in debt, as well as to take out second and third mortgages on almost all of his properties. If it were not for the collective effort of all banks and parties involved in that 1990 deal, Trump’s business would have gone bankrupt and failed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>C’mon.. Q is good fun, it’s an impressive sideshow, it’s entertaining. Nobody is going to jail though.  Let’s be realistic for once. It’s all just theatre.</p>

<p>I don’t know what is <em>really</em> going on or why it’s happening, but what I can say is it’s all a distraction and you’re better off ignoring it. Q anon is no different to any other TV soap opera. It’s just a story to follow.</p>

<p>Go and paint or make something instead, or run somewhere new. Have an experience that isn’t relayed to you through someone else first. It’s what Q would want you to do with all that “freedom”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is that supposed to prove?</p>

<p>That van could be (and most likely is) a prop in the big show. The driver just another cast member.</p>

<p>I suppose it’s possible some random news believer built that contraption to make some kind of point, but it’s also possible (and in my opinion <em>much</em> more likely) that it’s nothing more than another staged and scripted scene to advance the “Q” story.</p>

<p>News is controlled. The stories you read are controlled. The people producing the big show only show you what they want you to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct - news is controlled. But not (yet) to the level that you think. Much of the control is done through implication and internalization - ie &quot;if I don&#39;t publish <em>this voice</em> I will be canned&quot;.. but for the level of control you are positing, we would be talking about a multi decade lie of incomprehensible proportions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swamp is deep.  A lot of work to effectively remove the rot and corruption from the justice system, congress, FBI, corporations, judges, other countries, intelligence agencies, hollywierd, the senate....etc.  Fighting leaks, impeachment calls, special council...  Rabbit holes are deep.  Corruption extent and number of black hats way bigger/ larger than initially understood.  Takes a long time to get the collected evidence &quot;legally&quot; or admissible into the court system. Takes time to get necessary executive orders in place.</p>

<p>Taking a lot longer than planned to get confirmations through the Senate to get right players in place.   Plans evolving.  Takes time to get the public at large on board to avoid cognitive dissonance, riots, chaos and financial collapse.  Takes time to get the quick wins to get needed support from John Q public on both sides of the isle.  Need to have people see that things are going in the right direction. Building momentum....</p>

<p>Delays are now strategic.  They will have maximum effect on the mid terms. Blue wave looks to be collapsing into puddle splash.  Reduce or eliminate impeachment calls.  Deep state on the run. </p>

<p>Complicated business!  Patience, patience, it&#39;s happening. </p>
