    <div class="md"><p>Its a huge shitty base. They pretty much take more land every year and what is rideable changes a lot. Its not even properly fenced or anything. Literally right were the general lives the fence for the gating stops and all that is there is a shitty locked that looks like it was meant for cattle. Supposedly there are motiom sensors but i had a friend sneak into work for 3 months on that base through a hole in the fence and he was only caught because of a resident. Ammo, guns and explosives go missing all the time but is hidden. Plenty of people on this base willing to sell anything. This town is horrible and sucks ass</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a local just someone that lived their for awhile. Its a nice town in itself i just dont agree with the council. It also sucks most of the open isnt rideable but its cool the police wont really give chase or care most of the time unless youre being a real nuisance.</p>

<p>Oh ya like the smoke shops is understandable but i meant like some bars but thats because of various reasons and certain locals</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive heard of both being true. I know for sure there is a couple of air strips on the base which i have seen with huge blackened planes making midnight runs but i have also heard there being a very restricted part of the base that goes into a mountain and how supposedly its just a huge hologram mirage kind of thing going on. Ive never been that far on the base so idk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya man!  We should go back to legalized slavery and blacks only being 3/5&#39;s of a person.  Oh and we shouldn&#39;t let women vote.  Big mistake there!  And these pussy 40 hour work weeks!  If somebody is willing to work 12 hours a day 7 days a week it ought to be their God given right!  Speaking of work we need to go back to letting 6 year olds dig coal for pennies a day.  This is America!  Their small frame and nimble fingers are perfect for those hard to reach places.  And what is with these environmental protections?  In our heyday we were able to light entire rivers on fire!  Oh you got yourself hurt and died on the job?  Well guess what now you are entombed in the Hoover Dam, Patriot!  Make America Great Again!!!  </p>

We exist in an imperfect world and as a nation our founding documents were written by imperfect men.  Our culture changes through time and ideas that were once mainstream fade away to upsurd.  To ignore our history and idolize our past is incredibly dangerous.  We should demand better of ourselves. </p>

<p>I just made a comment on the snark you were throwing even though people were not discussing the issues you brought up, so you were just kicking nests to see what comes out. Let&#39;s honest here lmao.</p>

<p>No one is saying to avoid history, but perhaps when people discuss the communal nature we used to have, it isn&#39;t harkening back to terrible policies and atrocities against human beings.</p>

<p>If you had poor family members, who struggle and rely on neighbors and community, you&#39;d probably get what they are talking about instead of assuming their thoughts on race and child labor, but hey... everyone has opinions.</p>

<p>We should demand better of ourselves, when do you plan on starting though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You used hyperbole to a decent effect, I&#39;ll concede on that.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t demand better of them, you shouldn&#39;t overinflate arguing with individuals online as a lofty ideal.</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally the left and right boot stamping on our faces and they each kowtow to corporate interests, it&#39;s not the left hand/right hand. They&#39;re the same at this point, war hungry, corporate, and willing to do anything to remain in power.</p>

<p>OP did not do that, you&#39;re speaking about a commenter that you disagreed with that&#39;s the second comment down.   The better part of it all is that he is slightly agreeing with you when he says that we have fallen off the path and a majority of what we are doing as a country is ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP did. You literally cut off the quote you gave me right before to internationally mislead. You didnt quote the whole sentence so yes he did make a distinction.</p>

<p>If properly fenced and sign then no you shouldnt. Like most of those areas.</p>

<p>If you knew the area you would know this isnt the case and BLM and police always deal with this just by telling them to turn around or face being arrested and/or a ticket for riding on land you cant ride on.This has never happened were BLM agents open fired on someone on a ATV in this area. I am from this area and have friends who deal with BLM and the police for off road riding they didnt get shot at even the ones that DIDNT LISTEN and actual just rode off instead of let tge cops pull them over, which in that case maybe some force shouldve been used but didnt.</p>

<p>In this area shit like this happens all the time and no one is ever shot. These pussies dont even shoot at the cartel that operate on the national park either.</p>

<p>You thinking this is a Area 51 kind of area that has shoot on sight signs everywhere but its not. Its a poorly designed amd poorly taken care of national park that BARELY putting up trail signs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just cause you never lived in the southwest where the BLM is predominant. Trust me, you seem very stuck in your ways, but BLM to the people of colorado, New Mexico, nevada, Arizona, Utah, and Wyoming - has always meant Bureau of  Land Management. There’s signs on every road in every town out there since the 40’s. </p>

<p>Black Lives Matter has very recently taken over the acronym. And has never had “agents” (like in ops title) or been to a national park like “Joshua Tree”. I am not trolling and just glad to teach you about a part of the country you clearly know very little about, regardless of your downvote</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. “Restricted Area” designation could mean anything. Restricted from OHV use? From hunting? From public use? Classified area?</p>

<p>Using lethal force against people on top of ATV’s, with their hands clearly visible in handle bars, with engines running, with helmets on. Okay. If they had killed both of them then I would say they were protecting secrets. However, since they ceased fire, and killed neither, I’m going with negligence on the BLM agent’s part. </p>

<p>This isn’t a conspiracy so much as it is just unqualified people caring weapons on the job. Of course the BLM gets to hide behind their bureaucracy, but I guarantee that agent will get reassigned to a desk job. The BLM doesn’t like this kind of press. There is a reason they backed down at the Bundy ranch.</p>

<p>I do understand why the younger generations, who grew up in cities would not know about an agency that manages 1/8th of the US landmass. I mean, I never heard of this agency in school.</p>

<p>They also would not have been aware of current events during the high profile, armed standoff between BLM and Bundy a few years ago.</p>

<p>Established in 1946 by Harry Truman by combining the &quot;grazing service&quot; and &quot;general land office&quot; departments. Lately they have been known to aggressively seize lands that are in legal grey areas. As many government agencies have done, since they are ran by people, and since people are inherently greedy, they have been assigning themselves more power; this includes becoming more militarized. </p>
