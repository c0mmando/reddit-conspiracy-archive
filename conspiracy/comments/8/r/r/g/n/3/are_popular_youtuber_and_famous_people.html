    <div class="md"><p>Anyone with an outlet for their beliefs is “manipulating the masses” if you look at things negatively. Some of them probably believe they’re informing people. Some are trying to change people’s minds. Some possibly have been paid to push certain points. But many artists believe in what they’re saying, whether you do or not. You could argue whoever has the money allows for certain thoughts to be broadcast and pushes certain information and people into the mainstream, but the people themselves are just saying what’s on their mind (most of the time) just as I assume you would. Just as I absolutely would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTubers specifically are there to promote consumerism and sell you shit you don&#39;t need. Because their ad revenue is so low now, they rely on sponsorships to pay the bills. There are a lot of really good YouTubers out there who don&#39;t try to sell you anything because they have a real job and don&#39;t rely on it to pay their bills, but of course theyre hard to find and have less than 50k subscribers. YouTubers like Logan and Jake Paul are pure garbage and add absolutely no value to your life with their videos.</p>
