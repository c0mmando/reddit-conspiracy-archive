<p>You&#39;re spinning it to sound like it&#39;s a good thing we can&#39;t sustain ourselves independently of the system/state. I find it particularly troubling. I don&#39;t think being pampered, spoiled, and coddled is something I/we need to be especially grateful for.</p>

<p>I never, and I mean never upvote or downvote. Because who gives a fuck about make believe social media karma.</p>

<p>It is noted for future reference. You aren’t here to spread knowledge. You’re here to spread chaos. Good for you, and bad on any idiot without the brains to see through you and your nonsense.</p>

<p>Let me be succinct, since I am undoubtedly on every watch list one can reasonably imagine...</p>

<p>Fuck the system for which you seem only to happy to carry water. Its demise is currently under way. I agitate for that said demise at every opportunity. I spread the gospel of revolution to the underclass every time I’m in jail. Yeah, I’m one of those types. </p>

<p>Not necessarily. People and their local governments decide for themselves how to live. No one has to produce goods for western markets, but many seem to have the desire to export to those markets.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly idealistic (and wrong) way to look at the world. So, what, someone in a third world country led by a dictator or any form of corrupt government who works in a sweatshop to feed the child their husband made them have - they should just &quot;decide&quot; to change their life?

<p>You are aware that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Slavery was the best thing that ever happened to Black people and has lead to them getting a much better life than they would have in Africa, right? Just take a look at this comparison between British colonized countries and non-colonized countries: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/prv4cQH">https://imgur.com/a/prv4cQH</a></p></li>
<li><p>Even lesser paying jobs are a massive increase in life quality for people in other countries. </p></li>
<li><p>Places like Zimbabwe that tried to &quot;make things more even&quot; by doing things like re-appropriating White farmer&#39;s land to blacks totally failed. They eventually had to reverse their decisions. Why? Because unskilled farmers couldn&#39;t make anything of the land making it worthless, which lead to less jobs, less money being spent and destruction of the economoy.</p></li>
