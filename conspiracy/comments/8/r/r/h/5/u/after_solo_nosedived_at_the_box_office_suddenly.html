       I am kind of perplexed by all the solo hate as it was MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER. This is coming from an unbiased tagalong girlfriend of a SW nut. I have no dog in this fight. But hey keep up the Ewan memes I say...as long as they arent about hurting 14 yo girls I am down with the memes.

       Solo has its own problems but a large part of the hate towards it is from the residual hate of The Last Jedi and being told it was revolutionary when it just copied Empire and ROTJ while at the same time shitting on the OT and acting like it wasn't with "subversion" armor

       I have no problem with characters being nonwhite, I do have a problem with Disney telling me I'm racist for hating the characters because of bad writing.  Disney is trying to guilt trip, pressure, shame us into liking Star Wars.  Compare that with Lucas when everyone hated Jar Jar, he took Jar Jar out.

       that the trouble, or just demographics, George Lucas and LucasArts knew their fan base was aging and dying off, or just aged and apathetic, time to sellout to Disney and run with the money.

       A large part of it is also from Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson shitting on people who have legitimate issues with TFA. They have called them trolls, sexist, bigots, and manbabies to name a few. This led with people who follow production closly saw the shit that was behind the scenes for Solo. On top of this they blame the fans for Solo tanking instead of asking "well what did we do or not do that pissed people off?" Flying nun leiah, Mary Sue Rey, ruining Luke (even Mark Hamill agrees), making solo when no one asked for and casting someone who needed a acting coach halfway through. These are legitimate (opinionated) concerns. But Lucas doesn't address them in a serious way, they brush it off as trolls. When the people you call trolls are the backbone of your fanbase there is a problem. They won't want to see your movies and that reflects heavily in Solo by actual numbers and facts not feelings. You can't ignor that and expect people to come see your movie anyway. No one is waking up going "this movie made people mad so I want to see it when I wasn't going to" there are people who wake up and say "I didn't like the last one, when I voice that opinion I'm called a sexist troll, I'm not going to see the new one"

       they had an AMAZING storyline already in front of them...  the heir to the empire series was a phenomenal end to the skywalker saga and they fucked it all to hell...  the fucking shit was written and sanctioned already.  disney will never see money from me again and i hope the parks fail spectacularly at the same time.

       I have a dog in the fight as I've been a SW fan since I saw the OT on VHS in the early 90s, remember the hype and disappointment of the prequels, played all the games (Snes, x-wing vs tie, galaxies, kotor, you name it) and was pleasantly surprised by TFA (ep7) and R1.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLJ was brutal for a number of reasons (Johnson and subverting expectations being the main one) but at least they tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know what to think about Solo. I've never walked out of a movie before and I was so close to leaving out of boredom and eye rolling moments... I thought it was terrible from a movie standpoint, not even as a disappointed star wars fan. The plot, pacing, character development,lighting and cinematography were all bad IMHO.

       there's a large percentage of people who grew up on and love the prequels and McGregor even to people who hated the prequels was beloved.  but a lot of fans hate the sequels for it copying the original trilogy and want Lucas back in some capacity.  McGregor was/is the symbol of everything that worked with the prequels and the reminder that the sequels could not compare to even the flawed prequels

       i can't tell if you're being ignorant on purpose or not.  Ewan memes that were meta-related to Star Wars have been banned. Now only explicitly zero-meta Obi Wan memes are allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       prequelmemes without the meta is not prequelmemes.  youd know that if your only contact with the sub was just from your click a minute ago.

       disney killed meta prequelmemes and thus the life force in it.

       A lot of fans hate the sequels for it copying the original trilogy and a lot of other reasons and want Lucas back in some capacity. &gt;McGregor is the symbol of everything that worked with the prequels and the reminder that the sequels can't compare to even the flawed prequels. With The Last Jedi underperforming and Solo bombing, Disney needed to protect the sequels and part of that was by killing the McGregor memes and its halo effect on the prequels.

       That's an excellent spin, TIL. I was a little disappointed when the impression was the more midichlorians you have, the more force ability they give you. That was...disappointing.

       They are drawn to the force, and the more ability you have, the more midichlorians are drawn to you. A high midichlorian count indicates a powerful ability with the force. I like it - thanks!

       The prequels were terrible.

       The acting in the 3rd was beyond laughable. It was like watching a cut rate movie.

       Go back and watch the scene where Sam Jackson is battlin' foo's with light stix. It's embarrassing man.

       How anybody can call that level of crud a move, is beyond delirious. Add in the fact that its' a star wars movie, which basically prints money and says you can get as experimental as you want, they instead went for canned acting and crappy lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who made that should be ashamed. They had the golden opportunity to really try something in cinema. Instead they just sat around and fucked each other, while snorting coke through $100 bills.

       No matter what Disney does or tries to do, it will fail. The harder they try to direct The Force to their own will, the more it will humiliate them and be their downfall.

      <p>
       If people thought the response to "Solo" was bad, just wait until Episode 9. Put it out at Christmas, it won't matter. Disney killed the franchise internationally, it's not coming back, it will be a second tier IP for at least the next decade but probably forever.

       Nobody's buying the toys, you can do a search and see that TLJ toys were being sold at cut rate prices weeks before Christmas.

       They new "Star Wars Land" at the Disney parks will likely do well. That may be the last thing they've got to cling to. Not sure it will be enough.

       Because the agenda of forced diversity and acceptance  pushed by Disney and associates to the kids via the new Star Wars movies is not very welcomed among long time fans which is the largest base of fans so far for the franchise, a surprise but not a welcome for them was that the new solo movie didn’t took off as expected. So IMO maybe those kind of targeted audience tools, methods and techniques are to be followed, a decrease in the acceptance of those forced views maybe is a good sign

       I've actually been wondering for a while now how much influence Disney has here on Reddit. It's not just Star Wars either. The whole Marvel vs Disney feud seems a little out of hand. The DC movies just got pummeled in their own fan sub reddits. You couldn't say anything nice about Man of Steel or Batman v Superman without being downvoted and ridiculed. On the other hand, you don't dare question anything about the Marvel movies without also being downvoted and ridiculed... It's starting to look fishy.

       No, they didn't.

       They banned memes that were outside of the Star Wars universe. So a picture of Ewan McGregor IRL is banned, but a picture of Ewan on the set of Star Wars is fine.

       Stop trying to make everything a conspiracy. This clearly isn't some plot by shill mods. It has nothing to do with the Solo film.

       Ewan is prequelmeme's meta spirit embodied.  You can talk about "letter" of the rules but that's not what made prequelmemes popular
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot argue against the meta dankness which this is just a glimpse of

       This isnt a conspiracy. If you want to call out Disney for shady marketing tactics that's fine but that's not what this post is about. It's about one group of preference vs. another preference. Also, let's be honest, Stars Wars isn's exactly the height of cinema. They are movies for children and teens that adults can enjoy through the eyes of nostalgia. Plus, they are just another vehicle through which merchandise is sold and to Lucas's credit he really has hid that motive....very well at least.

       Lucasfilm is on this crazy passive aggressive power trip lately after solo... seems like every day they're faking reviews, calling out/blaming the fandom, or something else just as absurd. 
I mean, the fact alone rian johnson  still has a trilogy is all kinds of insane to me...

       I really hope they decide to step away from the franchise for a few years, stwp a solid plan for the future, and replace KK with Dave Filone

       Like I said, it has to be explicitly Star Wars related now, before this you could just post about Ewan and have it implicitly related to Star Wars.  No meta = no dankness = sequelmemes

       Solo has its own problems but a large part of the hate towards it is from the residual hate of The Last Jedi and being told it was revolutionary when it just copied Empire and ROTJ while at the same time shitting on the OT and acting like it wasn't with "subversion" armor

       I have a dog in the fight as I've been a SW fan since I saw the OT on VHS in the early 90s, remember the hype and disappointment of the prequels, played all the games (Snes, x-wing vs tie, galaxies, kotor, you name it) and was pleasantly surprised by TFA (ep7) and R1.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLJ was brutal for a number of reasons (Johnson and subverting expectations being the main one) but at least they tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know what to think about Solo. I've never walked out of a movie before and I was so close to leaving out of boredom and eye rolling moments... I thought it was terrible from a movie standpoint, not even as a disappointed star wars fan. The plot, pacing, character development,lighting and cinematography were all bad IMHO.
