       The front page of Reddit is fascinating; a place where you can study the indoctrination techniques they use to manipulate the masses. I find it fascinating how there are algorithms that decide when to push agenda points disguised as [fun/interesting] softcore media content to maintain the status quo for the consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this precise moment - such piece (submission r/videos) commands the listeners to ridicule anybody *questioning* the safety of vaccines. It's a powerful video, where the (alpha) funny (leader) comedian is actually not that funny, and the fake laugh track makes it disturbing.

       Still too easy to get doxxed and get infiltrated. I'm still thinking about perhaps doing it in a way where there is a crowdfunding link in order to do it, we won't say what it is until after its already up and running and had its time in the limelight on the front of r/all

       unless you have a another idea/method for us not to get infiltrated and exposed for this "project." Doing so will lead to a permanent ban and deletion of your account on Reddit.

       You'd actually be surprised how many people see it without the paid upvotes.

       I don't think the average person is realizing any of this. And certainly not motivated to do anything about it, change the behavior or change their behavior. So even if they average person does realize who gives a shit? Nobody, not even the average person.

       Why does something have to be "better?" Why has convenience become the objective over responsible consciousness? Hop in your car or bike, go to your local small business store, spend an extra buck or two and buy what you want. Put Wal Mart, Amazon, and Apple out of business.

       TwoX is a mandatory sub for all front page users. Often threads from TwoX regarding rape and sexual assault make it to the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       The front page engages in emotional manipulation of Reddit users. You'll be scrolling and see a cute cat video and feel all :3 but then the next post is about a woman being violently raped. Then the next photo is of something empowering a racial minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings weren't meant to have their emotions jerked in such extreme directions so quickly. Yet if you look at the deeper level, the front page is filled with emotional manipulation like this.

       Vaccines again lmao. Even if it is as dangerous as some of you guys believe. The benefits still outweigh the cost, just like all other medicine that is taken. The cost would be death in many cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the lymph epidemic caused by tics, all this could have been prevented with a vaccine that should have come out years ago but it got taken off the market because of the uproar of the anti-vaccine movement.

       I honestly dont know what I read is no but then the autism rates are up...why? I bet we will ever be told why thought it doesnt take much to guess. Certain non vaxing groups dont have high autism rates which makes one wonder if the very persons that have lied about MANY OTHER THINGS would suddenly be completely honest about this. So it continues

       That doesn't prove anything. That is a case of emotions trumping science. The government decided to settle for who knows what reason. The one who filed the lawsuit provided no proof that it was the vaccine. Correlation doesn't equal causation.

       Then-director of the Centers for Disease Control Julie Gerberding (who is now President of Merck Vaccines) stated: "The government has made absolutely no statement indicating that vaccines are a cause of autism. This does not represent anything other than a very specific situation and a very sad situation as far as the family of the affected child."

       the Special Master for the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program laid out the vaccine court's position in the Poling case and another, somewhat similar case that followed: The compensation did not mean that vaccines cause autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In Poling v. HHS, the presiding special master clarified that the family was compensated because the Respondent conceded that the Poling child had suffered a Table Injury--not because the Respondent or the special master had concluded that any vaccination had contributed to causing or aggravating the child’s ASD (autism spectrum disorder),” Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       A table injury means an illness or condition that is listed on a chart specifically created for the compensation program. The chart lists the kinds of vaccines, the possible conditions that might follow vaccination, and the time period within that condition must occur in order to be considered eligible for an award. If patients develop one of the specified illnesses or conditions within the amount of time listed, they can be eligible for compensation even if they can’t establish a link between the two.

       No, just keep on reading the case. The girl had a reaction, one of the side effects vaccines. Here's another opinion on the case :

       So if it's not autism and nobody knows whether vaccines cause mitochondrial disorders, why did the court come to this conclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not clear, as the details of the case and its deliberation remain sealed. But here are some issues to ponder. Experts tell us mitochondrial disorders can be aggravated or unmasked by illness; an individual's mitochondria will only go awry when there's stress placed on the body. The court document mentions a series of illnesses Hannah developed between her diagnosis of mitochondrial disease and after her vaccines. Two of these events occurred within the expected timeline for a vaccine reaction. One—fever and irritability—seemed to be a reaction to the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine. This is a rare but well-known side effect of that vaccine. The second was a fever and a rash that were diagnosed as a reaction to the chickenpox vaccine.
      </p>

       What should parents do now?
Vaccinate their children. Even the Polings aren't disputing the benefits of vaccines, as they said on CNN last week. If parents are nervous about one or more shots, spread them out. That's fine. Check out reliable vaccine Web sites like the Institute for Vaccine Safety or the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Vaccine Education Center. Read the vaccine information your pediatrician is supposed to provide to you as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have some advice for government, whose efforts to reassure the public about vaccine safety need vast improvement. Unseal the documents of the Poling case so the public can hold officials accountable for the decision. Otherwise, too many people will continue to believe that vaccines are autism's smoking gun.

       You didn't read the case but you want to spam your uninformed opinion around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two of these events occurred within the expected timeline for a vaccine reaction. One—fever and irritability—seemed to be a reaction to the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine.

      </p>
      <p>
       The court ruled in her favor  because of the table injury which was set up some time ago by congress, way before so many  studies have concluded the safety of vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's mind blowing how retarded people like you can be. You want to contest a whole bunch of independent studies that have many times concluded that there is absolutely no link between autism and vaccines because you cherry pick information you want to hear. And the crazy part is that you picked this case, which actually disproves your point considering the ruling clearly that the vaccines didn't cause her autism.

       The biggest one is saying that vaccines cured X disease when there are other factors involved. Clean water, sanitation, proper nutrition and environmental factors (e.g. mosquito netting) all play a role in disease. Instead though you only hear about the vaccines, since that's the only thing that the drug companies make money off of.

       The lasts few weeks there have been numerous echo chamber posts rising to the front page about vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch the legislation in the next few months. These kinds of social engineering campaigns usually get followed up with some new form of vaccination legislation. These campaigns “grease the rails” to increase political support.

       Many people have no idea how the monetary system they use EVERY DAY works. You're telling me those people have a solid understanding of world politics? I assume not. They are just following the pack cuz it's cool, especially on reddit where you can farm imaginary points for arguing with people.

       What are you talking about lol. Yes the economy is not a simple subject. But the hate he is getting is from stuff like his continuous lying, and blaming people for his mistakes, his scandals, from the women ones to the recent charity, his glorification of dictators, his aspiration of getting rid of all policies that Obama did just because he hates him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He got out the Tpp deal to make a better deal. He couldn't do it and he said he regrets doing that, we are about to see something happen with Iran soon since he is definitely not going to be able to get a better deal with just the USA sanctioning them. Got out of the Paris climate accord, and all that is because his ignorance and hatred towards science. He also brought back coal jobs which have ironically failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did the tax cut, which gives a tax cut for everyone but on the short run and especially on the long run it simply is a tax cut meant to benefit the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget about some of his appointees, like Gina Haspel, ajit, Pruitt, DeVos... etc. All are terrible and working for the rich.

       This is the disconnect though. How many of the top posts in r/politics are actually just reporting? It's been a while since i've seen a headline in

       The anti vaxxer hatred is creepy as hell.  I would vaccinate my children, but I can understand why some parents are skeptical.

      <p>
       I may disagree with their choices, but they are making these decisions because they care about their children's well-being. Hating them the way people do on Reddit seems completely over the top.

        By satisfying eight of the Hill's criteria for establishing causality applicable to our study (Table 9), we show that Al-adjuvanted vaccinesmay be a significant etiological factor in the rising prevalence of ASDin the Western world. We also show that children from countries withthe highest ASD prevalence appear to have a much higher exposure toAl from vaccines, particularly at 2 months of age."

       It's because their choices are causing other people's children to get sick because of their beliefs. There are ages where kids can't get the vaccines and the more children that go unvaccinated the more likely those young kids who aren't old enough for the vaccines are to catch highly treatable diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let people believe what they want but when people are believing in debunked bullshit that is endangering children, infants at that, that aren't their own there has to be a line that's drawn. Antivaxxers are endangering the children of everyone around them because they're wanting to believe pseudo science over verifiable scientific research.

       I thought vaccinated people are protected. isn't that the point of a vaccine? 
And that's a false conclusion. someone gets sick and you say "its all that un-vaccinated persons fault!" let's ignore every other contributing factor that may be there?

       Here I'll quote my comment since you apparently didn't read it. Infants and young children can't get certain vaccines until there older but they sure as hell can get sick from a kid who is old enough but has parents that would rather let their kids die.

       If you cannot read long sentences, let me show you the conclussions of this last study:
      </p>
      <p>
       "5. Conclusions and future directions
      </p>
      <p>
       By satisfying eight of the Hill's criteria for establishing causality applicable to our study (Table 9), we show that Al-adjuvanted vaccinesmay be a significant etiological factor in the rising prevalence of ASDin the Western world. We also show that children from countries withthe highest ASD prevalence appear to have a much higher exposure toAl from vaccines, particularly at 2 months of age."
      </p>
      <p>
       ASD is Autism Spectrum Disorder.

       If a child immune system hasn't developed to a point that it can fight off the weakened virus/dead virus, yes. But that's exactly why that has been research for over two hundred years, to determine when the body can safely accept a vaccine.

       You can’t avoid all externalities. Some parents let their kids watch degenerate shit which Can then potentially affect my kids if they interact with your kids. That doesn’t mean that I should get to ban degenerate media. I think people should have the choice over whether It is mandatory that the government inject some mysterious chemicals into your child’s body.

       Thanks for letting me know I should be killed for having an inquisitive mind and questioning the government.

        If you believe vaccines are bad, you are a fucking idiot, though. You should be ridiculed. This was a neat sub before all the retards came in. Also, Trump is a trash president and chemtrails aren't a thing. Most of you fuckers won't breed because you are societies undesirables, but you should all be sterilized just in case.

       The front page(aka All, Popular, etc) of reddit today is a Shit Show at the Fuck Factory.

       I honestly dont know what I read is no but then the autism rates are up...why? I bet we will ever be told why thought it doesnt take much to guess. Certain non vaxing groups dont have high autism rates which makes one wonder if the very persons that have lied about MANY OTHER THINGS would suddenly be completely honest about this. So it continues

       Many doctors and scientists are aware of the population control aspect of the vaccines and have been denouncing it for a very long time.

       You are just regurgitating points that you heard in the mainstream media because you failed to do any research (you might be shocked to hear this, but clicking on the first links of a google search is not research)

       unless you have a another idea/method for us not to get infiltrated and exposed for this "project." Doing so will lead to a permanent ban and deletion of your account on Reddit.
      </p>

       I have like 50 alts I made 5-6 years ago, so certainly I dont care if this one gets deleted.
