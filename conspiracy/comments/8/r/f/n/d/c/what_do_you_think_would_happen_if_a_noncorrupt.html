<p>The FBI the CIA and every other intelligence agency would immediately launch programs to try to counter and stop them</p>

<p>All of the corporate owned media Outlets would combined together in a coordinated attack on that person. They would launch lie after lie after lie attempting to turn the American people against the one person who&#39;s on their side</p>

<p>Partisans from both parties would hate this president. Very attack him for not being real enough</p>

<p>And ask yourself. Has this ever actually happened?</p>

<p>Yes, his name was Franklin Roosevelt, and he became known as a &#39;traitor to his class.&#39; In his first term, a business group hatched a plan to march into the White House and throw him out.</p>

<p>If it were to happen again, the &quot;non-corrupt anti-establishment candidate&quot; would insist that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tax rates are returned to levels going back at least to Jimmy Carter, if not higher.</p></li>
<li><p>The internet would be neutral, with ISPs broken up to prevent cartels, and with a public option.</p></li>
<li><p>There would be health coverage for everyone in our borders.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Obamacare is privatized cronyist profiteering expensive garbage where insurance companies and big pharma get sweet crony contracts and are allowed to be deregulated (thus they can do what they want with the prices.....horrendously expensive drugs/service compared to Canada, UK, etc.) They profit from the tax payer.
Lots of people did not and still don&#39;t know this. There are still normies that think Obama was &quot;ok&quot; or even &quot;great&quot; lol. We&#39;ve had SHIT presidents for decades, at least since Reagan.</p>

<p>Hell no is Obama a socialist, or even a moderate rightist. Obama is slightly left of far right Romney......wallstreet/banksters/corporations own both parties. This is the real American spectrum:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png">https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png</a></p>

<p>(Modern) Dems and Repubs are NEOliberal corporatist shills and have corporate media at their disposal to promote itself. </p>

<p>Is it really hard to believe the &quot;it wasn&#39;t real socialism&quot; thing when the world is ruled by psychopath extreme-capitalist oligarchs? There are many types of socialism but you get what I mean. If we look at &quot;communism&quot; which is a far far left version of socialism.....the USSR wasn&#39;t communist even though the whole world repeats that bullshit. Even Lenin admitted it was (authoritarian) state capitalism. Bureaucrats controlling everything does not = common ownership. Similarly, not all social programs are socialistic and non-profit. It depends on how it&#39;s run.  </p>

<p>If the president was centrist/social democracy, the social programs would be non-profit (efficient) or regulated against unethical conduct. For example, the UK has more affordable healthcare than the U.S. but even that is semi-privatized and a bit crappy but not as crappy as Obamacare/full corporate U.S. system. It used to be superior true nationalized efficient single payer, and so did the U.S. during FDR. Socialism doesn&#39;t mean no capitalism, it&#39;s a spectrum. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understamd the sheer amount of tax money that is generated </p>

<p>Combined with ending endless wars and slashing wasteful defense soending it is offset by a tax that is about half what you pay in premiums and you have no cipays or deductibles. </p>

<p>You really think the government wouldnt have every insurer trying to land that contract?
Youre thinking of single payer like its a national healthcare system lile in tge UK. Hospitals and insurance conoanies would 100% bring costs down when they know its the only game in town.</p>

<p>People would still retain the ability to get private insurance so conoanies still have the option of offering that as a perk to get higher quality candidates as well.</p>

<p>The only thing single payer does is slash the cost of healtcare in america. </p>

<p>Sorry folks but Hillary lied to you</p>

<p>The entire us budget in the entire year. That means ALL of the money collected by taxes only equals 3.3 trillion</p>

<p>Universal Health Care would cost about 3.2 trillion</p>

<p>That means we would have to either literally stopped funding EVERYTHING else including the military Social Security welfare and Roads to pay for it or we would have to literally double taxes on  EVERYBODY</p>

He then conceded and supported Hilary and played the bitch card. Now the DNC blocked outside party members from running and since he’s an independent he most likely won’t run as a Democrat for pres ever again. Unfortunately the systems rigged and we have a two party shit show of corruption. He should do another campaign for president as an independent but unfortunately he’s lose agaim. Bernie has good intentions but he should’ve went on a campaign against Hilary for the cheating out of the primaries and boosted the grassroots progressive independents. </p>

<p>Many, unfortunately, don&#39;t know this, but Sanders (&quot;Scamders&quot; - or &quot;Shamders&quot;, whichever one you prefer) is pretty much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sqoq-lAGO8">the lone figure who did away with and killed the &quot;Audit The Federal Reserve&quot; bill.</a></p>

<p>look back to the Bush era</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MSM made light of the stealing of the 2000 election by a 5-4 Supreme Court.</p>

<p>MSM including PBS supported the giant tax cuts proposed and passed by GWB and the Republican Congress.</p>

<p>MSM rushed to prop up the George W. Bush failing economy after 9-11.</p>

<p>MSM did virtually no analysis of the September 14, 2001 AUMF that handed the White House perpetual war power in every nation.</p>

<p>MSM failed to explain and cover the Patriot Act passed a few weeks later.</p>

<p>MSM and especially the New York Times ran top stories about one fake news WMD accusation after another: centrifuges from Turkey, yellowcake from Canada, yellowcake from Africa, &quot;Curveball&#39;s&quot; claim of WMDs buried in the desert, camouflaged WMD factories that were just bombed out buildings, the fabricated dossier by the California college student, etc. etc. etc. Now, they are blaming these accusations on the Deep State even though the lies came directly from the GWB administration itself or Tony Blair.</p>

<p>MSM refused to investigate or even to look at the 2004 Ohio election where the state was &quot;delivered&quot; to GWB by the proprietary voting software company Diebold, in direct opposition to the exit polling.</p>

<p>MSM apologized for getting the exit polling right, supporting Republicans and blaming themselves for somehow messing up this simple act of asking people who they voted for. It&#39;s all been messed up ever since, and that has benefited Republicans with the &quot;red shift.&quot;</p>

<p>MSM actually did cover the Katrina disaster and the lack of federal help while it was happening, but once it was over, the blame went mostly to the states and even the local government.</p>

<p>MSM barely reported on the very plain SPYING crimes of GWB, despite the fact that there were videos both showing he knew it they were crimes and and admission that he broke the law.</p>

<p>What were you saying again?</p>

You simply spike any story which doesn&#39;t show your man/woman in a positive light. So Fox viewers get a constant stream of stories showing Trump in a good light, while never seeing the bits which make him look like an incompetent fool. (Which are the bits that everybody else is basing their disapproval of Trump on). Did Fox viewers see his clumsy, protocol shredding handshake/salute to a NK General. It was cringemaking to watch.

<p>The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.</p>

<p>We must remember that any oppression, any injustice, any hatred, is a wedge designed to attack our civilization.</p>

From John Bolton to Jeff Sessions to cronies like Betsy DeVos who only got the job because she was a rich donor. Republicans are just fine with Trump when hes cutting taxes for billionaires or doing anything else that furthers their agenda. The problem is when hes on twitter at 3AM embarrassing himself.

Hes under a criminal investigation because he hired a bunch of criminals. Sorry dude but that&#39;s where we are now. Trump isnt a danger to the establishment.

    <div class="md"><p>lies. The ability to do it may have been created under a previous president. It is Trump&#39;s choice to use it. It is him and him alone who is responsible for creating cages of scared and bewildered children, who will probably grow up to be scary America hating adults. Or are you lot planning on keeping them in concentration camps for their entire life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You are lying. Whose policies were created under Obama and Trump doesn&#39;t have the authority to stop doing it. He wants to change it. But it takes Congress to change it</p>

<p>So Trump doesn&#39;t really have a choice. And you didn&#39;t really care when it was Obama. So you don&#39;t even care about those kids you just want an excuse to hate Trump for being white</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all I&#39;m white. I of course don&#39;t hate white people, and the idea that most of America hates Donald Trump because he&#39;s white is laughably stupid. It&#39;s as bad as saying people didn&#39;t like Obama because he was black...although talking to you Trump supporters more and more it seems that at least for some of you there absolutely is a racial component in your politics.</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/5313052/gop-republican-children-parents-family-separations-trump-administration/">http://time.com/5313052/gop-republican-children-parents-family-separations-trump-administration/</a></p>

<p>Read this. And read it carefully. The democrats and the congressional GOP are  both against Trump&#39;s <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna883716">zero tolerance policy</a>. And yes, it is his policy, it is new and not the same as it was under obama. The whitehouse can stop it at anytime, but is counting on his followers to believe his lies that it&#39;s somehow the democrats fault. Even them, they say that they have &quot;biblical justification&quot; for separating children from their mothers.</p>

<p>Even if you remain a Trump supporter, can you at least admit, that this one policy, is cruel and ineffective?</p>

<p>Nothing to do with his colour. I am white, and British. No, I despise Trump because he is corrupt and incompetent. And before you say it.... I wasn&#39;t impressed with BHO&#39;s performance either in the final analysis. Certainly didn&#39;t deserve a Nobel.... and HRC is a nasty cunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m more concerned about his ties to russia and how they undermined our election. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No youre not. Youre concerbed that cnn told u to pretend to he concerned</p>

<p>If you were concerned about ties to Russia and you&#39;d be concerned about Hillary and Obama the book sold your Russia our uranium</p>

<p>You&#39;re concerned about foreign countries interfering in our election then you&#39;d be concerned that Russia organized anti Trump rallies and clearly supported Hillary. You would be concerned that foreign in propaganda networks like the BBC were lying on behalf of her</p>

<p>You&#39;d be concerned that Mexico on the CNN makes up stories to push Hillary and Obama. And you would have been concerned when Obama was caught on tape colluding with the Russian Ambassador in 2012</p>

<p>No. You&#39;re not actually concerned about those things. CNN told you to pretend to be concerned that you&#39;re using it as an excuse for the hatred you already had for trump</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m concerned about his constant in your face lying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except you cant prove this &quot;constant&quot; lying he supposedly does</p>

<p>Obama lied 15 times a day. But whenever I ask someone to show me what Trump has lied about the best they can talk about his inauguration crowds and his private life with a  porn  star</p>

<p>If you really lied as much as people pretend he does then there would be a whole lot more examples</p>

<p>Not to mention you&#39;re not concerned with it because you didn&#39;t care when Obama lied. He didn&#39;t care when Hillary lied. or when Ron Paul lies</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m concerned about his hatred of fair trade</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally literally every time he talks about trade he says that he wants fair trade. He doesn&#39;t hate fair trade he supports. People like Obama and Hillary hated fair trade. As is evident by their policies.</p>

<p>Anyway again. You didn&#39;t mention fairtrade once during the 8 years of Obama. So I really doubt that you cared at all about it or even knew what it was until CNN told you to be outraged outraged</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the trade war he&#39;s created. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were already in a trade War. It&#39;s just little mama was purposely losing. Trump is fighting back so that America isn&#39;t screwed over. Trump is fighting back so if the poor don&#39;t get poor while the rich get richer. I understand that leftist don&#39;t like that. They hate the poor in love the rich. .</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned how he cozies up to dictators </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except you&#39;re not. Again. You didn&#39;t give two craps when Obama cozied up to dictators like Fidel Castro or Iranian dictators that he was making deals with. You didn&#39;t care at all when Obama put the American flag to Cuba&#39;s flag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again you&#39;re just making up excuses that you heard on CNN CNN</p>

<p>while insulting our allies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t call them allies if they&#39;re ripping us off. Again</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned about his policy of taking children from their mothers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again. No you&#39;re not. You&#39;re just repeating everything you hear on the TV. You didn&#39;t give two craps about the fact that that policy was created by Obama. Or the fact that Trump can&#39;t actually change it because it&#39;s up to Congress to change it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t care about the millions of children separated from their families every year when a family member is sent to prison. You just don&#39;t care. What you care about is the fact that a white man is in the White House</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m concerned about the massive spike in collateral damage all around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you&#39;re not. Because where were you when Obama committed war crimes in Yemen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m concerned about his basic understanding of how government works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another lie you heard from Jimmy Kimmel</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m concerned about his obstruction of justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you&#39;re not. Because there&#39;s no evidence he obstructed Justice. And didn&#39;t do give two craps when Obama obstructed Justice and James Comey admitted it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m concerned about his corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you&#39;re not. Because you&#39;re not corrupt. If he was you&#39;d be able to tell me who is paid him off. And how much money he&#39;s made from being president president</p>

<p>So in all reality you don&#39;t hate them for any of those things because you didn&#39;t hate Obama for those things. You don&#39;t even understand those things. You just a partisan hack who hates him for being white </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But most of all I&#39;m concerned about the people like you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually I&#39;m concerned about people like you. Who have Cults around this worship of people like Obama and Sanders and have this cold around the hatred of trump for trivial reasons that you can&#39;t even explain explain</p>

<p>People who are just puppets for whatever the Democrat media tells them to do. And that&#39;s really what you are. You&#39;re a puppet. Democrat politicians tell you to do something and you do it. You&#39;re like a wind-up toy with outrage. Democrat politicians and Democrat media Outlets will just wind you up point you in the direction they want you to go and watch you go</p>

Whether it’s Zionist, khazarians, chabad, etc. I haven’t seen enough proof for those claims yet, feel free to provide them. I’m staunchly against Israel’s actions, their lobbying efforts, etc. but the worlds more complex then them running the show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you watch the credits roll by for a TV Show or Movie most of the names are Jewish. By most I mean practically all of them. A large, almost complete, percentage of the Banking system is owned by Jewish people or by people loyal to Jewish interests. Same with the &quot;Main Stream Media&quot;. It has come to my attention after reviewing world history that any person or group that has attained an over whelming &quot;full spectrum dominance&quot; in any sector cheated and broke any and all rules to do so. Microsoft comes to mind, as does, the British Empire before World War II. So, are the Jews simply smarter than the non-Jews, or have the Jews &quot;conquered&quot; the known world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the instance that it did somehow happen, the elected person would be given the choice to either read the cards, and the teleprompter like a good little sworn to oath soldier, or get JFK&#39;d by the SS. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to say what you would do as president, until it&#39;s <em>your</em> ass in the hot seat, with literal hired guns in your back. A team of people trained to be proficient in every commonly available weapon on the planet, with unlimited resources and support on call to back them. </p>

<p>They have you in a secure location, with full control of all communication in and out, to and from you. These people are employees of the the Fed, (the private bank) and are not subject to any governmental oversight. They technically don&#39;t work for you. They will be right there with you, every step of the way, anywhere in the world you go. They will be outside the doors of where you and your family sleeps for possibly the duration of your lifetime. The President of the United States is essentially a prisoner after inauguration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You are lying. Whose policies were created under Obama and Trump doesn&#39;t have the authority to stop doing it. He wants to change it. But it takes Congress to change it</p>

<p>So Trump doesn&#39;t really have a choice. And you didn&#39;t really care when it was Obama. So you don&#39;t even care about those kids you just want an excuse to hate Trump for being white</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obamacare is privatized cronyist profiteering expensive garbage where insurance companies and big pharma get sweet crony contracts and are allowed to be deregulated (thus they can do what they want with the prices.....horrendously expensive drugs/service compared to Canada, UK, etc.) They profit from the tax payer.
Lots of people did not and still don&#39;t know this. There are still normies that think Obama was &quot;ok&quot; or even &quot;great&quot; lol. We&#39;ve had SHIT presidents for decades, at least since Reagan.</p>

<p>Hell no is Obama a socialist, or even a moderate rightist. Obama is slightly left of far right Romney......wallstreet/banksters/corporations own both parties. This is the real American spectrum:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png">https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png</a></p>

<p>(Modern) Dems and Repubs are NEOliberal corporatist shills and have corporate media at their disposal to promote itself. </p>

<p>Is it really hard to believe the &quot;it wasn&#39;t real socialism&quot; thing when the world is ruled by psychopath extreme-capitalist oligarchs? There are many types of socialism but you get what I mean. If we look at &quot;communism&quot; which is a far far left version of socialism.....the USSR wasn&#39;t communist even though the whole world repeats that bullshit. Even Lenin admitted it was (authoritarian) state capitalism. Bureaucrats controlling everything does not = common ownership. Similarly, not all social programs are socialistic and non-profit. It depends on how it&#39;s run.  </p>

<p>If the president was centrist/social democracy, the social programs would be non-profit (efficient) or regulated against unethical conduct. For example, the UK has more affordable healthcare than the U.S. but even that is semi-privatized and a bit crappy but not as crappy as Obamacare/full corporate U.S. system. It used to be superior true nationalized efficient single payer, and so did the U.S. during FDR. Socialism doesn&#39;t mean no capitalism, it&#39;s a spectrum. :)</p>
