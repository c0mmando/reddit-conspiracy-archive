        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can’t just off these people because they are also assets of God, so they are constantly being guarded. Hence all the mind fucking, gang stalking, and basically psychological torture. They know who will be what in the future through accessing the hall of soul records and knowledge aka akashic records. The gov employs the best psychics and mystics because they use them to predict events down to the detail via soul records. This is how the Simpsons knew Donald Trump would be president over 15 years ago. I know this sounds batshit insane but it is my opinion after asking many targeted individuals why they believe they are being attacked. They all more or less say the same thing, that they dunno but that they admittedly are anti-government and anarachists at heart e.g. revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Destiny is a funny thing as regardless of how hard you try to alter it, it will inevitably happen. Because if you were successful then that wouldn’t tagged in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow +friended you immediately. I can tell right away you KNOW WHATS UP! When did it start for you? My theory is the attacks emanate from the crazy looking &quot;cell towers.&quot; Why? Because they beamed me in various major cities but never deep in mountains. The people running this shit are very spiritual as they also target dreams and incorporate black magic into the mix. Its like an onslaught. I believe its a preemptive attack of sorts. They are getting ahead of the ppl who are bound to eventually fight them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, happened to me shortly after I had a bit of a spiritual breakthrough after a a particularly strong psychedelic trip. I started feeling my depression and anxiety I had developed early on in life lose its hold on me and I told my friend how much better I was feeling  for the first time in a long while and how I was feeling positive about the future.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It seems to me that they don&#39;t want you to feel good, they don&#39;t want you to get better, they don&#39;t want you to utilize the knowledge you developed for the benefit of the world around you. They want to keep you in a constantly traumatized state. They want to keep you dumbed down and bring you back down to that easily controllable level. It seems to me more than anything they will target free-spirited individuals who understand that all the fucked up stuff happening in the world is not right and should be stopped.</p>

<p>Were you diagnosed with candida? If so, health practitioners would prescribe much more than a simple diet.  Diet does not eradicate biofilm. Candida cannot be eradicated without eradicating biofilm. That is why candida emits biofilm.  Treatments for candida:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to break my reply into two parts because reddit has a maximum of 10000.</p>

<p>PART ONE</p>

<p>One of the trends I have been facing regularly over the past ten years is finding employment. The trend that continually happens is, I apply to many jobs and receive no response for an extended period of time, even though I am qualified. I finally get a job offer and its always a situation where I am forced to work in an environment with extreme harassment, entrapment, and unequal opportunity. Where I live there is a law that employers must disclose any requests for employment history to you. One strange fact is even though I have applied for hundreds of jobs, my past two employers reported that zero companies contacted them to verify my employment history. Yet another piece of evidence that will probably be ignored despite my efforts to expose this.</p>

<p>After the initial extreme event that triggered the overt harassment that started for me about 10 years ago. It seems like people were celebrating what had happened as if there was some sort of victory. I know of one guy that started celebrating (he had threatened me before and was deeply involved with a christian based church), another guy called me and knew where my exact location was, an ex-roomate called me just after it happened to literally just say &quot;haha&quot;, an ex-girlfriend called me to brag that she had so much &quot;stuff&quot; now as in physical possessions( After I broke up with her she traveled to a college I used to attend and spread slanderous rumors about me) . I found out one person deeply involved got fired from his job around the same time as the event (maybe he got caught doing something he should not have, guys name was Jason). Point being I think some third party initiates something to determine your reaction, while at the same time many people around you covertly attack you to try and skew the results/get a leg up on you.</p>

<p>The following situation was a forewarning of future events that happened several months and years later. The fact that this person was able to tell me this information proves that almost all of these situations were premeditated and there was little or nothing i could do to prevent them. The woman I was dating mentioned here (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/746r4q/its_an_arbitrary_thing/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/746r4q/its_an_arbitrary_thing/</a>) had a friend who was part of a christian based church and came to visit. He gave me a russian made pilot watch as a gift out of the blue, I thought it was kind of odd and have and email message from him proving he gave it to me. He told me that he did not like my freedom of speech and that I should avoid working for big companies. Another one of her friends who happened to be a drug dealer told me that maybe I would have a better life if I moved to germany. All off this took place prior to the incident that occured here (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/79g221/a_strange_incident/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/79g221/a_strange_incident/</a>). As I started to progress in my career and actually worked for a couple larger companies, I learned why he told me to avoid large companies. I was subjected to terrible attacks that caused extreme emotional distress, If anyone is interested I might do a post that details exactly what I experienced, even though it will be hard for many people to believe.</p>

<p>Color sensitization a lot of this is commonly done with cars especially if you drive a lot.</p>

<p>Colors in cars, clothing, logos, pretty much everywhere. Nature has a natural order of colors that may sometimes have a meaning. Call it conditioning or whatever you want, lots of people experience some kind of color conditioning to convey a sort of meaning. Vehicle colors, clothing etc. My understanding is its mostly totally ridiculous garbage and is like listening to a emotional woman on PMS trying to explain how her emotions are real and not just PMS this time. Irrational nonsense, arbitrary, not really very useful, and annoying. Found here also: <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread921383/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread921383/pg1</a> &quot;Color Harassment. T.I.s are systematically harassed by Perps that use color codes. Sometimes it will be a street full of Perps wearing red shirts or green shirts. This is a good time to bring up the fact that almost all harassment is done from vehicles, mostly bicycles and cars. But you never know. The important thing to know is that the Perps harass by using uniform colors. They might have 3 or 4 white cars and a white van all pull up on your block at once. &quot; <a href="http://www.zersetzung.org/areyoutargeted-com/61-ayt-articles/336-ayt-sensitization-and-why-it-works-so-well#sens-aware">http://www.zersetzung.org/areyoutargeted-com/61-ayt-articles/336-ayt-sensitization-and-why-it-works-so-well#sens-aware</a></p>

<p>They are obsessed with sexual thinking.</p>

<p>They are obsessed with sexual thinking. Non-ti&#39;s may date multiple people, new people each week, etc. Its a huge double standard. The perps are obsessed with what seems like trying to cause sexual thinking or harassment surrounding this. It seems like they want to ban any type of sexual thinking by the target.</p>

<p>Attempts to prevent dating.</p>

<p>Have noticed perps will attempt to prevent ti&#39;s from dating and meeting partners. Person with a partner is not usually subjected to the gang-stalking attacks like single ti&#39;s are, and they are malicious, so they try to prevent you dating. Additionally they tend to want to limit your selection of potential partners to people they choose. The people they choose may have malicious intentions.</p>

<p>Obsessed with labeling someone with a illness or disease with no actual evidence or diagnosis.</p>

<p>They seem to always want to invent a reason to disregard the target. The target can be perfectly healthy, but will be labeled with any number of ailments when there was never any diagnosis or reason for this. Even when this is disproved nothing is reversed and they find a new thing to lie about.</p>

<p>Doublespeak/Rumors</p>

<p>Forms of communication they tend to like to use doublespeak, using metaphors, talking about someone else when actually referring to the target etc. Using this method they can&#39;t directly be accused of slander. This type of rumor spreading is not an effective or accurate form of communication because it can&#39;t be verified (is lies 99% of the time in my experience) the target has little or no way to refute or defend against this. I have noticed the same rumors and nonsense being discussed around me from job to job, place to place, I&#39;m not sure what the source is. Advice/hints</p>

<p>The perps will attempt to give advice or hints about an issue or problem in the targets life. In my experience they are almost always wrong, non-useful, and annoying. Many times they are referring to someone other than you and don&#39;t even know it, they have likely been told likes about the target in a form of scapegoating/person switching.</p>

<p>External identifying thing.</p>

<p>There seems to be some kind of external identifying thing that follows the target around and the perps somehow instantly know information about the target. It seems like the perps are able to switch this thing with another person in a malicious way to cause the target to be blamed for things etc. I don&#39;t know how they do this or what exactly it is that enables the thing. Switching roles?</p>

<p>They are obsessed with attempting to impersonate people or accuse people of impersonations. How do I make it clear that I DON&#39;T want to be like anyone else or be impersonated by anyone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART TWO</p>

<p>Three important terms:</p>

<p>*Apriorism: the doctrine that knowledge rests upon principles that are self-evident to reason or are presupposed by experience in general. They disregard any information that is contrary to the conclusion they want with no reason for doing so.</p>

<p>*Aphorism: a terse saying embodying a general truth, or astute observation. Arbitrary illogical statements.</p>

<p>*Anthropomorphous descriptions are common(resembling or made to resemble a human form). Perps tend to like to describe people with anthropomorphous descriptions in a disparaging way. Common animals used, dog, cat, snake, rabbit, dinosaur, monster, etc. This type of language serves two main purposes, the first is from a psychological perspective it causes people not to sympathize with the target as a fellow person. The second is it serves as an insult by referring to the target as a creature with lower intelligence and worse behavior. Endless harassing testing and observing</p>

<p>During a first encounter with a new office or group of people they tend to do some type of testing phase. They will prance around in strange ways, ask weird questions, bend over in front of you etc. Then shortly after this they make some kind of conclusion. Even if the TI meets some unknown criteria, they usually lie and make an arbitrary decision anyway.</p>

<p>They want to constantly try to falsely associate you with gambling, drinking, smoking tobacco. Sometimes you see people smoking on your street corner and then you start hearing anti-smoking ads on tv and the radio, this is strange when you don&#39;t use tobacco.</p>

<p>They try to claim you are muslim even when you are not.</p>

<p>They try to portray you as gay when you are heterosexual, this ties into trying to prevent dating.</p>

<p>A big one is they want to portray you as having lots of money or have been rich in the past. The truth is they never actually gave you a chance, they just want to make it seem that way.</p>

<p>They want to claim you are dangerous in some way and therefor need to be observed, like a minority report dystopian future precrime scenario. They do this even when it makes no sense and you have never committed a crime.</p>

<p>Whenever someone does something really weird or something strange is done to you, they like to say you did it to yourself, which makes no sense.</p>

<p>Religious groups seem to play a large part in this issue.</p>

<p>There seems to be a large racial component to this issue.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think the only reason this continues is so they can continue to try and cover up the past.</p>

<p>These are things that has been consistently happening since I became aware of the organized harassment.</p>

<p>Clue one: Whenever I am with a group and go into a restaurant, venue, or event, there is something that happens. The staff first starts to observe me a little. Then some members of the staff start to behave like they want to pretend I am part of the staff. I am just a guy at the establishment, why would they pretend I am part of the staff? I almost sense like they believe they are showing empathy by doing so. Did they ever think to consider I don&#39;t want that? This is a remnant of one of the measurable effects of the thing they are hiding from us. What can we determine by analyzing this behavior? One thing implied by this behavior is that there are secret groups that are formed through social associations. They know when someone is not part of these groups. If they know this then they must have an extra sensory perception. It all keeps coming back to the same thing, related to telepathy etc. This is the one point I have not been able to get past and I believe is the key to everything.</p>

<p>Clue two: If I am around a group of people and something externally good is happening then they mob/croud me. For example if i get recognition for something and get mentioned in a publication, people instantly know and attempt to mob crowd around my proximity. Not sure why this happens, it just does.</p>

<p>Clue three: If i am applying for a position somewhere, it seems like the group is able to observe me wherever I am and people want to try and sabotage me. For example I am applying for a job with a new company. People around me start to talk over me, interrupt me, walk in front of me and generally do things to try and make me look bad. I have not told anyone about my application, but they know and do things to try and disturb the situation. This implies two things, they know what you are doing, and someone/group is able to observe you. It is very clear that they are both malicious and want to prevent you from succeeding.</p>

<p>I go into public and people mention worthless advice about details of my life I have never mentioned to them. At work people consistently make a harrumph to interrupt me, and they can&#39;t even see me. If I&#39;m doing something that accomplishes a goal people go out of their way to try and interrupt/stop me(loud noises start happening at that moment etc). When I am in a crowded room people measurably react if I think about certain things, as if they have a mild emotional responses to my thoughts. Chatter may instantly increase or decrease in intensity. Sometimes even a momentary silence. More people may show up within seconds. I have noticed when among a group, people instantly react to cell phone activity, as if they are wired directly into a computer network? The instant that email or sms goes out, or the instant I login to something, there is an immediate reaction from the crowd. Cars drive by, people look at me with different facial expressions based on the cell phone call I&#39;m having at that moment. If I&#39;m in a meeting the speaker may use relevant doublespeak related to my laptop use at that moment and they can&#39;t see the screen. I find myself trying to figure out how this is possible? Is almost everyone part of a telepathic network? There is no possible way that people can communicate this fast with traditional methods. The most chilling aspect of this is whatever they have, I have been left out completely. Why am I being left out and virtually everyone around me part of this ... whatever it is.</p>

<p>Another example i&#39;m out shopping at the mall. I give the teller my old phone number for a coupon. Suddenly the environment around me turns nasty, im getting looks and comments immediately. The fact that people are directly wired into electronic communications creates a hostile environment for me and unfair advantage to them. Its completely ridiculous. All my businesses get ruined because of it.</p>

<p>It feels like being vulnerable to everyone all the time and it&#39;s never a good feeling. To me it feels like psychological torture. I have discovered this to be one of the most intensely and fiercely covered-up aspects gangstalking. The solution that people around me try to do is usually to pretend i&#39;m someone else, which has never helped and usually makes thing worse and is a crappy idea to begin with, does not solve the ROOT issue. Someone messaged me with a clue that its related to &quot;morphic resonance&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you take the time to describe one of your experiences with being harassed by cars? For example, I have had people use anchoring, an NLP method, where I will exit my home and have someone rush out in front of my car wearing a blue shirt. I am forced to stop short and then as I return to driving a clue car swerves out in front of me as a jogger in blue jogs past me on the side of the road. I return to driving and a blue car is on the side of the road with hazard lights on and I turn into a parking lot at a store to buy coffee and a blue cars swings in and a person wearing blue steps out of the vehicle quickly to go into the store at the same time. When I exit and return to driving down the road away from the store a person in a blue sweatshirt raises their arm while turning their back towards me as I pass. </p>

<p>This sounds nutty but it is an example of how anchoring can occur in a car. I have had it happen in very dangerous ways but the point is to shock the person to associate an internal response to the color. This can get elaborate as they drop blue crap such as bright blue crap on the corner by where I live. Items such as rolled up blue sweatshirts, bright blue bins etc. will be left. The process of getting someone to associate a fear response to a color can be done while the target is driving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been done over and over to me since the fall of 2016. It is done in rapid succession. When I realized it was NLP I had to literally stop myself from dissociating and reacting to it all. I had to remove myself from it all physically. You can&#39;t imagine what this all is because it is really sick. 
I also see so many videos online that are fake because it makes those researching this discard the idea of the anchoring. If someone caught anchoring on film it would help. I have only seen one video that caught some of it where he filmed from his car as people waited for him to leave. That was all real but it still does not capture the intensity of what they do.</p>

<p>My problem now is that I don&#39;t know if what they use on targets causes actual damage to our bodies. I can&#39;t imagine who to go to in order to get help.</p>
