       With the bombshell intelligence report being a complete dud I want to showcase not all conspiracies are the same. Case and point the theory Russia influenced our election to disrupt the country and elect Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have intelligence agencies confirming this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have Trump asking Putin for Hilary emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a meeting between Trumps son and Russian officials that they lied about.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have Trump insulting every world leader including allies except for Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps wants Putin back in G7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Falsely equivicated that were just as bad as Putin in defense of him
      </p>
      <p>
       Next we have the last three right wing conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama wiretap, Nunes memo and the current intelligence report.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the difference between these? Russia collusion theory keeps having part confirmed and relevant information added as they investigate. The last three right wing conspiracies have fizzled out in a matter of days due to being smoke and mirrors. Really step back and look at how things play out and recognize what makes a theory credible and what makes a theory just something somebody thought up

       The report was a dud. So much so supporters of Trump have hyped it up got disappointed and now think 5 small redacted lines will change the original conclusion of the report. Also none of what you said disproves anything I said. It's your opinions and those aren't facts

       The conclusion of an investigation holds more weight that an opinion from a redditor and I suggest you don't hold your breath for 5 redacted sentences to completely 180 a reports conclusion.

       Yes the obvious implication here is that the meeting is nothing new?

       When I say we've been asking for evidence for a year now, some was yes? But it's still far from what would be required to impeach a president?

       If the best evidence you can point me to is the Don Jr. and russian lawyer meeting, again, you have no evidence of the claims you make

       No that is some of the publicly available evidence, your initial claim (which i even quoted to you) was that you have seen NO evidence, which is clearly false. But now I see I am talking to you in 2 threads and in both you are simply equivocating once it becomes obvious your chain of logic is ridiculous.

       Actually we have a lot of evidence publicly available already! But beyond that Mueller won't comment on what his findings are or have shown until he completes his investigation, though he has already gotten both guilty pleas and many indictments. I recommend you start here if you really believe there is no evidence yet available to the public: np.reddit.com

       Go read up on it and go figure out what Manafort's role in it is, minuscule role in the grand scheme of things but it's still a matter that arose during the initial investigation into the 2016 election meddling ;)

 It's one piece of multiple. Add it to the meeting and lying about it, the intelligence communities investigations, insulting everyone but Putin, asking for Putin to be allowed back into g7,and all the Trump campaign members being caught in contact with,Russian officials
