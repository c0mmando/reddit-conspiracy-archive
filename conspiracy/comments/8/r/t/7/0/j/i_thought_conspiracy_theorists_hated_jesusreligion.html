<p>How can you hate religion but still ultimately agree with Jesus? I had thought conspiracy theorists were usually Atheists, since a lot say religion is mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was not a socialist, sorry. he encouraged us to give of our own, to be a living sacrifice - not to create a state which increases taxes to fund a class of people permanently fixed to stipends and &quot;mob wife&quot; handouts. </p>

<p>Socialism gives a man a fish, no teaching. </p>

<p>Consider how every socialist revolution has gone and killed the farmers - that&#39;s not Christlike to me, and is a deliberate attempt to make it impossible for a man to learn to provide for himself and his family. </p>

<p>Just my two cents. </p>

<p>&quot;And I&#39;ll say to myself, &#39;You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.&#39; But God said to him, &#39;You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?&#39; This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.&quot; - Luke 12:19-21</p>

<p>&quot;He who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich - both come to poverty.&quot; - Proverbs 22:16</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can hate what religion has become but still be fond of the original teachings regarding such religions. For example, Jesus taught many good things such as forgiveness and love for all, even those who are wicked, cruel, and broken. These are pure teachings. However, Churches and other religious establishments often teach the converse of these pure teachings.  An example of this would be shunning gays, people with tattoos and other such trivial differences that religious people hold against others, despite the teachings of Jesus. This is why many people hate religion but enjoy the teachings of religious figureheads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe question the first lie you were told ie &quot;religion&quot;
Because if you believe in books that have been rewritten so many times to divide and control the masses and you don&#39;t question that, then any conspiracy theories you do  question are oppsolet.
Basically your eyes are wide shut if you believe in any religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are presented with a false Jesus (religion) at childhood and then he&#39;s mixed with the likes of Santa Claus so that we naturally reject him as we grow older.  Atheism is just a symptom of the false science that is peddled as truth these days.  They believe their high priests no matter what nonsense they tell them.  Once you dive down the rabbit hole you start to see all the lies of the system and have to go back to square one.  Even fake conspiracies are created to distract us from the truth (red herrings).  What was the first conspiracy?  For me, it was Santa (Satan) Claus.  What came next?  Jesus Christ.  It was only natural.  Once you know the entire system is set up and controlled you have to ask why is it set up that way?  It&#39;s set up that way so that one of the first things you reject is the actual truth and it seems so basic to you that you never look back.  That&#39;s why you must start over from scratch and come at this like a little child again.  Jesus Christ is literally the truth, the only truth.  All &quot;religion&quot; is false.  Most people who claim to be Christian are not.  They worship a false Christ.  Religion is a man made system of things you must do to get to a better place after you die.  The truth is Jesus Christ is God who died for your sins and he did all the work for you.  All the world is set up so that you never realize this.  This is because the world is run spiritually by Lucifer.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1¬† Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;¬†</p>

<p>1Co 15:2¬† By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.¬†</p>

<p>1Co 15:3¬† For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;¬†</p>

<p>1Co 15:4¬† And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:¬†</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Christians deny conspiracies? (Unless they listen to their initiated church leaders.)</p>

<p>&quot;Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders, And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord.&quot; Jeremiah 9:4-6</p>

<p>&quot;And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.&quot; Luke 4:5-8</p>
