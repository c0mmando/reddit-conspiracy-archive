       But then I saw a video of Alex Jones praying. And that guy David Icke says he hates religion but liked the teachings/ideals of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you hate religion but still ultimately agree with Jesus? I had thought conspiracy theorists were usually Atheists, since a lot say religion is mind control.

       Jesus was not a socialist, sorry. he encouraged us to give of our own, to be a living sacrifice - not to create a state which increases taxes to fund a class of people permanently fixed to stipends and "mob wife" handouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socialism gives a man a fish, no teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider how every socialist revolution has gone and killed the farmers - that's not Christlike to me, and is a deliberate attempt to make it impossible for a man to learn to provide for himself and his family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       You probably shouldn‚Äôt ever use public roads when you need to get around... or call the fire department if your house catches on fire... or the police for any civil/criminal needs. They‚Äôre filthy social programs. I would hate for you to be contaminated from that vile, vile hippie socialist stuff.

       Adorable little straw man argument you built there. Nothing wrong with a community pooling its resources to achieve communal benefits - but centralized planning far removed from any given community is what I'm talking about, and you knowwwwww it :)

       No as long as the funds and decisions are generated locally I don't have an issue with it. Most fire departments are volunteer based anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point still stands, I don't think we can call Jesus a socialist. Or a capitalist. Its just emotional manipulation either way, to get a certain group to adopt your political thinking.

       Me thinks you‚Äôre trying not to tell the truth. Me thinks you don‚Äôt like the idea of helping people that don‚Äôt want to help themselves and in your eyes, would be taking advantage of the system and stealing from you. And I think that of you because that is the overwhelming majority opinion of anyone I‚Äôve ever asked what they have against socialism.

       But, keep dancing around it. It doesn‚Äôt make it any less true by not outright saying it.

       You can hate what religion has become but still be fond of the original teachings regarding such religions. For example, Jesus taught many good things such as forgiveness and love for all, even those who are wicked, cruel, and broken. These are pure teachings. However, Churches and other religious establishments often teach the converse of these pure teachings.  An example of this would be shunning gays, people with tattoos and other such trivial differences that religious people hold against others, despite the teachings of Jesus. This is why many people hate religion but enjoy the teachings of religious figureheads.

       I‚Äôm into conspiracy‚Äôs and also Christian it‚Äôs not exclusive. Being religious makes a conspiracy even deeper for me at least. When you factor in the devil, demons, and biblical scriptures on some subjects it gets pretty interesting.

       It is kinda forced because the people at the heart of most of the conspiring, have a full faith in the luciferian part of religion. What that means for us is that we have a clearly evil force and the only way to understand the enemy is to study religion, spirituality, and the occult.

       I've found the opposite.  A large chunk of the conspiracy community is religious people who feel that society is being destroyed by erosion of morals.  I don't have time for religious nonsense, but I don't entirely disagree with them.

       Considering Alex Jones is widely regarded as a controlled disinformation asset, it makes sense that he would be trying to tie the ideas of "conspiracy theorists" and "religiosity" together. It helps drive the narrative that conspiracy theorists are all "alt right" goons. One of the mods even made a post about this trend recently, saying that there was an inorganic push to make this sub be seen as T_D 2.0 even when many people here are very liberal.

       Believing that the Bible tells a lot of ‚Äústories‚Äù and believing that the fictional, or nonfictional, words of Yeshua of Nazareth may carry some weight and be good to live by are not mutually exclusive. What a lot of people hate is organized religion and the way a simple message of ‚Äúhey be good to people and believe in yourself and everything will be cool‚Äù has been bastardized into an empire that stands for none of those things and actively opposes them a lot of the time. Also, just from talking to people, a lot of Christians seem to have never read the Bible. It‚Äôs like a kid who tells you he loves reggae and then can only name 4 bob Marley songs they heard on the radio.

       Not necessarily. This sub does not have an official position on any matter, other than "conspiracies exist". In any event, metaphysical questions, such as whether God exists or not, are outside the remit of

       As for organised religions - these are purely human constructs, and without doubt they are conspiracies to control the behaviour of the masses, but that wasn't your question.

       Maybe question the first lie you were told ie "religion"
Because if you believe in books that have been rewritten so many times to divide and control the masses and you don't question that, then any conspiracy theories you do  question are oppsolet.
Basically your eyes are wide shut if you believe in any religion.

       We are presented with a false Jesus (religion) at childhood and then he's mixed with the likes of Santa Claus so that we naturally reject him as we grow older.  Atheism is just a symptom of the false science that is peddled as truth these days.  They believe their high priests no matter what nonsense they tell them.  Once you dive down the rabbit hole you start to see all the lies of the system and have to go back to square one.  Even fake conspiracies are created to distract us from the truth (red herrings).  What was the first conspiracy?  For me, it was Santa (Satan) Claus.  What came next?  Jesus Christ.  It was only natural.  Once you know the entire system is set up and controlled you have to ask why is it set up that way?  It's set up that way so that one of the first things you reject is the actual truth and it seems so basic to you that you never look back.  That's why you must start over from scratch and come at this like a little child again.  Jesus Christ is literally the truth, the only truth.  All "religion" is false.  Most people who claim to be Christian are not.  They worship a false Christ.  Religion is a man made system of things you must do to get to a better place after you die.  The truth is Jesus Christ is God who died for your sins and he did all the work for you.  All the world is set up so that you never realize this.  This is because the world is run spiritually by Lucifer.

       "Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders, And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord." Jeremiah 9:4-6

       "And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." Luke 4:5-8
