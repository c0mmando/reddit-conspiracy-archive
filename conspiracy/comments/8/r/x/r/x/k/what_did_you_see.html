       Okay since I started this thread it is fair that I go first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a UFO once.  I have always looked at the sky, my entire life I waited to see something.
      </p>
      <p>
       During my early twenties I was involved in an experiment that has been going on since time immemorial.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would go door to door and cross country and attempt to convince others that we were worthy of their investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once, in our travels, I saw something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have only ever seen one object that I would consider to be a UFO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was trying to avoid work, on the top floor of an apartment I should have been canvasing.  Me and another person, a close friend, were looking out from a balcony.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a green opaque light appear from a copse of trees and rise into the air.  It then paused before dashing away.  I don't have another description for what it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend forgot seeing it, being there with me, getting out of the car, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ended up breaking up with their girlfriend because they couldn't get it up and left the company because they lost the skill we hired them for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have another experience, but this one is why I am here.

       It's all good.  At least you tried.  I always think it's weird when people need to go through contextless comments in an attempt judge someone or to understand ones position on anything.  Doesn't seem like an honest effort.
      </p>

       It's more fun to experience people.

       Submission statement:  I saw what I would refer to as a UFO once.  I was on the top floor of an apartment building in Oregon.  I saw an orb of opaque light, greenish, rise out of the woods and dash towards the horizon.  It was "see through" and a witness beside me lost all memory of the event.

       Yes, I live in Las Vegas. On 2 occasions I saw black triangle UFOs. The first one had to be huge, like 1000m on a side. I couldn't even make myself understand what I was seeing, the scale was so huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a month later I was out running in a pitch black area, and I saw a much smaller black triangle. Totally silent...just slowly cruising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then something of the paranormal variety... i was in a really bad spot in my life, like really bad, pretty much ready to check out. I'm playing EQ on my PC and out of the corner of my eye I see a young couple sitting on this little recliner sling chair I had. I take a closer look, and they are wearing outdated clothes. Like shit you would wear to the park in the 40's. It made me feel this...peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward a couple months, I go with my dad to sort out my favorite grandma's effects, she had passed a year previously.  My grandfather I never met, he passed when I was 3, but my family always said we were exactly alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I am going through this old box of photo albums that had not seen the light in decades. I surely had never seen it before. And in there is a picture of my grandparents wearing those exact same clothes as the apparitions, at a park in Canada. And you could tell they were in love and very happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took that to mean they were trying to help me feel better. Was never really into ghosts, spirits, religion, whatever. But I will never forget that. They shared what had to be what had to be their happiest moment with me.

       The UFO I saw never seemed to be a "craft" of any kind.  I could almost see through it, like it was a distortion that was intelligently controlled but I remember having a similar feeling of thinking that what I was looking at was too enormous to comprehend.  That feeling always struck me as strange because the image I remember seeing wasn't of a large object at all (Maybe car sized).  It seemed like there was a disconnect between what I was perceiving and what I was seeing.

       I came here when David Brock’s minions took control of reddit. I had an older account banned because I was so vocal on r/politics, and  r/sanders4prez about how Clinton cheated Bernie. This was one of the only big subs that talked about it at the time. I’ve known about theories for awhile. Watching pre-reactionary alex jones documentaries and stuff. I would come here sometimes but some of the shit was outlandish like some of the posts still posted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m still thankful for this sub even though there is biased mods here, but I feel like it’s one of the bastions of free speech on this stupid fucking site

       A sub that bans you for talking bad about the president cant be considered a bastion of free speech. Thats just insanity. Seriously, how could anyone think that? Say what you want about r/politics but its not literally fucking named r/hills_shills and it doesnt instantly ban every single person who whispers any kind of dissent.

       The donald is about donald trump, you cant go to the donald to say stuff about trump obviously, is like coming to conspiracy to shit on conspiracies, but the information flows like in no other sub, cause almost all others are fully censored, on the d you could have heard some news that show literally nowhere else, some times a week in advance, there is a reason the numbers have to be faked, it is actually more than several millions and they roll them back, the mods sell the advertising for 6+million and the official count is 600.000+  , its probably the board with the most posts, and humor flows uncensored, not against jews and trump, but that is obvious

       To be honest, I don't recall ever seeing anything out of the ordinary firsthand. I'm mostly here for political conspiracies. However, I once dated a guy diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia who certainly piqued my interest in the more paranormal arenas of conspiracy. He maintained that men in black wiped his mind and made it so hard for him to function, and he talked a lot about the illuminati and such. He was really politically informed as well as a creative deep thinker. Mostly I think it was prolonged drug abuse that triggered some latent schizophrenia and he genuinely has it, but still, that doesn't mean he was wrong about everything.

       I have personally seen a ghost. Or spirit. Or jinn. I don't know what it was. I have searched in vain for what I saw. While it didn't seem manevolent, I felt great power, like what a fly would feel before being swatted maybe. I have researched since that day. I have left my body numerous times. I have used dmt and tried heroic doses of mushrooms.I  think the closet to what I saw seems to be the famous picture of the ghoul type figure at the altar. The ghost monk of Newby Church.

       I was a Catholic altar boy. At the Christchurch Catholic Cathedral. I was seriously considering being a priest. I was putting candles out, and I smelt something. Like earth, roses, wood, ash. I am now a le cordon bleu qualified chef and recreated these as tastes and smells to an almost identical level. Anyway, I saw a figure at the altar. But unlike the picture it was behind the altar and I could only see the top half. Now I have never found out if this is true but one of my priests told me once that every true Catholic altar has a tiny part of Jesus in it. If you stand behind the altar where a priest would giving mass and look directly down to the altar, there is a small square cut out of the usually marble. But it is perfectly put back in so you can just see the perfect outline if you know where to look. Under this square, at this church supposedly had a small piece of fingernail. From Jesus. This part of the altar is almost always covered in a blessed cloth. And it is above this the priest blesses the Eucharist and wine. So.. To me it looked like it was behind the altar, but with it's arms crossed in front at the hands and the hands were above the small piece of altar. Like it was warming itself or taking power or I really do not know. So I first smelt the smells, then felt the presence then saw it for as long as it took to blink and then nothing. No one else around. I never altar served again. And only reluctantly go to church nowadays for funerals or weddings. I have never seen another conspiracy close to it, but I have a feeling if I went on to be a priest I may have learnt what that truly was. I am for ever searching for what that was and what it was doing.

       I saw a being once, during a traumatic family event, that struck me as immensely strange, powerful and malevolent.  It's a hard story to tell and I can't ever seem to properly describe the experience so I sort of avoid discussing it.

       I came here years ago, and started off browsing subs like r/sex (I know, cringe) then I came across these testimonies of 2 young kids in Hampstead London who said they were part of Satanic Ritual Abuse and I’ve been on r/conspiracy ever since.   I’ve never witnessed anything firsthand but the evidence for child trafficking and satanic abuse in this world is off the charts.

       Studying conspiracies, hoaxes, and the paranormal are a fun hobby. I love diving into rabbit holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been awake since the mid-80's in terms of consciousness and creativity. After a prolonged period of adventures in consciousness. People in these rabbit holes tend to talk about "being awake" all the time, but unless one realizes what the real self is and sees that one is not separate from one's experience, that the observer is the observed, and enters a real creative orientation in the here and now, then you're not really awake at all. And you're truly at the mercy of the social and political currents.

       This is probably one of the most important problem in our society to address. The longer it goes on the less likely it becomes that a peaceful solution can be found.  It's scary to think that regular every day people are quickly becoming chattel to an untouchable elite ruling class.  I think about this every day.

       Capital! So I will give my experience first and then try to fit it into the broader world of modern conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Context:
      </p>
      <p>
       The US economy was weak under Jimmy Carter in large part because of the Energy Crisis of 1980 and the war between Iraq and Iran (9/1980) and the Armed Forces were underfunded. In the same time period several serious international incidents broke out: the US decision to deploy 500+ Pershing II nuclear missiles in Germany (12/1979), the Iranian revolution installing Ayatollah Khomeini (12/1979) and the American hostage crisis in Tehran (10/1979), US support started for the anti-Soviet Afghan Mujihadeen (1980), the Solidarity movement sending Poland into martial law (12/1981) and the assassination attempt on the Polish Pope John Paul II (5/1981). Also, the wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua got underway (1980), which would eventually turn into the Iran-Contra scandal (portrayed in recent movie "American Made").
      </p>
      <p>
       October Surprise:
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the situation when a secret operation hatched by our dear friends Cheney, Bush I, Oliver North, and associated Clowns In America, known as "The October Surprise" went down. The two key events for it were the attempt to rescue the hostages by special forces, which failed (Delta Force's first big mission Eagle Claw, also known as the Desert One disaster - 4/1980), and the release of hostages minutes after Ronald Reagan was inaugurated (1/1981) obviously timed to emphasize a secret deal between Iran and the Reagan camp. Most observers believe Carter had a good chance of winning without the Iran crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe, the Army:
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a smart kid who ended up in the US Army in West Germany during the late 1970's and early 1980's. This period was the absolute low-point for the Army following de-Vietnamization. Morale and discipline were low, drug and alcohol use was near 100%, the vast majority of enlisted men did not have a HS degree, and the officer corps and NCO's were generally lax, incompetent and dis-spirited.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK this is where it gets weird - you just have to hold on and believe I'm being as honest as I have ever been about my experience. The force collected for the Desert One operation included soldiers from W. German based US units. I knew a guy - he was Iranian and experienced. He never said anything about it, but he was gone for that entire period.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Army units in West Germany had been exposed for many months to incessant mind control through at least two vectors:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The AFN (Armed Forces Network) television programming, in which were inserted mind-bending PSA's (Public Service Announcements - the AFN version of commercials, that didn't sell anything except weirdness).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The steady infiltration of extremely potent, drug-laced marijuana and several other hallucinogens into the unit's barracks. There was absolutely no explanation for the amount and easy availability of these recreational drugs, but the soldiers almost uniformly cashed it in and got stoned, while watching AFN weirdness.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       These Psychological Warfare efforts aimed directly at our own troops, combined with the low level of overall preparedness and morale, meant that the soldiers stationed in Europe at that time were not in peak condition to blouse their boots, let alone drive hundreds of miles through hostile territory and rescue guarded hostages. But I could only see it in person from that angle, where I could know the weird mental re-conditioning of just a few of the contributing participants, not from the aspect of the entire Delta Force contingent itself, which mobilized from the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gulf, the Navy:
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was on leave I took aircraft "hops" around europe to various US bases, and checked in for a meal and bunk overnight. One evening I was bunking in a room with a Navy guy. We got to talking, and for some reason I started in on the weird psychological aspects of the AFN. You have to understand that in situations like this, you didn't know how anybody would react, because you didn't know if it was allowed - since the chain-of-command never, ever explained anything about this weird psychological warfare "test" I'm trying to describe.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I spoke he got really quiet and his eyes just about bugged out. He then confided that it was much worse on board Navy vessels - AFN was the only source of news and entertainment - their reality about the outside world was totally based on AFN programs, and he said that when he was recently deployed the level of weirdness was completely off the charts. Although he never specified when and where he deployed - everything pointed to the Persian Gulf in 1980 supporting that abortive rescue attempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Theory - The October Surprise Coup:
      </p>
      <p>
       A whole lot was going on when I first put on my conspiracy hat. The cold war was at a peak of tension with nuclear threats in europe, and mideast wars, and central american wars, and a critical US election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the failure of the Delta Force rescue mission doomed the Carter re-election effort, and set up the October Surprise of 1980, amounting to a coup d'etat by the insider power-elite from Yale Skull and Bones society, with Bush I and II and the Clintons+O sharing the imperial presidency for nearly 36 crucial years thereafter (1980-2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       This event was the Step 2 of the takeover following JFK Step 1, and preceding Step 3, which was 9/11. 1963 - 1980 - 2001. We are due.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early Mass Mind Control:
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the AFN ran an experimental psy-op to ensure the soldiers and sailors on station would be incapable of staging an effective rescue operation. It happened exactly at the time the Reagan-Bush campaign was trying to prevent such a success story for Jimmy Carter. The AFN at that time was a special unit inside the Defense Department tasked with informing and entertaining service men and women, as well as propaganda. Somebody hacked the AFN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since my experiences in West Germany, watching those PSA's that featured aliens and Nazis and speaking backwards, high, I have tried to understand what they meant. My own country's military treated me like a guinea pig in a big experiment. Someone ordered it, and someone permitted it to fly. It's not the same as MKUltra or Gulf War Syndrome, but it is related.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the results from that secret psychological conditioning experiment have been digested and can be found re-applied at the root of what we now must all enter into - a world without solid foundations where appearances are always suspect based on who constructs and delivers both the message and the medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Postscript:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a sonnet I composed during it - my therapy art
      </p>
      <p>
       November 1980
      </p>
      <p>
       November snow, a quilted white aphasia,
Scuttles past out-scoured crystal features
And scattered buildings in a man-made maze of
Frozen glass and gritty concrete seizures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrapped in numb amnesia, snow, November's gift,
Soothes embattled senses, lures out illusion, 
Offers medication to replace reality adrift,
As the intimacy of cold negates confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Injected anesthesia wraps the unreal city,
Smothers in a welcome chloroform of cold
My uneasy expectations from a litany
Of autumn evils, awkwardly foretold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gazing at the falling snow, I am steeled
To weather now the world's insanity - congealed.

       I saw lights moving strangely in the sky when i was on vacation with a friend in FL as a kid. The light was moving one way then literally took off in the other direction over the gulf. Not a min later jets went screaming after it and ive been looking for answers ever since.

       Out of curiosity, were you able to see any sort of vehicle in the light?  Also, were you able to see the jets themselves or just evidence of them?

       At 11 years old a frkn alien came to my home, fought my cat, crawled to my bed and sat on my legs while staring at me and then made me sleep. Few days later I was approached by the legendary MIB who told me "we see you" "we know you" "we see everything you do".
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was 13 there was one incident when somebody remotely controlled my speech organ and also my left hand while I couldn't do anything but listening to what I'm just saying. (weird feeling having to listen to ones self voice in order to learn what one is saying at the moment) What I was saying was predicting near future events that started to unfold as soon as I stoped being remote controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around the same time I had a couple more of predicting "visions" (no idea how else to call it) which all became true. One time I was even abled to prove it to three of my friends beyond a doubt.
Those "visions" came without this remote controll effect. Just pictures, letters, sounds and feelings beamed right into my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       With 17 I started suffering from heavy scary as fuck sleep paralyses. No Idea if this was something naturall or caused by same ones who caused everything before. Might just be something normal Idk. I was able to get rid of sleep paralyses through autodidactic methods though.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Alien creature was real as fuck, no dream, no sleep paralyses, no phantasy, no drugs. My cat knew. lol
The MIB... I only realised what they were 20 years later. I think they were remote controlled like I was that one time, since they spoke monotone like robots and didn't move theire eyes or heads. They only looked exactly in the direction they were walking, even while talking to us (I was outside with a friend). And yeah no possible explanation that makes sense for that experience. There was more to this, I just don't want to go too much into detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being remote controlled offered the best obvious proof for me that somebody is fucking around with me big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Alien, 
being remote controlled 
and the MIB are the main reasons why I'm looking for answers for the last 20 years.
There was more stuff but nothing as significant as those three experinces. I just can't explain those away. I tried.

       And I'm going to delete all this after a day or so. Don't need people in future discussions calling me crazy because they saw this.

       I wouldn't even have posted that on my own, but since you asked for it. :)

       I stated I had two experiences.  My second experience is so outlandish that I wont discuss it even while anonymous.  Thanks for having the courage to post this knowing that people may belittle you for it.  Very interesting read.

       Will you just not discuss it openly here while anonymous, or not at all ever? 
(you could pm me if you like. You should have good reason to assume I can keep up with a lot. And I won't talk. ) ;)

       I will post a very brief description here for a while.  I might delete it.  It's something that I have discussed with family so it could be identifying.

       When I watched my mother die I also saw a very angry, very ugly and luminous being within her or overlayed onto her.  I can't describe it at all.

       That sounds terrifying and very brutal from the emotional side of view. 
Bad enough to lose a parent, but like this it must be really painful.

        It sounds like such bullshit. There is no way in those couple seconds I could have seen and interpreted so much, but it was like understanding about something I couldn't quite grasp was being fed to me in a super condensed form.

       The part about the light distortion is interesting to me as well, since I once had an experience where the lights around me started to act weird too. I was lying on my bed and observing dancing (white) light reflections on my blue colored ceiling when the light suddenly started to "spread" through the whole color spectrum. Like it's going through a prism. I didn't feel like there was a reason for this to happen though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't explain it, but I could see all colors of the light spectrum emerging from those simple sunlight reflections, but then it got realy interesting. I noticed how "another kind of light" entered the room from behind me.
It was a pure red light and for some reason, with every breath I took, it became more intense and claimed more of the room.
I then realised this light was working in a different way. It wasn't like there was a source that beamed the light through the room onto the wall like usual light would work, it kinda  sustained and moved itself along the surface of the walls and ceiling. Hard to explain, but it was more than a fluid flowing along the walls. Like it worked completely different than normal light from the physical point of view. It still illuminated, but it was like itself is the source of the light or as the wall is the source of the light.
      </p>
      <p>
       It became more intense with every breath that I took and it started crawling into the room through the door as well and soon the whole room was glowing in red light. This was so intense, that I started wondering if I'm just having a stroke or something and that made it immediately stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing was, when I told a friend, he finished the story for me and told me he dreamed that exact same thing the exact same day.
I wouldn't believe the shit I experienced if somebody else told me either.
No idea what that was. I wasn't on drugs or anything.

       Sometimes those phenomena seem to change the way our physics work.

       I have wondered a lot about what our brains might filter out.  Lots of things could be happening that don't directly affect our survival.  Maybe we can perceive a lot more than it is necessary for our brain to process but as a benefit of evolution striving to reduce the processing load on our brains we just don't experience it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some experiences can trigger a neurochemical situation where that filtration fails or maybe there are times when the trade off is beneficial to survival.

       I had a "Doppelgänger" effect experience with my mother (she was in two places at once), when I was 8. Then shows like "Sightings" and "Unsolved Mysteries" were aired and I've been intrigued with the paranormal ever since.

       After the Bush Administration, I started coming here. The blatant (albeit in hindsight for a youngster like me, I was 2 when Bush first took office.) selfish, and self-serving motives including the evidence that it was so led me down a rabbit hole, where I began to study history.

       My mom and I were up late after I got home from drinking all night just bullshiting and somehow we got on the subject of charismatic priests , the holy spirit and faith healers ..
      </p>
      <p>
       My mom is like one of those Catholics who goes to church everyday she also is a cooperator of Opus Dr I..but..that's a whole other story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So..I'm telling her how I think its all bullshit and its just a money making group hysteria ...
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple seconds later I was on the floor staring up at my mom who is asking me if I'm okay and has this perplexed look on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sat up and it felt as if I was in a whipit fog with the bee's buzzing in my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mom tells me I had for no reason stood straight up my eyes rolled back in my head and my mom tells me as if someone was behind me lowering me to the ground and was speaking some fucked up language for a couple of seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk how else to explain it other than some entity lowering me to the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also...my entire life I've had really fucked up dreams and sleep paralysis...most of the time it feels like evil is trying to kill me and have awoke at times with strange scratches on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its my belief good and evil exist in this world. I've always have had a healthy belief in God but never really believed in organized religion if that makes any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway...that's my story ...

       I watched it on TV live, having just woken up.  I alerted my family, told them they had to watch.  I feel like we watched the second plane strike live but maybe I have just seen it in footage that it clouds my memory.

       "JFK to 9/11: Everything is a Rich Man's Trick". Its 3+ hours, but it goes into the origins of fascism as an experiment by the dying European aristocracy and other capitalists. Truly essential.

       I also really liked this one.  If Loose Change grabs you, this is a great follow up for understand
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       things like this happen.  Definitely a deeper dive though.

       Sounds like we have taken a similar path.

      <p>
       I have totally agreed with your tastes so far, do you know of any others?

       No other "deep" docs I can think of rn. But you need to check out William Kay and his theories on "ecofascism".

       Has to do alot with the aristocracy/fascist alliance from Rich Man's Trick but talks about the environmentalist aspects of the world order.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick YouTube search on ecofascism would do the trick
