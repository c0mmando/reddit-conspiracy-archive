<p>You can nitpick the classic definition to try to find fault. Whatever.</p>

<p>By sidestepping the issue, are you in fact tacitly implying you approve of open borders ?</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s the real point here. Folks who for whatever reason want open borders and uncontrolled invasion accross our southern border want to guilt and vilify anyone who doesent    support this ridiculousness.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for controlled, qualified management of immigration, like...you know, most every other civilized country in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is completely false.</p>

<p>But there have been multiple situations where police use their &quot;discretion&quot; in an ill advised manner. And police will arrest you for whatever they please. Are you serious right now? Do you see what is happening in our country? </p>

<p>people are getting released everyday for crimes they didn&#39;t commit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you&#39;re arrested for a crime you didn&#39;t commit, we have a system to determine beyond reasonable doubt whether or not you actually committed that crime. Does that system fail people from time to time? Of course. No human system is perfect. There will be people unjustly imprisoned. However, the rate at which people are correctly imprisoned and the rate at which people are incorrectly imprisoned are well within acceptable boundaries. </p>

<p>Also, a cop is not going to arrest you for &quot;whatever they please&quot;. They will analyze your behavior, and a vast majority of them will give you the benefit of the doubt. Yes, even the ones with a boner for being an authority figure. Again, the rate at which cops correctly fulfill their position is much higher than the rate of cops who don&#39;t. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at here is: The rule of law is mandatory if you want a functioning society. You can&#39;t constantly make excuses for people that break the rule of law. </p>

<p>This is so very true.  Illegal immigrants are ruthlessly exploited, and too scared about deportation to call the police when they are attacked, or demand recompose when they are injured.  Anyone who claims to be concerned with their wellbeing should want these border crossings to be <em>stopped</em>.</p>

<p>So very true.  We should be attack this problem at its source.  Crossings would dramatically decline if companies could no longer exploit them for cheap labor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;children in cages&quot; - A little google work and it looks as though at the very least some of those images are bunk, and at least some are being taken way out of context. Further more &quot;cages&quot; sounds like small cramped one kid per cage...when in fact it looks very much more like room sized enclosures. Not ideal...but not caged like animals either.</p>

<p>...and as an aside, when you, a US citizen, commit a crime that causes you to be detained...what is your expectation...that they are gonna let your kids come along with you to jail? No...they call up social services and take your kid from you...why are you expecting anything different for these folks who have broken federal immigration laws?</p>

<p>Some of the kids taken away by BIA are my parents&#39; age.  And how much of Manhatten&#39;s current land equity is held by Native Americans?  Worth noting pipelines are always somehow able to go thru tribal lands, regardless of treaty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel great compassion for illegal immigrants.  They suffer greatly crossing the border, and they are exploited by businesses and criminals when they live in the US.</p>

<p>Did you know, for example, that 80% of unaccompanied girls <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/12/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972.html">get raped</a> by the cartel coyotes when they cross the border?  They&#39;re take contraceptives before they make their trip, so that they won&#39;t get pregnant(!)  And those are just the numbers taken from survivors.  Who knows how many people are raped and murdered by the cartels as they try to make their way into the US.</p>

<p>If you have compassion for illegal immigrants, then you should demand that the government take action to secure the border, punish the businesses that exploit them for cheap labor, and make sure that these damnable crossing stop.  </p>

<p>A lot of people think that illegal immigration is a victimless crime, but the truth of the matter is that illegal immigrants are so horribly abused and exploited, and this exploitation will continue so long as they are here illegally.  You cannot be in favor of both illegal immigrants, individually, and illegal immigration, generally, because the latter means exploiting the former.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So good idea to round them up right ? So you can give them their ticket and if they can&#39;t pay they must work it off in jail . $400 per person seems fair, they have families of about 5-6 so give or take 3 months of hard labor, building the wall as punishment then we can send them back .

<p>They were then split from their families. </p>

<p>What legal means should they use after drug cartels burn their village to the ground? Should they go online and start petitioning the government for citizenship? A process that can take over a decade and has zero guarantees that it will work? </p>

<p>No. They risk their lives to come here and we break their families up. If given the chance, they should absolutely, 100%, risk an illegal crossing now. If the government is definitely going to split their family up, and illegal crossing gives a family the chance to stay together, they should take that chance. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what this idiot policy accomplishes. It scares legal crossings into becoming illegal crossings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m scotch Irish Prussian, and as near as all of our research reveals, none of my direct ancestors came here illegally, or they came here before there even was an immigration law.</p>

<p>As near as I can also tell any of my ancestors who broke the law and were caught... Paid the price.</p>

<p>The law is the damn law, why can&#39;t people get a grip on that. If you don&#39;t like it, vote and legislate accordingly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s like asking people who grew up in the projects and leave why they&#39;re so hardworking, when the place they were raised in is so bad. It&#39;s their environment, there&#39;s not just goons hanging around our country, it&#39;s in their country also. And a lot of people end up either killed because they have limited protection, or have to comply with whatever they want. Shit, sometimes Americans even work for these shady characters without even knowing it. I don&#39;t know what the solution is, just giving you my thoughts I guess. </p>
