       Hello guys :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching a video yesterday with a linguistical analysys of different interviews of those guys that tends to show that they distanciate themselves from the event and are pretty stressed about being authorized or not to divulg certain informations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's obviously that press conference we all know where they looks more embarrassed than proud about their achievement and people take this as a mark of fakery and sure it is... but if I wanted to lie to people to make them actively think I did it, I think I would brag more about it. It raises the possibility that those guys were lying "against their own will".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's been discussed a lot already but there's that phrase from Aldrin in another interview that really made me see things in a different perspective. He gets upset at the interviewer and goes something along the line of : "Why don't you ask NASA officials ? We were just a team of pilots going out for a flight !"
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they were really "just a team of pilots going for a flight" ? What if they went just for a "classic" orbital or sub-orbital flight without knowing what was going on on TV etc. And then when they came back to earth they're not given choice in the matter because revealing the truth could just have blowed the country... maybe they were told/were thinking it was just a matter of time and thus was an acceptable lie for the good of the nation.

       Remember when you realized Santa wasn’t real, and you asked your parents?
      </p>
      <p>
       The look on Aldrin’s face is akin to learning Santa wasn’t real and that your parents lied to you about who actually brought the presents under the tree.

       They were knackered, the amount of tests and de-briefs upon landing. Not to mention the dump of energy they have after they are back on earth, after such an event as walking on the moon.

       I have hypothesized that they met a g-force that caused unconsciousness. The television presented "test footage" as the real deal. They were too embarrassed and confused to access the situation at the time. Once hailed as heroes and reassured peace via American supremacy, they did not speak out.

       They were told what happened and what their country needed of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They understood they were to be seen as American hero's for doing nothing other than re-enacting the real scenes of men who are still stuck on the moon (dead obviously).
      </p>
      <p>
       They love their country, it's why they have taken on the ultimate sacrifice; a life devoted to a lie in order to protect the world.

       Don't hate these guys, admire them for having the strength and fortitude that many other people wouldn't have had.

       Yeah, I see every theory has being correct and incorrect at the same time. The divide and conquer strategy means we rarely focus on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case; did man get to the moon? Some adamantly say yes, others say no. I say, both are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were rumours flying around the early days of the internet that the Russians actually landed on the moon 2 or 3 times before the Americans, but could never bring them home.
      </p>
      <p>
       America, through sheer luck and nothing else, managed to get a team of men on the moon, just like the Ruskies though, they couldn't bring them home. They died of suffocation on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another team of men were drafted in, possibly ready for another moon mission, but instead were told the truth. They heard and saw the footage of these men on the moon and re-enacted it in a studio (Area 51, hanger 18).
      </p>
      <p>
       If America didn't do what it did, it would be hard to argue the positives of capitalism over communism. We can imagine how the cold war would have gone if the Russians and communists were seen as superior over America and the capitalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why Neil is a fucking vegetable these days; he's lived a lie for so long, yet cannot say anything without endangering the west. Buzz on the other hand relishes in it, somewhat. He has grown jaded of all the moon talk, he still enjoys the celebrity status though.

       Well I remember seeing three men blasting off and I watched the live moon landing. Then I saw the same three men come back to Earth. Your scenario would require vastly more planning and co-ordination than doing the real thing. And in Britain we had Raymond Burke, one of the straightest and most respected TV science presenters ever, narrating it live. There is no way this side of Hades he would collaborate with NASA on a hoax.

       What I am gonna say will prove absolutely nothing, let's agree on that first.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you didn't saw them going in and coming back in a single movie sequence. Even then, once they're in the rocket they can escape easily like a good old illusionist trick. Or once they're in space they can broadcast us test footage and let them just orbit instead of going to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, let's be clear, by this I'm not saying that's what happened at all, I just have no clue. But what you saw proves nothing because there's too many ways to provide you with what you saw while doing something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously,
       <strong>
        if

       (I insist) there is a deception a minimum of people has to be involved, and the british TV presenter you put trust in would have been deceived like all of us. :)

       You are only saying that because you grew up in an age when computer trickery is normal. Nothing like that could have been mocked up enough in 1969 to convince Burke, or anybody.

       I mean, you see them entering a rocket and then ? You can't be 100&amp;#37; sure they're still in the rocket when it goes off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I don't say it's what happened uh, I have no clue. But as to speak of 1969, there was not a camera at every angle of everything, filming everything 7/7H24.

       Maybe you have to understand my position first : I'm a zetetician, which means the most frequent answers I come up with are : "this is (not) possible", "we can't be sure" and "this is not xxx"... but very rarely "this is xxx". :)

       I would recommend the movie
       <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077294/">
        Capricorn One
       </a>
       for some laughs. It came out in 1976 just years after the last Apollo flight and guess what the movie's about? NASA faking a Mars landing. In the first scene right as the rocket is about to launch the 3 astronauts are told by an operative to get out of the capsule and follow him. The movie even had the cooperation of nasa for some of the props.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the close link between government and hollywood, so it is strange this movie came out so soon after the missions. Was it to kick off moon-landing conspiracies? Was it to blatantly suggest that all the Apollo missions were faked? There are plenty of nods to Apollo in the movie, props, photos of Buzz on the moon, etc. Or did they just think it was a good/funny idea for a movie, and no ulterior motive was involved?

       Now you know where the "Moon Landing Hoax Theory" comes from... a Hollywood Movie starring Hal Holbrook, James Brolin, Sam Watterson and OJ Simpson!  It really wasn't a "conspiracy theory" until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       this movie came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But say, if you think about it for a minute... NASA is really behind the death of Nicole Brown Simpson.  No wait, hear me out.  You see, OJ knew that he was in this movie about a faked Mars landing, but he also knew that it was an analogy for a real "fake Moon landing".  In order to keep OJ quiet, NASA hired hit men to kill her, then plant the bloody glove behind OJ's house.  Oh, and Kato Kalin was a NASA employee the whole time, there to keep a close eye on OJ for the frame up.  NASA then deliberately sent microwaves to Al Cowling's head during the Low Speed Chase, telling him to keep it under 40 miles per hour, so their secret helicopter cameras could get a good shot of OJ holding a gun to his head in the back seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all seriousness, the Earth is a sphere, we went to the moon (you can see the actual tracks and equipment left behind if you simply google "Images of Apollo Landing Sites from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter"), and there is no "conspiracy" here in any of this.  But hey, who am I to challenge anyone's cognitive biases, or cognitive capabilities for that matter.

       Yes, you did just read that, just like I read you using a 40 year old movie as proof to your claims.  Just stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refuting a claim is not "trying to debunk 50 year old conspiracies".  In fact, the only "conspiracy here" is that you claim the moon landings were a hoax.  I don't know why people cannot see them as what they were, a daring feat of mankind's technological knowledge and daring to "do the impossible".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a witness to the events of history. Right now you're coming off as a teenager, who's only exposure to the Apollo program are conspiracy videos on YouTube.  But again, who am I to question your take on rational reality.
