        Peter Scully

       is an Australian convicted child sex abuser. He was on trial for numerous other crimes against children, including the production and dissemination of sadistic child pornography, torture and murder. In June 2018, he was found guilty of one count of human trafficking and five counts of rape and sentenced to life in prison.

       I had no idea he had been arrested either. He makes me really think twice on my stance on the death penalty. I have a big interest in dark things like serial killers and the occult, cults and NWO conspiracies etc, and he is almost certainly the worst human in existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have any info about accomplices? They know he had them but last I checked (over a year ago) there was no leads or anything.

       I read there were three or four men and one or two women also charged.

       If you ask me, there should be hell of a research to find everyone else who was connected and also everyone who paid to see those movies and then all of them should be openly executed, slowly. It'd be the only right thing to do.

       If we could use it in only cases such as his then I would be all for it is what I meant. On the other hand it also seems like a cop out for him to receive the death penalty. It's a truly awful situation. Apparently he has another 50 charges pending on top of his already life sentences.

       Trust me the jail will take care of him :) i'd rather see him suffering every single day of his rest of pathetic live, also I would gladly pay to keep him alive, put him on a watch to avoid him to kill himself and heal him back to another beating and torture from different inmates

       You have to have someone on the outside to make the payments to make your life easier.  Also they have really cracked down and have been doing more raids for contraband, the new president and head of the national police try very hard to burnish their "tough on crime image". I'm hoping this guy is fucked.  Philippine prison can be really shitty, and everybody knows what this guy did.  If someone outside has access to his money, it's more likely they will take it and hide than risk helping him.  If you want things to be better you need to make regular payments, so he's likely screwed.

       No lights. Just pointing out a probability. Nothing more.  Someone was talking about all the corruption in the Philippines and so it seems logical that it would be easy to pay a LEO there to kill the guy if its that corrupt. I have no personal knowledge about how corrupt it is or is not there or if it would actually work.

       I wouldn't advocate a slow execution. There are some people who shouldn't be alive, he's one of them. No need to make it slow though, .50 BMG to the back of the head would suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I'm generally against the death penalty is because of how poor government's track records are when it comes to conviction. I wish there were a way to solidly codify the standard of evidence necessary for a death penalty (undeniable video of the actual crime, overwhelming physical evidence, etc). I don't know if that will ever happen though.

       I don't think it's pleasure in seeing him get executed slowly. It's the pleasure that he will suffer like he made those little children suffer. Think about it this way - when a dog is sick sometimes it's recommended that it is put down and doesn't suffer. The more humane way instead of seeing it with pain.Why would we give Peter Scully that luxury of dying fast in a humane way when he did all those horrible things which to be quite honest I want to vomit right now - its sick.

       One can only hope he gets "destroyed" by his fellow inmates on the regular. This is one of the sickest fucks ive ever heard of. This guy needs to be put in general population, thats worse than any death.

       There really should be a new law put into motion where the punishment for these sub human filth are subjected to the same abuse and crimes they committed on others, and if they survive they are put in solitary for life. Just seems logical to me, no?

       Why? It sounds more like a good deed is being done making them understand exactly the pain that they chose to inflict on fucking children. You know it may make some of these other child rapists think twice before they do something again, or at least not go to some of the deranged levels of the current pedophiles. 
Have the CIA/FBI do it, make them actually do something GOOD once in a while. I hear those guys are some great "information specialists"

       GOOD DIE you useless eater...you oxygen bandit abuser you are worse than a useless eater you are a parasite on the very lifeforce of children and there should be a final solution to people like you. Bye Scully enjoy having to bribe people to get better meat and anything extra like you have. Enjoy sitting and KNOWING you hurt children in a mint green (ill bet) cage all day EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR SHAMEFUL EXISTENCE. Do the right thing for once and well you know..children could be eating on the food you will waste putting into that black hole you call a body.

       Question: What is the difference between Peter Scully and the rest of the ruling class/elites?

      <p>
       Answer:  He filmed what he did and disseminated it.

       The
       <em>
        providential
       </em>
       loss of evidence is just a common occurrence on these cases that start showing leads to buyers and higher ups involved. Instead of long years suffering abuse from fellow inmates, I'd rather prefer that animal to be kept as protected witness to bring down his entire network of providers, customers and enablers/protectors in high places.

       He's a monster. There's an interview with him and he is the most smug, heartless man I've ever seen. You can find the interview on YouTube, not that you expect a guy like that to show remorse, but watching him laugh and joke about what he did will make you furious.
