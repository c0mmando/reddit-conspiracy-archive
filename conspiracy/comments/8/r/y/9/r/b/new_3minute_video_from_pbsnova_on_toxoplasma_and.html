    <div class="md"><p>This subject fascinates me, but that Medium article is kinda trash.  It starts with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The below are facts. Any information below is either well established biology, or is from peer-reviewed scientific reports and articles. Anecdotal evidence is abundant too, but limited in this article. Please use the links for further documentation. Links will be updated and added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, that&#39;s reasonable.  As you read on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you reject or condemn it without further investigation or experience medium to strong resentment to the idea of a brain-parasite, if your consciousness seeks to induces abrupt change in subject when Tg is discussed, or if you find it very difficult/fear-provoking to contemplate …..then you probably have Tg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fair comment. That part is more anecdotal, as announced. However - having multi year experience with this after having presented the issue to a number of individuals, you would be surprised to see how accurate it is. Give it a try yourself. This resonates with something deep down everyone&#39;s consciousness that, more often than not, prevents follow-up of any kind. No questions, no response or action. Most say &quot;wow&quot;, and leave it there. Something seem to be stronger than their curiosity...
Given the spectacular information given from science, those who learns about the facts of Tg should start looking into how to solve the problem..but only fewer than few does that....isn&#39;t that odd? 
What is your next step?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that it&#39;s fear provoking.  It doesn&#39;t make sense that a bacteria would have a function to prevent its host from thinking or doing anything about it.  For many such bacteria, there is no cure, no treatment, so how would it evolve to cause a fear response when thinking about whether you even are infected.  I have had cats my entire life.  We&#39;ve had outdoor cats.  There&#39;s a slim chance I&#39;m not a carrier, but I have no qualms discussing it.  It&#39;s not even verified that it can affect humans in the same way or to the same degree as cats or rats, and if so, what are the behavioral changes, and how could they be measured.  You&#39;d have to know when you were infected, and before that happened, you&#39;d need an inventory of behaviors to determine any changes.</p>

<p>Saying that any aversion to discussion is a sign you&#39;re infected is a non-starter for serious discussion, and without protocols is completely non-scientific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool - in that case forget about the aversion to discuss, and let&#39;s discuss it. Here is my position on the issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is ample evidence that Tg is dangerous. In most of Europe its ranked as the most important food-borne parasite. Many scientists call it &quot;a global threat&quot;, WHO says that we have underestimated its disease burden. CDC has put it on a top five and advocated for mpre public information.....three years ago.</li>
<li>A lot can be done to avoid, cure or vaccine/create immunity, and this has been known for many years</li>
<li>Only 0.1 % of the population knows this and has even heard about the parasite...Why is that?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reviewing the list of possible treatments, and just in my own life, I use several of these &quot;treatments&quot; regularly, as does my fiance.  We&#39;ve also had rounds of hefty antibiotics in the last 48 months.  I wonder with all these possible treatments, what are the chances that someone is infected earlier in life and still has an active parasitic infection upon death.  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t like to think about how dirty it is to have open toilets in their homes (litter boxes).  Women who have thought about children are more likely to be aware, especially if they&#39;ve been reading up on pregnancy risks.  In the U.S. there&#39;s plenty of literature warning about it.  I don&#39;t know about the rest of the world.  I actually learned about it in reproductive health class in HS in the 90s.</p>

<p>Could be that we&#39;re so inundated with unimportant BS all day long that upsets us and our friends that we neglect information that would protect us from actual harm.  Who cares about parasites in your cat&#39;s poo when DPRK is threatening to rain down nukes on the US?  Trump is president, nothing else is as frightening as that. Even though the majority are unaffected by his presidency, they can&#39;t think of anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you regularly take turmeric or anything on the list I believe you are diminishing the effects, perhaps even killing it. You can only get infected once, after this you are immunized. 
The greater problem is that we do not see the problem - as mentioned, there is a huge gap between facts and action. 
If you see the diseases Tg is being related to - cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia, epilepsy etc. it is some of the most expensive - thus generating billions....could that be a reason? Are we that cynical? </p>

<p>If you reject or condemn it without further investigation or experience medium to strong resentment to the idea of a brain-parasite, if your consciousness seeks to induces abrupt change in subject when Tg is discussed, or if you find it very difficult/fear-provoking to contemplate …..then you probably have Tg.</p>

<p>What a fucking joke. </p>

<p>So if I think I don&#39;t have it without further investigation, or don&#39;t like to think about it - I probably have it.</p>

<p>Great reporting.</p>

<p>Fuck outta here with this bullshit.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to investigate anything - its a free world, but if it catches your interest, why not find out what to do, if not for you then your family?</p>
