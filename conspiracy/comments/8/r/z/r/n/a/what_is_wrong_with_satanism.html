       Remember the Gospels and Acts were composed AFTER Paul's letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gerd Lüdemann says:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Not once does Paul refer to Jesus as a teacher, to his words as teaching, or to [any] Christians as disciples."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Moreover, when Paul himself summarizes the content of his missionary preaching in Corinth (1 Cor. 2.1-2; 15.3-5), there is no hint that a narration of Jesus’ earthly life or a report of his earthly teachings was an essential part of it. . . . In the letter to the Romans, which cannot presuppose the apostle’s missionary preaching and in which he attempts to summarize its main points, we find not a single direct citation of Jesus’ teaching."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Richard Carrier, Paul's letters indicate that Cephas etc. only knew Jesus from DREAMS, based on the Old Testament scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Cor. 15.:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins
       <strong>
        according to the Scriptures
       </strong>
       ,  and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day
       <strong>
        according to the Scriptures
       </strong>
       , and that He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; then He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to James, then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to one untimely born, He
       <strong>
        appeared
       </strong>
       to me also."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Scriptures Paul is referring to here are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Septuagint version of Zechariah 3 and 6
       <strong>
        gives the exact Greek name of Jesus
       </strong>
       , describing him as confronting Satan, being crowned king in heaven, called "the man named 'Rising'" who is said to rise from his place below, building up God’s house, given supreme authority over God’s domain and ending all sins in a single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Daniel 9 describes a messiah dying before the end of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 53 describes the cleansing of the world's sins by the death of a servant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 22-24 describes the death-resurrection cycle.  The concept of crucifixion is from Psalm 22.16 and various other passages in the Old Testament.

       Jesus is the same fictional Jesus from the LXX version of Zechariah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul only ever indicates two sources of Jesus info, Scripture (the LXX) and dream teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul never indicates Cephas or anyone else was a disciple of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philo independently confirms Jesus is the same Jesus from the LXX version of Zechariah:

       That depends on the practitioner and their own understanding of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be nothing more than a form of spirituality for some, others take it a little further... Not that much different to any religion. You have followers and you have the crazies.

       Im not sure what that has to do with Satanism being right/wrong?

       Personally i think that
       <em>
        anybody
       </em>
       who gets duped by religion is a little bit foolish, whether that be christianity, satanism or any other system of controlled spirituality.

       Athiesm is a rejection of the theistic systems, of which satanism is one.
      </p>
      <p>
       For satanism to exist it needs 'god' to oppose. Otherwise you're talking about luciferian type paganism, which is very much removed for what most people think of 'satanism'.

       You really need to research Satanism.  The vast majority of Satanists are simply atheists.

       I've researched it for many years my friend. I'm aware of the difference between theistic santanism and atheistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we (and by we i mean this sub in general) talk about the subject, we are talking theistic satanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atheistic satanism rarely gets discussed because by definition, it is only 'way of thinking'. It doesnt present a clear danger, so discussion of it in the conspiracy sense is pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atheistic satanism has its roots in paganism/luciferianism or whatever you want to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, calling it satanism is wrong, as the first mention of satan comes from the Abrahamic religions. You cannot work atheism from a theistic idea.

       It is the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people believe that Gothic Satanism exists, which it doesn't. People do things and it gets false attribution, or a minority belief is allowed to be applied to the overall Way. Certainly this is allowed because Satanism is a great threat to any religion, not just the ones run by recognized churches.

       Composed AFTER the letters of Paul, Mark and Matthew were INTENDED as symbolic fiction, being written in a symbolic chiastic structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only with Luke-Acts did Christians start to view the four Gospels literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sayings of Jesus in the Gospels are things Paul originally said. See Nikolaus Walter's ‘Paul and the Early Christian Jesus-Tradition’.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events in Mark and Matthew are based on the LXX, directly borrowing its language:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Donkey(s)
       </strong>
       - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).
      </p>
      <p>
       Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Sermon on the Mount
       </strong>
       - The Sermon of the Mount relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isaiah 50.6-9.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The clearing of the temple
       </strong>
       - The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed 'Canaanites' to 'traders'.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Crucifixion
       </strong>
       - The whole concept of a crucifixion of God’s chosen one arranged and witnessed by Jews comes from Psalm 22.16, where ‘the synagogue of the wicked has surrounded me and pierced my hands and feet’. The casting of lots is Psalm 22.18.  The people who blasphemed Jesus while shaking their heads is Psalm 22.7-8.  The line ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ is Psalm 22.1.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Resurrection
       </strong>
       - Jesus was known as the ‘firstfruits’ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Barabbas
       </strong>
       - This is the Yom Kippur ceremony of Leviticus 16 and Mishnah tractate Yoma: two ‘identical’ goats were chosen each year, and one was released into the wild containing the sins of Israel (which was eventually killed by being pushed over a cliff), while the other’s blood was shed to atone for those sins. Barabbas means ‘Son of the Father’ in Aramaic, and we know Jesus was deliberately styled the ‘Son of the Father’ himself. So we have two sons of the father; one is released into the wild mob containing the sins of Israel (murder and rebellion), while the other is sacrificed so his blood may atone for the sins of Israel—the one who is released bears those sins literally; the other, figuratively. Adding weight to this conclusion is manuscript evidence that the story originally had the name ‘Jesus Barabbas’. Thus we really had two men called ‘Jesus Son of the Father’.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Last Supper
       </strong>
       - This is derived from a LXX-based passage in Paul's letters. Paul said he received the Last Supper info directly from Jesus himself, which indicates a dream. 1 Cor. 11:23 says "
       <strong>
        For I received from the Lord
       </strong>
       that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread." Translations often use "betrayed", but in fact the word
       <em>
        paradidomi
       </em>
       means simply ‘hand over, deliver’. The notion derives from Isaiah 53.12, which in the Septuagint uses exactly the same word of the servant offered up to atone for everyone’s sins. Paul is adapting the Passover meal. Exodus 12.7-14 is much of the basis of Paul’s Eucharist account: the element of it all occurring ‘in the night’ (vv. 8, 12, using the same phrase in the Septuagint, en te nukti, that Paul employs), a ritual of ‘remembrance’ securing the performer’s salvation (vv. 13-14), the role of blood and flesh (including the staining of a cross with blood, an ancient door lintel forming a double cross), the breaking of bread, and the death of the firstborn—only Jesus reverses this last element: instead of the ritual saving its performers from the death of their firstborn, the death of God’s firstborn saves its performers from their own death. Jesus is thus imagined here as creating a new Passover ritual to replace the old one, which accomplishes for Christians what the Passover ritual accomplished for the Jews. There are connections with Psalm 119, where God’s ‘servant’ will remember God and his laws ‘in the night’ (119.49-56) as the wicked abuse him. The Gospels take Paul's wording and insert disciples of Jesus.

       Satan's name, occasionally, is Yahweh.  He's the most consistently evil character in his own book, and people have been tricked into worshipping him by following the fabricated new testament Jesus/Titus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan is just a title, but is shown as one of the Elohim.  So the bogeyman that abrahamites like to pin their fears and evil on is actually one of their own worshipped deities.  (Elohim is plural, y'know...)

       Gnosticism is a ridiculously broad category.  Some believe in literal Jesus, some, as a figurative archetype, others don't at all.  Some are grounded in codified morality, others are nihilistic, hedonostic, on and on.
      </p>

       The most common themes that I've noticed are that this world is a corrupted/bad place, and that there are bad deities running it, who have rebelled against the "higher" deities.  But even within that framework, there are tons of variations.

       They could be on here because they want to talk about real conspiracies, same as me. It's "fun" I guess, for some people, to just speculate on what could possibly be, but some of us are to to talk about real things.

       Firstly - it is real.  Look at Hunter S.  Thompson. Secondly - a conspiracy sub is full of theories some real and some not but that’s why they’re called theories.

       Why would someone open a discussion about satanism if they don’t believe in rituals? Just seems weird.

       I'm a huge Hunter S. Thom,pson guy. I've read literally every goddamn word the man wrote, even the schlocky stuff he pumped out in his last decade to get paid. And .... I have no idea what you're referring to when you mention him.

       I open it because that sort of thing is, to me, the worst of this place. And "magic" based conspiracy talk is the worst. It's not verifiable or unverifiable even under the perfect circumstances. It's all just ephemeral, wispy words that have no bearing on real life.

       Hunter S Thompson made snuff films and drank adrenochrome.  You’ve seriously never read that?  Never read adrenochome in fear and loathing? Okay!!!

       Nah. As for Hunter Thompson .... you know his books are fiction, right? Inspired by his exploits, but, lol, no he did not do everything he describes in his books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt any major politicians are satanists, and here's the thing: so what if they were? It makes no difference which made up nonsense they believe in. It's all a big fake out to sell to the dummies that believe in magic sky gods. There is no satan to worship, so if that's his angle it wouldn't bother me any more than someone worshiping a more main stream religion. It would only depend on the practices the religion promotes.

       I’m not talking about fiction.   He wrote about drinking adrenochrome and he made snuff films.  Those are facts.  For a big fan you don’t seem to know much about him or maybe you are giving him excuses because you’re a fan.   Either way, sorry but he was one sick man.
      </p>
      <p>
       You doubt politicians are satanists?  Fair enough that’s just your opinion.  But it’s highly wrong and the tone of your comments aren’t really inkeeping with a conspiracy sub....
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU believe God isn’t real.   That doesn’t mean he’s not.  YOU believe Satan isn’t real.   Same thing.   Even if we don’t believe in Lucifer, people out there do.   They do disgusting things in his name.  THEY believe it.   Trust me it is so very real and it happens.   I hardly think hundreds of kids coming forward with satanic ritual abuse accounts are liars.  You need to have an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who believe in god or a god aren’t dummies either.  That’s....ignorant and again very close minded especially for a conspiracy sub lmao

       Everything he wrote was fiction. Even his sports reporting was hilariously unreliable. He
       <em>
        wrote
       </em>
       about making snuff films, but if you could show me one I'd be pretty damn surprised.

       As for my tone not being within the supposed theme here, I'd argue that people that are generally skeptics are more equipped to talk about conspiracies in a meaningful way than people that are inclined to believe what they're told.

       Wasn't a myth back then, it's not even a mystery today. Fuck, most of the ones who get off on that shit aren't even satanists. They are normal, edge-pushing, millionaires &amp; billionaires. The ones who aren't rich are forced to do it for blackmail purposes, to keep them in line.

       All of this kind of confusion comes from not rightly dividing scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul was chosen by Jesus Christ to be the Apostle to the Gentiles (everyone at this point in time)
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 11:13  For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
      </p>
      <p>
       He was given the "gospel of the uncircumcision" to spread to us.  This is different than the "gospel of the circumciion" which Peter and the rest of the Apostiles were to spread.  This was the gospel for the Jews at their time and Jews in the future time of Jacob's trouble (still in our future)
      </p>
      <p>
       Gal 2:7  But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;
      </p>
      <p>
       Gal 2:8  (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumsion.  This means his ministry was to Jews and not to gentiles.  He was preaching on the Kingdom of Heaven which he was offering to the Jews (which they rejected) and won't be back in play until that future time of Jacob's trouble.  People who follow Jesus's teachings today and ignore Paul's Gospel are lost and heading for the lake of fire because they don't understand this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 15:8  Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:
      </p>
      <p>
       We are currently in the dispensation of grace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eph_3:2  If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
      </p>
      <p>
       Col_1:25  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co_9:17  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Paul's Gospel and believing this in your heart is the only way one that one can be saved in this dispensation of God's merciful grace:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       Satanism is more analogous to atheism or agnosticism.
      </p>

       You might be thinking about luciferianism

       You are using a set of values created by Christianity, that vilifies Satan, to determine if Satanism is bad or good?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the inherent problem with this?

       When the Corinthians passage says that some of the people Jesus appeared to after his resurrection are now asleep, it means they have passed away. Greek meets the King’s English. Satanism is a bad idea.

       There are no satanists, only bored atheists. The only Satanists are the ones disguising as the noblest of the noble, holier than thou representatives of man.
      </p>
      <p>
       This includes religious leaders that impose themselves as other religions like Judaism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity, World political leaders, celebrities and cooperation leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil has to disguise themselves. Anyone who blatantly says that he is a Satanist is not one, but instead is likely a bored atheist. True Satanists or to be more often, true evil people show themselves in a holier than thou appearance while doing all sorts of stuff that makes the "satanists" look like a walk in the park in the background. (Waging Wars all over the world, starting revolutions that improverish countries, corrupting children etc.)
