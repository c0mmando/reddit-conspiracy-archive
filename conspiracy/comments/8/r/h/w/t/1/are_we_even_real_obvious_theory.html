        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a &quot;short&quot; theory I found on You Tube that basically says that we might be a simulation, a game from the future.</p>

<p>Let me explain:
 In the year 2004 for example, GTA San Andreas came out and it looked like shit. Then in 2013 GTA V came out (I know I missed GTA IV but it doesnt matter), which is still one of the most played games on steam right now. In 9 years a game that looked like shit in 2004 looks like real life in 2018, VR is a thing and robots exist and they are everywhere (Siri, Alexa, Cortana, etc), even human-like robots are a thing.</p>

<p>My point is that technology is developing insanely fast that in 1000 years, a gadget that you can just put on your head and press start to teleport you in a simulation of the year 2018 doesn&#39;t seem so out of place. Maybe we are all just fakes, characters created by the people of 3013 or something, those people might be playing a simulation from 2018 to see how the past looked like. Maybe we are living in the future, and when we die it&#39;s game over and that guy in the future says &quot;fuck&quot; and creates another character.</p>

<p>Imagine if one day the sky would disappear as a computer glitch, how would people react?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously they do  ot possess any conciousness, but it&#39;s only 2018 now, I just said that a simulation where you could go back to the past wouldn&#39;t be out of place in like 1k years. Besides, I refferenced this &quot;simulation&quot; as a game, like VRChat, so we would have conciousness if real people play us, our &quot;inner voice&quot; might be just the person playing telling us what to do. Time may be even slower here so the people in &quot;real life&quot; don&#39;t die.
I know it sounds absurd, but when you think about how fast technology is developing it could be very possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do not even know what consciousness is. It’s a complete mystery. We do know that all computers have no self awareness whatsoever and can only process information as programmed. Consciousness cannot be programmed materially. What coding would magically cause a programming to become aware? I do believe, however, we could create a humanoid robot so intelligent and complex that it could have the appearance of consciousness due to its sophisticated programming, but it would still, in reality, be no more conscious than a wall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NOW it&#39;s not possible, I&#39;m just saying that MAYBE, in the FUTURE people found a way of controlling things. And besides, we wouldn&#39;t even need &quot;conciousness&quot;, it could all be programmed for us already, we might already have a path, a limited one. Humans are limited so it would make some kind of sence. There really is no need for conciousness anyway if you can just lead that character to a &quot;quest&quot;. And in the theory we are people, but we are the characters of a game. In VRChat you don&#39;t suddenly forget who you are when you put the headset on or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there’s no evidence or signs of consciousness in those characters. They behave and act precisely as they’re designed to. They make no decisions or show no intentionality of their own. We do show these signs. Besides this, there is no need to create a computer simulation with individual consciousnesses, because you can program the characters to do exactly what you want then to do without imparting self awareness to them. Consciousness is unnecessary when it comes to programming, unless you want your sims to make their own decisions and show intentionality (behave outside of mere programming), which is exactly what computer simulations show no signs of whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my view the only way one can know about consciousness is by simply being aware of it and making decisions from it. We are conscious of our own consciousness, so we directly experience it on an individual to individual basis. We will never know what it is in my opinion, other than it is our very self or soul. I don’t even think it’s material thing and can be detected empirically. It’s not like we can see it through a microscope; it’s experiential. Consciousness is just self. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, heard of it. This is what I’ve pointed out in many philosophical discussions before. Even if the objective world is an illusion and I’m just a brain in a vat then I still exist as a brain in a vat with real consciousness. “I think, therefore I am” is an absolute truth. Also even a brain in a vat has to exist in time and space, so, even in that instance, I would still exist in a real objective world that I do not experience; my whole experience would be a subjective dream that I am conscious off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that is not what you experience. You experience your will being able to control your body at will. You experience yourself making real decisions. You have to deny your whole experience and argue everything is an illusion to deny free will of some kind. Belief in free will is a properly basic belief based on our everyday experience. Plus, if determinism is real it’s rather magical and unbelievable that an unintentional universe has accidentally created us to have an experience of intentionality (free will). A universe with no free will which creates and determines beings into existence who believe in and experience free will as a reality is such a giant leap of faith, that it takes more faith to believe in than theism and supernatural realities. Naturalistic/materialism is more faith based than belief in the supernatural. </p>

<p>the mind thinks. you are not your mind. you are the observer.
the physical brain is divided in two. the mind is divided in two. your being, the observing consciousness, is in the middle. ever have an internal dialogue? ever made a decision? you can only make a decision between 2 view points. if there was only one mind then you couldn&#39;t choose an option, or make decisions, because there wouldn&#39;t be any option to choose. decisions would happen automatically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the brain and the mind are different from one another. Why is the mind being conscious of itself a paradox? That would just mean it’s self aware. Plus, a paradox is not the same as a contradiction. Even if you argue the observer observes the mind, then what observes the observer? That’s just as paradoxical. I observe I have an observer. Isn’t it easier to say all of this is just components of an immaterial mind that is multi faceted?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing unreal, though everything is temporary and changing---evolving and fulfilling itself. Best not to confuse temporary idea construction with being fake or unreal. A house is made of thousands of individual parts, yet has a life as a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Within this wholeness of the house are usefulness, protection, privacy, and the concept of home. In that way, it&#39;s a symbol.</p>

<p>Same with our bodies. It exists temporarily, but is made of trillions of individual parts that are alive and cooperating, living and dying, and without us being conscious of it. The body I had when I was 7 has been replaced time and time again. It is gone, it has died. All the cells have died and been replaced with new ones. </p>

<p>The reality I experience is my own construction. You can never experience it, just as I can&#39;t experience yours. Though there is a universe of realized idea from which we both include in our constructions. If you come to this room I&#39;m in, you will instantly construct the underlying realized idea and form a room that we both can agree upon. But there will be two personal rooms being constructed. In that way the room as a permanent single reality isn&#39;t there. The realized idea is real, but each of us constructed our own versions.</p>

<p>In higher states of consciousness one can experience the room as being completely real, but also as not really there. It&#39;s paradoxical when trying to explain the reality of this, yet the experience of it is that it&#39;s both there and not there at the same time. It&#39;s both eternal and temporary at the same time. It&#39;s both interconnected to all that is, but individual at the same time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all quite wondrous and beautiful.</p>
