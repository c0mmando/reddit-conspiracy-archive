    <div class="md"><p>Sort of a rough day to ask that community. Short answer is there are none. Q has left 1400 comments and mentioned hundreds of topics. So at this point if basically anything interesting happens, people can point to something he mentioned 3 months ago and say &quot;dear god, Q predicted this.&quot; </p>

<p>Sometimes he gets something vaguely in the ball park and it blows his fans minds. He said the Pope would have a bad may and then those priests in Chile got in trouble. So I guess that was kinda lame for the Pope to deal with. But it wasnt that big a story and the Pope is still just chillin. But things like this are enough to prove Q is real to people who already believe. </p>

<p>Q is a fantastic larp though. He pretty much always throws out something to provide backup if his supporters become disappointed when something big is supposed to happen but it flops. So in preparation for the OIG report, he said we would see Rosensteins redacted version but Trump has the real one. So even though there were like 5 little redactions, the Q people believe this isnt the real one. This is just a demo and Trump is still waiting to drop the real bomb. </p>

<p>Q also has mantras like trust the plan and disinformation is useful and how they need to set the stage. So when the followers lose hope, they can always chant those things and keep believing. It&#39;s really one of the most intriguing things I&#39;ve ever watched play out on the internet. Im fascinated by all of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pay attention to the order of the words. Called out as potential monsters. Not called out as monsters because they might be. There is nothing wrong with pointing out extremely suspicious publicly available information and explaining the potential implications.

<p>Why would I be lying? I just went down a reddit hole and ended up finding this comment chain and the way you typed moved me to see if you were honest. You are not, so that&#39;s why I replied.</p>

<p>But it was never a vital subreddit, and most of the stuff you are saying is just wrong. Learn to ignore the bots and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>HAH!</strong> And reflect my moon light onto you? Fat chance, Mr!</p>

<p>Why do you think newsprint gets your hands black, the more you read it? That&#39;s how the moonlight is harvested from the people. Some would have you believe they only take just a bit of moonlight in our news, just a little there in our high-end blenders, just a little in the moonioactive element inside every single ADA certified tooth brush (fluoride is put in to distract us from dismantling every toothbrush on the face of the planet). But, it&#39;s ACTUALLY A LOT.  </p>

<p>Right now, go and undress in your bathtub, and check for the amount of moon dust on your body. Normally there&#39;s a bit. But, ever since I can remember, there&#39;s been less and less, and, now, well, look at us!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been racking my brain for months on this problem... too little moon dust... newspapers and toothbrush handles reflecting all the moonlight... why... why... why... how?  </p>

<p>Unless there&#39;s tiny syringes in the turn signal stocks of modern automobiles. It&#39;s the only rational conclusion. Listen, cars make no sense. If you look at the kind of industry and resource and environment depletion required to have 1.03 billion cars on the road, fueled, rolling, moving... unless... if not to signal the moon man our unwavering obedience?  </p>

<p>... unless... no... it couldn&#39;t be... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roza_Papo"><strong>Roza Papo</strong></a>, who nearly lost an eye in an air raid in 1942 after refusing to take shelter, later became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_military">first woman general</a> in the Balkans... factoring in birth time field as it is to used the positions of the false Sun, moonman as well as the false moon that we see during the winter... yes, she must be the wife of the time-keeper, the birth mother of the first moonman, Henry Moonman Ford.  </p>

<p>You see, the only way they could have so many cars is if they did a lot of terrible things to facilitate this. Further, to continue on as we have been, given what the scientists say of climate change, and challenges facing humanity, we have been just going on like mindless... mindless people who believe the moon is a &quot;Natural satellite&quot; --whatever nazi propaganda book that came out of.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so clear now.  </p>

<p>Q was once born, and by being born, he knew that I&#39;d make this sentence, once day, the genius he is, and so he would know that I&#39;d see all those bs at the beginning, and oh look, more bs, oh, there&#39;s more, hmm, how do I bring the bs back, oh, there they are, and like they they&#39;re gone. Bbbbb bbubububububub.  </p>

<p>Exactly, Repulsive guidance molecule B, a molecule the size and temperament able to enter the human body at the hand. It makes sense. Every vehicle since the model-T has a T-shaped reservoir of this relatively plentiful, naturally moonman-gifted  bone morphogenetic protein from the long long ago.  </p>

<p>They know they were using industry to reflect too much moonlight from us. So, they are using the molecular equivalent to moonlight. This must be why we don&#39;t get the moon dust on us.  </p>

<p>The catalytic converter, invented by the aforementioned Roza Papo, we&#39;ve always known that if it were running a mixture of RGM-B, human plasma, oxygen, that we&#39;d get moon dust. That&#39;s are simple facts which every immortal receives on her second ultra-moonmitzvah, at age 1,300  moon years.  </p>

<p>You see, people who don&#39;t have cars, they don&#39;t have the RGM-B to replace what they lose from the various taps upon human civilization.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not that we need cars either!  </p>

<p>We just need to clad our bodies in the horribly toxic, I would imagine, internal buildup within well-seasoned catalytic converters driven by people, but those with mild to severe cases of hematoma; I find it sticks better. Armed with a turning signal stock in each hand, I say we meet in the middle of the ocean.  </p>

<p>If we can get together, a million strong. Form a giant moon in the ocean. Linking arms, the people on the outside can moon-kick hard, like, moon-hard, because we need to spin the group to such speeds as to propel us moonward (haha, of course), but first to boil the ocean down to a subtle dampness that lacks the satisfaction of a mist on the breeze.  </p>

<p>So, the people in the centre of the wheel will have to secure themselves, somehow.  </p>

<p>Moonman suggests the non-believers form an unhuman chain, sacrifice themselves for the moonman, that everyone pivot around them in a moon-delta formation, transitioning into a moon-omega-victor-victor formation, ending in a moon-half moon... moon... moonman.  </p>

<p><strong>/̤̟̠͚͢ ͏̧̣͡ͅȨ͔̝͍̹͝͡Ṇ̵̣̗̻͕͍͙͞͞D̞̦̤͝  ͔͕̖̜̩̜M̧̘̤̻̣̲̕Ò̵͈̘Ò̷̝̺̙N̹̙̪̝͉̺̰̙͟͠P̨͙͘͠Ę̴̱̦̝̭͚͠ͅǪ̹̳P̨̰̟͔͍͘͠L̵̴̴̩̰̗̼E̺̲̟͘͝   ͍̥̺͘͡T̶̯͇͚̯̘͈̳Ŗ̡̱͕̹̹͢A҉͓͎̟̳̜͎̥͇̦͢N̢̳̪̻͍̼̝͔ͅS͓̫̦̭͖͡M̗̪̬̙̝̬̮̣I̸̥̯̱̦S̞̬̰̬̬S̻͙̰̞͜I҉̯̞̜O̸҉̟̮͖͎͇̟̻̹N̶͍̯̯͙͉ͅ</strong>   </p>

<p>I guess I can&#39;t say. I&#39;ve encrypted my message. If you COULD read the message, above, it would mean that the moon has direct access to your brain via the moon-shaped structure within the falsely lauded pineal gland. That would be very bad. It would mean, with no uncertainty, surely, that you&#39;re being personally stalked by the moon, by the moonman.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I guess, because you want more of an answer than that one paragraph, well; well, I&#39;ll tell you, the planet isn&#39;t <del>GLOBE</del> shaped, it&#39;s shaped like a fuckin&#39; moon.</p>

<p>The main thing was there was no conclusion anything was that Strzok pushed for <em>harder</em> techniques in the Clinton investigation. That runs contrary to any claims he tanked it on purpose.</p>

<p>Also, Comey acted improperly sending the letter to Congress about Weiner&#39;s laptop; and using a gmail account for FBI business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>think about it this way, my post provides various proofs (which were asked for) most of which are 100% accurate accept for one that i had just recently saved without checking its authenticity. the proofs in themself show a very tangible connection that heavily implies Q is who he says he is. this is also a conspiracy board so this kind of thing would make sense logically for people to be talking about here. IF it really was fake people wouldnt care so much to go out of their way to make posts bluntly stating that Q is a larp without even providing any information to back up their claim. pro Q posts wouldnt be massively downvoted and anti Q posts wouldnt be massively upvoted either. yet here we are seeing all of this happen. The situation is apparent at this point, this subreddit and many others are likely being controlled. the people that are in control are at risk of losing everything due to Q and current ongoing events. </p>

<p>Would you believe it if i told you that 4chan mods are now spastically deleting anything containing Q proofs? it was ramped up considerably yesterday when the IG report dropped. Honestly we are probobly nearing the point where things are seriously going to start happening. I know this has been said before but this time i feel is different.</p>

<p>either way make your own decisions based off of what you find, go out of your way to verify if the information your seeing is correct so that you know for yourself you arent being duped like i was with that 58 spaces picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=YQB-SIN">A direct flightpath from Quebec to Singapore doesn&#39;t go anywhere near Alaska</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/06/10/u-s-president-donald-trump-stops-over-at-souda-base-on-crete/">Except that Air Force One actually went from Quebec to Singapore via Crete</a>.  <a href="http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=YQB-HER-SIN">Which goes entirely the opposite way around the world from the one depicted</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>And <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4eJmeJY.png">this other one of your &quot;best pieces of evidence&quot;</a>... I mean, this is so simple to check.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/966681883206668289">There are 18 spaces there, not 58</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Which isn&#39;t to say that it disproves Q: he didn&#39;t claim either of these things -- <em>you guys</em> did.</p>

<p>But, if your opinion of the strength of these pieces of evidence is truly representative of the wider Q-commnuity&#39;s; maybe it isn&#39;t... it would cast a lot of doubt on the Q-community&#39;s credulity, competence and credibility in evaluating any of this.</p>

<p>Not even just because they were wrong in these particular cases, but because apparently nobody even bothered to check some incredibly basic things that are incredibly easy to check.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure someone will be along in a minute to accuse <em>you</em> of being a plant to discredit Q by deliberately putting forward weak evidence.</p>

<p>This seems way too vague. Just &quot;protect POTUS,&quot; and then taking a potentially unrelated coincidence as proof and claiming to be right. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t require any advance knowledge. The date the IG report was coming was known by all, and the House FC members cited have long been in the same court as Nunes. This just requires a pretty decent knowledge of the right-wing ecosystem and the narratives they push, to realize that the FC would likely keep doing what it had done in the past.</p>

<p>This is closer, but entirely relies on similar language of the sort Q often uses, and that&#39;s also not related to the rest of the post (i.e. no pics involved, it&#39;s not the NSA). This to me just reads like &quot;throw enough spaghetti at the wall and some of it is bound to stick.&quot;</p>

<p>Which leaves <a href="https://i.imgur.com/cFKLSD2.png">https://i.imgur.com/cFKLSD2.png</a></p>

<p>This is the sole one in the list that really does make it look like Q had advance knowledge of... something? I&#39;m not sure of its relevance, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your first point, please show me the evidence that supports your claim</p>

<p>your second point, so your telling me Q posting protect 6-14-46 (trumps birthday) and then the very next day they find a gun on one of trumps motorcade drivers (they arent allowed to carry guns) isnt a connection? im sorry but i feel your trying to ignore this one.</p>

<p>your third point, your ignoring the fact that the freedom caucus is comprised of many more members than just the three depicted, is your point that these same three members of the freedom caucus always compile requests like the one shown in the link? if this is your point then please direct me to the evidence of this being accurate.</p>

<p>your forth point, while this might be true, it definitely wasnt known to break in the news in may, it could have broken any month or not at all.</p>

<p>your fifth point, i agree with you on this one, sorry that i posted this as proof. didnt bother to check if it was legit.</p>

<p>your sixth point, Q doesnt often use the flood is coming, not really sure where your getting this information from. your also saying nothing was released by the NSA (YET). so while i agree that a flood of damning information hasnt revealed itself yet, it doesnt mean it wont in the future.</p>

<p>I really do expect you to respond to me on this, show me evidence of all of your claims so that i can actually take you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, let&#39;s talk logic for a second. It is the responsibility of the one making the claim - in this case, you, and other Q believers - to substantiate your claim; it is not the responsibility of someone to provide evidence to refute it. Logic alone - pointing out holes in the evidence provided - tends to be enough. This is how the US legal system works, and indeed how all logical debate works, simply because it is impossible to prove a negative.</p>

<p>For instance, I can show you evidence that Air Force One, on the trip to Singapore, refueled at <a href="https://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1359069/air-force-one-refuels-on-crete-while-on-way-to-singapore">Souda base in Crete</a> on the way to Singapore, and went <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/06/12/breaking-news/air-force-one-lands-in-honolulu-for-brief-refueling-stop/">through Honolulu</a> on the way back. At no point did AF1 pass over Alaska for the Singapore meeting. You, however, could say something like &quot;well, maybe for such an important meeting there were two AF1s, one went to Crete as the official cover story and the real one flew over Alaska, which is what Q/Trump was on,&quot; and I wouldn&#39;t be able to disprove that, simply because you cannot prove a negative. So the burden of proof for these rests on Q/you.</p>

<p>However, I will do my best to refute these as best as I can. </p>

<p>In general, my view of Q is that he/she is a LARPer using the Nostradamus method of saying so many things that a handful of them are bound to look correct in retrospect. When you make 1500+ posts, some of them are bound to be correct out of sheer circumstance/law of large numbers, but that doesn&#39;t make you a reliable source.</p>

<p>That said, I will do what I can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your second point, so your telling me Q posting protect 6-14-46 (trumps birthday) and then the very next day they find a gun on one of trumps motorcade drivers (they arent allowed to carry guns) isnt a connection? im sorry but i feel your trying to ignore this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it really does come off as throwing spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks. Q&#39;s post is basically just &quot;protect the President,&quot; which is the Secret Service&#39;s job. There are bound to be countless credible threats/attempts on any President&#39;s life (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_threats_against_Barack_Obama">case in point</a> ), so saying &quot;protect the President&quot; would undoubtedly be true sooner or later. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that the motorcade driver in question <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/19/gun-found-in-bag-of-trump-motorcade-driver-secret-service-says/?utm_term=.ae90f814521e">was driving the press van</a> and was released by the Secret Service after it came out that he was a legal firearm owner and didn&#39;t appear to pose any genuine threat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your third point, your ignoring the fact that the freedom caucus is comprised of many more members than just the three depicted, is your point that these same three members of the freedom caucus always compile requests like the one shown in the link? if this is your point then please direct me to the evidence of this being accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those three and only those three? No. But <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2017/12/06/gaetz-desantis-yoho-fbi-must-investigate-clinton/">Gaetz and DeSantis</a> have long been partners in crime, Biggs is a reliable <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/12/27/rep-andy-biggs-tells-mueller-to-end-witch-hunt.html">anti-Mueller voice on Fox</a>, the three of them are <a href="https://gaetz.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-matt-gaetz-leads-9-lawmakers-request-information-about-fbi-s-lost">regularly included in messages like this</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/18/17252290/desantis-letter-prosecute-clinton-comey">another example</a>. </p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?446001-1/house-republicans-call-special-counsel">here&#39;s a video of ARM calling for a second special counsel</a> on May 22. So the three of them have definitely worked together before. Do they &quot;always&quot; do it, the three of them? No. Are they consistent enough in doing this that it&#39;s hardly a stretch to see them doing it in the future? Yep. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>your forth point, while this might be true, it definitely wasnt known to break in the news in may, it could have broken any month or not at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. But this goes back to the spaghetti sticking argument. Knowing that the Chilean scandal was happening, and knowing that Francis was under fire for defending some of the people involved, it is not a stretch that <em>something</em> of note would happen in May that could then be reverse-interpreted to fit this post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>your sixth point, Q doesnt often use the flood is coming, not really sure where your getting this information from. your also saying nothing was released by the NSA (YET). so while i agree that a flood of damning information hasnt revealed itself yet, it doesnt mean it wont in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He may not use that specific language but Q followers are always saying things like &quot;a storm is coming,&quot; &quot;the fire is rising,&quot; stuff like that. </p>

<p>Like, let&#39;s just ignore the &quot;flood is coming&quot; part for a second. The McCabe story is about McCabe having discussed the Comey-Trump briefing with CNN before CNN published its story, and warned top FBI leadership that something was about to break (which he knew, since he was the source). </p>

<p>The Q post is about &quot;emails, videos, audio, pics, etc,&quot; the FBI deleting texts, and the NSA releasing them. The two have nothing in common other than that &quot;flood is coming&quot; message. </p>

<p>If the Q post were something like &quot;The flood is coming. How did CNN know what they know? Who at FBI was telling them?&quot; - a clear link between the McCabe email and the subject matter being discussed - then I&#39;d find it more plausible.</p>

<p>But as is, I think it&#39;s just spaghetti sticking. </p>

<p>Is it? </p>

<p>Q has made what, 1500 posts? There has been &quot;proof&quot; for a handful of them. Q is wrong far more often than he&#39;s right. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m like 95% sure that we knew that Obama accessed the Clintonmail server back during the 2016 election. I want to say it came up when people were like &quot;Hillary&#39;s IT guy posted to Reddit!&quot; So I wouldn&#39;t call this new information. </p>

<p>Addressing your other two points... sorry, I still find these really weak. &quot;Dark to light&quot; as the summit makes sense, but we all knew it was going to happen. The only thing that could be verifiable is the four &quot;booms,&quot; but this is again the benefit of Q being so vague. <em>Anything</em> that came out with four parts could be forced into the &quot;booms.&quot; You could just as easily go &quot;China, US, SK, NK... four countries, four booms!&quot; or whatever.</p>

<p>And the second part, &quot;blackout necessary,&quot; never came to pass. It means nothing. </p>

<p>Do you have a version of the second image (the fire engine one) at a legible resolution? I can&#39;t even read what&#39;s being written in there. </p>

<p>First of all, that&#39;s an opinion piece, and a very biased one at that. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/20/hillary-clintons-it-guy-asked-reddit-for-help-altering-emails-a-twitter-sleuth-claims/?utm_term=.73f3e08cf3ea">Here is an article</a> from September 2016 with Clinton&#39;s IT guy asking for help with a &quot;very VIP&quot; email address, which was long theorized to be Obama. So yeah, the theory that &quot;Obama knew about the email server&quot; has been around since 2016.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s the thing - I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any credit to give. He posts random shit in these posts <em>all the time</em> that to me just seems obviously intended to make them seem ~dramatic~ and then gets retroactively fitted to something to have them make sense. </p>

<p>Okay. So what does this have to do with NK and the summit? </p>

<p>This is the sort of thing I&#39;m talking about. Let&#39;s assume, for a moment, that Q is absolutely correct and has some sort of insider knowledge. What possible message is he sending here?</p>

<p>&quot;Hm, I know, my post number will match the number of the fire truck sent to hold up the American flag for the prisoners coming home! This is despite the fact that the post in question has nothing to do with North Korea or the prisoners, and that really the only secret message here is &#39;I am real.&#39;&quot; He&#39;s not telling you anything of note.</p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s far more likely that he saw the picture of the fire truck, saw it was Q74, scoured his recent posts for something that was the 74th post and went &quot;see? It matches!&quot; </p>

<p>All of these &quot;proofs&quot; seem like they&#39;re just connecting stars to look for constellations, contorting the data into a message rather than there actually being one.</p>

<p>Like, in terms of narrative/message, the Alaska one made sense - it&#39;s Q going &quot;Air Force One was almost shot down over Alaska by a rogue missile due to China&#39;s hacking our navy.&quot; There&#39;s a coherent message there in the theorycrafting - it just falls apart when you learn that Trump went to Greece rather than Alaska on his way to Singapore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes. I mean, the very premise of what we&#39;re discussing is &quot;there is a secret war going on between government factions and President Trump is the ultimate good guy fighting off the evil black-hat rebellion, and also there&#39;s a guy who has top-level knowledge of all of this and decided that rather than go to the Post or the Times or even Fox News, Breitbart, etc was to make cryptic, vague posts on 4chan/8chan.&quot; </p>

<p>That is a monumentally extraordinary premise, which means I will need extraordinary evidence to take it seriously. </p>

<p>Every time Q posts something exact, it&#39;s wrong. His very first post was saying that Hillary Clinton would be arrested at a specific time on a specific day, and it never happened. Even just recently, there were promises that June 11 would be a monumental day full of Happenings... and nothing happened. The IG was supposed to blow the FBI&#39;s bias wide open, and if anything, it proved that Hillary Clinton&#39;s grievances were legitimate.</p>

<p>The only posts that have been &quot;proven&quot; are the ones that are exceptionally vague and open to interpretation, <em>because</em> they&#39;re so vague and open to interpretation that they can be made to reference everything. Q and his believers say that &quot;sometimes disinformation is necessary,&quot; but to me, it looks like it&#39;s 99% disinfo and 1% something credible. </p>

<p>If it ever happens that Q posts something specific, like &quot;the Podestas will be arrested on Friday&quot; - not something open to interpretation, but something unmistakable - and it comes true, I&#39;ll believe it. Until then, I think the best-case scenario is that you guys are all getting taken for a ride by some kid LARPer shitposting on the chans. Worst-case, you&#39;re falling for some weird psyops campaign. </p>

<p>What would it take for you to believe Q was a hoax? </p>

<p>Others have been very polite about your misunderstanding of how discussions work, but this is wearing on my patience. If you make a claim, YOU have to back it up. If I claim &quot;water is poisonous to snakes,&quot; then it&#39;s up to ME to prove that claim--not you to <em>disprove</em> it. Do you understand?</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/jEojZKq.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/jEojZKq.jpg</a>
Here Q is referencing dark to light (Singapore summit)
4 points of peace were discussed at the summit <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/06/12/trump-kim-peace-pledge-summit-signed/">http://fortune.com/2018/06/12/trump-kim-peace-pledge-summit-signed/</a>
here again Q references dark to light and points to a video where they reference dark to light while talking about the peace talks in Singapore <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TvjC1if.png">https://i.imgur.com/TvjC1if.png</a>
heres the video in question <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A838gS8nwas">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A838gS8nwas</a></p>

<p>this next proof is also pretty amazing <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QhxLiE0.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/QhxLiE0.jpg</a>
the point here is that letters in front of numbers on fire engines are very uncommon, i searched around for about an hour and i couldnt find any. Its also important to notice that Q&#39;s 74th post on the board he was posting on was a very important one, and the castle lock post with the american flag was posted right after it was.</p>

<p>Do you actually think all Trump&#39;s enemies would stand by and NOT attempt to completely shred it, reveal it, end it? But they don&#39;t, or can&#39;t, or something...</p>

<p>What is that something? I don&#39;t know, but it may be the one institution every smart observer circles back around to - US military intelligence, or something equivalently immovable.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m as skeptical as everybody - middle road - but tell me it isn&#39;t plausible that one side of the deep state wants to get things done with &quot;honor&quot; (which includes smart bombs apparently) and another side wants to get things done with &quot;craft&quot; (like sex, drugs, and sexual entrapment). These two sides just might have the official version of a mob war on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is textbook <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading">cold reading</a>, akin to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_prophecy#See_also">Bible prophesy</a> as well. </p>

<p>The trick to knowing whether something is knowledge or just a guess that gets filled in <em>after the fact</em> is its ability to predict something that couldn&#39;t have been guessed. </p>

<p>Like when Einstein predicted that stars behind the sun would appear to move during a solar eclipse as an artifact of his Special Theory of Relativity. It&#39;s a bold prediction, because it&#39;s either going to be photographed or it isn&#39;t. No gray area.</p>

<p>Now, when Q says &quot;there&#39;s gonna be a &#39;win&#39; in the near future,&quot; and the POTUS doesn&#39;t use that word like he usually does, it <em>becomes</em> &quot;Good<em>win</em>&quot;. As in Micheal Goodwin, a Fox News and New York Post contributor. To call him a &quot;suck ass&quot; is to understate his support for the POTUS. But really, big fucking deal. That&#39;s the &quot;win&quot; that we needed Q to leak to us? </p>

<p>The question is, do you really need Q clearance to predict <em>part</em> of a name of a political pundit who wrote a praise piece on the administration? Apparently that&#39;s enough for some hopeful/victimized egos.</p>

<p>So if you believe there was actual knowledge, when in fact, it was a calculated ambiguity of no consequence, you&#39;re participating in this illusion.</p>

<p>This has a name. It&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdiction">Postdiction.</a> This is a well-known bug of human psychology that gets hacked by con artists trying to interpret the Bible or Nostradomus or insert opportunistic propaganda to get to the public to see something in the fog of these murky texts that isn&#39;t really there.</p>

<p>You know how a bunch of assholes came out <em>after</em> 9/11 to point out how Nostrodamus or Bill Casey predicted this or that? Hint, if the &quot;prediction&quot; comes after the fact of the event, it ain&#39;t much of a prediction.</p>

<p>And if you fall for this, you&#39;re very susceptible to letting the wool get pulled over your eyes--to essentially become the tool of the richest people in the country. Or just make the distinction between prediction and postdiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that theory. Throwing vague shit at the wall and hoping some sticks. I get it. But... don&#39;t you think some of those examples are pretty ironic?</p>

<p>And looking at your history, why do you go to GreatAwakening to tell people he&#39;s not legit? Why would you even go there? Why go thru so much trouble? Did you search for this post or did you stumble across it? Are you searching out posts about Q so you can shoot it down? </p>

<p>Trying to think of reasons, I say: Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to see people waste their time and energy? Even if that were true, why would it matter so much to you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironic? I&#39;m just pointing out that &quot;Q&quot; is pulling shit out of his/her ass. Undeniably. Why you would want to keep listening to someone who is clearly lying to you is beyond me. </p>

<p>Is it team loyalty? If Q was legit, he wouldn&#39;t have to make up a goddamned thing. He wouldn&#39;t have to play the postdiction game. There would be a prediction and it would either come out sooner or later. Not this &quot;I have knowledge of the color blue and the number 7 and a capital J...&quot; then fill in the blanks later with whatever sticks. He wouldn&#39;t need to.</p>

<p>And yet. There&#39;s no better example of a psy-op happening in real time. You should be way more cautious about the people claiming to tell you &quot;secrets.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>think about it this way, my post provides various proofs (which were asked for) most of which are 100% accurate accept for one that i had just recently saved without checking its authenticity. the proofs in themself show a very tangible connection that heavily implies Q is who he says he is. this is also a conspiracy board so this kind of thing would make sense logically for people to be talking about here. IF it really was fake people wouldnt care so much to go out of their way to make posts bluntly stating that Q is a larp without even providing any information to back up their claim. pro Q posts wouldnt be massively downvoted and anti Q posts wouldnt be massively upvoted either. yet here we are seeing all of this happen. The situation is apparent at this point, this subreddit and many others are likely being controlled. the people that are in control are at risk of losing everything due to Q and current ongoing events. </p>

<p>Would you believe it if i told you that 4chan mods are now spastically deleting anything containing Q proofs? it was ramped up considerably yesterday when the IG report dropped. Honestly we are probobly nearing the point where things are seriously going to start happening. I know this has been said before but this time i feel is different.</p>

<p>either way make your own decisions based off of what you find, go out of your way to verify if the information your seeing is correct so that you know for yourself you arent being duped like i was with that 58 spaces picture.</p>
