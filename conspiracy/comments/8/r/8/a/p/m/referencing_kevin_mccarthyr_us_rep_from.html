        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today, the paper local to Devin Nunes&#39; (R) Congressional District, 
in the southern half of California&#39;s big central and agriculture dominant valley.  </p>

<p>There was an article rebutting a current campaign ad by Nunes, charging the Fresno Bee with all manner of subterfuge against him. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article213209074.html">http://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article213209074.html</a></p>

<p>But the interesting part is how a company he is invested in has this Russian connection.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nunes is an investor in a Napa winery called Alpha Omega that is owned by a friend.</p>

<p>The story reported that Alpha Omega sold wine to Russian clients in 2013. A Russian alcohol distributor called Luding lists Alpha Omega as one of its American suppliers. The discovery of that relationship came as Nunes and his committee looked into the suspected election meddling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that Alpha Omega tweeted it only did business in Russia in 2013. That involved a single transaction for 22 cases. But Luding still lists Alpha Omega on its website.</p>

<p>I see a lot of finger pointing blame shifting, I don&#39;t think it is out of the question Netanyahu is very dirty and those tea party Republicans have certainly been cooperative with him.  Remember when they had him address Congress to demand that Obama invade Iran?</p>

<p>Have we seen any outcome to Netanyahu&#39;s corruption trial? </p>

<p>It appears Luding lists everyone they have ever done business with. It makes them look more global.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.luding.ru/en/suppliers/">http://www.luding.ru/en/suppliers/</a></p>

<p>22 cases sounds like they bought some but in the end didn&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>The Fresno Bee seems to have a grudge against Nunes(from coverage of a civil case that has nothing to do with Russia). </p>

<p>By your logic anyone who has ever traded globally has a Russia, China, UK, insert whatever nation connection.</p>

<p>You linked a poor man&#39;s snopes article. It isn&#39;t actually an article. It is an editorial that shows an obvious grudge against Nunes.</p>

<p>You realize 22 cases of wine is what amounts to nothing? It is sample. Whoever is buying tries it out, looks at the margins and decides if they it is a wine they want.  You have gone down a 22 cases of wine rabbit hole, anything for muh Russia I guess.</p>
