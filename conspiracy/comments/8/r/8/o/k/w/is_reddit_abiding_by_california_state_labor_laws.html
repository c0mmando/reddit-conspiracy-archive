        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of you know, I&#39;ve recently became a mod after many years.  During this time I have come to realize the troubles that come with cleaning up the sub, and the constant complaints and threats that come with it.  I&#39;m literally making myself a target for reddit&#39;s benifit... After all, they did create this sub, hence why don&#39;t have a &quot;Created By&quot; next to our age.  But as they say, it&#39;s a volunteers job, Right?  But I&#39;m curious, is it?  Reddit is HQ&#39;d in San Francisco, CA.  California passed some pretty strict labor laws a couple years ago, which essentially make it illegal for a private, for profit company to utilize volunteer labor.  By the way, reddit has mentioned going IPO in the next couple years.  Many of you may remembe the news that for profit companies couldn&#39;t utilize interns anymore in California without it being associated with a school/course that providing college credits.  This started making me wonder, does reddit utilize free labor to keep their site clean of specific content without providing any compensation, even though state law says otherwise?  That&#39;s the question, for a lawyer who may want a class action lawsuit... I bet they could make a pretty penny!  That&#39;s quite a conspiracy, to utilize free labor to maintain once site, with the threat of being fired from being a mod... Oh, sorry, banned. </p>

<p>It is though, the reddit even has guidelines for how mods act.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yup, and That&#39;s how I viewed it till I mentioned it to a buddy of mine.  Our business, which is in CA, can not use volenteer labour in any form.  If someone shows up at our work and starts cleaning up our business, and we all them, we are in violation of the new labor laws.  It&#39;s even difficult for many nonprofits to utilize volenteers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>IMO, subs that were created by reddit themselves (before users could create subs), like r/conspiracy, politics, news and worldnews, are extentions of reddit themselves.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d agree, but that doesn&#39;t invalidate my point on current CA labor laws.... There is alot of laws that are ridiculous.</p>

<p>They are utilizing free labor, they have entire teams of moderators controlling the content of their users.  In addition, a company can&#39;t allow volenteer to work for them for free if they are a business.  If someone shows up at my employers location and starts to provide labor, and I allow them, then tgat business is in violation of CA labor law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I contact has nothing to do with it.  Any business in California can&#39;t use volenteer labor.  Especially a position/responsibilty that was held by an employee.  Admin use to be the mods, until they handed it over to the volenteer mods, yet California law is pretty clear about for-profit businesses using volenteer.

    <div class="md"><p>im certain most of the mod team on key political subs are generally payed by other institutions</p>

<p>i think r/conspiracy would be immensely better if the mods were publicly known people who could be contacted outside of reddit and who were compensated.  </p>

<p>reddit is a corporation and so it is itself a conspiracy, you can&#39;t have a corporation run in the open, by nature it is secretive and makes decisions at the expense of its customers.  </p>

<p>i don&#39;t just think modding is worthy of pay, i think all posting on the internet is worthy of pay if it is a contribution to human knowledge and society.  </p>

<p>which is to say, that proof of meaningful activity on a site like reddit should make one eligible for basic income.  </p>

<p>i dont want to give anyone at eglin air force base a bonus though....see the dilemma?  </p>

<p>Except that your understanding of California law almost certainly wouldn&#39;t hold up in court. Specifically you&#39;re only looking at the distinction that disallows for profit businesses from engaging  volunteer employees. Unfortunately, your activity on Reddit doesn&#39;t qualify as &quot;work&quot; (volunteer or otherwise) in the first place. The definition of Employer and Employee is set, in California, by the Industrial Workers Commission. If you read through their definitions you&#39;ll see that the unsolicited &quot;labor&quot; you do doesn&#39;t qualify you as an employee. Specifically &quot;Reddit&quot; hasn&#39;t actively engaged with you, nor do they control any aspect of your &quot;work&quot;. So...tough luck.</p>

<p>Your argument is the equivalent of finding a rake in someones lawn, raking some leaves, and demanding payment. </p>

<p>Well, for making a comment that long you could have linked to or even just said HOW it doesn&#39;t qualify.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m more inclined to say OP is right, because you are talking about &quot;work&quot; and &quot;labor&quot;, but it all about the definition of <em>volunteer</em> that matters.  And Reddit is NOT a &quot;public agency&quot; or &quot;nonprofit organization&quot;, if you are going that route.  People in this thread even say, &quot;Why don&#39;t you stop volunteering?&quot;  Technically, in CA, they aren&#39;t allowed to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can be inclined to whatever you want. However, the reason I’m talking about work and labor is because the definition of volunteer is contingent on the definition of “work”. If you are not “working” then you are not volunteering. This is why the law states that volunteers at private companies must be paid - because they are working.</p>

<p>As OP is not doing work he’s also not a volunteer. He’s a user of the site - same as you and I - who chooses to interact with it in a different way. He’s no different than a power user who regularly submits good content and comments. Both provide value to the community (and therefore the site). Neither could be considered a volunteer employee of Reddit. </p>

<p>Still not the CA definition. All that does is shift the brunt of the definition from &quot;work&quot; to &quot;performing a service&quot;.  Do mods provide a service, and does the corporation make money because of the service the mods provide.  Still seems like a yes.  </p>
