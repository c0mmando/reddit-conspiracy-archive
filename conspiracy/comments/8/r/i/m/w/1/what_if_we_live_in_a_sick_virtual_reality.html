       As the simulation theory says,if its true,what if we all live in a world created by some creep that is more evil than good?As in the world happens more evil than good,and the feeling of deja vu,paranormal activities are just glitches in the game?That would explain why society try so hard to conform to the rules and have a normal life instead of being themselves,and those who dont behave are punished if they get caught.Everything that happens might not be all planned from the start but in the end maybe the big picture of what will happen its already planned,what if so called god is the one that created the game or started a new game?

       It's not virtual reality, because there is nothing unreal in existence. Everything that is, is. Albeit temporarily. The nature of personal reality is that the one I experience is my version of the underlying idea construction. My consciousness is like a web browser, instantly forming personal experience from the constructed ideas, action, and beings that are present. If there are 5 people in this room, then there are 5 different rooms being experienced. If person number 6 shows up, everyone's consciousness instantly materializes their version of the person. Creativity is ubiquitous. Action=instant change in reality (though the change might not yet be the full realization of the vision or idea). It's all quite amazing and beautiful.

       Holy f***..... I've been thinking the same thing for a couple years. I always trip on the idea that in total, there is over 7 billion experiences happening at once. All different, all unique. What happens in my "web browser" may not necessarily happen in someone else's...at least, I have no way of proving it does. That is a personal mind fuck for me.

       It's easy to fall into solipsism with this---that since there is no way to prove anything exists outside my bubble of awareness, and I'm constructing my experience, that all there is is me. Which can make one feel claustrophobic---trapped in a bubble of awareness---everyone is free to come and go, come and go, but I'm trapped here. Or I'm the only one, I'm dreaming everyone, and this is all an illusion of delusion. When I awake, I will again exist as a consciousness in a complete void.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these are just ideas and fantasies about personal experience, and can be disregarded as such, or used to fuel creativity. Instead of used to drive one's self crazy and make one's self paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher states of consciousness will reveal what sounds like paradox: that all is connected but still individual. That all is eternal, but temporary.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I create in my reality in this time and space or timeline, will also be created in another's time and space or timeline, if they are sharing the same time and space or timeline. The drawing I made and put on the fridge has only been experienced or constructed by a dozen people. The rest can experience it online if they wish when I finally create "Fridge Stream."
      </p>
      <p>
       Creativity and action are the lifeblood of existence. Vision, imagination and action. Contributing realized idea to this universe of idea construction is what we do. Though some act in more limited habitual ways than others. Recreating the same thing day in and day out. Still they are adding to the creation.

       Stuck in solipsism please send help. What happens when you really can’t contribute anything creatively to the collective consciousness ? This is where I’ve been for a while and I’ve been in a deep state of depression about it. Eventually you’re just more skillful at making people happy through work and service since you have no artistic abilities. Then you just feel like an NPC. I’ve tried to make friends over the years but my last job I didn’t even bother to learn anybody’s names. I remembered some of them but knew I was only going to be working there temporarily. I felt bad about it because I’m like why am I like this as a person? But at the same time deep down I know it’s true. People come and people go throughout your life and realistically, none of us are going to go much further than work with our work acquaintances. There was a talk by Alan Watts that made me curious and he was talking about a philosopher who said the ultimate question was as to whether to commit suicide. I think it means either you think life is worth living or you don’t and you think it’s meaningless so why bother being here? I have a bunch of other weird theories about reality but I digress It’s just still leaves me feeling like a black sheep amongst black sheep. Sometimes I get trapped in a weird thought loop where it’s like yeah you could commit suicide but what if reincarnations a thing you’re just going to come back and endure it all again anyways. So then I have even less motivation do things. I just wish I was more formless and  free. I’ve never felt comfortable in human skin.

       Your post is a contribution to the universe and collective unconscious. You thought it up, acted, and now it exists. You changed your experience just a little, and mine as well. Creativity is as natural as breathing. The problem I ran into, and many do, is becoming too concerned with the story of self, the past, and what's going to happen in the future. Let's call these "mental loops."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the story of yourself as you tell it here, it shows how selective we can be about the past because of what beliefs we hold about ourselves. I might hold a belief that I'm a weak person, then I look at my past selectively and see only the times that I acted as if I were weak, ignoring any times that I might have been strong. The truth is that both weakness and strength are within me at any given time. They are latent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cosmic joke is that the story of self is just that...a story. The me in the story is not real. It's a fictional character.  A phantom made of beliefs, memory, and imagination. The real me is synonymous with here and now. It's not limited by the story of self. It has boundless potential to create and to love and to act.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a time in my life when I was really concerned with the story of self. I was slightly paranoid. I thought people were thinking things about me. I was anxious and depressed. I wasn't rooted in the primary reality of my senses. I was isolating. My primary relationship and focus was with the mental loops running around my skull. I found myself working in a health food store back then when they were truly strange places to work. The people I worked with were into adventures in consciousness in a myriad of ways. One of them once said to me, "here you are now....the only place you can ever be...get out of your head...you're not seeing reality as it is...now, which you? Which world?"
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, something awakened in me. I realized I was just lost in my thoughts all the time and not consciously creating my life. The realization didn't instantly stop my brain. I needed to get to work. So, whenever I found myself "looping", I'd stop, get in my senses, and start to listen to, smell, feel, taste, and see the details of my environment without judging or labelling them. Then I'd get to the business of the task at hand if I was at work, or get to the business of creating outside of work (writing, drawing, art, creating for others, maintaining living space, creating experiences outside of the house, etc.). I brought myself to what I would call mental health through hard work. The past lost its power. Unreasonable anxiety disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which me? Which world? My actions will tell the tale. I can sit here and focus on the story of me, or I can get busy having visions big and small and get acting to make them happen. Leaving the story of self in my vapor trail where it belongs. In order to stop the momentum of mental loops, I need to get busy creating consciously as much as possible (doesn't have to be the arts--it can be within existing relationships, the yard, business, decorating, maintaining the spaces and things in our lives, doing things for others, sex, carpentry, a body of work on Reddit, etc. whatever holds one's interest). End book.

       It's both subjective and objective. Subjective in that everyone is forming their own reality, and objective in that there are fields of idea constructions and probabilities and physical "rules" that are unto themselves (though not separate--it's both)--fields of agreed upon reality, shared idea construction and probabilities, if you will— That each individual surfs and co-creates within.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a thought exercise, one can imagine and come to a conclusion that the universe is only experienced subjectively by the beings in it, thus there is no objective reality. But in experiences of higher consciousness one can become aware that subjectivity and objectivity are coexisting at once. It's a paradox in thought, but not in experience.

       Experience (in quantum mechanics at least) somewhat corroborate your statement: particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like traits. It’s a paradox until we learn more.

       Yes, the journey into love, knowledge, and creativity is an amazing one. I add creativity, because I find that love/freedom and creativity go hand in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read a few things about QM (i'm no expert) that basically said that these physicists have seen that the observer affects the observed just by observing it, which point to the experience/realization I've been having since 1984 that the observer is the observed, or that I and my experience are one.

       title should read “What if I live in a sick virtual reality” not WE because my life is beautiful , maybe it’s because I don’t subscribe to the whole deja vu , paranormal activities , and I don’t try to conform to the rules , I’m my own person and I take responsibility for my own actions , create my own luck and have the ability to separate fiction from reality, your post makes me believe you are stuck in a fictional life you created because you dont know any better and you truly believe that “TPTB” actually have any bearing on your life , they don’t , get off your ass and make something of yourself, stop blaming everything for your misfortune and create your own reality bud

       TPTB don't care about most people playing in their own sandbox, even if you do well and make a few million you are not even on the radar; but use that money in politics,  try to patent a technology that can be a threat, or even speak out against certain people or states and you will find out if TPTB have control over you pretty quickly.  You are just enjoying flying under the radar like most people.

       Yea, but it's not like you think. Most people walk around in a trance. The truth will set them free. That's why anyone that tries to speak truth gets attacked by the establishment.

       Also, look up Organic Portals. I partially believe in this theory.

       I figure we are actually advanced beings who choose to forget our existence so we experience struggle and emotion and accomplishment again from a different angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it probably builds our character to experience these lives of struggle

       I don't think we actually see more evil than good but rather that a single act of evil can easily destroy decades of beneficial efforts and hard work that was all to the good in one fell swoop.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simply the disproportionate harm and shocking nature of any acts of evil that we witness that shocks and offends our sense of what is "normal" i.e. good or completely harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also an attitude in our culture that as much as it looks to severely punish evil acts and behaviors it does very little to actually promote or reward the good and more benevolent behavior that is simply
       <em>
        expected
       </em>
       or considered to be "normal" when in fact such norms are the by-product of relatively safe, sane and reasonable living and social conditions that no everyone has.

       It's not virtual reality, because there is nothing unreal in existence. Everything that is, is. Albeit temporarily. The nature of personal reality is that the one I experience is my version of the underlying idea construction.
