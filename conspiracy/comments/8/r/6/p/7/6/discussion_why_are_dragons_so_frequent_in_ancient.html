       I'm not sure.  We still have a day we praise a tree, respect mistletoe lovingly, and give gifts.  I know they allowed some customs to stay to appeal more, but...the mistletoe part.  I think it interesting they could only allow us to kiss.

       To become a metaphor there must have been an established meaning first. The OP is wondering how/when humans developed the imagination of a dragon first.

       Determining fiction or non-fiction is the tricky part. If you take one of the other replies about the stories being based on primordial instinct-fear, then it leans to non-fiction IMO.

       Ive heard a couple theories. The obvious one being dinosaur bones being interpreted as dragons and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another theory ive heard is that the genetic memory of humans has cumulated into similar "beasts/dragons" popping up in numerous different cultures. Basically dragons have the characteristics of animals which our genetic ancestors would have feared millenium ago. Think talons and wings of eagles that would snatch primapes out of trees, or the face and scales of snakes and lizards. Also the body of a predator similar to big cats or bears. Im not sure how valid this theory is but I do know that 'genetic memories' or however you want to put it are passed down on a smaller and larger scale. For instance the foods your accestors eat can affect how you digest or like foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in a time before computers and constant communication story tellers played a much larger role in the passing of history. These scary or heroic stories may have become an accumulation of the characteristics which humans were most frightened of dating back to the threats faced by our ancestors.

       Turkeys were the only birds that consistently recognized particular shapes, but the shadow of a slow moving bird overhead does indeed trigger a prey response in most baby birds tested - the idea that all chicks have the shape of a predatory animal’s shape burned into their brain from memory is a misrepresentation of our current understanding of instinct.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will often hear this phenomena referred to by creationists who believe instincts are proof of god and that the transmission of information at the cellular level isn’t feasible (and to be fair, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       inconceivable to them for some reason).

       Shit. I remember having to do a project over it in highschool senior biology class in Texas. Teacher loved hunting, and knew everything about birds. Got us to do an extra credit assignment. I think I found it in the Google scholar thing or whatever. The search that results in scientific essays and papers

       Love that second theory. As someone who's usually automatically looking for evolutionary reasons/genetic motivations to do/behave certain ways, that is the best theory on why dragons are so powerful in the collective consciousness ive ever heard. they combine all sorts of fears: snakes, cats (tigers/lions/panthers), crocodiles, etc. I like it. anyway, thanks. carry on.

       I think story tellers and story telling is stil extremely important but is much more convoluted now a days. Rather than looking towards a respected elder or wise man we have a virtually unlimited source of information on the past both high and low quality. My point on the internet was that it creates a huge mixing pot of information rather than a more constant stream of archtypes or stories being passed down through stoty tellers. Tbh though this is not a hill I would die on as I was mostly trying to stress how these charceteristics could have passed down through past generations.

       This kinda ties in with archetypes, which Jung wrote about prolifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symbols and abstract concepts deep within our collective primordial subconsciousness that conceptualize the same things. It's no wonder why so many groups and civilizations from antiquity all have such a common story, or a shared way of illustrating it through symbols.
Maybe it's because we have a shared sense of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we're all not so different after all.

       The two obvious ones are snakes, which are arboreal ancestors would have been terrified of, and then of course the security of the tree being disrupted by what is essentially a flying snake that can breathe fire and burn said tree down.

       Its not that im super confident that my theory is correct but i dont think you can call dragons being a fantasy ignorant. If that's the case that means your coming in with the presumed perspective that they are in fact real. I beleive the burden of proof should be on those who want to prove them as real rather than having others who must prove them to be false. Similar with lochness monster, cenatuars, yetis or any mythical beast for that matter, the burden of proof is on those who think it is real not the other way around. Assuming something isnt real when theres no concrete evidence for it isnt ignorant, its just the default position.

       Im not insulted or anything I just think you need some semblance of evidence that they are any more than imagination before assuming they are not. Agree to disagree though, I hope they were real and would love it if we found out that they were.

       Basically there are meta myths that humans all over the planet dreamed about. From Angels to gods to ghosts and common stories of miraculous things happening. Human minds interact with the same world and we are all capable of imagination, so you see a lot of similar ideas from people that have never even met. Kind of like, you see comedians joke about the same interactions they have on a daily basis.

       I think that has more to do with the phenomenon of how a behavior can spread through out a population. The collective unconscious thing has more to do with how our imagined bounce off the world we all live in. So over the course of thousands of years, things went bump in the night and humans who never interacted with each other came up with similar stories about ghosts.

       Hard to tell. I dont personally believe in demons so my guess would certain sicknesses might have led people to believe more was going on. Like a lot of people think the vampire legends were born out of observing people with rabies. When you watch demon possession movies, they kind jerk around like they are having a seizure. So I wouldn't be surprised if demon possession legends were born out of something like seizures or a reaction to some crazy drug like peyote.

       While it has many characteristics, the most prominent to me are it's ascending/descending, shape-shifting, winged/horned serpent like attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say it's difficult to get the big picture at first, but researching our ancestor's depictions and symbols helps.

       Here's a couple timelapses that I belie.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WxcKZ5V">
        In this first album,
       </a>
       there's a timelapse and stills. You see a horizon spanning tube shaped cloud passing in front of the moon. Now if you
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VXc3L8v.jpg">
        zoom in and look closely,
       </a>
       you'll see that cloud consists of a intermingled mix of twisted ribbon and sawtooth shaped "trails", which imo are
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6FcGGlo.jpg">
        actually depicted here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Tdepmv5.gif">
        This timelapse
       </a>
       shows again the tubular shape cloud, lights up red, and notice how it moves in a forward direction like a serpent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/IIyd02R">
        And this timelapse
       </a>
       shows where the winged part comes from. An often phenomenon is
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lJ5eAiQ.jpg">
        pairs of vertical trails,
       </a>
       like wings accompanying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just a couple, there's more.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/8cox1z/z/dxmw4o1">
        I put down more observations here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, the sky is insane once you start paying attention, and our ancient ancestors were definitely seeing the same things.

       I'm a little skeptical of mining, but IDK. I believe these creatures exist, to this day, and they supposedly eat children, which would explain all the missing kids from national parks recently. They're purported to be 1,000 plus years ahead of us as far as technology, probably taking direction from off-planet, and are a predatory force on human beings that seeks to stop us from being. I recommend the book "Not in HIS Image" about the archons, and also the radio show "Non Human Entities," which you can listen to on YouTube.

       The eating children thing throws me off.  Children blood is excellent as a transfusion, and if you terrorize them before slaughter to get them to pump adrenaline their blood should give a rush, but eating children is pointless.

       Interesting video, but there are a few major issues with it. For one, the Eastern Dragon is seen not as destructive, but as a symbol of protection and luck. They are completely different than the destructive dragons like in the St. George myth. The other problem is that the symbols they show in the video don't align chronologically in their narrative for the mis-alignment. Nor does the video explain time spans or how humans could survive such alignments.

       Almost every ancient culture had winged serpents (or sometimes seen as scaled skin birds) and they were usually man eating and required human sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up the Serpent Mount.  Its the oldest has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States and is estimated to be built hundreds of years before Columbus.

       Are you familiar with the idea that dinosaurs are an elaborate ruse?

       Before you downvote me, ask yourself how many dinosaurs you have seen with your own eyes.

       Ask yourself how many other monstrous creatures you believe in which you have literally never seen.

       I'm pretty sure I've seen a pterodactyl.  I know it's a stupid thing to say.  But I wasn't on any type of substance and i definetly saw something weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend was in the car and we were driving home from hockey and something fucking huge flared up right in front of my car.  My friend,  who had kind of a speech impediment yells out "holy thshit! A thpterodactl!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, totally unbelievable,  but i cant reconcile the memory.

       No i was out in the sticks.  The only thing close was a huge abandoned quarry.  It was also in the late 90s of that means anything.   It could've been... well shit i dunno.  I remember very clearly seeing all the veins in the wings as they were illuminated by my high beams.  The wingspan was easily 7 or 8 ft.  I still feel stupid even taking about it.

       Don't feel stupid talking about it. On the contrary, feel awesome. Is a cool story. Do u have Shoebills or any other giant birds like that in the area? Maybe even if they aren't indigenous there could have been somebody with a giant pet bird that got loose? Idk. I know if a shoebill swooped in front to of my car I'd flip the hell out. Also a rock quarry seems like a good place to maybe fly a pet bird or a model airplane but idk. If you can't come up with a more "rational explanation" I honestly don't think it's completely out of the question you may have actually seen some ancient bird or a bird that was just isolated enough to grow really huge. Birds are very closely related to dinosaurs still today if I'm not mistaken.

       In the US? I'm an engineer and have worked with people from Indonesia that mentioned to me about a "Giant Bat". They tell villagers not to go canoeing down a small rivers (forgot which ones) because this bat has been know to lift children out of canoes. Them being english speaking say it is teradactyl of some sorts.

       I really don't get what you mean by this. I've seen the bones of them. And before you say that the bones could be put together wrong, that has happened. Some dinos turned out not to be real and we learned of other ones that way.

       You’ve never seen the bones, nor has anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dinosaur fossils are made of mineralised deposits. In other words, rocks that look like bones.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could be a few years old, or a hundred billion years old, and you’d never know because it’s impossible to accurately date rocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or... they could have been fabricated by a Chinese factory worker on a production line because dinosaurs are BIG money.

       Point taken on fossils not exactly being bones. But I've seen fossils that I know for a fact weren't made in a factory. How do I know that? A family friend collects fossils in the wild and sells them to museums. I've seen his private collection/inventory.

       Ask him his opinion on why there appear to be no complete dinosaur fossil skeletons.

       I’ve always had a problem with this detail. After dying in a swamp, then being compressed by sediment, then mineralised over millions of years.... how do dinosaur bones always seem to scatter?

       Several different channelers have stated that at one point in our history great beasts fought each other over the right to hunt humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, once you read more into consciousness and the occult you realise that form is completely alterable based on your perception of yourself. In traditional stories, Dragons are creatures of extreme magical ability and will. It wouldn't be at all out of the question that creatures once existed with the ability to shape reality around them to an extreme degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me dragons fit the bill of entities which are several orders of magnitude above humans in terms of magical ability. Given the amount of reptilian motifs from history we have it also wouldn't surprise me if not only did they creatures never, die out, they never died at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if the 'reptilian elite' that is suspected to sit at the top of the current civilisational pyramid are being that fit the bill of what we refer to as Dragons. It wouldn't be a stretch that beings with a significantly advanced level of magical ability could change they form to resemble such creatures, if they were not already in that form naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Out of context tl;dr: Do dragons rule the Illuminati? It's not out of the question.

       Feathered, not winged. Also, a god, not fire-breathing, not collecting gold etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Winged, fire breathing dragons weren't even a thing until the middle ages and are a specifically European myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that in principle, you ask a valid question but you should not limti your question to dragons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mythical snakes do appear indeed in many cultures but take many forms and are not limited to the dragon kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       As mentioned already, there are plenty of theries. Race memory, genetic memory, fossils, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snake cults (not dragon cults) were a big thing in the ancient near east and the oldest myths about dragon-like creatures clearly identify them as snake-like.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story about the (god) hero who slays a giant snake seems to originate with the proto-indoeuropeans so it's not surprising that this specific myth can be found among those cultures who decend from these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As mentioned, the current western image of fire breathing winged dragons only arose during the middle ages so it's a pretty modern evolution of an old myth.

       well something to consider is that Dragons are seen differently depending on the region. In Asia, dragons are seen as magical, positive, symbols of good luck. They tend to be slender and not really have "wings".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the west, they are seen as evil and look different--more like dinosaurs.

       Awesome thread. I love this topic, and it played on my mind a lot as a kid. I think every continent has a mythos of giant flying reptiles, except for Australia which only has the Rainbow Serpent.

       Australia had Megalania, a giant Goanna or Komodo dragon. If I had met this creature I'd call it a dragon. If they died out after the first generation of settlers arrived in Australia and those first ancestors of our country had to explain to their children what these creatures were, I'd use the term dragon - if dragon meant the same creature in their tongue as ours.

       It's a huge misnomer to think people sat around and told scary stories just to kill time. 
I think people were very much in the 'now' (were zen-like) and wrote (or talked) about real life events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like we struggle to explain things we haven't been taught (UFO crafts that seem to be organic etc) same applied back then too. But that doesn't mean they made stories up. Just lacked the vernacular.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in all probability, everything that's been labeled myths and legends were all true with small elements of exaggeration. Fairies, no moon, two moons, mermaids, Sasquatch, dragons and everything else we have a hard time imagining......were probably real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life on Earth didn't just start with 'us'. It's had many many different realities and do-overs.

       I got a bit off track with my last comment but I believe there was a period on Earth where everything was colossal.  Flora (trees), fauna (animals, insects, reptiles etc) and people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In time it will probably be realized man and dinosaurs lived together at some point. There are  many ancient cave paintings and artifacts indicating their awareness of these creatures in much detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything we've been taught or conditioned to believe is wrong IMO.
Religions came along to try to explain to the confused,  the 'beginning' while.........science stuck their nose in there and spun theories into facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I wrote before, there have been many different 'incarnations' on this planet. And for reasons still unknown, have been wiped away and replaced. To think it all began just 6000 years ago is just crazy-arrogance!!

       the mono usage english name for assorted things from varios cultures across the ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       the english language usage of the word 'dragon' does not mean flying firer breathing reptiles with a fondness for gold being universal or even real.

      <p>
       Welsh ones were earth tunneling worms (think Dune), Chinese ones were water spirits (catfish sharks crocodiles). neither would have had wings.

       Fantastic answer.  So, over time as the word dragon became more tuned to serpent, each culture adopted their most serpentine myth to fit?

       Dinosaurs are a hoax that was created to cover for Dragons.  The reason Dragons are everywhere is because Leviathan (Satan) the main one and is very real.  People who don't read their Bible think the "serpent" in the garden was a little snake.  He wasn't, he was a Dragon that could talk and everything.   He has influenced/deceived humanity from the beginning.  Many cultures worship him.   That's why in China 100 people run around LARPing a big Dragon all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where the Dragon lost his legs and became leviatahn (more like a huge water serpent).  The prophesy about the dust won't happen until the future:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gen 3:14  And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
      </p>
      <p>
       More about him in his current state:

       Rev 12:9  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

      <p>
       The Dragon will persecute Israel and people who come to Jesus Christ during this time period:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev_12:13  And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev_12:17  And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of all the predictive programming on Dragons people will worship him.  The Antichrist will claim he is God:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev_13:4  And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

       The ones that weren't "discovered" until ~1830''s right as Darwin (Occultist) starting pushing his theory of Evolution?  The same theory that says we can keep evolving to our own Godhood today?  It's all just a fraud being pushed by Mystery Babylon.  So much of the dino bone stuff is just fakery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not totally dismissing bones though.  I just think any reals stuff that's found are Dragon bones or bones of human Gaints.  They will find a 6 Ft human femur and then extrapolate some dumb fake lizard from it.  Anything but the truth.

       Could you explain this a little more? Bone marrow is very easy to determined if it is bone or not. So when you take a T-Rex skull and know it's real bone, we can assume that most of the other bones that attached to it mostly likely came from the same creature. However, you can debate whether or not we assembled it correctly...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just not sure why bones would be "molded" it try and explain evolution. Why didn't they just mold "missing links" if it's fakery?

       It's just common sense.  Why would evidence of giant animals that had been around some crazy number of years ago not been found until the 1/3 through the 1800's?  Did humanity not dig in for a few thousand years?  The timing of it with Darwin's theory of evolution ties it all together.  It is a coordinated hoax by the powers that be to turn the truth of the Bible into a fairy tale.
      </p>

       There were however Dragons (draco) which are giant serpents of some sort so anything legitimate that is found could be those.  All sorts of cultures document them.

       Yes, the dragon (Satan) will manifest in the future during the time of Jacob's trouble.  He will be thrown down to the ground by Michael and his angels at the moment below.  He will come crashing through the firmament of the sky with all his angels.  It this is the scene being predicatively programmed by many scifi movies where aliens just show up.  When they land here they will set up shop, take over dominion of earth with the Antichrist and start preparing to do battle with Jesus Christ at his return at Armageddon.  This is being programmed by shows like Game of Thrones where you have a world that forgot about dragons and magic but it all suddenly returns and a seemingly all powerful King with an army that can't die about to invade and all nations have to unite to defeat him.  They will say he's some kind of other wordily threat and must be defeated.  It's the great deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 12:7  And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 12:8  And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 12:9  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

       I believe there is part of history of Earth that hasn't been uncovered that involved all kind of fantastic creatures that were real (giants, dragons etc). I think the author of lord of the rings based the story on some book he found in a library which said that the ancient world  was like this.
