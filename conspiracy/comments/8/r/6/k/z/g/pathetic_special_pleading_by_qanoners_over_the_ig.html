And of course, Q knows about the whole thing - and is giving just enough info to make sure we know, but say nothing about what&#39;s actually in the &quot;real report.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah there were like 5 but even some of the Q folks are aware 5 redactions arent going to turn the entire report into something new. Those redactions arent criminal charges for Hillary or Obama or anyone else they think should go down. </p>

<p>But at this point they have they have so much emotion invested into this that accepting that this wasnt the bombshell they were hoping for is too much to bear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe that Q does have some degree of authenticity, and many of the things discussed there definitely board merit. I think it’s intriguing, interesting, and downright entertaining at times, but, like everything else in this world, it has to be taken with a grain of salt. Some people are heavily involved in it, and won’t be happy until they see Hillary carted away in an orange jumpsuit on CNN. I would love to see that as much as the next guy, but it just doesn’t seem realistic. Bring that up to them and they throw out a warning about any doubtfag comments. They’re all in, and I feel for them. It’s how I was with Bernie. We all know how that turned out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say Q is actually some dude who chills with Trump. Even if thats the case, I would still call him a complete fraud. Simply because hes made all these people believe that they have some master plan and they are in complete control of events to come. </p>

<p>I was just reading this bible children&#39;s book to my nephew before he went to bed and it was the part where jesus was talking to these people and saying &quot;god takes care of the birds and the flowers, and they dont worry about what they will eat or the clothes they will wear. And god cares much more about you so you have no reason to worry.&quot;</p>

<p>And I was sitting there thinking fuck, what a crock of horse shit these people were so ready to accept. Kids dying in the street every day and these words of false hope dont mean a damn thing. </p>

<p>Q has been leading people to believe their wildest dreams were just a few steps away for over a year now. I think it&#39;s really unhealthy for these people, especially when they get so involved that their relationships with their spouses and families become strained. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just my gut feeling. I think that conspiracy theorists are very dangerous to TPTB nowadays, because they&#39;re (/we&#39;re) networked and can compare notes and do independent research. The easiest way to control us is to do have something like Q Anon pied piper us away from things they don&#39;t want us to focus on. It&#39;s gamified, it makes people feel important, there&#39;s a slow trickle, and just enough truths sprinkled in to keep people invested.</p>

<p>Nothing needs to be spun..once again...all the infractions/deviations from standard procedure are listed...but everyone walks.</p>

<p>That&#39;s OK...everyone is going to figure this out.</p>

<p>I really like how Comey come completely agrees with the findings of the report...except for the parts he doesn&#39;t agree with...nice touch.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t wait for Lynch&#39;s statement...should be a hoot.</p>

<p>You&#39;re doing a great job yourself pushing TD LARP annon posts. </p>

<p>Sounds like you believe LARP anon posts over factual investigations, that just happen to result in an outcome you don&#39;t believe in. </p>

<p>I have every right to disagree with their decisions regarding &quot;their interpretations or recommendations&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re pushing unsourced, unverified, LARP posts and you&#39;re lecturing me about truth?   </p>

<p>Well good for you. Just agree with what ever fits your narrative, anything against it is wrong, that seems like a good strategy...</p>

<p>Again you just don&#39;t like the report because its not damming to Hillary Clinton or Comey, or the FBI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems quite a bit far fetched.  I do think a lot of things were taken out of the report when it was sent to the FBI and DOJ, so it is possible that congressional oversight will demand more transparancy (especially after the missing text).  </p>

<p>That said, I would not call it a bust.  It adds weight to the bias argument made by the White House and Republicans </p>
