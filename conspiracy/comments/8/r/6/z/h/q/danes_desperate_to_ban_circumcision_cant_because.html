       ... Germany all over again. Germany actually did the right thing and tried to ban it in 2012. Took about 1 day for the law to get reversed because of, you guessed it, Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny how people will talk about the islamic takeover of Europe, but European countries are banning the burqa left and right. You can create anti-islamic organisations, demonstrations, networks, debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine anyone being able to do this while going after Jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       The double standard sickens me. It's hilarious to see the same people defend Israel as a Jewish state, turn around and say that European countries wanting to preserve a European majority would be horrible and racist. Drawing Mohammed is good, but drawing Jewish caricatures is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genital mutilation of boys will likely never be banned. Had it been a muslim practice only, it would have been banned a long time ago, and people like Shapiro, Lavant etc would support it. But no, since it's practiced by people who have a lot of political power (Jews, Americans), it wont happen. Instead, they promote it with fake science and remove the prepuce from American medical books as if it doesn't even exist.

       Your assertion that Jews are members of, or adherents to, a 'religion' demonstrates a viewpoint which is seriously inaccurate.  In the case of Israel, Jews are an islamophobic military/political nationality.  Jews are also identified as an ethnic culture, as a social class, as an economic union, and/or as a society with a genetic commonality.  Being a Jew can identify someone as a supporter of the idea of a birthright, as an individual with an ethnic or cultural supremacy based on one's birthright.  To be opposed to any of these identifies a person as antisemitic.  Virtually no one is opposed to the Jewish religion, but it is very common for one to be opposed to any or all of the other forms of Jewishness which I have mentioned.

       I have not read that.  I am trained as a Social/Cultural Anthropologist.  My interest and field of study deals with why groups of people behave the way they do and what the universal traits of behavior may be.  One of my areas of focus is the behavioral dynamics of people who regard themselves as Jews.

       It's actually really smart and everyone should do it. Especially when it comes to evil religions such as Judaism which proclaims the Jews to be god's chosen people superior to all others and endorses total genocide of the enemies of Jews.

       I mean regardless of whether you classify it as an ethnicity, language group,  religion,  etc...the term today is widely accepted in its meaning and association with a well-defined group of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need to even believe in the holocaust to understand that making generalized judgments on an entire group of people based on the actions of a handful of individuals who are associated with said group is just a hallmark of ignorance, not to mention being logically flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no different than labeling all muslims terrorists, or Hillary Clinton calling black, inner city youth "super predators". Not only does it prevent any sort of rational discussion from taking place, it just makes you seem dumb. People (including jews) are individuals, and should be treated as such on an individual basis. To judge them as a group based on one commonality is just silly.
      </p>

       You're no better than Netanyahu using the label of antisemitism to neutralize political criticism of Israel. Do you hate bankers? Do you hate the Israeli Zionist movement? You can't actually believe that all Jews around the world are participating in a grand conspiracy to control humanity...,can you?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your specific beef that makes you think antisemitism is a defensible stance to have?

       Because I'm a human being that is aware of what's happening in the world. That, and when your Jewish people are avowed to end white european-ness, I'll be the voice reminding you that 1933 can happen again, and we've learned a lot from where others failed.

       Again, Jews aren't ending white European-ness...even If we take at face value that someone is trying to do that, it's a group of individuals (some of whom may be jewish)...not Jews. In that regard, being antisemitic just immediately discredits you.

       Also your whole stance is coming from a presupposition of white European superiority, which is inherently racist in it of itself.

       Where is the supremacy in what I say? I'll grant you I feel we are different, but not necessarily superior. Though, why does every color of the human rainbow dream of a western land?
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is that no one has a right to have access to white people and what they create. It is a privilege and we're revoking it.

       Lol dude...everybody dreams of western life because white, western countries have been raping the rest of the globe for centuries, robbing poor countries of their land, their freedom, and their vital resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of these countless atrocities,  the developing world has been left behind in squalor while the western nations who have benefited from this unrelenting exploitation have reaped the benefit of enhanced development by profiting off these stolen assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The colors of the rainbow" as you put it are irrelevant,  the current state of affairs where white westerners seem to be flourishing relative to other races has nothing to do with race itself, and everything to do with the fact that they've been the ones who have benefited from centuries of exploitation....everybody wants that lifestyle because its inherently built off the misery of those who currently don't have that lifestyle...not because of "white European accomplishments". Your greatest accomplishments in advancing your society have largely been atrocities....its not something to be proud of haha

       The term is meaningless. It's just used to get people to backpedal and defend themselves instead of further the argument. So I'm an antisemite, because then we can just agree on that point and move on.

       I'm just saying, there's a place in the world where I don't care what they do to their kids. That place, Israel, not Denmark. If the Danes want to outlaw the practice, who is to stop them, especially members of a hostile, foreign tribal religion.

       There is very little that is as fucked up as cutting a baby to look sexy for mommy. That being said, it's more practical to advocate against infant mutilation than to advocate against the preference, convincing adults to stop doing it to themselves is not as urgent.

       Think of it like a BDS movement. We can't stop fools from abusing their children, but we can change the culture to discourage parents from abusing their children in that way. If you know a parent who is unsure of what to do with regards to a baby, we should ABSOLUTELY tell them that genital mutilation is abhorrent and we should shame them if they want to force that on their baby over their own personal aesthetic opinions on the appearance.

       There is no respectable trait inherent in being born with a vagina.  Being a woman does not garner you actual respect.  If you are female and believe that you are respected for being female you are retarded.

       Women (as a class of people) do not "deserve" respect.  They, like all others, have to show that they are worthy of respect.  Your problem is that you are conflating disrespect with not respecting someone.  It's a result of your indoctrination.  Also I'm not your fucking mate.  I doubt you'll ever get a mate.

       I am communicating.  Just because it's something you don't agree with doesn't mean you are justified in sticking your cheeto covered fingers in your ears, screaming la la la like a child and praying to your god "equality".

       If you actually listened to people with differing points of view (communicating) then you might grow as an individual.

       It was a joke.  It's a common theme among people who espouse non politically correct opinions (as I have been) that Jewish people are attempting to destroy many of the traditions that are the foundation of western cultures (such as free speech, etc) as some sort of misguided self defense mechanism.  It may be true.  I would say that the idea probably comes from organisations such as the ADL which advocate for "hate speech" laws in order to obfuscate actual criticisms of Jewish culture under the guise of antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an attempt at self deprecating humor.

       The holocaust is entirely overblown in my opinion.  6 million jews allegedly died as a result of the "Burnt Offering" (what holocaust means in Hebrew) and as a result Jewish special interests around the world conspired to murder 33 million German civilians by firebombing, disease and intentional starvation.  I am pretty sure I know who the real monsters in WWII were.

       The Allies did the same exact thing to the Germans during and after the war.  In fact, they did far worse.  Death camps, gang rape, torture and forced starvation of MILLIONS of people.  Far more German civilians died than Jews.

       You just ignore the fact that it's literally impossible that 750,000 people could have died at Treblinka while also ignoring the fact that record from the time show that hundreds of thousands if not millions of Germans died at Rhine meadows.  Fine, you know what, believe the historical records that back up your preconceived world view and ignore everything else.  You sure are smart!

       I am genuinely curious about this preference as it doesn't seem very common here in Australia. Is it mostly a preference with US women? I have had two partners and neither were mutilated. It never seemed to be an issue for them. Do these women just think natural cocks are ugly or is it more about hygiene?

       Cut and you'll never convince me to say that (/s)

      <p>
       Its weird though, the official reason that cutting happens? For hygiene and for looks, what they say around here
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its so the first trauma experienced by a baby will determine attitude later. I could imagine cutting a puppies ear lobes off would make a fucked up dog. So what is the reason for this? You put a ring in a cows nose to control it

       First of all tons of non-jews get circumcised...so to say this is a "Jewish movement" is inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, there are established benefits to being circumcised (such as a far lower incidence of infection and squamous cell carcinoma of the penis). Circumcision dates back as a tradition to desert inhabitants who realized that cutting away the foreskin reduced infection in a time before antibiotics. It's no different than the reason Jews and muslims don't eat pork...trichanosis was previously rampant in several animals (mainly pigs), and thus the custom was adopted to avoid disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call it mutilation if you want, but unlike females, Male circumcision does not reduce the ability to derive sexual pleasure for sensory input. You can say that it is immoral to take such actions without a babys consent...but the same can be said about anything done to a kid at that age (like vaccines) that are seen to provide positive benefits to children.  That's why we as a society have decided that parents can legally do what they perceive is in the best interest of their children...because they're parents, and they're undertaking the task of raising a child (hopefully for benevolent motives).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, many females inherently prefer cut men, that's nothing to shame or try to change,  it's just preference.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many injustices in this world, I simply don't understand why this would be a cause on which you wish to focus.

       Circumcision is a clearly barbaric practice that should be completely illegal except when medically necessary. This isn't a fucking preference thing... it's permanently deforming a child's genitals.

      <p>
       So having a lair of skin protecting the most sensitive part of a male's body versus it being constantly exposed and rubbing against underwear all day doesn't have any affect on sensitivity, thus sexual pleasure? I have a hard time believing that. Furthermore a percentage of circumcisions are botched with such devastating results as loss of the penis or even death.

       Haha you're exposing more sensitive surfaces which arguably enhances sexual pleasure. As someone who is circumcised,  its entirely unnoticeable when wearing pants, it's not as if it causes any sort of discomfort...and does not cause any change in sensitivity when it comes to intercourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also labeling it mutilation does not change the fact that a preference does exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for calling it barbaric and citing "botched circumcisions"...instead of relying on you opinion let's look at some facts derived from large scale studies of entire populations:
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinical research has found circumcision can safeguard an infant from a number of health complications, most notably urinary tract infections. Kidney damage develops in about half of infants who contract a UTI. The adult lifetime risk for a UTI is approximately 1 in 3 for uncircumcised men. A review of more than than 500 studies, found that circumcision reduces overall risk for HIV transmission in heterosexual men by 60 percent, genital herpes by 30 percent, and cancer-causing strains of HPV by 35 percent. One study of 3400 individuals also showed that circumcision in the first year of life reduced the long term risk of prostate cancer by 15%.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all when compared to the incidence of negative complications from the procedure, studies find on average that the health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks by nearly 100 to 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while you may have the uninformed opinion that this procedure is some barbaric, indefensible act....the actual evidence is very clear that you couldn't be more wrong...there is HUGE benefit to getting it done compared to risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, seeing as how you've never experienced it...I can tell you the sex is still fantastic, and most women I meet actually prefer it to uncut penises.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with being a "Jewish thing", and everything to do with being a positive public health measure. Given the choice now, I would absolutely have it done again....you need to gain some actual perspective on this issue instead of just spewing your opinion that's clearly drenched in racial bias and ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every way that you look at it...you're wrong.

       Exposing "more sensitive surfaces" constantly would lead to reduced sensitivity... How the hell do you know if it is different when it comes to intercourse as a mutilated man? You don't. I never said sex doesn't feel good when mutilated, I just doubt that there isn't a difference in sensitivity just using basic logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the kind of basic logic that says cutting off part off of a baby's dick usually without any anesthesia is barbaric.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a comment above here implies, a preference it may be but it's a mutilation fetish similar to people who are into amputees.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never mentioned anything about it being a Jewish thing and yet you claim I am spewing anti-semetic ignorance.

       My comment about antisemitism was related to your original statement that were it not a Jewish custom it would already be abolished...
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your statement about sensitivity....you're right in the regard that neither of us will ever know which way feels more pleasurable,  but your assumption is that chronically exposing those areas leads to desensitization and discomfort. I've discredited your discomfort argument...and as for desensitization, while it may expose sensitive areas...those areas are more exposed during intercourse when circumcised which just as likely provides physiological enhancement that negates your assumption....also sexual pleasure is derived from many different regions other than the tip....so any theoretical argument about physiology you want to make is entirely pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       As those studies I showed you point out...the risk of negative outcomes is much lower than 1%, and the benefits far outweigh the risks...also many circumcisions are done with alcohol or other anesthetics...so you're wrong there too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your final point about comparing the general female preference to circumcised men to "amputee fetish" is just laughable....you're implying that the majority of western women have the same fetish for disfigurement?? Doesn't seem likely....the more rational answer is that a circumcision is simply more visually appealing than an uncut penis and thus generates a clear preference in women. Though I am heterosexual, I agree with that sentiment...I don't have a fetish for disfigurement, I just generally think that uncircumcised members are very visually unappealing....the entire porn industry agrees with me too...they simply put out material based on what the consumer wants (unless you're implying that there is some grand pornographic conspiracy to normalize circumcision). In that regard the preference is clear, the health benefits are clear, and you really have no ground to stand on anymore haha

       Lol, that statement was merely meant to refute the ludicrous claim that the reason women clearly prefer cut men is that they have some sort of disfigurement fetish akin to amputees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that, pornography is an accurate representation of what most people are into, and to claim that the vast majority of women have some sort of fetish with disfigurement (as representative of the overall contents of most porn) is just silly.
      </p>

       But yeah, use irrelevant personal attacks to avoid addressing my main point which was the blatantly obvious public health benefits of this procedure...really makes me see your viewpoint better.

       Your narcissism is making you delusional if you think I care whether you see my viewpoint better; you're not here to listen or be persuaded, you're here to propagandize. My comment was for others who may be on the fence about this issue.

       But
       <strong>
        why
       </strong>
       would virtually all males in the US be circumcized? It’s not the case in Europe, or Christian countries in general. I know Italy is mostly Catholic, I didn’t know the US was mostly Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       During WW2 In Europe Jews were recognized by the circumcision. I would probably
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       want everyone to partake in the same barbaric ritual mutilation as me, if I was suffering from a neurotic persecution complex.

       Lol the US isn't mostly Jewish (not sure if that was sarcastic)
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is mostly circumcised because we have general healthcare guidelines ,(some good, some bad) that most people follow..so when the American society of pediatrics recommends it, most people do it (like vaccines). Again, you see it as barbaric,  but there are numerous health benefits to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel persecuted at all, nor neurotic about it...I think its laughable that so many (mostly blatantly racist) people on here are so concerned with ending the practice...I merely wanted to contribute to the conversation some facts that most of these people were clearly unaware of.

       Ok, you aren’t aware of why US doctors recommend (and love to practice) such a barbaric ritual... that’s OK. I would hint it has to do with the “culture” dominating the profession.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you should know there aren’t any “health benefits”.. that is, if you know minimum hygiene. We aren’t living in the fucking 11th century.. but indeed the barbarians who mutilate their newborns certainly seem to be stuck there.

       Sure..60% lower risk of transmitting HIV for heterosexual males, 15% reduction in prostate cancer risk, far fewer UTIs, far less kidney damage, basically decreases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis to 0, and many more.....theres definitely no health benefits to having the procedure done,  it's all because a bunch of Jewish doctors want to cut our foreskins off for their evil plan to dominate the world.

       I'm not very into the Jewish conspiracies, but the topic of circumcision sparked an idea recently.... Feel free to correct anything I am definitely wrong about.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my understanding the Jewish faith is a chauvinistic society that treats women as inferior people. Circumcision decreases sensitivity which requires more action to reach orgasm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering if the point is to have men be extra hard on their subservient wife in bed to reduce the spiritual connection during sex and further drive a wedge between the sexes in this case.

       History is largely patriarchal or chauvinistic almost across the board don't you think? That being said, I'm circumsized and if I was any more sensitive I'd never be able to pleasure a woman from standard intercourse alone. So while your theory may have a point you have to consider the opposite as well. Maybe they did it to give more lasting pleasure to their female companions and increase the chance of providing an orgasm. It's quite an "evolutionary" advantage if u think about it like that.

       Forgive me for intruding into this thread with an off topic post. It made me think of an odd piece of web debris that I stumbled on and archived, so I'm posting it to 'jew related threads' in the hopes of gaining further insight into it. Please note that I am not a bigot. I go to a lovely Jewish restaurant once a week because it is awesome and the operators are wonderful people. Thanks for reading and have a great day!

       - A 'Jew' is not a 'Judite'. Judites are of the tribe of Judah and practice Judaism. They are 'Ju's' not Jews. A 'Jew' is a gnostic priest. 'Israel' is a Zionist 'Judaic' state, not a 'Jewish' state. The Druidic priests of Ireland took the name from the Irish 'Yew' tree. The letter 'J' replaces the Hebrew 'Yod' or 'Y' in English. The original Jews (Yews) were 'Aryans' (Ireland, Iryland, Aryland Airyland or 'Aryans'). 'Zionists' are not Jews. Talmudic 'Ashkenazi' (AskaNazi) Ju's and Khazarian converts to Judaism are not Jews. The Hyksos tribes of Canaan who were the Pharonic rulers of lower Egypt plagurized the name 'Jew' and adapted their good name to the tribe of Judah after they revolted against upper Egypt with their Pharaoh 'god' Akhenaton in the 2'nd century BC. Akhenaton became the Son of 'Aton' (tetragrammaton or four measures of ATON) the Sun Disk or 'Yahweh' (Jehovah) in the Judaic Torah. This is the source of the false doctrine of monotheism and patriarchy which has been an abomination of reality for over 2,000 years. The Bible refers to them as "Fake" Jews in Revelations..."Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet..." Revelation 3:9 KJV JC. Today the Zionist Ju's run the World through banking, religion, media, politics and duel citizenship in America and other countries. They are in league with the Vatican cult of Saturn and the British Crown in the tiny city state of the 'City of London' financial district aka "Baby London" or 'Babylon the Great', the financial Capital of the World to establish a Zionist-Communist-Fascist New World Order through the United Nations...There are less than 150,000 Jews on the planet. Being "Jewish" does not make one a Jew, but Jew "like". Yeshua ben Yoseph ("jesus") was a Jew and a 'Christ' who the Ju's and the Romans crucified. Rome has become the 'British-American' or 'Anglo-American Empire'. The 144,000 Jews in the Bible are the 'anti-Christ' or 'Body of Christ'. The Vatican cult and the Society of "Jesus" (Jesuits) represent the false Christ whom they call "Jesus". "Jesus" = 'Yesus' or Yes us, the 144,000. The 'Tetragrammaton' is the 'Tetragram of Ra' or YHWH YaHuWeHe(r) or YaHu (God) We He(r), the 144,000 Gods and Goddesses and 'Christs'... -

       as a circumcised american i will always be against taking knives to babies and i feel i have earned the right to say so and i will exercise this right
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not glad im circumcised, quite the contrary i take it as an assault on my person and i am not in a forgiving mood about it, or the mountain of other offenses the state of israel has made against my country
      </p>
      <p>
       jewish people have a problem, they can't call other people who perform genital mutilation of infants barbaric without bringing attention on themselves, and they can't allow the laws to change without admitting that they are responsible for committing this atrocity billions of times over
      </p>
      <p>
       of all the practices taking a knife to a baby penis is the most revolting and i find it just as revolting as removal of the clitoris at infancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       i will mute anyone who even tries to argue that i am wrong, i simply don't care about the 'health benefits' or want to hear any more hasbara.
      </p>
      <p>
       everyone who mutilates baby genitals is a cultish psychopath, let the cards fall where they may.

       Right on. There was a discussion around this subject a while ago. I particularly remember it because some woman started arguing for it and when a bunch of guys expressed that it’s a man’s (having it done in adulthood. I actually have a cousin that went through this) or a parent’s decision, then she started saying that us guys were “verbally assaulting her” because we didn’t agree with her. Nobody actually made any personal attacks or aggressive comments. It was just ridiculous.

       I was commenting against the barbaric and endemic genital mutilation of newborn males in a mainstream sub (worldnews pretty sure), and someone showed up and started talking about the botched circumcision he had as a baby, and how that left him handicapped. The judeophiliacs of that thread mocked and demeaned him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it’s only 1%, it’s still thousands of young boys that are thus gravely mutilated every year. And that’s the order of magnitude for clinical circumcisions (every medical procedure involves risk and error). Don’t get me started on

       Maybe there is a link between the 'me first' attitude of America (in general) and the penis mutilation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean. The US is the most 'capitalist' place in the world, capitalism is all about 'me first and fuck the rest', it's basically a license to fuck over everybody (i.e. I have money so I am allowed to use you as a slave and you have little real choice). At the same time the US is the only country doing these mass mutilations. 
Also the jews are traditionally seen as 'moneygrubbing' for a reason (i.e. very capitalist).

       Circumcision is a clearly barbaric practice that should be completely illegal except when medically necessary. This isn't a fucking preference thing... it's permanently deforming a child's genitals.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Male circumcision does not reduce the ability to derive sexual pleasure for sensory input
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So having a lair of skin protecting the most sensitive part of a male's body versus it being constantly exposed and rubbing against underwear all day doesn't have any affect on sensitivity, thus sexual pleasure? I have a hard time believing that. Furthermore a percentage of circumcisions are botched with such devastating results as loss of the penis or even death.

       Exposing "more sensitive surfaces" constantly would lead to reduced sensitivity... How the hell do you know if it is different when it comes to intercourse as a mutilated man? You don't. I never said sex doesn't feel good when mutilated, I just doubt that there isn't a difference in sensitivity just using basic logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the kind of basic logic that says cutting off part off of a baby's dick usually without any anesthesia is barbaric.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a comment above here implies, a preference it may be but it's a mutilation fetish similar to people who are into amputees.

       As far as I'm concerned this blog post is pretty much the final word on circumcision, although she did follow it up with a second post later.

        Also, seeing as how you've never experienced it...I can tell you the sex is still fantastic, and most women I meet actually prefer it to uncut penises

       You are so completely in denial.  it is YOU who have never experienced sex with a uncut natural penis.

       You are like the battered wife defending the abusive husband. Your parents were ignorant or religious fanatics so deal with that, go see a psychologist.

       Here is however a chapter from Voltaire’s encyclopedia, the masterpiece
       <em>
        The Philosophical Dictionnary
       </em>
       . Note this chapter is mysteriously absent from all modern editions, including in French.

       But
       <strong>
        why
       </strong>
       would virtually all males in the US be circumcized? It’s not the case in Europe, or Christian countries in general. I know Italy is mostly Catholic, I didn’t know the US was mostly Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       During WW2 In Europe Jews were recognized by the circumcision. I would probably
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       want everyone to partake in the same barbaric ritual mutilation as me, if I was suffering from a neurotic persecution complex.
