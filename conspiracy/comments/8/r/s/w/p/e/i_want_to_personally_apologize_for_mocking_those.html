       not at all and when i explain why its relevant to what you said you'll probably see why. the plot revolves around a drug dealer delibrately poisoning her own product to extort heads of state into legalizing drugs, but oh ho the president decides "fuck those druggies" and imprisons them in ad hoc interment camps full of cells in sports stadiums to let them all die so that he can "be the president that won the war on drugs". spoiler after the good guys win, the president is exposed and the cure administered, everyone just calmly, happily strolls out of their illegal and unconstitutional detainment and noone sues the government or their mindless agents who were just following orders. so you know, happy ending.

       Yet internally you probably still hold disdain for those who talk about other theories you
       <strong>
        feel
       </strong>
       are unlikely.  Conspiracy theorists are used to this and don't need to be apologized to.  We we're mocked when we said the government was recording all our phone calls, we we're mocked when the cellular GPS mandate came out and we said the government was recording all our movements, we were mocked when we said microphones were always listening and web cams were always watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are still mocked for insisting that there is a shadow government with global aspirations.  We are still mocked for insisting there is a global elite pedophile ring.  The later exists to ensure silence about the former.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will continue to be mocked as we present theories to explain the observations we make.  Admittedly a theory is always 100% on target, with limited information you're always going to form a distorted picture.  But a distorted picture, if allowed to be discussed and refined will gain clarity and focus the closer those observers get to the target.  That distorted picture gets us closer, the whining and bitching from outsiders is intended to stop the progression.  The race baiters and character assassination is to shut down the refinement by associating individuals and the theories they present with offensive regressive topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this one topic will allow you to see with a little more clarity, other topics you still mock.

       What good does admitting we we're right do about this one thing do after the MSM has already capitulated and run the story?
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger issue is mocking people because the establishment doesn't admit something is true yet.  After the fact is nice but worthless.  A step in the right direction but taken blindly while stumbling around in the dark.

       FYI, Snowden was only one whistleblower out of many.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.”

         "Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany's BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans.

       It’s not illegal to seek asylum in the United States.  Seeking legal asylum shouldn’t mean that your children are sent to concentration camps.  This isn’t controversial.

        Under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 protocol, and adopted into U.S. law, the U.S. must recognize refugees that fear persecution and are not able to get help from their home country.

       Under the law, anyone seeking asylum into the US must be processed to understand whether the asylum application is credible, you can enter the country illegally, but still be in the country legally if you are seeking asylum.  Even if you enter the country illegally, you have one year to request asylum:
       <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum">
        USCIS.gov
       </a>
       .  Essentially, they broke the law to enter the country, but they are legally allowed to be in the country now that they are here.  They are legal immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes things difficult.  It's a loophole.  Asylum seekers are in the country legally, but broke the law to get here.  Under the Obama administration, the initial broken law (entering the country illegally) was treated as a civil offense.  Under the Trump "zero tolerance" policy, the initial broken law is treated as a criminal offense.  Since this is now treated as a criminal offense, they parents need to go to jail while the asylum application is processed.  The government can't send the children back to Mexico (since the children and parents are in the country legally), and there is rarely a guardian in the US... so concentration camps.

       It's a fucked up system.

       Not at all. The literal definition has nothing to do with killing. Your assumption is most likely based off the connotational meaning when used in context of WWII camps. Everyone who is claiming they are not concentration camps has never googled "define concentration camp". Might just enlighten you to the rhetorical meaning which many colloquially assume is genocide or death camps. A concentration camp can lead to death, but not necessarily.

       They are calling them "Detention Centers" in Europe where those refugees are being held in far, far, far worse conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling them Concentration Camps is a insult to anyone actually aggrieved or tortured and makes the person calling [this]() a "Concentration Camp" a complete piece of shit.

       They are in the minds of anti-trump fanatics.  These camps were established by Obama and nobody cared.  Now that Trump inherited them... Concentration camps/ literally Hitler.

       I think trumpa immigration policy has made this problem much worse. However, If you read above someone posted the definition of concentration camp and this seems to fit pretty well regardless of who started them.

       This kills me someone some time back makes up a conspiracy theory that later actually happens does not justify that original ct.  There were no such things as FEMA death camps or Walmart concentration centers until the Trump administration decided to house detainees for deportation.  We have an actual out of control administration mistreating people this is big news and does not justify conspiracies.

        Jaime Garcia, the shelter’s program director, told reporters on the tour: "All the kids have been able to talk to their parents."

        They were shown a room with pool tables and children playing computer football games. Some watched the film Moana dubbed into Spanish.

        Some were being taught in temporary classrooms.

       This does not sound like a concentration camp to me.

      <p>
       Im not a Trump supporter but people are completely over reacting to this.  How else do you deter people from illegal boarder crossing, which is horrible for the economy.  Before they made the current law, if you got caught you simply got sent to imigration services and brought back to Mexico basically.  So you could just keep attempting to illegally enter the country with no real reprecussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If folks don't want to be separated from their children, just don't try to cross the border illegally.

       im kind of neutral on him honestly, he does a lot of dumb shit but that was expected. he does get a lot of shit for things hes not reponsible for, like this actually. i may be wrong but this whole system was started long before trump and the situation now was overseen by obama for at least his second term, but hey its all trumps fault...

       I remember when my dad went to prison for using drugs, and I got to spend every day with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except no, I didn't. He committed a crime and I was put into foster care. I didn't have any contact with my dad for like 6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel for these people trying to leave their country to come to America, given their situation I'd probably do the same, but a crime is a crime. Illegally crossing a border is no less a crime than illegally ingesting a substance. And honestly, these kids have it decent comparatively. They could have been sent back to their country alone without family, or put in a real Nazi Germany or North Korean concentration camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparatively, I'd rather have their childhood than my own.

       Yeah, the propaganda includes many presidents. It's a broad indoctrination plan, they're not just trying to get them to love Trump alone.

       It is NOT his intention to separate kids from parents. What's in it for him??  Trump out of anyone in D.C. cares MOST about people and this country.

       Liberal ideology does not square with Trump's actions. You're either a liar or misinformed about what a liberal is. Liberals oppose human rights violations. Liberals aren't xenophobic. Liberals don't praise or salute dictators.

       "Concentration camps are OK as long as the prisoners held without due process are treated relatively well." They're political prisoners, locked up due to their nationality, and they're denied constitutional rights and due process, but I'm supposed to be OK with it just because the political prisoners arent being tortured or killed or something? You're gross.

       They are being held legally and safely because their parents decided to break the law. If we sent them back to their country, which we could they would be trafficked/kidnapped almost instantly, but by all means keep virtue signalling to make yourself feel better sitting on your couch eating cheetos.

       If one was going to hide FEMA camps in plain sight, Wal-Marts are a good candidate.  Placed on major thoroughfares and everyone knows where the nearest one is.  Alot of people know someone who has worked at one.  Alot of psychological barriers to obeying when people are told
       <strong>
        <em>
         "report to the nearest Wal-Mart for citizenship processing"
        </em>
       </strong>
       are already broken.  Wal-Marts all have fairly standard architectural design so troops/guards can learn a new post earlier.

       Good on you for admitting you shouldn’t have mocked people.  However, my understanding of the facts is that it is in no way a concentration camp.  At most it’s a processing center.  Also, the Walmart concentration camp people said the camps were for US.  Clearly, they are not for us.

       not at all and when i explain why its relevant to what you said you'll probably see why. the plot revolves around a drug dealer delibrately poisoning her own product to extort heads of state into legalizing drugs, but oh ho the president decides "fuck those druggies" and imprisons them in ad hoc interment camps full of cells in sports stadiums to let them all die so that he can "be the president that won the war on drugs". spoiler after the good guys win, the president is exposed and the cure administered, everyone just calmly, happily strolls out of their illegal and unconstitutional detainment and noone sues the government or their mindless agents who were just following orders. so you know, happy ending.

       Yes there were centers for minors that came without parents but it's Trump's policy to seperate children from their families, no matter how much he blames the Democrats.

       There are some issues I don't agree with when it comes to Trump but let me tell ya.... this whiny hateful insidious obnoxious ad nauseam side of many of you liberal-dipped dems,  is more embarrassing for this country then Trump could ever be.

       The parents are the ones charged with a crime.
