Now resents having to do physical labor ( overpaid by everybody who indulges him.)

Never indulged in drinking or drugging because I had no talent, draining my parents for hundreds of thousands of dollars, or endangering people and animals on the road with numerous DUIs. </p>

<p>What’s your point? How is life in your parents’ basement going for you? Why do you accept those conditions and fail to get yourself in gear? A girl rejected you in the seventh grade so you need thirty years of free therapy, paid for by your parents? Just wondering!</p>

<p>I went to college becuase literally every single adult I knew or talked to at 18 told me to. Thats what you do. Thats how you get a good job to make money and have a family. Well after 25k in debt, I was dropped onto the “work force” I had been working full time while going to school. But at a grocery store, cooking. So the only thing on my resume was food! Took my business manaemt degree into being an exec chef. Took my 6 years as a cook. The pay was shit, had nothing technically to do with my degree. So I moved and tried a trade skill.</p>

<p>The biggest part people miss, and your post with acting like people who went through what I did are entitled or privileged is your own insecurities, I assume you are not a plumber or electrician either? Probably work a dead end job and never tried for a degree? </p>

<p>All humans are inherently lazy and what things for free, the more of us there are the less that can happen. There is no clear answer to success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe in “overeducatuon”, which isn’t even a word, I think you’re going a little overboard. “Those idiots. Cramming their brains to capacity with chemistry, history, and philosophy”. Do you realize how ridiculous that notion sounds? Also, Marx was actually a huge fan of capitalism (read Das Kapital) and I believe he would be ashamed of the bullshit pixie stick agenda he is being used to propagate today. The word ‘Marxist’ today is used as loosely as ‘conservative’. If you’re looking for people to shake a stick at, Jaques Derrida and Michel Foucault. Both are advocates of the cultural and moral relativism that bothers a lot of folk (including me to an extent). I’ve had professors who were self professed marxists and far left hacks. They usually got laughed at for being too ‘woke’. The people who buy into it are delusional from the get go. College will give you a nuanced awareness of social issues, but, perhaps not the right tools or methodology to fix them. This sub keeps trickling down the slippery slope towards 1984 blindness. If ‘they’, whoever ‘they’ are, can get artisans (carpenters, masons, electricians, etc.) and college graduates to despise each other I’d say they’re already winning. Both camps are already frequently divided against party lines. We’re stronger together. These narratives are divisive, that’s the end goal. Miss when this sub valued education and valued other perspectives. Now it seems like more and more posts are devaluing education. A liberal arts education refers to classical liberalism, which American and western ideals are seated upon. The idea that all college educated people think honest working folk (like my father, a contractor) are idiots is absurd. Most of those ‘idiots’ are their parents. And, if you believe that, it seems that you’re already buying in. Always ignorant people out there. Don’t be one. We’re all equally worthless in the eyes of those spinning these narratives. </p>

Keep in mind higher education is mostly a scam to enslave ppl in debt.  I took tennis in college.  I paid more for my education than was necessary in part because the university pays someone to take adults to a tennis court to teach them the rules &amp; how to play.  There is a ton of things that cpuld be eliminated to make college cheaper but they need these fluff classes so its easier to graduate ppl &amp; keep the very profitable scam going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious. If Higher Education is a form of scam and debt-enslavement in your opinion, how do you rationalise countries such as mine (Scotland) where higher education university degrees are free for everyone? The opportunity for higher education in my country&#39;s opinion is practically a <em>human right</em> and is open to anyone who is academically capable of it. It has ZERO to do with who can pay, and is open to people of all privilege. I went to one of the worst public (called state-run here) schools in my country, grew up so poor we couldn&#39;t afford a television, yet went to one of the most prestigious schools in the country to study Medicine. At zero cost to myself. </p>

<p>Is that still a scam? Am I <em>scared</em> of manual labour?</p>

<p>It sounds a lot frankly like you&#39;re bitter towards people who go to get a university degree and degrading them because they <em>don&#39;t</em> want a vocational or manual career like being a plumber or electrician. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re scared of those types of careers, it&#39;s that they&#39;re either not interested in them at all, or would find other types of life mind-numbing. Not everybody is the bloody same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I am asking is if university is a debt enslavement scheme entirely and the value of the degree is questionable to you, how do you make that same argument in the case where it is free and doesn&#39;t leave you with thousands of pounds/dollars of debt, like here? </p>

<p>I can understand your opinion as it relates to the US, but university education is just as valid here as there, but here your argument falls short due to that issue. Either you think it&#39;s worthless or not. Without the debt from it here, it actually improves lives, not ruins them in the same system, just with different financial aspects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are arguing semantics here &amp; it all depends how i am defining worthless &amp; how you are defining it.  Many degrees in the US are completely worthless... meaning they have no monetary value post-grad.  You’ve just put yourself into debt in many instaces for knowledge you can get for free on the internet.  If you get a gender studies degree that is your fault you went 40-50K in debt to obtain a degree that has no monetary value.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worthless in what regard? Finding a job?  That is a narrow filter to view such a historically impactful institution as academia. </p>

<p>Much of education is not designed to give someone gainful employment but rather to give them a more thorough understanding of the world around them. This is true from grade school through grad school. In a greater cultural sense, degrees such as art and philosophy are just as important to our species&#39; self-empowerment as physics and computer science. </p>

<p>It&#39;s mostly because the economy sucks and students are saddled with a ton of debt that people are now rebelling against education. And since we&#39;re in a Conspiracy subreddit, I should note that it would be in the best interests of the elite to make poor people scared of getting an education. Historically the more educated that poor people are the less the elite can exploit them. If gaining education were not a financial detriment then I&#39;m sure more people would go to school at least to pursue their interests by auditing various classes. And if it were not a long term financial boon then there would still be a huge social benefit to having people get higher education. America should encourage education as much as possible and work to be more like first world nations where obtaining it does not become a financial burden for the student.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on man. Way to state the obvious but that wasn&#39;t your OP.  You basically said people who&#39;ve gone through the education system shouldn&#39;t get a good job. What if they worked really fucking hard? What if they weren&#39;t privileged to begin with? Should they not get a good job then? What do you think they&#39;re doing while they&#39;re in education for however many years? Strictly having fun? Not working at all? Education is hard. Ask a stupid person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you pay to live in a cinder block dorm &amp; expand your mind w/ weed/alcohol/etc?  Real fucking hard.  I got the college experience for half the price as others because i lived off campus &amp; worked to pay rent so i didnt have go between semesters.  I didnt get to party as much as everyone else because of this but i dpnt bitch about the debt i incurred for this reason at the same time.  College is easy.  Some degrees are harder than others.  Some classes are harder than others.  In the US many go to college to delay becoming an adult.  Then they are surprised when they struggle after graduating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naturally, when you go to school for a worthwhile career, you&#39;re going to assume you&#39;ll get a job related to your education. While in school, I worked as a plumber and a line cook. That experience didn&#39;t mean much to my manager. What she did like was the experience I gained in school and how it was written on my resume to translate into the job I have now. Also, it helps to have decent interpersonal skills. </p>
