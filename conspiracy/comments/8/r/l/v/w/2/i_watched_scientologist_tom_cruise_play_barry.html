<p>Hollywood has made tons of TV and film about real and fake conspiracies.  UFO/alien movies alone have done more to prop of the conspiracy than all the &#39;researchers&#39; combined.  Bigfoot, mind control, government fuckery, political fuckery, CIA, FBI...</p>

<p>The thing you have to be careful of is how many of your favorite conspiracies are propped up by folks with an agenda (money, politics, ideology). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another example of this happenung is a film called American Ultra. It&#39;s based on the CIA&#39;s unethical Project MKUltra. It&#39;s a comedy film that makes light of the fact that the US government used drugs and torture to attempt to mind control people. </p>

<p>American Ultra came out in 2015. American Made came out in 2017. Both suggest that these criminal enterprises are especially <em>American</em>. I think that&#39;s interesting. And I&#39;d agree, drug smuggling, torture, definitely very American. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MKUltra is pretty extreme. It&#39;s kind of unique. USA isn&#39;t the only entity that would torture, obviously, but I don&#39;t think many of them are brainwashing people with drugs and torture in order to turn them into amazing sleeper-cell assassins. Because that&#39;s what happens to the protagonist in American Ultra, that&#39;s allegedly what happened with Project MKUltra. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson is also about MK Ultra and Gibson is portrayed as a tin foil hat wearing conspiracy theorist who finds out that he’s not as crazy as he thought.</p>

<p>I watched it when I was younger but most of it went right over my head but I watched it again now that I’m into conspiracies and the movie made a lot more sense.</p>

<p>If you haven’t seen it in awhile, I recommend checking it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make it seem like doing shady shit is cool as long as it&#39;s with the CIA.  Think of recent CIA agents portrayed.  Think of Central Intelligence, or to some degree, Agent Coulson from Shield.  They are a quasi CIA type organization.  There&#39;s another one I saw recently that portrayed the CIA agent as a quirky, funny, clueless guy just there as comic relief, and just like Coulson, they will usually end up getting hurt or die, sympathetically.  I just can&#39;t remember what it was.  Maybe in the newest Avengers or something like that.</p>
