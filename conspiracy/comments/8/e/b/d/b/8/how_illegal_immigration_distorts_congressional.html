        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From Interview with Kris Kobach, Secretary of State Kansas</p>

<p>&quot;The reason you need to know if a person is a citizen or not is because, right now, we’re apportioning congressional districts just by the number of warm bodies in that district. Citizen, noncitizen, legal alien, illegal alien, they’re all counted the same, which is not how our system was designed. That is not what the founding fathers intended.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so, as a result, you have places in California where half the district almost is illegal aliens and that person is getting the same representative, one representative for about 710,000 people, as someone in a district elsewhere in the country where all of those people in that district are citizens.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And it means that the 300,000 or so people who are eligible to vote in the district with all the illegal aliens, they have twice as much voting power. They have a representative in Congress for half the number of people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, it grossly distorts representation in Congress. It means that states that encourage illegal immigration, like California, get more representatives in Congress, get more electoral votes, and their voters get more voting power than the rest of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If Congress is going to fix this problem, which I believe they should and they must, they at least have to have the starting information which is how many of the people in each state are citizens and how many people are not.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I credit income tax (in part) for an educated workforce and a massive investment in infrastructure during the first half of the century.  I credit the free market in capitalizing off of these government funded services to reduce poverty.   </p>

<p>Back to my edit:    </p>

<p>So the federal government spends about $12,000 on average per person (including children). So, you need to make around $75,000 for each person in your family to be considered “productive.” So a family of four needs an income of about $300,000 to reimburse the federal government with their federal income tax. So anyone making less isn’t “productive.” Correct?</p>

<p>I think that is tied to the country being 400% richer in 1990 than in 1900. But I give zero credit to the income tax there.</p>

<p>In fact from your link:</p>

<p>A good way to determine how the poor fare in the free market is to examine how the standard of living of the poor has changed over time. One factor to consider is real income. Between 1900 and 1990, the growth in real (inflation-adjusted) income—generated by the free market—was enormous: Real income in 1990 was 15 times greater than it was in 1900. Real per capita income was over four and one-half times greater in 1990 than in 1900.</p>

<p>Another important measure of income is real money earnings from employment. Real earnings were almost four times greater in 1990 than in 1900. But statistics on real earnings mask significant changes in work hours and the way workers are compensated. In 1900 nonfarm workers toiled 60 hours a week; by 1990 they worked 39.3 hours a week, a decrease of over one-third. Moreover, in 1900 workers received almost all of their compensation in wages; by 1990 workers received nonwage benefits accounting for almost 40 percent of their total compensation. That means an hour of work in 1990 paid well over eight times what it did in 1900.</p>

<p>Still, one might argue that real per capita income and money earnings tell us little about the status of the poor. Did the poor share in the economy’s growth?</p>

<p>Since real income in the United States has increased, we know that the real income of the poor has increased if the share of income received by the poor is stable or increasing. In 1900, the poorest 20 percent of income earners received 4.8 percent of the nation’s income; in 1990, they collected 4.6 percent. Thus, the real incomes of the poor have risen significantly this century.</p>

<p>---The income tax rightly receives none of the credit. </p>

<p>How you calculate it:    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democratic do not love illegal immigrants because they are used for union busting and wage suppression.  There are allegedly 10 or so million, Trump is not deporting all those illegals working in the meat cutting, pork processing or chicken processing plants or the ones doing all the cleaning and serving etc. </p>

<p>He is running a terrorist camp;aign against them.  GEt a lot of news coverage about the few he deports to keep all those millions scared and submissive while they are subjected to dangerous low paying work.  </p>

<p>And I wonder why you don&#39;t see how they are used to harm you. </p>

<p>Democratic and or liberals say they are human and if you want illegal immigrants stopped, stop the employers who hire them.  </p>

<p>If you say I love illegal immigrants, are you saying you love the employers of those illegal immigrants more? </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t watch that long and I don&#39;t believe it. &quot;Mexican Ambassador?&quot;  Is it the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico or the Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. if the former, he is a Trump appointee and they are not noted for intellectual or knowledge expertise on any subject. But appointed because he will do and say what the Kochnetwork tells him to say. </p>

<p>We have legal resident Mexicans who also still send money home.<br/>

the number of people sending money to Mexico is not limited to illegal immigrants. </p>
