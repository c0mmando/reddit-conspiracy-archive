       SS: This will be taken down no doubt because i doubt this is a real submission statement. This sub loves to call itself Open Minded. But do we really know what that means? We all seem to get along when talking about points we agree with, but just try to have a discussion and debate a topic without it devolving into insults and attacks of character. I myself have been terrible for it.

       So many ask to be challenged but shut down real discussion baselessly, others deny any truth but there own. 
Discussion will free your mind, and allow us to reach a greater understanding.

       Even then i wouldn't say thats totally fair to say. Believing in any one part is fine, once your willing to have discussion about opposing beliefs. My biggest issue comes when peoples choose to disregard evidence that presented to them, and use arguments that have almost no backing. I'd love to understand why people can defend a point like that so strongly

       We need to be careful with the term "evidence". People will very often rebut a conspiracy theory, and cite Snopes, or CNN, or the FBI, or Washington Post, and call that "evidence". Which is what makes all of this so confusing and difficult at getting to the truth. You first have to get people to realize that they cannot just blindly trust any source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for arguments. If I make an argument based on historical precedents, steeped in the backstory of the creation of the Federal Reserve, or the Council on Foreign Relations, or CIA operations over the years, it then makes it very hard to explain my arguments when people ask me for "evidence of my claims".
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree that what you said does happen, that's not exactly grounds to dismiss anyone's claims or counter-arguments. Everything must be analyzed individually, which only makes getting to the truth that much more difficult (and most people don't have the time, patience, or drive to find it).

       I do not believe any of the 37 items on the list. I used to believe most if not all of them. Then I started checking the evidence for myself. What I found has shaken me to the core of my miserable soul. How deluded I had been for so long.

       Yeah unfortunately, people even in this sub fall just as easily for all the crowd behaviour that all the other normies end up doing, they just happen to have a more controversial point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this sub really needs is healthy amounts of skepticism.

       And a realization that skepticism doesn't mean "debunking" anyone else's ideas or opinions but rather reserving judgement on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also means not allowing yourself to see any proposition as some either/or situation where if one side can be disproved then the other must be right by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always numerous other possibilities that need to be explored and any true skeptic can live more comfortably without an answer to burning question rather pick a side that they don't have enough solid evidence to actually prove it's the right one.

       yes, which means the OP's claim isn't quite accurate (that's not to say he doesn't understand this and is just miscommunicating).  OP is suggesting that you must decide, but people never have to decide anything until they come to a choice.

       I’m fairly sure they do sit in the basement of a 14th century castle drinking adrenochrome, doing black magick - but I wouldn’t say their lives are easier. Money and power come at a price as well.

       I like to think about that too. What if TBTB are truly just people trying to do the right thing in their minds? It actually makes more sense. I imagine the people pushing for the new one word order are doing so for "the greater good" of humanity. Not selfishness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the only possible way humans will get off this planet is by coming together as one. I also think that will never happen without mass catastrophic which good be either natural , non natural, or not real (false flag). Tbtb are the only ones who could orchestrate this. Are they trying to save us? or kill us?

       Its just a subject where some of my friends growing up have. Or no doubt will, become transgender and the obstacles they faced mentally were largely attributed to outside pressures and stigma... Not a mental illness attributed to orientation and state of existence.

       When it comes to current events, this sub isn't really open minded. It tends to prefer counter narratives simply because they contradict mainstream narratives. All narratives should be viewed with suspicion, and we should accept that we don't really know what's happening on the ground. We can speculate about what happened, but we will only (possibly) come to know the truth further down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot know what goes on in the mind of someone like Trump, Putin, or Assad. Any explanation that seems rational from behind a computer in the relative safety of the first world may not seem so rational to a dictator in the midst of a civil war.

       Yep. I also feel that a good amount of people here sadly started to believe everything is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this isnt helping this sub at all. There are many many conspiracy in all kind of political and financial and sociologic layers but NOT everything is necessary a conspiracy.

       Just look at the death of avicii who was known to be a hardcore alcoholic since his 18th birthday and now somehow its a mix of israel, the deep state, child trafficer and hillary clinton that murdered him.

       I disagree, I say open-mindedness is the ability to
       <em>
        humor
       </em>
       the furthest flung idea, without needing to "decide" or jump to conclusions. It's also understanding that most beliefs are temporary, or works in progress, that the wise thing to do is let ones beliefs evolve over time. Also, that contradictory beliefs can both be valid in different contexts.

       This sub takes in very controversial subjects. What’s the old saying “you can fool some of the people some of the time etc etc ...”. There will always be people who see through the veil. Jut now we can communicate that with others, and that means we have to look like unhinged loonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Open minded yes, but there are shills who’s job it is to open any crack, show weakness and basically discredit any argument. Very little we talk about offers 100% proof that can be taken to the bank, so we have to work on our own research and conclusions. And yes some o that means filling gaps we don’t always know, let’s face it if there were articles everywhere about the  9/11 who dunnit and why then everyone would know. I know it was a plot I just don’t know exactly why (false flag is one reason yes but there are normally many).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to be vigilant and try and help each other out when we get attacked. Anything to do with nasa or mandella effect gets attacked badly. And likely other topics are planted by propaganda shills. So yes ideally we’d all love to just chat and exchange ideas but seems we have to be prepared to fight at times.

       <em>
        any
       </em>
       counternarrative.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8e3f1u/a_funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_the_moon/">

       This place is meant to advance unbiased, critical thought. What's critical about "That's so obviously fake" or "You're a dumb baby if you think we went to the moon" or "That event in extremely unfamiliar conditions didn't go how I with 0 relevant education and experience expected it to"? Then no matter whether your response is short or comprehensive, no matter whether you're patient or rude, no matter whether your account has a lot of activity or a little, you're told you post exactly like a paid shill would post and you're asked why you're in r/conspiracy since you obviously don't like conspiracies. Imagine submitting burnt hotdogs to r/food or 15 mins of wet burnt-hotdog farts to r/music and crying about how anyone who criticized your garbage contribution doesn't like food/music.

       Users here act like it's so obvious that Alex Jones is controlled opposition used to discredit conspiracy theorists, and then they themselves comment just as dumb  and irrational of shit in this sub as he's ever said.

       Lol, that wasnt my goal. I think youre right that open mindedness is not simply acxepting the furthest flung idea. Its not immediatelty dismissing weird ideas or unusual ideas. However the sexond part you wrote about making up our own mind based on various sources is more a critical thinking thing. Unfortunatetly a lot of people dont have the current capacity for the latter.

       Even then i wouldn't say thats totally fair to say. Believing in any one part is fine, once your willing to have discussion about opposing beliefs. My biggest issue comes when peoples choose to disregard evidence that presented to them, and use arguments that have almost no backing. I'd love to understand why people can defend a point like that so strongly

       I like to think about that too. What if TBTB are truly just people trying to do the right thing in their minds? It actually makes more sense. I imagine the people pushing for the new one word order are doing so for "the greater good" of humanity. Not selfishness.

       I believe the only possible way humans will get off this planet is by coming together as one. I also think that will never happen without mass catastrophic which good be either natural , non natural, or not real (false flag). Tbtb are the only ones who could orchestrate this. Are they trying to save us? or kill us?

        My biggest issue comes when peoples choose to disregard evidence that presented to them, and use arguments that have almost no backing.

      <p>
       We need to be careful with the term "evidence". People will very often rebut a conspiracy theory, and cite Snopes, or CNN, or the FBI, or Washington Post, and call that "evidence". Which is what makes all of this so confusing and difficult at getting to the truth. You first have to get people to realize that they cannot just blindly trust any source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for arguments. If I make an argument based on historical precedents, steeped in the backstory of the creation of the Federal Reserve, or the Council on Foreign Relations, or CIA operations over the years, it then makes it very hard to explain my arguments when people ask me for "evidence of my claims".
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree that what you said does happen, that's not exactly grounds to dismiss anyone's claims or counter-arguments. Everything must be analyzed individually, which only makes getting to the truth that much more difficult (and most people don't have the time, patience, or drive to find it).
