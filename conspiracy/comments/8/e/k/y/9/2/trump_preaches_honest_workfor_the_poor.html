        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>AS FEDERAL investigators sift through the evidence of Donald Trump&#39;s criminal history seized from his lawyer&#39;s office, Trump and fellow Republicans are racing to pull off what could be remembered as their last big score: Destroying what&#39;s left of the social safety net to pay for billionaire tax cuts and Pentagon boondoggles.</p>

<p>These con artists are calling their plan &quot;Welfare Reform 2.0&quot;--and, like the original scam run by Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Newt Gingrich in 1996, it relies on the false claim that work requirements lift people out of poverty by ending their supposed dependence on &quot;big government.&quot;</p>

<p>Surveys show that these patronizing and racially coded claims have far less credibility with the public then they did 20 years ago. But it will take protests, not polls, to stop Trump and his gang of thieves from getting away with this historic attack.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ON APRIL 10, Trump signed an executive order calling on federal agencies to force more recipients of Medicaid, food stamps and public housing to work for these benefits--and to force those already working to work more.</p>

<p>Two days later, House Republicans pushed a plan inside the 2018 Farm Bill that will expand &quot;workfare&quot; requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)--better known as food stamps--by eliminating exemptions for people living in states with high unemployment and for parents of children over five years old.</p>

<p>In other words, the president who campaigned on a promise to expand childcare programs is now looking to take away food from mothers who don&#39;t work because they lack access to affordable childcare.</p>

<p>These workfare proposals are impossible for many people to fulfill. But that&#39;s the point. Trump&#39;s goal isn&#39;t to reduce poverty, but to reduce spending on poverty.</p>

<p>That&#39;s clear from the proposed budget released by the White House in February, which calls for taking $17 billion from SNAP in 2019--a reduction of 22 percent--and cutting it by over $200 billion over the next decade.</p>

<p>The administration budget also calls for drastic cuts to public housing and the Section 8 program--&quot;at a time when public housing faces a $40 billion backlog of capital needs,&quot; according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</p>

<hr/>

<p>THESE ATTACKS on social programs are being promoted by an array of politicians and think tanks owned by billionaire ideologues like the Koch Brothers, with lies as bald-faced and outlandish as anything Trump has come up with about voter fraud or the size of his inauguration crowd.</p>

<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), for example, had the nerve to claim in February that imposing work requirements would be good for Medicaid recipients&#39; health because &quot;higher earnings are positively correlated with longer lifespan.&quot; As Christopher Baum wrote for Socialist Worker at the time:</p>

<p>Few would dispute that people with more money can generally expect to live longer and healthier lives--nor that the unemployed tend to suffer disproportionately from physical and mental health issues.</p>

<p>But to say that having a job makes the difference--as opposed to, say, having reliable access to &quot;high-quality health care&quot; because of greater financial resources--is absurd even by the debased standards of the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Another lie pushed by the right is that recipients of public assistance don&#39;t work. In fact, as Valerie Wilson of the Economic Policy Institute explained to the Washington Post:</p>

<p>The truth is that a majority of poor people who can work, do work--more than 60 percent. The problem is that their jobs don&#39;t pay enough. People who are on public assistance and don&#39;t work are not choosing between a six-figure salary or staying at home. Taking a low-paying job gets no one closer to economic stability.</p>

<p>But the big lie of &quot;welfare reform&quot; is and always has been that fewer people receiving government assistance is somehow evidence of fewer people needing government assistance.</p>

<p>The truth is more obvious and more brutal: Fewer people receiving government assistance means more people being denied government assistance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>TRUMP ADMINISTRATION officials, echoing talking points from Koch Brothers propaganda firms, claim that work requirements in Kansas, Maine and Alabama have lifted people out of poverty. But their only evidence for these claims are suspiciously incompetent statistical comparisons and declines in welfare caseloads.</p>

<p>As Baum argues, workfare programs benefit big business, not only by allowing for more tax cuts by trimming the rolls of social programs, but also by creating an even more precarious and therefore exploitable workforce:</p>

<p>According to the Kaiser Family Foundation report on Medicaid work requirements, roughly 60 percent of non-elderly Medicaid enrollees already have jobs today. Consider how their situation may be about to change.</p>

<p>Under current law, if they lose their jobs or give them up, their medical coverage will continue without any changes. For people living at or below the poverty line, this is a crucial safety net--literally a matter of life and death for some.</p>

<p>With a work requirement scheme, however, enrollees have no such safety net. If they lose their job, they stand to lose their health care coverage as well, with potentially catastrophic consequences. This gives the employer a powerful hold over them.</p>

<p>Work requirements also advance an obvious ideological agenda of portraying recipients of government programs as good-for-nothing &quot;takers&quot; of taxpayer dollars--as opposed to those glorious &quot;makers&quot; in corporate boardrooms who generously hire people to slave away for them for $11.50 an hour.</p>

<p>In a country built on the backs of enslaved Africans, anti-worker ideology is always spiked with anti-Black ideology. Campaigns against social welfare programs are generally dripping from head to toe with vile stereotypes of supposed Black ignorance and laziness--even though most recipients are usually white.</p>

<p>House Republican leader Paul Ryan gave a typical example of this slime in 2014, when he decried a &quot;tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work.&quot;</p>

<p>Jonah Birch and Paul Heideman described in Jacobin how this commonplace message successfully stigmatized welfare in both white and Black communities:</p>

<p>A number of studies have found that people on welfare, Black Americans included, feel that people take advantage of the system and receive benefits when they should not. Here, the constant demonization of people on welfare has had an effect on welfare recipients themselves. While attributing their own use to structural factors such as discrimination and joblessness, they attribute others&#39; use of the system to laziness (importantly, however, this suspicion does not carry over into political support for attacks on welfare state, which are consistently opposed by people receiving benefits).</p>

<hr/>

<p>AS THE phrase &quot;Welfare Reform 2.0&quot; implies, the model for these vicious right-wing attacks is the law that Democrats championed in 1996 as the key to Bill Clinton&#39;s successful re-election: the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).</p>

<p>This legislation replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program created during the New Deal with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. Tristin Adie summarized the significance of this change for SocialistWorker.org on the law&#39;s 20th anniversary:</p>

<p>For 60 years, AFDC had provided federal aid to recipients who met income eligibility requirements, through matching grants for funds spent by the states. Whether the number of recipients was 200 or 2 million, AFDC guaranteed that people who needed assistance would receive it...</p>

<p>This notion was done away with by TANF. States were given a block grant of money to use as they saw fit...If these funds couldn&#39;t meet the needs of the total number of people who were eligible, so be it. Guaranteed assistance to all who were eligible was out the window.</p>

<p>TANF funding has remained fixed since 1996, which amounts to a 30 percent cut after inflation is taken into account. The funding levels remained fixed even in 2008, when the country went through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and official unemployment rate reached double digits.</p>

<p>At the signing ceremony for PRWORA, Clinton declared that the new law &quot;gives us a chance we haven&#39;t had before to break the cycle of dependency that has existed for millions and millions of our fellow citizens, exiling them from the world of work.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton said this, Adie writes, &quot;even though nearly one-third of welfare recipients prior to 1996 were women who were either disabled themselves, or were caring for disabled children. He ignored reports from his own Department of Health and Human Services that an estimated 1.1 million children would be pushed into poverty.&quot;</p>

<p>The results have been disastrous for poor people. Some 23 percent of poor families with children received benefits in 2014--down from 68 percent in 1996. And that 23 percent receives a pittance--as little as $170 a month for a family of three in Mississippi. Not a single state provides TANF assistance that is even half of the official poverty line.</p>

<p>As a result, the number of Americans who live in extreme poverty, defined as less than $2 per day, has increased by 159 percent--a total of 1.65 million households since Clinton boasted about all the meaning and dignity he was giving to poor people.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NOW REPUBLICANS see a historic opportunity to carry through the next phase of ending the great social welfare reforms of the 20th century--not because their proposals are popular, but because the Trump presidency has signaled the erosion of all pretense.</p>

<p>In other words: It&#39;s looting time until somebody stops them.</p>

<p>To most people, the most logical way to block the Republicans&#39; attack will be to vote for their main opponents, the Democrats, in the hopes that they will win one or both houses of Congress for Democrats this November.</p>

<p>Or there&#39;s praying for Trump to be hauled out of the White House in handcuffs.</p>

<p>But the enthusiasm for the November elections, while understandable, ignores the clear history showing that Democrats are also determined to &quot;reform&quot; social welfare programs into oblivion.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton wasn&#39;t a historical exception. Barack Obama gutted social spending, and while his apologists claim he was forced to do so by a hostile Republican Congress, the actual history shows that Obama initiated negotiations to gut Social Security and Medicare. It was only Republican fanaticism that stopped them from taking him up on it.</p>

<p>The point is that the millions of people who want to stop Trump&#39;s attacks on social programs need to take things into their own hands. The wave of teacher strikes has shown that ordinary people have the collective strength to defeat entrenched Republican power, without having to rely on lousy Democrat half-measures and concessions.</p>

<p>The fight against &quot;Welfare Reform 2.0&quot; needs to bring together the working class revival of those red-state teacher rebellions with the anti-racist politics of the Movement for Black Lives.</p>

<p>That&#39;s honest work--and it needs to get started now, not after November 6.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, what a joke. The &quot;gang of thieves&quot; as you put it, isnt Trump. Walk into a Walmart on the first of the month and look at where our tax dollars are going. Its not helping. </p>

<p>Shopping carts full of hotpockets and junk food. The &quot;parents&quot; still wearing pajamas, face and neck tattoos.</p>

<p>Makes me sick. Not because of how they look, because when I see the kids they look sad. The parents are rude and don&#39;t even care if they yell at their kids in public.</p>

<p>The REAL issue is this was the plan to destabilize America and it&#39;s working. 20 years ago it was better, way better. </p>

<p>If you make people work it will give them self-confidence and will change their perspective.</p>

<p>Not to mention that chase bank is the one the issues the EBT card so they get their cut. There is Major fraud even restaurants are getting their produce and meat. From EBT cards. Where do you think some of the food trucks get some of their supplies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real problem is that these people work their asses off just to make ends meet. Having a constant stressor in the back of your head saying &quot;am I going to be able to afford food this week?&quot; does not do anything positive for most people. Instead it slowly festers into legitimate mental health disorders. And then when they do get to go food shopping, they buy the cheap junk food because it&#39;s affordable. Healthy foods like fruits and vegetables are way more expensive than mass-produced, artificially flavored hot pockets. </p>

<p>That kid is sad because all they know is poverty. Their parents come home at the end of a 12+ hour work day, and the kids are expecting some sort of positivity, but the parents can no longer provide that because they are giving all that they can give to their employer, just so they can get that measely $7.25 per hour (before tax). I&#39;d be a pretty terrible parent too if I was so exhausted all the time that my life seems to have lost all meaning. </p>

<p>We already make people work. We are all slaves to the system set in place by those with more money than us. You want to break out of poverty? Good luck finding a job above minimum wage without a degree. You have a bachelor&#39;s degree? Have fun paying off those lones, now that you make $10 an hour. Obviously this is not the case for everyone, but we are facing major unemployment which is only going to get worse as more and more jobs become automated. So what happens when half the country is unemployed because there just aren&#39;t enough jobs? Do we spend all of our resources on giving corporations more money to hopefully create more jobs (we all know how that plays out) or do we create a world where you don&#39;t have to worry about where your next meal will come from, or whether or not you can afford a place to live?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great responce, but some of the &quot;poorest&quot; people have $200 shoes and a $700 cellphone and play fortnite like its a fulltime job. </p>

<p>Anything you want to learn literally at your fingertips, but use that technology for selfies saying they &quot;keep it 100&quot;. </p>

<p>Not only that, they couldnt find their butt with two hands but LOVE to vote Democrat selling us out even further.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a broad brush and there are execptions to every case. But to tell you the truth, its not all their fault. This was done by design and they are being used to bring down Society. But yet blame the one man trying to help them. Lifes kinda funny isnt it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree, people in poverty do not always spend money wisely. As you&#39;ve said, it&#39;s a product of society. The only way they can even have a hope of feeling success (and by extension, happiness) is to buy these status symbol items which, in reality, are completely worthless. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see what voting democratic has to do with this necessarily. Neither party truly has the impoverished people&#39;s best interest at heart. In fact, I&#39;d say neither party has any of America&#39;s best interest at heart. Clearly voting Republican hasn&#39;t worked out too well either. </p>

<p>I&#39;m by no means blaming you, I&#39;m trying to humanize people living in poverty, while you&#39;re trying to demonize them. Just another example of how society stacks the odds against them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in Sacramento California and have seen welfare literally breed evil. There is no demonizing some of them, they will gladly brag about being wicked. They are proud of it. </p>

<p>I thought it was normal until I moved away. Later in life I realized that the gangster mentality was on purpose and very intentional. It was designed to destroy and corrupt and came from the very top.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I see the gangster mentality has gone even more mainstream. Face tats, full body sleeves and no regard for themselves let alone anybody else. Not even their kids. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t even feed  themselves. Give them EBT and they live off Cheetos and Doritos and Monster drinks.</p>

<p>And then claim that they can&#39;t afford  fresh fruit and vegetables? BS, it takes effort to cook from scratch,  and only the lazy live off of Hot Pockets and TV dinners.</p>

<p>Once again, this is not everybody on foodstamps, but way more then you might be aware of. </p>

<p>And to thosen that say Donald Trump is stealing from them because they need to look for a job, is a prime example of why the welfare mentality is disgusting.</p>

<p>Oh bullshit. I have friends that have companies in the trades; building, plumbing, HVAC, electrical and the like. Their complaint is that they can&#39;t hire enough people, and those they DO hire don&#39;t want to work hard. And those are good-paying jobs.  Nobody is going to hand you shit in this life; you have to work for it.

    <div class="md"><p>Trade schools are a great alternative to customary four year degree colleges. However, I would go back to the issue at hand which is society pushing people into those four year programs, and inflating their expectations of what they will achieve coming out of it. Half of the degrees offered nowadays are essentially worthless when it comes to finding a job, and yet the program is still presented as a valid career starter. Sure, you can blame the individual for not choosing a smarter, safer career starter, but is it really their fault when they&#39;ve been pushed that direction their entire life? For me personally, if I had chosen to go to trade school I would have been ridiculed by my peers and family. Social pressures can be incredibly powerful, and going against the norm is much easier said than done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment is a great example of victim mentality. </p>

<p>Insurance and access to healthcare are two different things. Everyone has access.</p>

<p>Everyone in America has access to food. Everyone.</p>

<p>&quot;I ’m good enough to die for my country but not good enough to have the opportunity for a decent standard of living.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re referring to being in the military. Then yes you get a paycheck have access to Food and Health Care.</p>

<p>&quot;You’re going to tell me that it’s okay for a kid to go hungry at night?&quot;</p>

<p>If they are then there is this thing called CPS to remedy that. Teachers are also trained to look for signs of neglect. If that doesn&#39;t work they provide free lunch and breakfast. </p>

<p>&quot;Or have lead poisoning from shit pipes&quot;</p>

<p>Buy a water filter like the rest of us who live in the city. I know, they wont be able to buy ciggerettes and the filter. Lead water it is then.</p>

<p>&quot;Or for an elderly person to be too poor to afford medication?&quot;</p>

<p>News flash, 90% of the time it&#39;s the prescription medication that made him sick and their lifestyle choices that made him poor.</p>

<p>&quot;who put them there?&quot;</p>

<p>They did. </p>

<p>&quot;bipolar disorder to kill themselves because one 30 day prescription of latuda costs over $1000?&quot;</p>

<p>Psych meds have lead to more suicide then helped.</p>

<p>&quot;I’m good enough to receive a fair chance in life&quot;</p>

<p>You did have a fair chance. You could have done anything in life but gave up before you even tried.</p>

<p>&quot;We are not a third world country&quot;</p>

<p>Not yet, but don&#39;t worry the free handouts will fix that.</p>

<p>&quot;You’re gonna sit here and tell me the top 1%&quot;</p>

<p>The poor not only don&#39;t pay any taxes, but get money back most of the time.</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I do anything for my country if my country only wants to take shit away?&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you mean give you less? They can&#39;t take anything away from you that you never had in the first place.</p>

<p>&quot;Wake up and smell the roses dude; they don’t care about any of us&quot;</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t care about your country, which literally represents every man woman and child living here. We are America. For everything you take you need to give. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What part of this is victim mentality? All I’m talking about is making things affordable. Cps? Really? That’s your answer? I’m not talking about neglect. You don’t even know how many kids are homeless because of unfortunate situations. Also, our wonderful leaders just took away free breakfast to impoverished kids because it “didn’t generate money.” Are you really making generalizations about people you don’t know? Are you serious man? My grandpa had diabetes. He controlled it with diet. Was fine until he died. It was the kidney failure that got him. Because there are some things you can’t help. Even when drinking five bottles of water a day. As you get older, things start breaking down. You think that an elderly person shouldn’t be able to afford insulin on a fixed income? They should just die because too bad? Do not speak on mental health because you are terribly misformed. On most things actually. And you actually don’t know me. I am a college student who was kicked out of her house at age sixteen. I have worked for everything I have since then. 35 hours a week. Straight A’s and the honors program. I pay my bills. I support myself. And when I was a child and my mom gave up on me, I was so thankful that I was able to get my medication for my bipolar disorder. I was thankful I was able to eat and not starve. I was 12. I couldn’t afford to fend for myself. And my parent didn’t want to work. If I wouldn’t have had those things, I would have starved and I’m sure been dead by now. Because psyche meds fix chemical imbalances that you can’t correct otherwise. Not everyone is as lucky to have normal depression and just be apathetic. Sometimes people don’t wanna live. And they need help. And the one thing I’ve had is access to Medicaid. Again, I work hard and I pay my taxes. But I can’t afford $1000 for one medication. I have a lot of health problems too; things I didnt do, like degenerative disc disease and arthritis. I’m lucky I have affordable access to an orthopedic surgeon, especially while in school. I can’t afford to pay hundreds of dollars in health insurance bills because I don’t have much left over when paying my other bills. I am a hard worker. I am trying to make a life for myself. And without food stamps or Medicaid, life would have been so much worse. And there are millions of kids in my situation. In a lot of cases, life chews you up and spits you out and you have to keep going. But you can’t keep going if you’re not able to work or can’t afford to live. Also, no one is asking for handouts. People just want to be able to AFFORD THINGS. In doing so, we could provide a better life for people and therefore our quality of life in America would increase and money would be circulating throughout our country. But politicians would probably only want to take more money and put us further in debt. How can someone not pay taxes and get an income tax check? That is not how it works. Check out how awful the new tax bill is for citizens By the way. They are literally making the rich richer and the poor poorer. You wanna talk about handouts? The rich are getting the handouts. Oh no, but they can. People may not have access to affordable necessities but the government is also seeking to take away freedoms too. I don’t know how they’re pouring from an empty cup but they are. I am giving but it doesn’t matter. Why would I care about people doing all of these bad things? You are... the most ignorant person I have come across. You don’t even wanna see that. When your rights start slipping away, you’re not invited to complain. I hope when you’re old and decrepit, and social security doesn’t exist, and life became so unaffordable you’re living in a homeless shelter eating rice water everyday, that you don’t get shanked in the kidney by a bum and require medical attention. You are a miserable and selfish fool. Thank you for adding gasoline to this burning ship of a country. You don’t even understand the difference between free and affordable. I have not used the word free. But you’re so selfish, you don’t even want things to be affordable. Enjoy your shotgun trailer in Hickville and please don’t have any fucking kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite possibly. By privileges I mean a four bedroom house is better than a lot of people have. And people shouldn’t take that for granted. I want people to do well. Higher wages and affordable healthcare would help you too. By no means am I saying things should be free or people should get hand outs. I just want people to have the opportunity to do something with their life and not get stuck in poverty. It would be the best thing for our whole country. And yeah. I’m pissed off. Because the people in control don’t have a care for the greater good. I live in an urban area. I see people who struggle. Many kids I went to high school with didn’t have a good home life. Many were homeless. Many had parents locked up. Many saw their friends die for absolutely no reason other than the wrong place at the wrong time. I don’t think people deserve to die when we have the resources to help them. But it wasn’t their fault. And people don’t think about that. By all means should hard work get you somewhere. But it shouldn’t be hard work for so little. It’s achievable. But people are greedy. And I want to see that change. I want to see people do well. The system will never be perfect and people will always abuse things if given the chance. But that represents very few and by eliminating these things, we eliminate it from the people who need it. Give people the opportunity and if they fuck it up then it’s their fault. But don’t think everyone is out here abusing welfare, selling drugs, and driving Cadillacs. Like I said, if it weren’t for the government aid I was given as a child and young adult, I wouldn’t be in college working to improve my life and my community. I would’ve been homeless or at the very worst, dead. I appreciate what I have but I work hard for it. And so do the majority of people on welfare. If we made things affordable, there wouldn’t be so many people needing government assistance. But we can’t just scrap it man. This is a life or death situation for some people. It’s not a luxury. And you can’t justify people dying over money. I’m more than willing to let my tax dollars assist the needy, especially after what it’s done for me. I didn’t have it easy man. But I’m thankful for what I got, no matter how shitty the situation was. Because I always had a roof over my head, clothes on my back, food in my stomach, and I could go to the psychiatrist without paying an arm and a leg. And I believe people are entitled to this as well. This is what you need to survive. </p>

And they need help. And the one thing I’ve had is access to Medicaid. Again, I work hard and I pay my taxes. But I can’t afford $1000 for one medication. I have a lot of health problems too; things I didnt do, like degenerative disc disease and arthritis. I’m lucky I have affordable access to an orthopedic surgeon, especially while in school. I can’t afford to pay hundreds of dollars in health insurance bills because I don’t have much left over when paying my other bills. I am a hard worker. I am trying to make a life for myself. And without food stamps or Medicaid, life would have been so much worse. And there are millions of kids in my situation. In a lot of cases, life chews you up and spits you out and you have to keep going. But you can’t keep going if you’re not able to work or can’t afford to live. Also, no one is asking for handouts. People just want to be able to AFFORD THINGS. In doing so, we could provide a better life for people and therefore our quality of life in America would increase and money would be circulating throughout our country. But politicians would probably only want to take more money and put us further in debt. How can someone not pay taxes and get an income tax check? That is not how it works. Check out how awful the new tax bill is for citizens By the way. They are literally making the rich richer and the poor poorer. You wanna talk about handouts? The rich are getting the handouts. Oh no, but they can. People may not have access to affordable necessities but the government is also seeking to take away freedoms too. I don’t know how they’re pouring from an empty cup but they are. I am giving but it doesn’t matter. Why would I care about people doing all of these bad things? You are... the most ignorant person I have come across. You don’t even wanna see that. When your rights start slipping away, you’re not invited to complain. I hope when you’re old and decrepit, and social security doesn’t exist, and life became so unaffordable you’re living in a homeless shelter eating rice water everyday, that you don’t get shanked in the kidney by a bum and require medical attention. You are a miserable and selfish fool. Thank you for adding gasoline to this burning ship of a country. You don’t even understand the difference between free and affordable. I have not used the word free. But you’re so selfish, you don’t even want things to be affordable. Enjoy your shotgun trailer in Hickville and please don’t have any fucking kids. </p>
