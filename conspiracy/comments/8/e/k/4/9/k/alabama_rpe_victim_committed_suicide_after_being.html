        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The family of an honors student who was, “mistreated by Tuscaloosa police, the university, and DCH Regional Medical Center” before committing suicide, will be suing the University of Alabama.</p>

<p>Megan Rondini, a 3.8 GPA student who had received a coveted spot in a special MBA program for high achievers in STEM fields, hanged herself in February 2016 after allegedly being raped by “one of the wealthiest men in Tuscaloosa,” according to a bombshell expose by Buzzfeed News.</p>

<p>“Megan couldn’t remember how she ended up in Sweet T’s white Mercedes on the way to his ornate mansion, decorated with his choicest hunting conquests, from massive-tusked elephant and wide-mouthed hippo heads to taxidermied lions and leopards,” Buzzfeed reported.</p>

<p>“Sweet T” allegedly referred to to T.J. Bunn, Jr. of the ST Bunn Construction family, who claim to have paved every street in Tuscaloosa.</p>

<p>“‘Was it consensual?’ Megan’s friend asked her when she picked her up that night, the friend told investigators. ‘Like, did you want to?’ No, Megan told her. She didn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s why they went to the hospital for a forensic exam, even though it was the middle of the night and Megan had just run away from Sweet T’s mansion by climbing out of his second-story window. Afterward, instead of going to sleep, she met with law enforcement for an interview,” Buzzfeed reported. “Megan never imagined that she would soon be cast as a criminal, or that investigators would view Sweet T — really T.J. Bunn Jr., son of an influential Tuscaloosa family — as the true victim. But that’s exactly what happened.”</p>

<p>“Bunn has sandy brown hair, a boyish face, and a preppy wardrobe: The night he picked Megan up, he was wearing khakis and brown alligator shoes. He’s sometimes referred to as an ’employee’ of ST Bunn Construction, but it’s unclear what he does there,” Buzzfeed wrote. “A 2012 Tuscaloosa News profile published after former governor Bentley appointed Bunn to Alabama’s Conservation Advisory Board focuses on his many hunting accomplishments — he’s even killed the African ‘big five’ — but there’s not much other information about him available, other than records relating to a 2013 DUI arrest.”</p>

<p>Records show, “Bunn sued the director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety after his driving privileges were taken away, claiming he would ‘suffer irreparable harm’ if his license was suspended because he would be ‘unable to drive to work and will lose his job’ at his family’s company. Bunn got his license back.”</p>

<p>“Megan was loved by everyone who came in contact with her. Her loss is everyone’s loss. Title IX, the University of Alabama, the Tuscaloosa Sheriff’s department and the overall judicial system in Tuscaloosa let her down on every level,” Birmingham lawyer Leroy Maxwell, Jr. — who represents the victim’s parents, told AL.com. “Through litigation our firm is committed to doing everything in our power to shine a light on Tuscaloosa’s systemic problem with sexual assault.”</p>

<p>“Bunn insisted he and Megan had consensual sex. In a statement provided by his lawyer, Bunn reiterated that he was never charged with a crime and said it would be ‘improper to say anything further about a young woman, who was clearly troubled, that could cause pain for a family dealing with grief,’” Buzzfeed reported. “Under Alabama’s archaic rape law, victims must prove they ‘earnestly’ resisted their attackers, and the investigator who interviewed Megan quickly decided she hadn’t fought back against Bunn — she hadn’t ‘kicked him or hit him,’ he explained. His investigation would conclude that no rape occurred. But he didn’t stop there. Instead, he started building a case against Megan, questioning her for multiple crimes she wasn’t even aware she had committed.”</p>

<p>Buzzfeed learned that in Tuscaloosa, “only 10 cases out of 98 se-xual assault reports in 2016 were heard by a grand jury, and 12 out of 124 from 2015.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also have consensual sex and then climb out of second story windows, go by the hospital and then stop to chat with law enforcement. </p>

<p>So because she didn&#39;t hit or punch him then she must have liked it ? This makes me sick. Obviously she was scared for her life to sneak out of a window. On the second floor !! </p>

<p>What are they saying her motive was for accusing him then if he&#39;s so innocent? Money ? </p>

<p>This poor woman and her family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. My wife left me and took our baby. She&#39;s being just terrible about the whole thing, too. Taking me for all she can get, filed a restraining order at the advice of her lawyer because it results in more &quot;favorable&quot; outcomes in court, even though I didn&#39;t even call/write her after she left for fear of the same thing happening. What is shocking is that a good portion of states <strong>require</strong> that lawyers tell their female custody clients about this; that it is a form of malpractice not to, as again it results in more favorable verdicts. My life is absolutely in shambles, while the state pays for her court costs, her lawyer, etc, while I am forced to pay my own way if I would like to, you know, meet my daughter. I am left with severe trust issues. I worked at a hotel when she first left me, and I had 2 chances to &quot;hook up&quot; with 2 girls who stayed with us. A part of me wanted to, but the now-loudest part of me just screamed &quot;DANGER DANGER DANGER DANGER&quot;, so I got out of it, awkwardly, both times. </p>

<p>You&#39;re being downvoted without being argued against because, imo, people have been pavlovianly trained to react with severe negative 100% pure <em>emotional condemnation</em> to the men who choose to opt out of Societies comfy lies, because if we were to not simply hate them without question, we would be forced to listen to why they choose to. It&#39;s no coincidence that 70% of suicides are middle aged (30-50) year old white men. </p>

<p>Look at this article. <a href="http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/this-may-be-responsible-for-the-high-suicide-rate-among-white-american-men">http://bigthink.com/philip-perry/this-may-be-responsible-for-the-high-suicide-rate-among-white-american-men</a></p>

<p>Even on an article postulating causes for this shocking statistic, there is an image of a suffering black man as the header. We are hated, and targeted, and ignored even when spoken about directly. This article again <em>hypothesizes</em> that it is <em>our fault</em>; that we are forced to live in &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; wherein our emotions and expression of them are met with derision, yet again blaming men rather than understanding the causative factors which might now be leading white men to commit suicide in droves. </p>

<p>Society is so unjustly hateful towards white men, in just so many ways. Some men choose to say &quot;well then fuck you, too&quot; and remove themselves either socially, or at the barrel of a gun/a hangman&#39;s knot. </p>

<p>I will be attacked for saying this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly what you wrote, wont be read or understand by most men. They will just have to figure it out the hard way.</p>

<p>For me its simple, we lived the beginning of our lives as children, happy, free, playful, without the need for a partner or sex. </p>

<p>Then the hormones/Lust kicks in, and our slavery to it creates prisoners who spend a shit load of time, money, energy, resources to chase down that girl for the sake of procreation.</p>

<p>Eventually though, you will be fucked, just like you showed above and similar instances happened to me. When all is good, you are making money, supplying the dates, food, gifts, she will shower you with &#39;love&#39;, but soon as you go down, like an injury, job loss, etc, most are gone, or will cheat, or will become evil after a break up.</p>

<p>I almost got married twice but had a falling out both times, and the first time, the ex threatened me with cops and lawyers to keep the dog and all our stuff we had together (furniture, TV&#39;s, etc) and I just said &quot;fuck it&quot; and go the hell out and just let her have everything because it wasn&#39;t worth to me.</p>

<p>Now I live with absolute distrust of women, and though I do date here and there, I have a lot of my resources hidden in crypto, real estate is in a trust, and I feel like I can&#39;t love again because of the psychos I have been with.</p>

<p>Then people will say, &quot;you just haven&#39;t found the right one,&quot; lol. Yeah right. They are all the same, with relative levels of psychosis.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we will both get downvoted because the male/female relationship is too sacred to touch for most people even here, who should be questioning it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that meme lol it&#39;s perfect. </p>

<p>Sorry you&#39;ve gone through the painful shit that happens to so many countless men.. It&#39;s really crappy that it takes personal experience in what is near-universal before most men will see. It&#39;s like you said, the hormones/lust are powerful motivators, and the idea of family is all that many men, most men I would say, have to live for. The probability that this will not happen as they wish it would is something we all ignore until it is too late, or even if some don&#39;t, and act upon the world as can be measured objectively and as such say &quot;no thank you; too dangerous&quot;, society says &quot;oh lol look at that incel loser bet he just thinks things are unfair because he can&#39;t get laid lol I bet he has a neckbeard and a little dick and is ugly too lolol oh how funny&quot;. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m just preaching to the choir lol</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to write out that reply. Sincerely, thank 
 you.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how, but I still have hope, even if entirely devoid of reason and in all likelihood wrong, that things will get better in our lifetime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No prblm. We are brothers anyway who have to llok out for each other, something that doesnt necessarily exist within feminism which is basically virtue signaling.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I&#39;ve actually spend some time in some Buddhist and Kriya monasteries so at the very least have the context to know what its like without a woman for an extended period of time, and I fucking loved it. </p>

<p>Also did you see the sex bots that are being made? That is going to ruin the western women manipulation system as well, because that whole system relies on men with resources to be extorted and exchanged for sex. If a large portion enough portion of men end up taking on the Go Your Own Philosophy, (which has 50k + Users in r/mgtow) then its going to crate a shortage and more infighting among women for the fewer resources.</p>

<p>Its going to be a glorious meltdown. Ive seen women in some of the women&#39;s subs and YT vids talking about getting into Gov to make these bots and porn illegal, because subconsciously they know what&#39;c coming.</p>

<p>Now I prefer the real thing, but like you and the situations you mentioned, I&#39;ve turned some down and others I&#39;ve never let them be more than that because of the future risks.</p>

<p>Its much more scarier when everything you won is paid off and you have nice 401k that&#39;s growing</p>

<p>That, that shit right there, really makes me think. I, even at my most resentful period directly after being fucked by our custody courts, did not think that women thought of themselves as &quot;just a hunk of meat&quot;, because 1.) I don&#39;t think they are, and 2.) they regularly say that they aren&#39;t, but this collective REEEE seems to suggest that many women do indeed view their bodies as methods of obtaining their position in society. Notice they don&#39;t ever say &quot;this will make it harder to get into a good relationship!&quot;, but instead just insult, use emotional labels, assume the worst of all men, etc, and very very rarely if ever say &quot;this will harm my ability to use my body for personal gain&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Me, too. I think most men do. It&#39;s just a hunk of cold silicone, in the end, and the vast majority of adult men simply crave love and affection and partnership, not a little fuck toy to throw around and use as they please. The reason that men choose these dolls over real women in brothels that carry them, even when the doll costs more, is because of a simple cost/benefit judgement: Interacting sexually with women is incredibly dangerous no matter the situation. </p>

<p>But yeah, good on you for making something of your life and taking charge of your finances, dude. I&#39;m now forced to work my FT job in order to pay for my wife&#39;s &quot;lifestyle&quot;, as she says, (she has said she spends about 1/10 of her CS money on our daughter, which is probably being generous) and am also laying Euclidean tile designs in the homes of wealthy hippies to make ends meet. I make much more doing the latter than I do the former, and I&#39;m forced to simply not declare those earnings if I am to be able to remain self-sufficient and live without roommates (something custody courts recommend to all fathers saddled with CS). I&#39;m honestly just saving up ~300k before I eventually just leave this country for a non-Western one. My only concern is the life of my daughter and her being raised by a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bnzQkdN.jpg">single mother</a>, but I have already spent $18,000+ just trying to <em>meet</em> her, and have been met with nothing but failure, and being told &quot;well just keep paying me and we&#39;ll get this done somehow&quot; by my lawyer. I don&#39;t know what else to do.</p>

<p>Good luck to you, man. I hope everything works out, at least, works out as well as can be reasonably hoped for in today&#39;s world lol</p>

<p>I called this years ago. Not this case, but that as more and more and more women use the legal advantage of being a woman to attack men, such as in custody courts, rape cases, etc., there will be a commensurate loss of trust in all women in general, which will not so much negatively harm the baby thieves, alimony parasites, and false accusers, but instead will cost most to the women who attempt to use the system fairly.

    <div class="md"><p>She also climbed up the house, through the window, and back into the bedroom. She states explicitly she never felt she was in danger.  </p>

<p>Her description of events:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He made comments like he wanted to have sex, and I really didn’t want to. He walked over to me, started trying to kiss me, and I didn’t really want to. I was just like ‘I need to leave, and he just ignored me, and I thought if I kind of let him do whatever…,” she said. “When we had sex I didn’t even face him at all. I didn’t look at him.”</p>

<p>She said that Bunn removed her shirt.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t really looking at him. I’d already said I’d needed to leave and he wasn’t really responding to that and I just, I kind of just let him do it.”</p>

<p>“When he started to touch me, I was not responsive to him at all,” she said later in the interview. “I honestly felt like if, because he wasn’t going to stop, if I just kind of let him, then I would be able to leave.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bunn&#39;s version of events is different, including claiming that she was on top during sex. </p>

<p>Fwiw, Rondini&#39;s texts to her friend beforehand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>12:05 a.m. Megan: Pick me up in the morning</p>

<p>12:06 a.m. Friend: Kk I have class at 10 so early ish</p>

<p>12:08 a.m. Megan: We are going to guck [sic]</p>

<p>12:08 a.m. Megan: (emoji with sunglasses)</p>

<p>12:11 a.m. Friend: Do it (money bag emoji)</p>

<p>12:11 a.m. Friend: Wear a condom</p>

<p>12:11 a.m. Friend: Good luck</p>

<p>12:13 a.m. Megan: Eww but I’ll make it real good</p>

<p>12:14 a.m. Friend: Hahah like a tru horseback rider</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These texts were sent after she got to Bunn&#39;s house. Rondini claimed to not remember how she got to his house. Bunn claims to have offered her a ride as she was walking down the sidewalk. She recalls bits and pieces of riding in the car, and that he was driving drunk and that made her nervous. Security camera footage then shows both of them entering her apartment, staying for about 15 minutes, then leaving to go to Bunn&#39;s house. Rondini is leading the way both into her apartment and when they exit, and is visibly able to walk unassisted, and unlock and operate doors. While likely quite drunk (there are snapchat videos sent from Bunn&#39;s house with her giggling and talking about his taxidermy trophies) she does not ever appear to be impaired to the point of being incapacitated. </p>

<p>What&#39;s presented in this post is a very particular limited version of events. I&#39;m not typically one to go to bat for alleged rapists but cases like this imo are damaging to actual rape victims. </p>

<p>The actual storyline appears to be: She left the bar, got a ride from him to her apartment, invited him in, made more drinks, left to go to his house, texted her friend about planning on having sex with him, went upstairs and into his bedroom had sex, states she was never in fear of danger, then left his bedroom, got lost in his big house, panicked when she felt she was locked inside the house, so decided to climb out a window, then climbed back in the house, stole some cash, still states she had no fear of Bunn because she says she knew he wouldn&#39;t wake up (indicating he apparently was quite drunk also), went back outside, went into his car, decided to steal a gun (which she would later leave outside), and then left when her friends came to pick her up. </p>

<p>The only parts of that story that are contested are the amount of cash, and the degree of enthusiasm/reluctance in the sex act. </p>

<p>That would indeed change the story, however I have read that prosecutors&#39; plan to present evidence to a grand jury was ongoing at the time of her death, which would contradict a claim of coercion. Do you recall the source where you read that claim? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>she couldn&#39;t go to a therapist because Bunn &quot;knew them all.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is unfortunate but I&#39;m not sure what it in itself has to do with a lawsuit or crime, or who that lawsuit or crime would be against. The first counselor at U of A recused herself from treating Rondini since she knew the Bunn family, which is appropriate. She then referred Rondini to another counselor, which was also appropriate. </p>

<p>It is that counselor who is now being sued by the family for not treating her appropriately or sufficiently in their opinion. Without the details it is hard to say whether a lawsuit for counseling negligence is warranted although personally I would think if it is, it should fall on the school or the grad student&#39;s supervisors and not herself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could see being suspicious of someone saying a rich guy raped her. Easy to extort some money. But people that do that dont routinely make those reports after climbing out of a 2nd story window and they dont normally make their complaint so soon after and in tge middle of the night</p>

<p>How many victims wont come forward because of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After leaving, she climbed back up the outside of the house through the window and into his bedroom, where she went through his pants pockets, and according to her, took $3 in cash, assorted papers, and an old football game ticket from his wallet. </p>

<p>He claims that rather than $3, there was $300 missing from his wallet, along with a company gas credit card. </p>

<p>She also admits to going into his car and taking a pistol she found in the console. She says it accidentally discharged while in the car, though police could only find a casing and no bullet. She took it and left it somewhere by the side of the road.</p>

<p>Despite her saying that she did not want to press charges, prosecutors took what evidence there was to a grand jury, who chose not to indict. Subsequently they were planning on also proceeding with the case against her for theft and I believe firing a weapon in some inappropriate manner, but she committed suicide prior to that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I called this years ago. Not this case, but that as more and more and more women use the legal advantage of being a woman to attack men, such as in custody courts, rape cases, etc., there will be a commensurate loss of trust in all women in general, which will not so much negatively harm the baby thieves, alimony parasites, and false accusers, but instead will cost most to the women who attempt to use the system fairly. What a terrible world we live in.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly what you wrote, wont be read or understand by most men. They will just have to figure it out the hard way.</p>

<p>For me its simple, we lived the beginning of our lives as children, happy, free, playful, without the need for a partner or sex. </p>

<p>Then the hormones/Lust kicks in, and our slavery to it creates prisoners who spend a shit load of time, money, energy, resources to chase down that girl for the sake of procreation.</p>

<p>Eventually though, you will be fucked, just like you showed above and similar instances happened to me. When all is good, you are making money, supplying the dates, food, gifts, she will shower you with &#39;love&#39;, but soon as you go down, like an injury, job loss, etc, most are gone, or will cheat, or will become evil after a break up.</p>

<p>I almost got married twice but had a falling out both times, and the first time, the ex threatened me with cops and lawyers to keep the dog and all our stuff we had together (furniture, TV&#39;s, etc) and I just said &quot;fuck it&quot; and go the hell out and just let her have everything because it wasn&#39;t worth to me.</p>

<p>Now I live with absolute distrust of women, and though I do date here and there, I have a lot of my resources hidden in crypto, real estate is in a trust, and I feel like I can&#39;t love again because of the psychos I have been with.</p>

<p>Then people will say, &quot;you just haven&#39;t found the right one,&quot; lol. Yeah right. They are all the same, with relative levels of psychosis.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we will both get downvoted because the male/female relationship is too sacred to touch for most people even here, who should be questioning it</p>
