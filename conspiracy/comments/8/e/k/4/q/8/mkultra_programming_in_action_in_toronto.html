       For those who are unaware, someone ran over people in Toronto (10 killed, 15 injured) with a van.

       Check out this video of his arrest and see how the programming works. Fascinating!

       Possible false flag to bring down 4chan? Specifically reference 4chan in post before the attack, Armenian (Christian) perpetrator so there’s no terrorist angle: check. Victim I saw was a blue haired old woman, so how do you work the Chad/Stacy/Elliot Rodger angle when he’s just mowing down randoms? 4chan down at 5:07am EST hours after the attack took place. Pretty quick detective work/conclusions reached there, Interpol. To recap, within 24 hours: post insinuating 4chan cause of radicalization, terror attack, 4chan shut down. It almost seems.... orchestrated

       The Internet potentializes the madness: it is mind control, the only question is whether it is externally generated or internally self-generated programming. In other words, does the perpetrator unawarely program him/herself via the Internet towards malevolence or does the malevolence have its direct origin in an externally generated programming.

       lmao I'm from just outside toronto. I've been aggressively arrested by more cops outside of a small town bar for pretty much being brown in all white town. I did nothing and was arrested illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       This motherfucker drives over 25 people, 10 dead, and acts like hes pulling a gun on Toronto Police, who are worse than the cops who got me, and they do nothing???? There is one cop standing there? Where the fuck is backup? Why doesnt he shoot at him?? He knows its a fake weapon after he pretends to draw it on him 4 to 5 times... so fucking take him out.... lol makes no sense.
      </p>

       Oh... and it just so happened he parks RIGHT in front of a HUGE YELLOW ARABIC SIGN lmao. Programming at its finest...

       Not sure haven't looked into specific times yet. But yeah, I also got arrested for possession of cannabis last month in Markham, another city just outside Toronto. I was completely compliant in letting him arrest me and he then illegally searched my car. He called for backup for some reason and they were there in 5 minutes... So backup arrived in 5 minutes to arrest me for possession of 6 grams of cannabis 3 months before it will be legal in the entire country. Yet this guy runs over 25 pedestrians lmao in big city Toronto, with more cops patrolling, and just one cop is there making the arrest... as he has a potential weapon drawn... lmao

       I'm actually from Toronto, and it does not surprise me that the police are calm. I've only ever had absolutely wonderful experiences with them, even when drunk and intentionally heckling them like an asshole. I've never really seen aggression from the cops here. But, I'm a young white dude, so obviously my opinion is going to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy was clearly out of his mind. The officer actually went out of his way to
       <em>
        put his gun away
       </em>
       after it became clear the man did not have a gun. I'm impressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the guy's actions there's obviously something going on here though. The arabic sign doesn't surprise me at all given the neighbourhood -- its just wildly multicultural. Beside where this happened is a big billboard with a real estate firm with four different languages written on it. If he drove a block up the sign he stopped by would be korean.

       haha yeah you're white you really don't have a say in who these policeman really are. Trust me. I've dealt with them all, Peel regional, north york, toronto, halton hills. The majority of them are all the same, pieces of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is putting your gun away the right thing to do in that situation? Was he aware that the man had no other guns or weapons on him or in the van? Did he have any type of explosives? Was the cop sure there wasn't any other armed people with him in the van? What if the man attacked a pedestrian, such as the group of 3 people who are walking behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah the area's multicultural but come on, the chances are very slim. He couldve stopped 4 blocks up, but he didn't. He's on the run from the cops right, so he's not trying to do this on purpose and park there. So it was in the spur of the moment decision to stop there in the midst of all the commotion going down. What a coincidence... almost like someone planned it

       Yep. Thats why I made sure to point out that I'm white. My experiences are gonna be way different.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for him putting his gun away, its Toronto. The guy identified the threat and handled it. Cops don't get into shootouts here. You're right that he was oddly calm as fuck, but somehow it worked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, chances arent slim. Its an ad in north york. Theres less english there than anything. As for this being planned? I don't believe that, but something fishy is going on here.

       Holy shit. Even genuine cops that want to save someones life dont let them point a gun at them. Hes either suicidal himself or in on it.

       He very obviously was trying to be suicided by the cops. Instead of being trigger happy the officers seem to be aware of that and arrested him so he can be trialed and we can hopefully be provided with answers as to why he did this. I don’t think there is a conspiracy here, I think this was a very mentally ill man or someone who did it by complete accident so saw the suicide by cops as the better option, rather than jail.

       Mind control is yet another quasi-religious ridiculous thing that conspiracy theorists just BELIEVE in, despite their being no evidence of it and plenty of more rational explanations. All of you would fit right in at church back in the day.
