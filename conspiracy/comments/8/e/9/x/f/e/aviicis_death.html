        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I love Avicii, in my opinion, one of the greatest and most considering artist, every famous artist has that one hit song which made them famous, and most of them kind of falls off after that. But Avicii always made good songs, all his songs are as good as his songs that got to the Top. So in no way do I want to disrespect him for who he was, or his death, I respect him as the man he was, the content he made, and What he achieved, and I hope he died in piece. </p>

<p>Conspiracy: He stopped touring because of health problems, but he still made music, now, people knew he had health issues, because of excess drinking, and since he is one of the Top DJ’s he sure made alot of money. </p>

<p>I have been googling alot and can’t find the real cause of his death, but it points at health problems. Now he did get to 28 years old, Which is very Young, to think that there was nothing that could’ve prevented him from dying. </p>

<p>So I started to think that maybe he faked his own death, to quit music, and touring, and fans that are everywhere, expecting new music. This + the drinking at every tour, got to him, he couldn’t handle it, he already had health problems, so faking his death would be fairly easy. He also has alot of money so he could easily live in a villa somewhere else where he would draw less attention to his house or who he is. </p>

<p>Maybe he just wanted to dissapear, quit the music, enjoy life, stop with the alcohol, and live the rest of his life in piece, without fans expecting new content from him. </p>

<p>As mentioned, this could be possible because the guy had a lot of money, he did go on a trip for a year I believe, Which is a long time to think about it and make plans. And he had health problems, so everyone knew he wasn’t a healthy 28 year old. </p>

<p>I came up with this by myself because I can’t accept his death, since he meant alot to me, and every single song is such a pleasure to listen to, and I will never be able to find an artist like him. </p>

<p>If anything above has some errors because of new information about his death, please feel free to comment them, this post was written 23.4.2018, so information that might come out to the public about his death, and cause of death, is not available as I’m writing this. Thank you for Reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that no celebrity’s death would have an impact of my life, but it feels so surreal that Avicii died.</p>

<p>I was born 2000, so when I was around 12 and had access to music and internet, ever since then have I enjoyed Avicii’s music, I have never been so hyped about an artist making an album, when Avicii made his latest album. It was perfection, and now, there will never be music from him. </p>

<p>I love EDM. Wasn&#39;t really a fan of Avicii or the poppy house scene. Not to speak ill of the dead, but I really dont think he would have to fake his own death when he seemed to get out of the touring scene so he could focus on producing new music because it was easier on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bought the bullshit hook, line and sinker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heard it before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet you display such ignorance on the topic.  Clearly, you haven&#39;t heard it before.  You know there is an idea out there that you don&#39;t like and want to reject, but it&#39;s obvious that you haven&#39;t actually looked into it at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if your assumption that they were MKultra is correct</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, that isn&#39;t my assumption.  That&#39;s what you want my assumption to be.</p>

<p>Second:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were failures that co-opted the movement and realized the potential of these drugs. Ken Kesey as well. Timothy Leary. Robert Hunter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boy you really are ate up with the bullshit, aren&#39;t you?  The whole mythology of the magical 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>Be honest with me now.  You haven&#39;t actually read Inside the LC, have you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it lead greatly to the anti-war movement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, you&#39;re sold on it!</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what happened at all.  If anything, it delegitimized the anti-war movement that already existed.  It pigeonholed anti-war protest basically forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LSD doesn&#39;t brainwash anyone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why does everyone always circle down to the same nebulous bullshit?</p>

<p>&quot;All is one.  Love is all.  The water is breathing; the breath is life.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you taken LSD? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you have.  What a silly question though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which can very well lead to a change in perspective vs the status quo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boomerosity <em>is</em> the status quo.  We have LSD and all of your counterculture acid apostles to thank for that one.</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s worth mentioning that a heady-drunk on a heavy night can lead to a change of perspective versus the status quo just as well as lsd.  Either way they crash just the same: 
In a church pew or on your momma&#39;s phone begging forgiveness. </p>

<p>You buy too much hype.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the docile thing is not quite right. The strategies of psyops, mind control etc are to find ways of getting people to participate in their own enslavement.</p>

<p>The 60s was more or less an experiment to control both sides of the issue - establishment versus counter culture. The control comes in to push people into the arms of the more extreme ends of this paradigm. Counter culture claims to be fighting for the underdog but really it stays stuck in a negative, destructive mode and never gets round to being a positive force in the world. </p>

<p>The established culture is not as much of a threat as the counter culture would like to believe. You have to have a clear understanding where they both are right and wrong without picking a side.</p>

<p>That kind of balance did not happen - the counter culture has gained too much power and now you have a society that embraces self-destructive tendencies. We’re stuck in a paradigm where the status quo is always wrong by default. But now we’ve gone full circle where the counter culture is the status quo. And nobody knows what the hell is going on - I would argue by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing of Avicii&#39;s death was far too much to not consider murder.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He took time off for health reason two years ago. Why would he die now when there has been no further news from him or others about new health reasons?</p></li>
<li><p>So far Fake News Network CNN has said &#39;authorities are ruling out criminal suspicion&#39;. this is laughable as they don&#39;t explain which authorities and why homicide is ruled out. </p></li>
<li><p>This happened in Oman. It would be easy to do from there. Oman is a trafficking country. lots of enemies <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Oman">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Oman</a></p></li>
<li><p>Avicci was getting ready to release a new album. Why would he be getting to release a new album if he was having ongoing health problems? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This shit stinks. Avicci was taken out. I loved him. He was a great artist and a great person known for helping other artists out when they needed emotional support.</p>

<p>Lets let his music fuel the movement so that his spirit never dies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Good thing is, that somehow it’s not sad, just surreal that he’s gone, I feel numb thinking about it, one side is like: eh whatever, and the other one is like: wow, he really is gone. </p>

<p>It’s like a good part of my childhood is gone. But you know, thinking about it is not going to help me, just have to accept it I guess. </p>
