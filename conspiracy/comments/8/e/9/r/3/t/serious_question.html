<p>It was never proved conclusively, the “evidence” was never presented to the public for investigative scrutiny. If the had it in the bag, it would’ve been detailed for peer review on the front page of every publication. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The leaked emails were nothing. Sure there was some questionable things but in reality their content was a snoozefest. All the good ones were deleted long ago.</p>

<p>So you acknowledge that there were some “good ones”/something illegal/damaging?</p>

<p>The other point is WHY was she running very secret SOS business through a private server? Because private servers aren’t covered in the FOIA act, as it is a private entity, not government. If she did her business legit and ran it through Gov servers, and destroy a Gov server, that’s a federal felony. </p>

<p>They do have a reason to sow discourse, but was this really harmful to the process? Aren’t we better off knowing rather than not?</p>

<p>You may not care, but there was a hell of a lot of Bernie supporters who did and do give a damn. It also lifted the veil that the DNC is a private organization and can do whatever the hell it wants to, regardless of what it&#39;s members want. If you&#39;ve got the cash that is.</p>

<p>It explains why CNN gave so much of their airtime to him. Wasn&#39;t Brazille outed for giving Clinton questions at the time hall in these leaked emails as well? Anyone who had any doubt that CNN was an arm of the DNC had that notion squelched.</p>

<p>Yeah he&#39;s been awful, right? I mean I got a tax cut, no longer have to pay a penalty for not carrying insurance that would have cost me over 10k and I totally wouldn&#39;t have used.

<p>I don&#39;t know what the food stamp number is but fine take that victory if you really want, I would like a source of that though </p>

<p>Peace in Korea has nothing to do with Trump</p>

<p>If this is the only list you can come up with I&#39;m sorry for you lol. The United States at a world stage is worse off with Trump since he&#39;s started, we really aren&#39;t better off because of him. Nobody knows wtf his position is on anything because he says one thing one day and then completely contradicts himself later that day.

<p>A tax cut is a raise. Feel free to give yours back. I&#39;ll be saving mine for a home. </p>

<p>You know what we had under Reagan? Yuppies. It was a phenomena exclusive to the times. You know why they existed? People had jobs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insurance whatever fine nobody needs it until they need it, I hope you don&#39;t get sick or hurt :)</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t that be my choice though? It is my money. It&#39;s my credit. It&#39;s my health. Despite the fines I&#39;ve been forced to pay, I was able to pay off a vehicle in under 2 years which had a ridiculous interest rate saving me many thousands, paid off an old student loan that got me nowhere, and saved an emergency fund in case I break my foot and need to be off work. I would not have been able to do those things if I&#39;d purchased a plan. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to the Dr. once since Obamacare passed. I paid cash. While it was a gamble, it was a very calculated risk and I absolutely won. Sure woulda been nice to have the $2k I&#39;ve been fined over the years sitting in an IRA. But I don&#39;t believe in looking back. Only forward.</p>

<p>Peace in Korea has nothing to do with Trump</p>

<p>Any chance you were freaked out last summer when Trump was talking &quot;fire and fury&quot; with &quot;little rocket man&quot;? If you weren&#39;t you were most certainly in the minority among your peers. </p>

<p>So yet again, Trump will only get the blame, never the credit in your eyes. </p>

<p>You could prove me wrong about that assumption though. Name one postiive/good thing Trump has done during his term. Just one.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right in that no one knew what to think when he took office. But you&#39;ve presumed that that was a bad thing. He was a total wildcard for foreign leaders. He&#39;d never done this before. They&#39;d never negotiated with someone who wasn&#39;t a career politician. That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. And in the case of Kim Jong Un, it may have been a very good thing.</p>

<p>I think most of the cats who think like you are just embarrassed that he&#39;s the president. And you may not, but those that are watching CNN and MSNBC on the daily, are getting nothing but outrage at everything he does.  You&#39;re getting a lot of opinions, speculation, and gossip. The biggest complaint is that he&#39;s not presidential. Who&#39;s the arbitrator of what&#39;s presidential? </p>

<p>You made the comment that I would be blaming the next president for Trumps fuck ups. Did you blame Obama for his lackluster years?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not caught up in any cycle my friend. I didn&#39;t vote for him. I&#39;ve come around though. If he doesn&#39;t go to war in Syria, I&#39;ll more than likely vote for him in 2020. But that&#39;s several years off, who knows what could happen between then and now. I&#39;m allowed to change my mind. But this is where I am today. Enjoy your day!</p>

You really think after all of these years of the Kim Jong&#39;s defying the international community regarding nuclear proliferation that China suddenly had a change of heart?

<p>Did you miss how while teamed up with SS extraordinaire herself they took out Ghadafi and now Libya is a goddamn nightmare?</p>

<p>What about ISIS? Remember them? The guys that popped up when Obama refused to listen to anyone and pulled troops out leaving a vacuum where Islamic fundamentalists grew to numbers unheard of and went on a very public beheading campaign? Did you know that we, the US, actually armed and funded them? </p>

<p>And of course there&#39;s the server incident that happened under his watch, were his SS extraordinaire opted to bypass federal dictates and set up her own server, that he knew about and lied, lied, lied about.</p>

<p>No there was a multitude of shit that lead to the subprime crisis, the Fed during W&#39;s years has a lot of blame though, there were a lot of signs they chose to ignore. Bailing out the banks was just one part of a bunch of programs the Obama Admin put together that cut the bleeding short and put us on the right track. You can find a lot of articles discussing it.

<p>Trump was a democrat for years, then suddenly turns into a Republican? how convenient. its almost like he was set up to lose, then the dirt on HRC comes out and turns the election and he wins? sounds like a fuck up to me, even considering he had less votes overall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it actually mattered, they would be making a big stink of the Awan story.  But they aren&#39;t.  Because it doesn&#39;t fit their pre-written anti-russian narrative.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to be too negative or name call, but honestly there are so many red flags surrounding the whole thing that you&#39;d have to be stupid to not have your eyebrows raised.  </p>

<p>DNC via Crowdstrike provides all evidence of alleged hacks.  Crowdstrike is both employed by the DNC and owned by people with a long standing grudge against russia.  So it&#39;s a double conflict of interest that backs every piece of evidence put forth.  </p>

<p>And if that&#39;s not enough, the evidence isn&#39;t even conclusive.  TOR ip addresses?  Jesus.. I hope they don&#39;t come and arrest me for some shit somebody use has done using the same vpn service I use.  That would suck.  </p>

<p>And of course, they included RT coverage of fracking, and third party candidates into their report suggesting a conspiracy to undermine the US.    I really don&#39;t know how anybody could not be skeptical knowing those things.</p>
