       Even if Hackers, Russian or not, Hacked Hillarys emails, does it matter if they were Russian? What if the Hackers were from a "friendly" country?
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason i ask this is because the whole point of the Leak was that they were Legitimate and Real, and revealed the inner workings of Her and her Campaign.

       Even as a trump supporter I can acknowledge that it’s never a good thing for a country when one of its main adversaries is hacking the servers belonging to a major political party or one of the campaign managers email accounts and possibly weaponizing any of that information

       Honestly, if there is truth out there, and it takes black hats to make it known, I don't care what country or group they come from. The truth will serve itself.

      <p>
       Imho this was a DNC leak by our favorite 'murica flag jammie wearing brother, but that doesn't matter. Do evil people have a right to privacy? Sure. Do we have an intrinsic right to seek out and expose evil? I think that is true too.

       im more interested in trumps golden showers tape and his tax returns. told forbes in the early 80s that he was worth over 100 million but it was found he was worth around 5 million at the time. trump is a walking paradox, and above that, a liar.

       You honestly dont see a problem with our biggest adversary as a country interfering with our political process? The leaked emails were nothing. Sure there was some questionable things but in reality their content was a snoozefest. All the good ones were deleted long ago.

       What kind of point is, "All the good ones were deleted long ago"? Doing good things doesn't cancel out violating federal law. And I sincerely doubt the good and bad were on a 1:1 ratio in terms of quantity.

       It was never proved conclusively, the “evidence” was never presented to the public for investigative scrutiny. If the had it in the bag, it would’ve been detailed for peer review on the front page of every publication.

       So you acknowledge that there were some “good ones”/something illegal/damaging?

       The other point is WHY was she running very secret SOS business through a private server? Because private servers aren’t covered in the FOIA act, as it is a private entity, not government. If she did her business legit and ran it through Gov servers, and destroy a Gov server, that’s a federal felony.

       i only expect a more concise answer in regards to your comment, because you have high standards for others in here, i expected you to abide by your own standards. example:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You missed the point of the comment and chose to zero on on one thing. You were reading to respond not reading to read. Try again

       <p>
        So what you're saying is youre trying to derail the conversation then cherry picking one sentence from a vroader point. ok. Run along im done with you

       Well we did learn that the HRC bought the DNC. We also learned that Clinton's campaign wanted Trump to get the GOP nomination, the pied piper strategy. We also learned that Obama was very much aware that Clinton was using a private server while she was SS.

       You may not care, but there was a hell of a lot of Bernie supporters who did and do give a damn. It also lifted the veil that the DNC is a private organization and can do whatever the hell it wants to, regardless of what it's members want. If you've got the cash that is.

       It explains why CNN gave so much of their airtime to him. Wasn't Brazille outed for giving Clinton questions at the time hall in these leaked emails as well? Anyone who had any doubt that CNN was an arm of the DNC had that notion squelched.

       Yeah he's been awful, right? I mean I got a tax cut, no longer have to pay a penalty for not carrying insurance that would have cost me over 10k and I totally wouldn't have used. Unemployment is at an all time low. Less people on food stamps than ever before. And the possibility of peace on the Korean peninsula. You're right. He's been TERRIBLE.

       If this is the only list you can come up with I'm sorry for you lol. The United States at a world stage is worse off with Trump since he's started, we really aren't better off because of him. Nobody knows wtf his position is on anything because he says one thing one day and then completely contradicts himself later that day. Dude is incopetent and you will be blaming the next president for bullshit they have to deal with as a result of trump lol. Congratulations for falling into that cycle

       Shouldn't that be my choice though? It is my money. It's my credit. It's my health. Despite the fines I've been forced to pay, I was able to pay off a vehicle in under 2 years which had a ridiculous interest rate saving me many thousands, paid off an old student loan that got me nowhere, and saved an emergency fund in case I break my foot and need to be off work. I would not have been able to do those things if I'd purchased a plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been to the Dr. once since Obamacare passed. I paid cash. While it was a gamble, it was a very calculated risk and I absolutely won. Sure woulda been nice to have the $2k I've been fined over the years sitting in an IRA. But I don't believe in looking back. Only forward.

       Any chance you were freaked out last summer when Trump was talking "fire and fury" with "little rocket man"? If you weren't you were most certainly in the minority among your peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yet again, Trump will only get the blame, never the credit in your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could prove me wrong about that assumption though. Name one postiive/good thing Trump has done during his term. Just one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right in that no one knew what to think when he took office. But you've presumed that that was a bad thing. He was a total wildcard for foreign leaders. He'd never done this before. They'd never negotiated with someone who wasn't a career politician. That's not necessarily a bad thing. And in the case of Kim Jong Un, it may have been a very good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of the cats who think like you are just embarrassed that he's the president. And you may not, but those that are watching CNN and MSNBC on the daily, are getting nothing but outrage at everything he does.  You're getting a lot of opinions, speculation, and gossip. The biggest complaint is that he's not presidential. Who's the arbitrator of what's presidential?

       You made the comment that I would be blaming the next president for Trumps fuck ups. Did you blame Obama for his lackluster years?

       I'm not caught up in any cycle my friend. I didn't vote for him. I've come around though. If he doesn't go to war in Syria, I'll more than likely vote for him in 2020. But that's several years off, who knows what could happen between then and now. I'm allowed to change my mind. But this is where I am today. Enjoy your day!

       Him being in office for less than a year has literally nothing to do with him. You don't just fix the economy in a year. The rates had been going down since before Trump got into office lol. The fact you think he can instantly flip a switch and do that is hilariously misguided.

       No this isn't a bad thing, its just when you take that and also all the countless signs of him being incompetent, a hypocrite, a chronic public liar straight in his own documented words, there was nothing about him appealing as a political figure lol.

       What lackluster years? The innocents being bombed? The drone program is the only high profile mistake I can point to Obama for in terms of being "lackluster" in the fact it was bad. The Republicans locking DC up in congress isn't his fault. Tea Partiers are political cancer of the past 15 years.

       Couldn't agree with you more! You know Trump has been discussing things with Xi. Remember when he got those dumbass shoplifting kids outta China? He was there wheeling and dealing my friend. I'm very aware that North Korea is basically under China and Russia's thumb. You really think after all of these years of the Kim Jong's defying the international community regarding nuclear proliferation that China suddenly had a change of heart? Look deep within yourself my friend, it is very possible that the new leader of the free world was such a wildcard that Xi and Un took him seriously and thus reversed course.

       No there was a multitude of shit that lead to the subprime crisis, the Fed during W's years has a lot of blame though, there were a lot of signs they chose to ignore. Bailing out the banks was just one part of a bunch of programs the Obama Admin put together that cut the bleeding short and put us on the right track. You can find a lot of articles discussing it.

       Why can’t he be corrupt as well as Hillary? It seems you are deflecting away from Hillary so you can score points on Trump, when in reality, they are on the same team.

       Trump was a democrat for years, then suddenly turns into a Republican? how convenient. its almost like he was set up to lose, then the dirt on HRC comes out and turns the election and he wins? sounds like a fuck up to me, even considering he had less votes overall.

       If it actually mattered, they would be making a big stink of the Awan story.  But they aren't.  Because it doesn't fit their pre-written anti-russian narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like to be too negative or name call, but honestly there are so many red flags surrounding the whole thing that you'd have to be stupid to not have your eyebrows raised.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC via Crowdstrike provides all evidence of alleged hacks.  Crowdstrike is both employed by the DNC and owned by people with a long standing grudge against russia.  So it's a double conflict of interest that backs every piece of evidence put forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that's not enough, the evidence isn't even conclusive.  TOR ip addresses?  Jesus.. I hope they don't come and arrest me for some shit somebody use has done using the same vpn service I use.  That would suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, they included RT coverage of fracking, and third party candidates into their report suggesting a conspiracy to undermine the US.    I really don't know how anybody could not be skeptical knowing those things.

       Get shit on kid. If part of the details you give ultimately makes up your point, I don't have to acknowledge the point if it's foundation is flawed. Your reasoning is garbo.
