       So, it is not unusual for musicians to die, especially musicians in the so called "club/EDM" genre.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Avicii had left all that behind, he had been sober and recovered to the point to where he recently looked better than he has in years. I cant find the photo compilation that showed this but he basically went from substance abuser, with a methhead look in his face, to a much fuller and happier face and sober with writings on his appreciation for life on his social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       His video "For a Better day" ' which he also directed
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq-knHXSKYY">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq-knHXSKYY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Starts out with a group of upper class old men standing in an empty field near a military transport truck, they pop open the truck and its filled with pale, frail children in their underwear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It switches to showing 2 of these children escaping and jumping off a cliff away from a man obviously upset to be losing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fastforward to the future we see these same 2  victims of child sex trafficking going into the homes of the various people seen in the beginning of the video, beating the shit out of them, using a blow-torched branding iron to brand
       <strong>
        "PEDOPHILE"
       </strong>
       on their victims. It repeatedly shows them at their headquarters with a wall of mugshots presumably of other known pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       It finishes off with them branding a big-shot politician and hanging him in front of a crowd of protestors (day of the rope when?) and then the vigilantes take off their face coverings and you can see one of them is Avicii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he just wanted to act in his own video, but he is specifically playing the role of a child who escaped sex slavery and hunted down his captors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I want to point out something disgusting, look at the description an entertainment website gave of the video
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “For a Better Day,” which will appear on Avicii’s upcoming album “Stories,” features a video full of unsettling imagery as hooded traffickers go on a killing spree of adults in their way, including a politician portrayed by actor Krister Henriksson.
        <a href="http://entertainment.inquirer.net/177875/avicii-tackles-human-trafficking-in-directorial-debut">
         http://entertainment.inquirer.net/177875/avicii-tackles-human-trafficking-in-directorial-debut
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a blatantly
       <strong>
        intentional
       </strong>
       misinterpretation of the video the "hooded traffickers" are branding the adults as "pedophiles" and the politician is shown to clearly recognize them as the 2 children who escaped, this seems like a spit in Aviciis face and the fact it was never corrected is even more telling
      </p>
      <p>
       His other video he directed "pure grinding" depicts a man who breaks rocks for a living basically a stereotypical hard worker whos mail is being flooded with "OVERDUE" notices, and switches between him, and a group of criminals who are making duffel bags full of cash for very little work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this video depicts how the common man works the way he is "supposed to" and barely gets by for a large amount of work 5 days a week, while the "elites" at the top commit crimes and cheat the system to make more in a day than the common man makes in 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their isnt much else to go on but I will mention his Wikipedia only has 2 sentences on his early life part of which shows he was born to an actress who was in 50 films
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Tim Bergling was born on 8 September 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden to Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén.[13] He has three siblings, David Bergling, Linda Sterner and Anton Körberg; his half-brother. In May 2007, Avicii signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label.[13]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to also point out within days of his death they immediately ruled no foul play was involved, which is typical of pedophilia investigator assassinations
      </p>
      <p>
       see Max Spiers, he was making serious progress
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Days before his death, Spiers sent his mother, Vanessa Bates a haunting text. He wrote: "Your boy's in trouble. If anything happens to me investigate."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       then he vomits 2 litres of black fluid while in a foreign country, his death is deemed the good ole "natural causes" and his body creamated with no autopsy or examination whatsoever and the UK refused to investigate further
      </p>
      <p>
       Now listen to what he was investigating right before he died:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Conspiracy theorist Max Spiers allegedly investigating ‘circle of black magicians’ involving political leaders and celebrities before his mysterious death
        <a href="http://beta.nydailynews.com/news/world/max-spiers-allegedly-investigating-circle-black-magicians-article-1.2835441">

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       read this fucking disgusting wikipedia article which makes no mention of him calling his mom and his investigation into politicans and celebrities, and instead paints him as a substance abusing crazy person who even conspiracy theorists didnt believe in.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a part of the statement from the wife of Max Spiers:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are just the prisoners of The Hunger Games… I am aware of this BUT do you know how hard it is living with this “truth”? Can you even imagine how hard it is living every day looking around and seeing that we are far away from home- “true home”- and that we have some mission here…and we don’t even know what kind of mission we have here? How can we know? This place doesn’t want us to know…we can just feel it deep inside, that’s all. BUT is it enough to BELIEVE? Oh how strong you have to be to BELIEVE…JUST YOU KNOW THAT…AND MAX KNEW…

       black magicians rule the world. From the research i've done for the last 15 years  i've come to the same conclusion.  The symbols are everywhere.  They control the money and therefore everything else.

       That video gave me hope.  I think the world is waking up now.

       Here are the main theories of Max Spiers:  Be prepared for a mindfuck, the most chilling one for me is he beleived their are
       <strong>
        CURRENTLY
       </strong>
       over 2 million active MKULTRA victims
      </p>
      <p>
       He believed that Nazis who weren't killed or imprisoned after WWII went underground, where they joined forces with Britain and the US to continue their research into mind control. ( basically a more nefarious Operation Paperclip which is confirmed real)
      </p>
      <p>
       He thought that for years he was a victim of this regime, frequently described as the Fourth Reich, before he "woke up" aged 31 and remembered everything about mind control conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK ULTRA is based on Satanism and encourages victims to self-destruct by switching around the pain and pleasure centres. Max said he was constantly brainwashed with “Just remember, pain is pleasure, and pleasure is pain.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Max believed that Big Pharma (large pharmaceutical companies operating for sinister purposes and against the public good) and Nazi controlled cartels created "false memory" foundations to prevent mind-controlled victims from waking up and breaking their silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       These include fake therapists and psychiatrists who convince mind control victims that they are delusional and are having false memories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Max believed that around two million Americans are involved in MK ULTRA programs and that everyone else was controlled by TV, government propaganda and falsified history.
      </p>
      <p>
       He thought that the assassination of JFK and death of Princess Diana were mass rituals for brainwashing, and that 9/11 was a "false flag" operation, designed to deceive the public into thinking that the bombings were carried out by terrorists instead of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Max thought that black magicians were top of the NWO, because they could manipulate electromagnetic energy to serve themselves. He thought they used rituals, sacrifice, sex and death to raise this energy then use it to create the reality they want. He also implied that there is a battle taking place between priests and scientists, who are supposedly developing technology to govern mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Max believed that as soon as we go underground we enter our "sub-conscious mind", and as a result there are several Deep Underground Military Bases across the world which programme people for mind control.
      </p>
      <p>
       He thought that there were massive underground cities under both London and Los Angeles built for this purpose, which he believed is where he was put under the MK ULTRA program.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also believed that each level of these bases are represented by different symbols which re-in force the mind control and are seen in everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dulce Base is an alleged underground city in the town of Dulce in New Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumour has it it's jointly run by humans and aliens and used to carry out generic experiments on kidnapped people - as well as mind control, cloning and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       A former US government engineer called Philip Schneider claimed he help to build the base in 1979, and shortly after there was a battle between humans and aliens which killed 60 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schneider also claimed that there are 1,477 underground bases across the world costing $17billion each, funded by a secret Black Budget.

       That's the conclusion I've come to believe. Love your family, be close to your significant other, and build the world into a better place. The interface of two hearts and two brains that love each other generate a combined EM field that is more powerful than any blood/sex/black magic. That is the power of love.

Those evil entities/forces exist to manipulate us into spreading hate and negativity against each other so they can feed on it and they know and fear how powerful our creation of love is, especially when collectively combined. Waking up is realizing this frightening reality and understanding that the most important thing we can do in life and to combat their evil influences and control is simply to love and appreciate every one and every moment in the present as much as possible without ego or judgement. Humans are like a global network of many individual cell towers transmitting energy, whether it be positive or negative, to everyone else around us. The more we consciously focus on collectively transmitting higher vibrational positive energy the further it spreads, the more people it wakes up, and the stronger it gets. Each person that truly wakes up as a result of this positive enlightenment remains at a higher state of this understanding and is less susceptible to their negative influences. That is the only way to triumph over their evil. The war against evil will not be won with weapons of destruction but with love and co-creation. That is the key to our species intelligent evolution as a whole.

       Not the Trump admin, but an independent spending audit by a group of university professors that discovered over $21 Trillion in unreported, unaccounted for and unauthorized non-descriptive DoD expendatures just between the Army and HUD and just from 1998 - 2016. That does not include the DoD's authorized annual $600-700 Billion spending budget or our $20+ Trillion national debt. The Trump admin may have had some indirect influence in the audit since he did support auditing the federal reserve and unchecked federal spending by our government agencies over the last 3 decades under Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush Jr., and Obama who were all CIA/Deep State agents. This is a staggering revelation of unprecedented government/political financial criminality that every American tax payer should be revolting over.

       How is it "about to end"? i see them getting stronger and the opposition is almost non-existent. People writing posts about it does not help at all it seems. Kinda like preaching to the choir or ranting inside a echochamber. I could do more.

       having been on the side of the opposition for 15 years there are wayyyyyyy too many people who have begun waking up to put this back in the box now.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 years ago, their were about literally 5 people total on the internet saying the world is run by an "Elite Pedophile ring".  That number grew to the millions last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talk to people in real life today who know the "elite" are satanists.  This was unheard of even 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are watching the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, for similar reason, pedophilia, corruption,  and fake money.  History repeats itself.

       I'm definitely one of the newbies who has woken up. And I'm also noticing it's spreading. My family is starting to talk about this stuff too. Literally yesterday out of the blue my 11 year old nephew asks in front of everyone "do you believe 9/11 was an inside job?"
      </p>

       People are starting to talk. I'm glad.

       That makes me shed a tear of joy my friend. I've been labeled a tin foil loon since my sophomore year in HS when 9-11 happened. Up until about a year ago people have come ot me for answers if they're unsure of this or that. I have a friend who is finishing up his masters degree in physics and we get to talking for hours on end about this kind of stuff. His daughter is the same way, so smart.

       What do you mean unheard of? John Todd talked about all those things in the late 70's. Hell he even said in one of his very first talks  that communists took over are education system. I can't say he was wrong on that one.

       Its unfortunate that institutional pedophilia amongst the ultra-rich and high-level politicians finally hit the mainstream airwaves, and is bound to the small time conspiracy of Comet Ping Pong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I personally think, based off Alefantis being in GQ, based off his Instagram, based off his mysterious other property holdings, and based off his visits to the white house (and Q recently brought up a little girl pictured multiple times with Obama whos mom is coincidentally friends with Alefantis) and based off the whole street camera being aimed away from the shop the day of the shooting and aimed back the day after,
      </p>
      <p>
       Based off all that I think Comet and Alefantis are DEFINITELY what pizzagate claims them to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its a hard pill to swallow, and the conspiracy community would benefit much more from a more cohesive and coherent "-gate" not tied to one specific thing which the media can "debunk"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because now talking about all the very real pedophilic behaviors of the elite get you labeled "alt-right Pizzagater"

       I would like to look more into Max Spiers, but in all seriousness, all that I looked into was waay to long videos, and he was mumbling a lot. I'm not a native english speaker and it was hard to follow. If you have any link to something shorter , it would be apreciated.

       Isn't the end of April also the time of the most 'occult sacrifices' or something? I read somewhere on here that during the last days of April, there is always a lot of blood shed/big sacrifice. Prince also 'died' on April 21st.

       Boston bombing was on April 15th. Columbine was on April 20th. Deep water horizon April 20th. Verne Troyer died 4/21. There were also plane crashes and other bombings that occurred on/around these days. Just to name a few.

        This is a blatantly intentional misinterpretation of the video the "hooded traffickers" are branding the adults as "pedophiles" and the politician is shown to clearly recognize them as the 2 children who escaped, this seems like a spit in Aviciis face and the fact it was never corrected is even more telling

       Or just lazy writing from an intern that clearly didn't put in the effort. Really guys? It sucks that he died but he had a history of health problems and being hooked on Percocet and alcohol + a workaholic really fucked him up. Instead of finding a global pedo-connection look at the people that made money of him.

       My ex-colleague is one of the characters beating them up in the music video (6x world champ boxer/bouncer), I grew up a block from where HE grew up (one of Swedens most privileged areas) and my cousin even went in his parallel class (one of the most prestigious high schools in the country). He had a strong will to raise awareness on things like poverty, trafficking and suicide. His sister happens to be on the board of a charity dealing with these issues. Stop trying use this poor guys death in order to fit your own narrative.

       I was a DJ on the local circuit around the same time as he started going for it, she was a bouncer at one of the clubs that I used to play at, let's just say me and him had some mutual friends.

       I'm not saying it doesn't exist, I'm saying the likelihood of it happening is still very small. Sweden has a population of around 10 million (basically the population of Manhattan). Let's say there is something like 1% pedophiles at any time in any given population. That makes about 100.000 in total (still way to high due to our vastly better healthcare and social safety nets picking them up fairly quick) we have like 2 kids go "missing" every year and usually they end up being found in like a day because they got lost in the woods, and it makes the paper every time). The most common perp is a suburban PE-teacher that still thinks he's in high school and tries to fuck junior high chicks. People are very aware of stranger danger due to our nation consisting of people that value personal space. So much in fact that we have a shortage of male teachers, even less applying now after the metoo movement. Most of our pedophiles just book tickets to Thailand and do their thing over there. They usually end up in jail because other swedes rat them out when they get back. The most common thing is the police going through their computers and finding kitty porn now that I come to think of it. In a society where even proclaiming yourself to be a non-feminist puts you at risk of being ostracized, just think of the ramifications of getting caught with that in your laptop!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah maybe in America, but here our social services has the legal right to snatch your kid at any given point if you fail to live up to the standards of care that they deem fit. Every teacher/healthcare provider and counselor are legally required to report any suspicion of neglect to social services the SAME DAY or they could become a target of litigation.

       I have very little knowledge of Avicii except a bit of his stuff I’ve heard on the radio, I was just reading through as I, like you, wondered if they were making something out of nothing.  However your post smacks of something not right to me. Whilst I don’t discount the fact you may have known him, I wonder why you would discredit any investigation into child paedophilia that you have admitted happens and that Avicii stood against?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely the video is made to bring about awareness and questions regarding this horrendous crime that goes on, and therefore anyone starting to question it should be encouraged and Avicii death not used to discourage any such investigation ?
      </p>
      <p>
       You knew him, would you think he would like his legacy to be one of opening up lines of investigation into child abuse. Or that people just danced still to his music a few years from now ?

       That's a straw man if I ever saw one, I'm not trying to cover up any child abuse, and I obviously applaud people trying to stop/expose them. What I am against is sensationalizing a very tragic end of a life, ended way sooner than it should have, taking away the light from the real issue of substance abuse and the mental health of high-level performers and artists. This guy was just a regular dude that happened to be very good at making music, he never craved the limelight but got it anyway and he tried to make the best of it, unfortunately he was surrounded by a lot of "yes men" and it becomes really apparent that many of them just cared about the paycheck if you watch his documentary. He wasn't raped and there is literally NO EVIDENCE of a Swedish child sex-ring at this moment. In reality Tim probably got the inspiration for the video from
       <a href="https://youtu.be/2cXDgFwE13g">
        Skrillex
       </a>
       . That seems way more likely than what you guys are trying to pull out of your ass right now. Could you even imagine the pain you would feel if your sibling/friend/classmate/parent OD'd and then going online and seeing a bunch of randoms speculating about weather he/she was a member of the illuminati or a fucking Lizard-human? And again, I'm not saying there aren't conspiracies, I'm just saying not EVERYTHING is a fucking conspiracy just because you don't have all the information in front of you. In the case of flat earthers it doesn't even matter that they have literally ALL the information, they still don't believe it. You guys really need to take it easy with the edibles and "investigate" Occam's razor imo. Sorry for ranting but I'm still pretty bummed about this.

       I don’t have any information on this. None at all I know nothing about him.  And I agree not everything is a conspiracy. But surely he was highlighting the problem, and even what he was suggesting seems to be a conspiracy. So when in conspiracy question everything.  It’s a pain sometimes but that’s just the way the world is now.

       It's pretty obvious that you came here to disrupt the conversation and that you are an inauthentic user. Nowhere in the OP does it mention "lizard people," "flat earth," or the Illuminati. Your comments are full of accusatory and defamatory statements. Nice try at discrediting someone who is trying to highlight the achievements of an artist who has unfortunately passed. In the one percent chance (less than that, really) that anything you said was close to being real, I hope you grow up and stop taking your emotional and mental issues out on people who are trying to shine a light on abused children and other societal problems. Get off the internet and take a nap.

       I mentioned those because they are as absurd as what you guys are speculating about, the difference is that I have

        proof

       and you guys don't. I do know that actor and me and Tim did have mutual friends, I even know his private Facebook name, and that's pretty hard to come by. He's not part of a Swedish cabal of sex traffickers because news flash, I just listed a bunch of logical reasons for there not being evidence of one. Now the burden of proof is on YOU not me. 👍

       A lazy intern would not have bothered to write "video full of unsettling imagery as hooded traffickers go on a killing spree of adults in their way".   That is an oversimplification at best.

      <p>
       It is tragic that another young person has died.   It this day and age of instant communication, it is perhaps a reflex to rule out coincidence and assume conspiracy, but without any medical evidence, perhaps this young man simply succumbed to an early death.

       Totally agree with you on your other points though. We are quick to try to find connection when something tragic and unexpected occurs. Again I'm not trying to say there aren't conspiracies happening at this very moment or that trafficking isn't a serious and horrible thing that occurs world wide. But in this particular case, I firmly believe that his lifestyle and mental/physical health led him down this path, which is very very sad, because he was so young and obviously very talented and hard working, and by all accounts a very humble and friendly guy.

       There’s a picture of him with some buddies a day or two before his death, and he had a drink in his hand. They’re like on a boat and he looks a little red faced like he’d probably been drinking, and has a big smile on his face. There could be foul play, but just know he was an alcoholic that went sober for a while, but appeared to have started indulging in some drinking again.

       It’s actually a pretty popular tourist spot, even being called the capital of Arab tourism in 2012. If I were rich and could travel anywhere, I certainly wouldn’t say no to a place like Oman. Place looks like it definitely has it’s beautiful tourist spots to see, plus I’m sure being rich makes any experience like that better than average. So yeah, I’d guess he was there because it’s a top tourist destination.

       What? Are you joking? Again, it’s a highly regarded tourist attraction. There may be slave stuff going on in the country, but that doesn’t mean every single person that goes there to vacation or experience the beautiful sights it has to offer is pro-slavery. Slavery, pedophilia, etc all go on in America. Is anyone that wants to come here, or is everyone that lives here, supporting all of those bad things?  You’re on the internet and theres kiddie porn on the internet, are you suggesting you support that? Saying if I were rich, I’d go there (a top tourist attraction, with Muscat named one of the top cities in the world) to vacation isn’t me saying I support slavery. What the fuck?

       Slavery wasn't even outlawed in Oman in 1970. I'm just giving perspective here, you don't need to spend your time defending a rich person you didn't know who most certainly took part in some practices that have been around for literally thousands of years.

       Yeah I’m certainly not trying to say foul play isn’t possible. Was just trying to get all the facts out there. It definitely seems like an alcoholic drink, especially with the cocktail straws lol. TMZ part does make it sketchy but I bet they just paid the most for the picture.

       If I was out on a boat in the Middle East all day, I would probably also have a red face, and would probably drink some kind of cold liquid, possibly with a straw since it's a fancy boat and drinking heavily iced water from the rim is uncomfortable and unbecoming.

      <p>
       The sun is especially brutal on the water. On the snow too!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just sayin... Y'all (and TMZ) are jumping to way too many conclusions. It's unbecoming and disrespectful to the diceased.

       If you disagree, don't comment.  Lots go by without your contribution of personal opinion.  Keep up that trend.  Don't be a douche and toss insults to dissuade people from looking into what they want to.

       its a blog run by a HW lawyer. So there is always different types of hearsay information on there about folks in the entertainment business. He refers to them as blinds, as not to accuse anyone, and then the readers try and guess who he is talking about. H usually posts things before they happen or right around when they do. Its pretty interesting

       This post was presented very poorly, and I highly encourage you revise it. You included this completely unrelated tangent about Max Spiers without context. You also refer to Avicii by his stage name predominantly, which is also confusing. There is only one point in which you refer to Avicii by his real name, and you don't even really refer to it, you just link to his Wikipedia page. I read through this first thinking Max Spiers
       <strong>
        was
       </strong>
       Avicii, before scanning through it again and checking Avicii's real name to clarify this myself. Refer to Avicii by his real name at some point. Your first sentence should identify him by his stage name and real name, for clarity's sake. Also, explain why you are bringing Max Spiers into this. There are plenty of people that have died mysteriously that were researching conspiracy theories and child sex trafficking among the elite. Make your intent clear.

       I'm just curious guys what do you think about the fact that they now released the information that he died on royal property and not in the hotel that he stayed in.
I mean that seems like foul play to me.
The Hotel didn't correct or state anything.
Royal property means there probably were lots of policemen around that area and most definetly some kind of doctors.
How can you get such an important fact wrong?
I also heard that police was called but when they arrived a different team already investigated the crime scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that 100% proofes they want to hide something.
A suicide under those circumstances seems extremely unlikely to me.
After his brother went to Oman to investigate, the whole familiy joined him after a few days.
If it was such a clear case and foul play had been ruled out so quickly, why did the family join him?

       It’s actually a pretty popular tourist spot, even being called the capital of Arab tourism in 2012. If I were rich and could travel anywhere, I certainly wouldn’t say no to a place like Oman. Place looks like it definitely has it’s beautiful tourist spots to see, plus I’m sure being rich makes any experience like that better than average. So yeah, I’d guess he was there because it’s a top tourist destination.
