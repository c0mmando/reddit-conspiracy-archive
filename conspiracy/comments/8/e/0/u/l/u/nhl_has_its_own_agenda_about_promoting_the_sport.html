        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a Canadian hockey fan I&#39;ve watched hockey since the early 80&#39;s and im old enough to remember when things changed. Particularly under long standing commissioner Gary Bettman.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched year after year canadian teams and small market american teams get questionable calls during the playoffs. Like most people I&#39;ve had to give the NHL the benefit of the doubt. I&#39;ve made excuses that it was just circumstantial. But today i did the math.</p>

<p>If a Canadian team doesnt win the stanley cup this year, it will be 25 years since the last time a Canadian team will have won.</p>

<p>There are 7 teams out of 31 that are based out of Canada. If we treat this like rolling a 31 sided die 25 times hoping for a 1-7 happening...</p>

<p>The odds are a ridiculously improbable 1 in 602!!!</p>

<p>Those odds are now so far skewed from the realm of possibility, that Canadians (and Americans who enjoy integrity in their sports)  need to speak out and demand change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I quit NFL.  I waz raised by a Dallas Cowboys obsessed Dad and it was our thing on game night.  I started noticing outrageous calls and strange behaviors.  The last straw was shortly after 9/11 when I had been awoken to the manipulations and &quot;unseen hand&quot; behind everything.  I was also reading some historical fiction on Byzantium and the use of the great games and races to channel the ire and anger and resentment of the lower class into a red vs green rivalry instead.</p>

<p>Then watching the Super bowl just just as the WMD push was going on and the really bad calls in Patriots favor and NFL slapping their wrist when it became known they had stolen playbooks.  It was all by design.  Patriot Act, Patriots win Superbowl lets go stop WMDs in Iraq.</p>

<p>Sorry it&#39;s ruined hockey too.  It&#39;s a bitter realization something you loved has been adulterated and your trust betrayed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t sacrificing anything if the league is involved and its not simple minded to think a ref can call a holding call on virtually every play...
The last two super bowls were so rigged its not even funny.
Atlanta had that game wrapped up and then the flags started flying.</p>

<p>People just don&#39;t want to believe their precious Sunday ritual could possibly be fixed....
Its not even a conspiracy anymore....
Its ENTERTAINMENT. 
It would be embarrassing for people to realize they&#39;ve been hoodwinked the entire time they invested watching games a long with the fact they spend countless hours in fantasy football leagues which means Jack shit in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>If it makes you sleep better at night thinking real games happen each week more power to ya...but</p>

<p>Just like the half time show when Justin ripped off Janet Jackson&#39;s bra off to create controversy so does the NFL to keep the ratings and revenue rolling in</p>

<p>This <em>doesn&#39;t</em> include <em>you</em>. A sample size of 30? Really? </p>

<p>I am an NHL historian. You have no idea what you are talking about. The American teams win all the time because the American teams have more money to spend, and thus, pay for the talent they need. I can break down the numerical analysis in more detail, but that is what this boils down to. Also, regarding Toronto Maple Leafs, they have no interest in the Stanley Cup. They have (and have had for decades) what they really want...money, or more exactly, corporate profits. Toronto Maple Leafs, as a corporation, are the second richest sports corporation in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a hockey expert, but I&#39;d chalk the Canadian championships of the period 25-50 years ago to there being more top tier players from Canada per capita and that back then players were more loyal to local teams. Check the Olympic medal records before the ban on proplayers and after it was lifted, the Soviet dominated period in between being irrelevant.</p>

<p>Of course if we are living in a post player-home team loyalty era we could also consider band wagon jumping, top players wanting to be on winning teams, as a factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intellect has nothing to do with it. It has to do with experience and instincts. If intellect was all that mattered anyone could become a scout or gm.</p>

<p>When you trade your star players and bring in trash like the canadians have done youre not going to do well.</p>

<p>Those odds arent exactly crazy. Especially when you consider there is more to winning than just buying a bunch of star players. </p>

<p>It comes down to the gm and the coach and building a team around a system. Its a competition. Snot all competitors are created equal</p>

<p>Look at the browns in hand egg. Shit team for ever. Even with #1 draft picks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol hate to admit your team is only good because you were an expansion market with little interest so they fixed matches to generate a fan base? </p>

<p>Canadian teams aren&#39;t good because our fan base is going nowhere. We are loyal to a fault to sports in Canada, especially ice soccer. If attendance, ratings, and merchandise sales dropped or disappeared you better believe the team would be good again. </p>

<p>Sports operate like a slot machine with simple understanding of psychology. Reward the fan every so often to keep them interested. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see we have Winnipeg vs Moncton in the staney cup final. What would those ratings be like? I&#39;m not sure if your just being a dick or you actually believe sports aren&#39;t fixed to maximize profits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how probability works, and this has to be the most pathetic thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m a Bills fan. If games were just even probability and I was also an idiot, I&#39;d say the NFL is clearly out to get the team. No Super Bowl despite having been around since the first? Losing the Super Bowl four years in a row? Missing the playoffs 17 straight years? Ludicrously improbable! Rigged!</p>

<p>Then I remember sports are a competition with innumerable variables involved that make the idea of a flat probability of literally anything happening outright moronic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My condolences on the Bill&#39;s. They are just a unlucky and sometimes mismanaged team (Doug Flutie).</p>

<p>The statistics i use require a larger sample size (30 teams over a large period of time.) Your comment that &quot;this is not how probability works&quot; is just ignorant to people who actually understand, and only misinforms others.</p>

<p>Please dont comment like you know what you are talking about when you obviously dont.</p>

<p>Its frustrating to me to see people say that this is not an accurate analysis. I assure you it is accurate enough to make a valid point.</p>
