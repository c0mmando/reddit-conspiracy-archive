       Looking on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       I stumbled on a post on a sub called
       <a href="/r/fuckthealtright">
        /r/fuckthealtright
       </a>
       which showed a bunch of police pointing guns at 'Nazis' except the police were dressed like military soldiers in full gear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments were the bad part as it seems like a circlejerk of people cheering it on because these people were supposed 'Nazis'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me make it perfectly clear, if you call yourself a Nazi, I will probably assume you're a dumbass but that doesn't mean you should be shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, the worst part is that it's 'left wing' people cheering it on when historically, the left has been on the other side and tends to be against police abuse. It's crazy to me how divided the US is right now and how the system is able to get away with abusing people's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not right to me. I like you Americans and hate seeing you guys rip yourself apart due to ideological differences.

        what did they do to get that reaction

       ANTIFA have set a precedent for violence (remember the assholes throwing m-80s at people and beating others with pipes and bike locks - or them throwing human waste at people - piss and shit?).

       You're assuming cops are complete authoritarians who are just persecuting them (little ole anti-fascists - dindu nuffins), when, there is far more evidence cops react to

        violent behavior

       This is the thing that has been pissing me off around here for the last couple of years. I don’t know how the fuck people are upvoting support for antifa and downvoting critical posts.  From the first day of protests in downtown DC these people were destroying and vandalizing private and public property. Fuck that shit. It doesn’t matter who or what you’re protesting against. Violence is unacceptable unless you are defending yourself from physical harm. This was not the case. These idiots were just acting out like spoiled babies when things didn’t go their way.

       Why does it matter when they protest peacefully people ignore them, ask why they arent at work (because vacation days are weird for them I guess) and any number of other things. You'll just find another reason to trash them. That's what people that dont agree with the ideology it a protest group do.

       They think they are defending themselves from harm.

      <p>
       Just like cops do when killing youths who ask questions. Questioning their authority is dangerous.

       Antifa are cops with a different allegiance. Yep. They're despicable punchable faces. And they learned how effective violent tactics is from the cops.

       You are in the righy sub. Putin's cat account must have gotten compromised because normally we agree on a lot of things. Like the police standardization of violent enforcement of social norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa wears uniforms and gets violent mostly for the same reason Neonazis do. They've been indoctrinated into obeying whatever authority they agree with and feel completely righteous in using violence to defend their chosen ideology from even the tiniest of threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the cops.

       Sensible and free willed people rarely join such groups, unless they mean to lead them, which usually means they're power hungry psychopaths who want to reshape the world into the image that they were taught it should possess by either the state or the church.

       Dude. I love you. But violence is absolutely acceptable, following the standards set down by both our ancestors who used it to achieve our freedom, and the standards set by the state continually working to remove those freedoms.

       The more people come out and speak the truth the less any extremist will be able to stereotype their opposition. Online we're able to label each other all types of horrible things. IRL motherfuckers wouldn't say shit to me 'cause we'd come to an understanding that all of this is a huge load of shit and we can do better. But to have that conversation a million times...

       I mentioned Republicans because that happens to be the name of the Party running that particular show, really of course your are correct, there is no Republican party, it is all Tea Party and libertarian in any position of power. Two names that now define the same thing. Libertarian Tea Party is now the Republican Party.

       You couldn't be more right. Fuck nazi's. Fuck racists. But what the fuck happened to the left being a liberal party?
      </p>
      <p>
       They used to support the first amendment. Now they do there best to shut it down. They used to support the fourth amendment. Now it doesn't matter as long as those civil liberty violations are being used against a political foe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is disturbing to watch. I remain hopeful though. Many of those on the left are just blissfully unaware of how their party is being hijacked by radical ideologists.

       But everyday more and more folks are waking up and beginning to question the authoritarian tone being set by those within their midst.
