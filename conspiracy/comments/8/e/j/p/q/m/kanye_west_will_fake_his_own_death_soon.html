        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always had a crazy suspicion that Ye would fake his own death. He has a lot of lyrics hinting at this IMO. When he says no one man should have all that power, or calls Pac &quot;Makaveli&quot; on the &quot;Bonnie and Clyde Freestyle&quot;, and tons of references in My Beautiful Dark Twisted fantasy. I feel like hes leading up to some ultimate finale or &quot;lesson&quot;.</p>

<p>With all these tweets and sudden &quot;wokeness&quot; I think now&#39;s his time. </p>

<p>My theory is a grand &quot;lesson&quot; from yeezus, he&#39;s always been anti media image, anti paparazzi, anti villain creating in the papers or tmz. </p>

<p>I think his lesson could be &quot;taking his own life&quot;. He&#39;s been constantly showing a mental instability almost to the point of cries for help, and the media has absolutely destroyed him at every corner. I think if Ye killed himself it would be a huge lesson for everyone to look at people as humans who could be on the verge of a breakdown, instead vilifying anyone who acts a bit &quot;abnormal&quot;, or has different opinions.</p>

<p>Ive had this theory for a few years now. It started when I tried to image a 60 year old Kanye. When you have an artist as big thinking, influential, and innovative as Kanye or Pac, they can&#39;t just fizzle out into a super old guy that people trot around feeling sorry for. They have to go out in their prime. And Kanye is just insane enough to pull something like this.</p>

<p>Idk give me your thoughts, can anyone think of any lines, or quotes that could be referencing a master mavavelian plan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing that would be difficult for him to do with faking a suicide is Kim &amp; the kids. The Kardashians are the most followed family in the world. I don’t know much about Kanye’s paternal nature but I feel like he wouldn’t want to give up his kids and never see them again but I just don’t see how he could fake a suicide and hide off somewhere and maybe Kim &amp; the kids visit from time to time without it getting out. Plus Kim &amp; the entire family would have to be in on it and I don’t see them all being good enough actors to pull it off, plus Kim doesn’t seem like she’d be able to play the grieving widow role. Add in to that that they’ve had massive leaks from all their staff previously, if it were a fake suicide I don’t see how it could be covered up.</p>
