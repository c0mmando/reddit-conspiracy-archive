    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely expanded under Trump, though.  Before it referred to the &quot;real&quot; powers, i.e. a group of powerful people in the military, intelligence, etc. who purportedly were the real powers that be.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s basically devolved to include anyone in the civil service who isn&#39;t personally loyal to Trump.  A park ranger who doesn&#39;t lie and say Trump&#39;s inauguration was bigger than Obama&#39;s &quot;deep state.&quot; An NOAA employee who refuses to remain silent about climate change is &quot;deep state.&quot;  An EPA employee who thinks the agency should <em>stop</em> pollution is &quot;deep state.&quot;  Etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of the definition of that term &quot;deep state&quot; refers to <em>policy makers</em>; non elected civilian members of various boards, think-tanks and institutions that make policy.</p>

<p>Policy which is then carried out by <em>figureheads</em>, namely the politicians we have &quot;elected&quot; to various positions. </p>

<p>Then of course we have to include the machinations of <em>oligarchs</em>, people who have the personal financial power to effect the policy makers; these people have the money and the will to employ <em>lobbyists</em> to grease the political wheels.</p>

<p>These components make up the whole of what i personally refer to as the &quot;deep state&quot;. </p>

<p>We have this thing in certain circles we call &quot;the media&quot; or &quot;MSM&quot; that some of us realize is actually a business; they are beholden to advertisers for their income. The product they sell <strong>to advertisers</strong> is a spot in the awareness of millions of people. They have a vested interest in associating the minds of people and their advertisers in a positive manner; to do otherwise would result in a loss of advertisers... </p>

<p>You know who else pays the MSM? Political Parties. Politicians. Oligarchs.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this group of people out there who qualify themselves as &quot;informed&quot; because they saw a headline or watched twenty five minutes of MSNBC. These are most often called &quot;useful idiots&quot; or &quot;parrots&quot;.   </p>

They have never posted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before now, they are using really weak easily refuted arguments, they are providing no links or sources, they are jumping right into the partisan &quot;Republicans suck&quot; attacks, and they bring up all of these other popular conspiracies as examples of bad conspiracy theories. This makes them an easy target for people to attack and say &quot;look at this guy who believes in muh Russia&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are over in politics right now ranting about hating gun owners, and even the users there think they are being a bit excessive. I&#39;ve actually noticed a couple of other users like this recently as well. They take some viewpoint that is so absurdly far-left that it almost seems like a joke, and then they go around stirring shit and acting like a douche. Maybe they are just a couple of extremely liberal users, but it sure seems to me like someone&#39;s attempt to make liberals look bad. I mean, the one guy even tried to claim that independents don&#39;t exist and that I only want guns to kill gay people with. Which is more likely - that this is a genuine user who actually thinks this way, or that they are actively trying to divide people and make us hate each other? Is Controlled Opposition the correct term here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If it&#39;s what you say, I love it.&quot;</p>

<p>That right there is pretty much enough to confirm the basic gist.</p>

<p>Look, pretend in summer 2016, someone told you that several Russian nationals contacted the most senior members of the Trump campaign, and told them the Russian government was supporting Trump&#39;s presidency and had secret stolen docs to share with them.  And what if you learned the campaign&#39;s response wasn&#39;t to contact the FBI or tell these fuckers off, but to take the meeting and say, &quot;Hey that sounds great lets do this in a couple months.&quot;</p>

<p>You would have denied such a smoking gun could possibly exist.  But that&#39;s what it is, the smoking gun, even if the smoke has since cleared.</p>

<p>We have that communication, affirmed by Trump&#39;s people.  We also have a guilty plea from George Papadoupolous confirming a similar story occurred with him.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s own people have confirmed that they were approached by people purporting to be representatives of the Russian government -- and subsequently confirmed to have high-level connections to the Kremlin -- who claimed to have materials stolen from the Democrats.   We know that the unanimous conclusion of US and allied intelligence services is that Russia was in fact behind the hacking of the Democrats -- a conclusion shared by <em>multiple</em> Trump appointees, including his pending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Communications from Trump&#39;s people confirm that they received these Russian overtures eagerly.  We know that Roger Stone and Wikileaks traded communications about how best to disseminate these stolen emails.  We know that the campaign never approached US law enforcement or intelligence officials to reveal this dangle from the Russians.  </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m limiting myself to facts that <em>Trump&#39;s administration admits</em>.  Trump&#39;s people have confirmed their belief that Russia hacked the Democrats, that Russia approached the Trump campaign promising stolen Democratic emails, and that Trump&#39;s people jumped on this possibility eagerly.</p>

<p>What we <em>don&#39;t</em> know is whether Trump himself was aware of all this, if the Russians ever actually shared their stolen materials with Trump&#39;s campaign before releasing publicly, if Trump&#39;s campaign was active in shaping how the documents were released or provided other material support to the operation, or whether any promises were made by Trump or his campaign in exchange (though there is plenty of evidence to at least invite discussion on each of these topics).  </p>

<p>But the overall allegation, that Trump and team were in communications with the Russian government about this, and were aware it was likely an intelligence operation being done by Russia to swing the election, has already been proven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should believe the intel when it agrees with our pre-baked opinions, yes?</p>

<p>Asking others to disprove your wild claims is not in any way shape or form a valid discussion tactic. </p>

<p>One can safely assume you are spouting a party line as fact and claiming it&#39;s irrefutable simply because you have zero interest in any information to the contrary. If it were truly irrefutable you would have no need to wait for others to ask you to provide evidence. You would proudly have presented it in your OP, and every time there after that it was questioned or presented. </p>

<p>Instead, like a true authoritarian slave, you expect everyone else to also accept authoritarian prerogatives as fact without anything that remotely approaches evidence. Your 17 intel agencies have so much proof that they haven&#39;t been able to act against the accused. Even a man without a nose can tell this doesn&#39;t pass the smell test. </p>

<p>Yet here you are. You are suspect, and transparent. How amusing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What boggles the mind is that the deep state has been discussed by presidents, Woodrow Wilson’s memoirs of 1919 </p>

<p>Did Woodrow Wilson bitterly regret his role in creating the Federal Reserve?</p>

<p>&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world — no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; </p>

<p>and Eisenhower’s Farewell Address of 1961 </p>

<p>“IN THE COUNCILS of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”</p>

<p>being two examples. </p>

<p>If you knew your geopolitical history, you’d know that power in the shadows has been a norm. The deep state goes by many names, is an international entity of like minds with a nefarious global agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If it&#39;s what you say, I love it.&quot;</p>

<p>That right there is pretty much enough to confirm the basic gist.</p>

<p>Look, pretend in summer 2016, someone told you that several Russian nationals contacted the most senior members of the Trump campaign, and told them the Russian government was supporting Trump&#39;s presidency and had secret stolen docs to share with them.  And what if you learned the campaign&#39;s response wasn&#39;t to contact the FBI or tell these fuckers off, but to take the meeting and say, &quot;Hey that sounds great lets do this in a couple months.&quot;</p>

<p>You would have denied such a smoking gun could possibly exist.  But that&#39;s what it is, the smoking gun, even if the smoke has since cleared.</p>

<p>We have that communication, affirmed by Trump&#39;s people.  We also have a guilty plea from George Papadoupolous confirming a similar story occurred with him.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s own people have confirmed that they were approached by people purporting to be representatives of the Russian government -- and subsequently confirmed to have high-level connections to the Kremlin -- who claimed to have materials stolen from the Democrats.   We know that the unanimous conclusion of US and allied intelligence services is that Russia was in fact behind the hacking of the Democrats -- a conclusion shared by <em>multiple</em> Trump appointees, including his pending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Communications from Trump&#39;s people confirm that they received these Russian overtures eagerly.  We know that Roger Stone and Wikileaks traded communications about how best to disseminate these stolen emails.  We know that the campaign never approached US law enforcement or intelligence officials to reveal this dangle from the Russians.  </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m limiting myself to facts that <em>Trump&#39;s administration admits</em>.  Trump&#39;s people have confirmed their belief that Russia hacked the Democrats, that Russia approached the Trump campaign promising stolen Democratic emails, and that Trump&#39;s people jumped on this possibility eagerly.</p>

<p>What we <em>don&#39;t</em> know is whether Trump himself was aware of all this, if the Russians ever actually shared their stolen materials with Trump&#39;s campaign before releasing publicly, if Trump&#39;s campaign was active in shaping how the documents were released or provided other material support to the operation, or whether any promises were made by Trump or his campaign in exchange (though there is plenty of evidence to at least invite discussion on each of these topics).  </p>

<p>But the overall allegation, that Trump and team were in communications with the Russian government about this, and were aware it was likely an intelligence operation being done by Russia to swing the election, has already been proven.</p>
