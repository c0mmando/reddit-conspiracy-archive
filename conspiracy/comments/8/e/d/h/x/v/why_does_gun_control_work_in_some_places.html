<p>So my question is this: why does gun control seem to work in places like Germany and most of Europe, but fail miserably in places such as Chicago?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of culture. Europeans have always associated firearms with criminal activity and therefore avoid them on their own, while Americans have championed their use as a civil right for well over two-hundred years. You can&#39;t hope to stop such a powerful tradition just by changing a few lines in the big book o&#39; rules.</p>

<p>To those who claim that gun control <em>never</em> works and that people will just find another weapon to use: let us not delude ourselves here. America has the highest homicide rate of any developed country <em>by far</em>. It would be naive to blame the discrepancy entirely on the free availability of guns, sure, but it would be even more naive to deny its influence entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much my feeling as well. There are a lot of factors at play in American gun violence and unfortunately it isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;ban the guns&quot; in this case. Culture and tradition are powerful things that are poorly understood. I also think in the case the the US the genie is out of the bottle due to the number of guns and peoples attitudes about 2A and its purpose. A strait up gun grab would not go over very well and they know this.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This...</p>

<p>Its not that it works there and doesn&#39;t work here.  Up until recently, each European country was widely one culture, or a mix of similar cultures that have found a way to live together over the centuries.</p>

<p>The U.S. is not this.  We are a young nation.  We&#39;re a little over half-white as a nation, with the rest being other races.  White Americans alone have a huge diversity among their cultures.  We have opened our borders to let in people from every other country and culture on the planet and we allow these people to live their lives as they want.  This isn&#39;t something other countries have done.</p>

<p>America is diverse, and has a wide variety of people and cultures.  These people will clash and fight and kill each other, guns or no guns.</p>

<p>You can see violence increasing in countries such as German, France, Sweden, and England.  Its not because of weapon accessibility (though it might make it easier), but because of conflicting cultures that are struggling to assimilate to one another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize in advance, but I find this to be a load question.</p>

<p>Does gun control work? How do we even measure this? Is it based on crime rate? Is it based on gun-related accidents and gun related crime? Do we weigh these events against those who haven&#39;t misused their guns or had their guns fall into the wrong hands?</p>

<p>Do these areas where &quot;gun control work&quot; have other issues that affect their society? Do they share a similar government, similar laws? Is their culture even similar? Do they have similar needs and issues?</p>

<p>Are the cultures and societal issues the same? What about their history? Their economy?</p>

<p>What was their country like before gun control? Can we even say that gun control was a main issue in a country improving?</p>

<p>There are so many issues that need to be addressed, prior to arguing that &quot;gun control works&quot;.</p>

<p>I apologize if this source isn&#39;t to your liking:

<p>Who sells guns illegally?</p>

<p>Who says that gun control works?</p>

<p>This is one small topic that I have NEVER seen concise evidence on. People just like to point to areas or events and blame it on guns, or contribute it&#39;s success to a lack of guns.</p>

<p>If you replaced this topic with race, you&#39;d understand exactly how little logic is actually being applied.</p>

<p>How can I answer your question when there are so many variables that have not been addressed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you examine gun crime related data, you&#39;ll find that the biggest correlation between gun violence and anything else is poverty rates.  Why? Well, if you examine the areas where gun violence is the worst, there is always high unemployment, high drug use, high levels of single parent households, etc.  Basically when you have a whole lot of poor people with nothing to do, they develop their own illicit economy which lacks laws or structure so violence rules.  Does race play a big part in this?  Not really, similar situations have arisen many times in all sorts of locations and ethnicities.   </p>

It stays locked in a cabinet, ammo etc in a separate locked cabinet. None of my friends or family have guns. None. Our everyday cops don&#39;t have guns. We really have no need unless you want to hunt. We had one mass shooting and got rid of a lot of guns. We are a little country but I love there are no guns around really. We have strict licenses for guns but of course some criminals still have guns and always will. I love NZ and wouldn&#39;t change anything. I also love my guns for hunting. I treat my weapons with respect and have never used recklessly or irresponsibly. Here I really think most people don&#39;t need and/or want guns really. </p>
