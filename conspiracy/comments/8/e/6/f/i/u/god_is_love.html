    <div class="md"><p>As you well know, God is not a he, unless he is in his role as &quot;Sky Father&quot; which is the etymological root of the standard word for God in most indo-european languages - Iu-Pater (sky father) - Jupiter - Zeus - Deus. The word god is germanic and can refer to any of the gods in the pantheon or, after Christianization, the &quot;One God&quot;.</p>

<p>Regardless of the etymology, modern theology generally defines God as something closer to a neutral universal principle which maps rather closely to the scientific term &quot;Cosmos&quot;.</p>

<p>I will extend the argument because I think maybe you are wondering why God isn&#39;t female? In Christology, the place of the matching &quot;Sky Mother&quot; is taken by a &quot;semi-deified&quot; historical woman, Mary. Further, in some mystic traditions the third person of the trinity - what we know as the &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; or Spirit, is identified with that Mary-force that blankets female concern upon the human soul.</p>

<p>So the Christian God, to me, is as much a female as it is a male, and critically it venerates a Child (Jesus never having grown up, obviously), who stands in for all such children, adrift in a harsh world with nothing, save the good intentions of us faulty adults who are human, all too human.</p>

<p>And yeah.. its pretty hard to understand the violence, really really hard actually, but there is a reason and thats what faith allows us to replace the internal search for that reason with instead.</p>

<p>Its a system. Do stuff, learn, try again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really easy to do.</p>

<p>Im not going to continually and blindly parrot “faith” obviously there is more then that. </p>

<p>My own path had extreme bouts of angry militant screaming, and years of depressive hopelessness, but each day is a new day.</p>

<p>One tip i had was to always observe. Keep watching. And in a very simple way that single act of trying to watch this place is almost a primitive form of faith.</p>

<p>Like just by watching itself, we exercise faith that there is purpose, because ultimately we all need that.</p>

<p>No, what Gods love is not. It is not human love, although humans can express it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the mystified:</p>

<p>The passage is from John 4:8 and goes like this in Greek:  &quot;Theos Agape estin&quot;, which translates &quot;God is Agape&quot;</p>

<p>Agape is a special Greek word for Love that is &quot;Divine&quot; or &quot;of the Gods&quot; and in its Christian sense means a love that surpasses ordinary love and entails the willingness to die for another.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agape has been expounded on by many Christian writers in a specifically Christian context. C. S. Lewis uses agape in The Four Loves to describe what he believes is the highest level of love known to humanity: a selfless love that is passionately committed to the well-being of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just arguing from a purely theological/philosophical pov- if a being created the entire universe, giving it its own set of laws so that it might dynamically unfold accordingly, then the beauty of that system is allowing it to self-regulate, and to not interfere with it.

<p>Being on the other side, I&#39;ve linked up w dead relatives, guardian angel, and recalled the area where I came from prior to taking on this current body. So basically we all exist prior to these bodies being born here, but we get our memories wiped.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come across good and bad being on the other side and witnessed so much shit that just blows my mind its absolutely mind bending in terms of who we really are and where we really come from.</p>

<p>There are Conscious beings there which as as big in size as Manhattan, the planets are all conscious, I&#39;ve actually connected and communicated with the Sun and then after that crazy experienced, jumped online and found all sorts of people say the same, and I&#39;ve connected with living bodies of water which are living conscious being as well, trees, earth, mother nature as a whole.</p>

<p>However, these bodies/earth incarnation is a prison. In my OBE experiences, there are walls and boundaries that you cannot surpass even though you can see, feel, know that there is more on that other side, and I&#39;ve seen being be forced to incarnate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God is Love, very true.  He however will unleash his perfect wrath on anyone who rejects the blood atonement he made when he became flesh as Jesus Christ and died for everyone&#39;s sins.</p>

<p>Pro 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
 
Pro 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
 
Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
 
Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
 
Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
 
Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
 
Pro 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
 
Pro 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
 
Pro 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
 
Pro 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>

<p>God loves his children but you can only became a child of God by repenting and believing in the gospel.  Nothing you do yourself can save you, only trusting in the finished work and blood atonement of Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had about 2-3 dozen OBE&#39;s all which I unlocked after having an NDE from a work accident that killed me (electrocuted high voltage, and am basically fucked for life in terms of chronic issues since then) but got resuscitated.</p>

<p>Being on the other side, I&#39;ve linked up w dead relatives, guardian angel, and recalled the area where I came from prior to taking on this current body. So basically we all exist prior to these bodies being born here, but we get our memories wiped.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come across good and bad being on the other side and witnessed so much shit that just blows my mind its absolutely mind bending in terms of who we really are and where we really come from.</p>

<p>There are Conscious beings there which as as big in size as Manhattan, the planets are all conscious, I&#39;ve actually connected and communicated with the Sun and then after that crazy experienced, jumped online and found all sorts of people say the same, and I&#39;ve connected with living bodies of water which are living conscious being as well, trees, earth, mother nature as a whole.</p>

<p>However, these bodies/earth incarnation is a prison. In my OBE experiences, there are walls and boundaries that you cannot surpass even though you can see, feel, know that there is more on that other side, and I&#39;ve seen being be forced to incarnate.</p>
