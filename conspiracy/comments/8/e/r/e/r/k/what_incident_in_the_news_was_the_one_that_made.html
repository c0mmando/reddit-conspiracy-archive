    <div class="md"><p>The Las Vegas Shooting with Stephen Paddock. </p>

<p>I mean, 9/11 of course but I was quite young at the time and only remember the day of the attack but nothing related to the politics of it. </p>

<p>the Vegas shooting just didn’t add up to me, though. 500+ injured and they can’t find a single thing detailing maybe why he would shoot at an entire festival? maybe we’re all looking too deep into it, maybe he just had a deep rooted hatred for country music. also the mainstream media just kind of slowly stopped talking about it, certain agencies demanding certain bits of information not be released to the public, etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was probably long dead before the shooting ever took place... a mass shooter wouldn’t have dozens of guns...they’d have a couple guns and many mags and thousands of rounds instead makes much more sense..  He was obviously a patsy who thought he was selling guns to the buyer or buyers who are most likely the real shooters that have since left the country and are living happily ever after.  All too easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>completely backed! his transportation of guns is flawless, why would you question it? the hotel security see so many people throughout the day, they’re not going to be specifically weirded out by the same dude and the likelihood of him getting the same luggage guy is so slim</p>

<li><p>the lack of gun powder and residue in the photos? </p></li>
<li><p>the accounts of multiple shooters make me very curious </p></li>
<li><p>the link between the Saudi’s got me hooked, the four seasons and all that and then throwing everybody in prison around the same time</p></li>
<li><p>the weird time of death for stephen paddock on his death certificate</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah! and the reports of Mary Lou Danley actually being in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting? </p>

<p>this hasn’t been reported on but I will 100% stand that she knows sooooo much more than she’s telling. </p>

<p>or maybe she’s telling them and they already know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the last straw for me. Ive been reading as much as I can about the vegas shooting. I read Mike Detty&#39;s book Operation Wide Receiver. It was basically the operation that spawned fast and furious. He was a loner type. Wrote for a gun column but lived alone. In the book he provided pictures of what his living room looked like when he set up buys with the cartel. Guns leaning against walls and stacks of magazines similar to how paddocks room looked. The ATF/FBI tried to erase his computer files that he saved. Audio, video, phone conversations, reciepts. He stored them all on his computer and went to open them when the ATF turned their back on detty. When he went to retreive them the data was all corrupted. Luckily he had backed it all up on an external hard drive. May give creedence to the missing hard drive from paddocks computer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no question the Las Vegas shooting was sketchy.  Over 500 people injured? Even if they were all flesh wounds, with 500 people, there would be a lot of blood. I didn&#39;t see any. Everything about it seemed fishy. Footage was shown of what appeared to be gun fire coming from a different floor other then what we were told and what we were showed on the news with that one room window being shot out. Youtube ended up deleting that video for some reason. Every Picture in the news that was released to the public has the same man in it with a cowboy hat. There supposedly were over 500 people injured. You couldn&#39;t get a different picture with different victims? Did anyone noticed that there was more garbage in that parking lot after the &quot;shooting&quot; than a garbage dump? Seemed very much intentional. Idk what for but it was a dump. Never seen a concert floor that filthy and full of empty water bottles. Security gaurd goes missing, he is then found, before he gives a his story, a private security team is hired by god knows who to watch his house. It seemed more like he was a prisoner in his home rather then for his safety. He never left his home till he then (out of all shows) gives his speech on the ellen show. The story didn&#39;t make any sense. Then ellen reassures him that it is all over and you never have to speak about it ever again??? Suspicious?? Wtf. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in fairness of the people saying it didn’t happen, a family friend was at the festival and thankfully survived, but he’s truly fucked up by it and traumatized, so I don’t doubt that the actual event took place, </p>

<p>but definitely the events surrounding the security guard going on Ellen, and a couple of the other people that went missing after and such, super weird</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk. All I know is that there was incredible evidence we were not given the true narrative. Did you watch the press conference with his brother speaking outside his home? It didn&#39;t feel right. It didnt seem like a real interview. Felt staged. Real questions weren&#39;t asked. The brother seemed off. Like he was prepped. Idk. It was just odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 2000 &quot;election&quot;, specifically when the Supreme Court appointed Bush as president over the voting irregularities that occurred in the state his brother was governor of. Especially because Gore actually got more votes, even in Florida. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton bombing Iraq to distract from the Lewinsky scandal was pretty eye-opening too, but I was a child when that happened and didn&#39;t fully grasp what was happening there until years later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>911 for me and Michael Moore. I kind of dislike Michael nowadays, but as a teen his books and documentaries opened my eyes enough to still be a conspiracy theorist some years later.
I think maybe the x-files at a younger age too in some way and I often think of the poster in molders office. Dude spends his entire life being abducted and shit and has a poster that says &quot;I want to believe&quot;. Even after everything thats happened he still only wants to believe, implying he doesn&#39;t. Some psy-op bullshit going on with that poster, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>911 and Michael Moore&#39;s docs. But then I was asleep for long, minding my own bussiness until mainstream media started hatin&#39; on Trump... Then I thought, what the hell is going on, this guy must be awesome or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Sandy Hook happened I started getting deep into conspiracies and started realizing the media controls what we see. The Boston Bombing was a heck of a story and I remember it happening I was glued to my TV but I feel something just wasn’t right with that either.</p>

<p>It’s very strange how these huge events happen every once in awhile. Obviously us citizens aren’t perfectly at peace with each other, but how all these cases are stopped being talked about a week after, it’s just strange. </p>
