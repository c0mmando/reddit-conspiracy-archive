       Kanye has come out as a Trump supporter twice and both time, the media has said that he has "mental problems" because of his support. They're prob going to send him to "rehab", but actually sending him to get reprogrammed. The thing is MK Ultra is considered a conspiracy and it really isn't because it was declassified by the CIA. Do you guys think that all of Hollywood is controlled by MK Ultra? The science behind MK Ultra is seriously the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, probably the worst thing you can do to a human. Traumatizing someone so much that they develop a new persona because your brain gets rid of your normal persona because it is just way too traumatic, causing you to develop multiple personalities. Nicki Minaj says she has multiple personalities, there is a video of Britney Spears getting interviewed and she switches from one personality to another. Fucking nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: There is declassified material saying how during MK Ultra that they were able to hypnotize people into shooting someone and have the person wake up and have no idea what had happened. Wouldn't be surprised if most of these mass shooters are MK Ultra, to get rid of our guns.

       I feel ya, I'm definitely not for the wars he is continuing and the fact that he wants more nukes. (WTF?!?!?) I hate war and the money it makes. But his strong stance against North Korea def stopped them temporarily, hopefully forever if his talk goes well. But aren't the Rothschild's globalists? Trump hates globalism, but at times he is def not sticking to his America First agenda.

       The Rothschilds are Zionists. Yea, I mean I’m sure you want to hang on to hope that Trump is a good guy and he is fighting globalism. I used to be a Trump supporter as well. I just accept that he’s a total puppet though. I mean the multi trillion dollar omnibus spending bill. The war mongering with North Korea, Syria, and Iran, even Russia. uncaring about NSA and Google spying. Uncaring about the federal reserve manipulating markets and won’t pull us out of the IMF or the World Bank even though it’s totally corrupt. Hell hes even considering putting us back into the TPP. I think Trump was a puppet from the start.

       didnt he bring peace to korea for the first time in like 70 years? tried to withdraw from syria but the chemical attack kept him there against his will. The Iran thing is because he doesn't want to sell them nukes. And Russia is just russia. How are they bad things?

       Uncaring about spying, yet has facebook in court, has shut down loads of sites for trafficking links and his team are trying to get people to demand an internet bill of rights? How is this uncaring? Literally the only government addressing the issue.

       Peace with Korea? Umm it feels like we are going through the exact same things we have been going through. Korea has never invaded anyone, at best they have waged a war of words. They are not a threat, but there are ulterior motives behind the tensions with North Korea. For example they have a 6 trillion dollar mineral reserve beneath them, they print their own money, it isn’t printed by a rogue and private federal reserve. And North Korea has been known to support Israel’s enemies in the past. Trump fails on that front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tried to withdraw us from Syria, but the false flag chemical attack kept us there and made him attack a sovereign nation with cruise missiles? Trump fails with Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Iran thing is because he doesn’t want to sell them nukes”. Wtf that doesn’t make sense. Iran should be allowed to have nukes if Israel and America do. America is the only country to have ever used them and they were used unnecessarily because they would’ve won the war anyways? Israel has access to highly advanced bio-weapons and nukes and they are more hated in the region than Iran is by far due to their destructive imperialism. Iran also has a nationalized central bank meaning they print their own currency not under the guise of a private institution like the Fed. We see the same color revolution psy-ops in Iran like we have in the past with other nations. They highlight the very few people that want regime change and ignore all the citizens content with their current government. He fails there
      </p>
      <p>
       And Russia is just Russia. Stop it, don’t mess with Russia. Trump said he would improve relations with Russia during the campaign and they have actually managed to get worse. He fails there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uncaring about spying? Yea he’s uncaring about spying or otherwise he would’ve at least mentioned that he was attempting to repeal the PATRIOT act and perhaps investigate the NSA instead of continuing to give it taxpayer dollars to remain in operation. As for Facebook it seems like a nothingburger and Zuckerberg will continue to walk as a free man and his company will continue to violate our 4th amendment rights. Trump fails on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t find anything that Trump hasn’t failed on. I gave you a very thorough answer. But the sad thing is you will continue to support Trump and treat him like he is on your side in the fight. He’s not

       North Korea have basically said they're going to denuclearise, that is huge. They're going to have talks with the South. That is huge. If it was any other president they'd be singing about it on the news. They're not a threat to anyone but the south, but now they aren't even a threat to them. All their backers, who emboldened them, have pretty much backed off. These are good things. Sorry Trumps responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel his hands were tied on Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want Iran to have Nukes? REALLY? Fuck me. Another rogue with nukes. That'll help the world. You know if Iran attack Israel we're all backing Israel. Like it or not. That's what will happen. You want to give our enemies nukes just because America and Israel have them? Great logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has done what? NOTHING. They're all talk, as you say. Relations are worse because of the media too and pretty much every western government itching to go to war with them. Is that Trumps fault? He's done a bit to piss them off in retaliation, but whats the alternative? Rolling over? He's handling it well. He can't be too peaceful though or the press will be screaming russian collusion and shit all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you do? Fire all the NSA? Replace with what? What about the CIA? FBI? Do they stay open or close too? Who does their job? What fills the vacuum? 
Literally any government would have let zuckerburg walk. the rich never pay for their crimes. blaming trump for judges decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't think of a single win? How about China trade tariffs? Does he fail there too? Probably in your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can give a long answer, but it doesn't mean you're in any way correct. I know he's not on my side, no politician on the planet is. But he seems better than a lot of them too.
      </p>
      <p>
       We won't agree though, so, lets call it a day, aye? All the best, man

       How is he not sticking to America first? No TPP, no Paris agreement, trying to build a wall, took out deep state strongholds in Syria so we can put it to rest, and now he is likely going to stop the $250 BILLION payments to iran. Seems to be putting the citizens interests first.

       I'm 95&amp;#37; with Trump on everything. But things like him bombing Syria over the fake gas attacks that had zero evidence and him signing that huge budget bill a month ago was a huge loss for his agenda. I just wish he would literally end the CIA and declassify everything that the public should see (things in the past), so the public finally knows about all the dark stuff the CIA has done. Expose everything that is wrong with our government intelligence agencies.

       And yet another puppet of the global elite. The only part that surprises me, is that it took some people so long to figure that out.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I'd recent pointed out recently in a comment regarding the hegelian dialectic scripted narrative of the corporate/mainstream/mockingbird media:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's more that they tend to support neoliberal and neoconservative view points, as they are two sides of the same coin. All other voices are either silenced, ignored or ridiculed. Meanwhile, both sides of the aisle continue to distract the populace with a 24/7 stream of political theatrics in order to keep the people divided and at odds with one another, blaming the other half of the nation and their preferred scapegoat and momentary figurehead (e.g. puppet) while either completely ignoring or becoming completely oblivious to the elite who rule over them.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is one way, one key tactic used to perpetuate the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">
         false left-right paradigm
        </a>
        and control the population.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         False left–right paradigm political theory
        </p>
        <p>
         The "false left–right paradigm" is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book "Tragedy and Hope"—
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers."
         </p>
         <p>
          "Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy."
         </p>
        </blockquote>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In short: distract, divide and conquer.

       Okay? I see you edited your comment above to add the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You're a mod of known TMOR outfits. Hmm...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which I will note was not present in your original comment at the time I responded to it, so I'll respond to it now:
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said before, here and elsewhere, I have and want nothing to do with TMOR. That said, I have managed to get along with one of their mods, who added me as a mod of two of his subs. We get along because we have similar taste in music, which I discovered months back while I was drunk posting music videos, noticing he posted most of the same to his sub, so I started posting them to his sub as well while heavily intoxicated. Since then, we interact occasionally and briefly, albeit not discussing conspiracies, which is probably why we're still able to get along as we do. That's just the kind of person I am. I have a tendency to put differences aside and get along with people with diametrically opposing views, whether political, religious, conspiratorial or what have you. I've also made it known to that individual and others that I want nothing to do with TMOR, do not support what they do, and consider it dickish and unnecessary at best. So there you have it. You can jump to any conclusion you want, as you tend to do, but the fact is the worst thing I'm guilty of would be 'fraternizing with the enemy' if you choose to even look at it that way. I look at it more as I occasionally shoot the shit with a dickish TMOR mod when I'm drunk and now we're on relatively good terms. And I see no reason you and I can't get along as well, if you weren't overly defensive and antagonistic toward me as of late.
      </p>

      <p>
       So what is it I post, in particular, that you have a problem with? If you look at my account history, there's nothing I post that is contrary to this sub or its ideals. I have my own opinions and political leanings, like everyone else, but I never shit on conspiracies or conspiracy theorists like TMOR mods, so implying I'm guilty of the same isn't even remotely accurate let alone a fair comparison. I post regularly, to a variety of subreddits, about a variety of subjects most here would likely agree with, however never to TMOR because as I said I do not agree with what that sub represents and what they do, nor will I take what they do personally or seriously. The moment you do, whether you believe they're trolls or literal shills, they get exactly what they want, which is to ridicule those here and affect them in one way or another, whether to get a rise out of them or demoralize them. I've been targeted by them in the past, when I was a mod here, yet I'm still willing to put our differences aside and not take it personally, and to get along on areas of agreement in spite of it.

      <p>
       I consider it irrelevant, because I don't buy into Vatican disinformation, and already answered the question: I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, or why that would be proof of one concept or another.

      <p>
       Good. I encourage people to archive anything they feel is necessary, but to compare me to a troll from TMOR is bullshit. Everything I stand for, post and do on reddit and in general should make that obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would a TMOR troll post even half the shit I do about the CIA, MKULTRA, the global elite, pedophiles in the elite, etc? Didn't think so.

       Probably the scariest / saddest realisation is that all (/Most) effort to strive to succeed is somewhat useless because the people who succeed / get ahead are groomed / predetermined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more scarier is the idea that there is pretty determined generational breeding of such personas who all help / promote each other.

       mk ultra is the greatest conspiracy of all time. my personal favourite anyway. covers so many other conspiracies at the same time. Can lead to you questioning pretty much everything though and feeling totally mind fucked after so much research.

       Wait until you get the sick feeling in your stomach from realizing a lot of trash fed to us through movies really does and can condition us into a certain line of thinking or way of analyzing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manipulating the co creative power of mankind through the use of subliminals and subversion techniques. Hijacking and capitalizing on the way our brain works and thus hijacking the course of humanity by use of large scale manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fascinating and terrifying because it can be used for purposes of further awareness or used as a means of control, which it has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at most main stream recycled movies that come out these days. Recycled jokes, cliches, boob jokes, over sexualizing the female body, dick jokes, dick pictures, crude and crass humor that is completely immature and illogical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get some people like and enjoy that humor but when movies keep getting further and further degenerate and keep pushing the moral bounds of what we accept as "normal" it gets really fucking dark and can become nefarious and used as a means of control and subjugating a whole population of people and corrupting them from the inside out to make them easier to mold into your liking...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucked the more you research and think about it...

       Reminds me of Will Farrell comedy. Didn't he do some satin ritual?
      </p>

       Also in regards to movies these days... I see alot of Marvel movies and similar just demolishing cities and playing the bad guys vs good guys that are really the bad guys roles.

       Subjects that have 'tunnel vision', those who focus on the central point of their vision, rather than the periphery, are easier to hypnotise/induce a trance in. This is because those who focus on their periphery take in a lot more information and thus, it is hard to 'distract' them and make them focus on one thing (required for hypnosis)
      </p>
      <p>
       When you think about it, people walking around with their phones 2ft from their faces are being condition to focus on the central point of their vision and to ignore the periphery altogether.

       How about If I had 5 concussions? How hard will it be to tap into my brain? I don't even dream anymore, good luck accessing the lil bits of GBs my brain has left to process. I honestly wonder if it's harder when someone has degenerative brain disease.

       Depends on the disease. If you're still high functioning the hypnosis/trance will work. Sometimes it works better on those with brain disease of mental handicap because it's easier to focus the patients' attention onto that.

       I think that's why NSA spying was leaked.

      <p>
       Mass MKUltra through 'truth'.
      </p>
      <p>
       NSA knew that there was just too much data for them to process so their surveillance is broadcast to the masses. Now, since they know that they are being watched and they
       <strong>
        think
       </strong>
       that this is being looked into, they censor themselves, so there's potentially less noise to analyse.

       Hope so. It's literally flat-earth type stuff to a lot of people. From my perspective, even drugging someone up with something that makes them suggestible, strapping a bomb vest to them and sending them to an Iraqi market is itself mind control. But then you have the programmed individuals like Sirhan Sirhan as well as all the MKULTRA proper research. Let's not even get started on trauma-based dissociation mind control.

       You don't need MK Ultra to have someone snap under the pressure and insane expectations. Sure, MK Ultra might be there, but lets imagine MK Ultra never existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the entertainment industry, which is many many billions of dollars. To become a star you give up all semblance of a private life or being able to interact with anyone without questioning their motives. Some people are brought up in this from a very young age. Even with all the money, it's often misspent and mismanaged so people have tons of pressure. Along with this there is a ton of sex and drugs and the related temptations, pimps, and whores. You even have to deal with the "vampires" who thrive under these conditions. Now tell me, how would people snapping under those conditions look different from MK Ultra?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like if MK Ultra exists, it's knowledge would not be used to break people down in those situations, but rather have them survive those situations. What you could be seeing is not the failings of MK Ultra, but simply MK Ultra failing. You're seeing people crash and burn because the pressures of society for a celebrity outweigh the mental conditioning.

       Nicki Minaj has multiple "characters," and she might play it up as personalities for the sake of eccentricity. Britney Spears? I'd have to see the video. Again though, she's been in this for 30 years, since she was a teenager. I think she would have some bad days no matter what. I also knew people growing up who would play up on these things for attentions. Plenty of self-diagnosed autism/bipolar/schizophrenia ... hell even people with "a touch of anyeurysm" (no, you don't have that, you're not dead.) Real multiple personalities are incredibly rare, and not particularly functioning.

       I think that the national security apparatus is about an authoritarian control of society to maintain certain interests. A lot of people dislike authoritarian control (understandably so), and use that to say that the security services are just plain evil. I think that's a mistake to understanding what they do. They're sort of beyond good and evil in this sense -- understandable why this makes people assume they're evil, as this is not an ideological framework people are used to, as the omnipotent and omnipresent becomes a bureaucracy.

       You don't have to buy into this, and I recommend not just buying into anything anyone writes. However, I would encourage you to examine their various purported actions through this lens and see what conclusions you come to.

       Well, that's a new one, I've never seen someone honestly try to argue for mind slavery. To make a diamond out of coal. Trauma based mind control victims are said to have photographic memory, amazing strength, and an unmatched pain tolerance. This is why it is theorized many great athletes and artists are most likely MK Ultra victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human brain is capable of isolating traumatic events in order for the conscious mind to survive and persist. The traumatic event can break the mind into isolated alternate personalities created to deal with said trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is moot in the grand scheme of things because these are people being abused into a slavery of the conscious mind. Every human has the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Who in their right mind would honestly argue for a positive side of MK Ultra? Is there a PR team out there that would honestly stoop this low?

       Where'd you hear that from? The False Memory Syndrome Foundation? Maybe once upon a time it was considered rare. There was a push to discredit DID by the FMSF in the 90's but these days that is a rapidly changing statistic.

       What a petty claim. The point is, the victim has no say in the matter. It is against their will. Any aspect of the outcome that you may find positive is a moot point and insensitive to victims.

       You're right, their statistics are outdated and underwhelming. Here's a quote from the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.isst-d.org/default.asp?contentID=76#prevdd">
        "Some studies indicate that dissociation occurs in approximately two to three percent of the general population. Other studies have estimated a prevalence rate of 10% for all dissociative disorders in the general population (e.g., Loewenstein, 1994). Dissociation may exist in either acute or chronic forms. Immediately following severe trauma, the incidence of dissociative phenomena is remarkably high. Approximately 73% of individuals exposed to a traumatic incident will experience dissociative states during the incident or in the hours, days and weeks following."

       It's almost like most of science is theoretical and ever changing. What's your point? You're just playing devil's advocate.

       A redundant claim that adds nothing new to the discussion. To know your enemy is one thing but to humanize them is sick.

       You asked for a better source to my claims and I gave you a better source. If your not satisfied with the scientific method involved in procuring these results then that's not my problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm giving you credible evidence from a group of doctors that supports my argument. Whether or not you find it satisfactory is irrelevant. The science stands on it's own merit, there's no need for me to defend it. There are far more credible doctors capable of that, you can read their work on the ISSTD website. No need to waste your time refuting the evidence with me. Unless that's your job...

       You can see it in his eyes, in photos of when he was younger, as well as the majority of high-profile mass murderers of late, a wide-eyed blank stare, reflecting an individual who was literally drugged and brainwashed (see my post above for context).

       The first link is listed as an Opinion piece. The second is from a site i've never heard of, and it cites Wendy Williams' opinion. She doesn't have any journalistic background or respect as a media person (except for people who watch her show).

       It is still a dangerous piece by the WaPo (WaPo is part of the CIA), they're trying to sway the opinion of the black population with fake news. The black population should be able to vote whoever they want without backlash.

       people do that all that time, not just celebs. its mental illness... to boot, these people are performers. theres always a persona for the public (which you use to make money out of, with its own set of values for public acceptance), then you have your real one which you cant really just show coz then the fans would boo you... at one people people will just crack and get tired of the shit and just show who they really are

       Didn’t Kayne “break-from-their-control” during that live concert incident? 
He named really big names, so they took him to god-knows-where and reprogrammed him.
He came back a whole different person.

       Now he’s coming out with a new album that is probably tied to the government having a lot to do with it.
No not a political album.

       Ever consider that the conspiracies could be a form of manipulation and mind control? Conspiracy websites and even members of this sub could be manipulating our opinions. There seems to be a hive mind in this sub. For example with the Jew hate and the Bush family hate you see regularly here.

        I was claiming that the intelligence agencies controlling these people acting as bureaucracies rather than individuals. I am trying to say that you should properly understand these people in order to better counteract them.

       A redundant claim that adds nothing new to the discussion. To know your enemy is one thing but to humanize them is sick.

        Of course things are constantly changing. However, you're cherry picking a minority group of professionals that agree with you to be your source.

       You asked for a better source to my claims and I gave you a better source. If your not satisfied with the scientific method involved in procuring these results then that's not my problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm giving you credible evidence from a group of doctors that supports my argument. Whether or not you find it satisfactory is irrelevant. The science stands on it's own merit, there's no need for me to defend it. There are far more credible doctors capable of that, you can read their work on the ISSTD website. No need to waste your time refuting the evidence with me. Unless that's your job...
