        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Kanye has come out as a Trump supporter twice and both time, the media has said that he has &quot;mental problems&quot; because of his support. They&#39;re prob going to send him to &quot;rehab&quot;, but actually sending him to get reprogrammed. The thing is MK Ultra is considered a conspiracy and it really isn&#39;t because it was declassified by the CIA. Do you guys think that all of Hollywood is controlled by MK Ultra? The science behind MK Ultra is seriously the most disgusting thing I&#39;ve ever seen, probably the worst thing you can do to a human. Traumatizing someone so much that they develop a new persona because your brain gets rid of your normal persona because it is just way too traumatic, causing you to develop multiple personalities. Nicki Minaj says she has multiple personalities, there is a video of Britney Spears getting interviewed and she switches from one personality to another. Fucking nuts.</p>

<p>EDIT: There is declassified material saying how during MK Ultra that they were able to hypnotize people into shooting someone and have the person wake up and have no idea what had happened. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if most of these mass shooters are MK Ultra, to get rid of our guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel ya, I&#39;m definitely not for the wars he is continuing and the fact that he wants more nukes. (WTF?!?!?) I hate war and the money it makes. But his strong stance against North Korea def stopped them temporarily, hopefully forever if his talk goes well. But aren&#39;t the Rothschild&#39;s globalists? Trump hates globalism, but at times he is def not sticking to his America First agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschilds are Zionists. Yea, I mean I’m sure you want to hang on to hope that Trump is a good guy and he is fighting globalism. I used to be a Trump supporter as well. I just accept that he’s a total puppet though. I mean the multi trillion dollar omnibus spending bill. The war mongering with North Korea, Syria, and Iran, even Russia. uncaring about NSA and Google spying. Uncaring about the federal reserve manipulating markets and won’t pull us out of the IMF or the World Bank even though it’s totally corrupt. Hell hes even considering putting us back into the TPP. I think Trump was a puppet from the start. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>didnt he bring peace to korea for the first time in like 70 years? tried to withdraw from syria but the chemical attack kept him there against his will. The Iran thing is because he doesn&#39;t want to sell them nukes. And Russia is just russia. How are they bad things?</p>

<p>Uncaring about spying, yet has facebook in court, has shut down loads of sites for trafficking links and his team are trying to get people to demand an internet bill of rights? How is this uncaring? Literally the only government addressing the issue.</p>

<p>One of us must be very wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peace with Korea? Umm it feels like we are going through the exact same things we have been going through. Korea has never invaded anyone, at best they have waged a war of words. They are not a threat, but there are ulterior motives behind the tensions with North Korea. For example they have a 6 trillion dollar mineral reserve beneath them, they print their own money, it isn’t printed by a rogue and private federal reserve. And North Korea has been known to support Israel’s enemies in the past. Trump fails on that front.</p>

<p>Tried to withdraw us from Syria, but the false flag chemical attack kept us there and made him attack a sovereign nation with cruise missiles? Trump fails with Syria.</p>

<p>“The Iran thing is because he doesn’t want to sell them nukes”. Wtf that doesn’t make sense. Iran should be allowed to have nukes if Israel and America do. America is the only country to have ever used them and they were used unnecessarily because they would’ve won the war anyways? Israel has access to highly advanced bio-weapons and nukes and they are more hated in the region than Iran is by far due to their destructive imperialism. Iran also has a nationalized central bank meaning they print their own currency not under the guise of a private institution like the Fed. We see the same color revolution psy-ops in Iran like we have in the past with other nations. They highlight the very few people that want regime change and ignore all the citizens content with their current government. He fails there</p>

<p>And Russia is just Russia. Stop it, don’t mess with Russia. Trump said he would improve relations with Russia during the campaign and they have actually managed to get worse. He fails there. </p>

<p>Uncaring about spying? Yea he’s uncaring about spying or otherwise he would’ve at least mentioned that he was attempting to repeal the PATRIOT act and perhaps investigate the NSA instead of continuing to give it taxpayer dollars to remain in operation. As for Facebook it seems like a nothingburger and Zuckerberg will continue to walk as a free man and his company will continue to violate our 4th amendment rights. Trump fails on that. </p>

<p>I can’t find anything that Trump hasn’t failed on. I gave you a very thorough answer. But the sad thing is you will continue to support Trump and treat him like he is on your side in the fight. He’s not </p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea have basically said they&#39;re going to denuclearise, that is huge. They&#39;re going to have talks with the South. That is huge. If it was any other president they&#39;d be singing about it on the news. They&#39;re not a threat to anyone but the south, but now they aren&#39;t even a threat to them. All their backers, who emboldened them, have pretty much backed off. These are good things. Sorry Trumps responsible.</p>

<p>I feel his hands were tied on Syria.</p>

<p>You want Iran to have Nukes? REALLY? Fuck me. Another rogue with nukes. That&#39;ll help the world. You know if Iran attack Israel we&#39;re all backing Israel. Like it or not. That&#39;s what will happen. You want to give our enemies nukes just because America and Israel have them? Great logic.</p>

<p>Russia has done what? NOTHING. They&#39;re all talk, as you say. Relations are worse because of the media too and pretty much every western government itching to go to war with them. Is that Trumps fault? He&#39;s done a bit to piss them off in retaliation, but whats the alternative? Rolling over? He&#39;s handling it well. He can&#39;t be too peaceful though or the press will be screaming russian collusion and shit all day.</p>

<p>What would you do? Fire all the NSA? Replace with what? What about the CIA? FBI? Do they stay open or close too? Who does their job? What fills the vacuum? 
Literally any government would have let zuckerburg walk. the rich never pay for their crimes. blaming trump for judges decisions.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t think of a single win? How about China trade tariffs? Does he fail there too? Probably in your eyes.</p>

<p>You can give a long answer, but it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re in any way correct. I know he&#39;s not on my side, no politician on the planet is. But he seems better than a lot of them too.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t agree though, so, lets call it a day, aye? All the best, man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet another puppet of the global elite. The only part that surprises me, is that it took some people so long to figure that out.</p>

<p>As I&#39;d recent pointed out recently in a comment regarding the hegelian dialectic scripted narrative of the corporate/mainstream/mockingbird media:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s more that they tend to support neoliberal and neoconservative view points, as they are two sides of the same coin. All other voices are either silenced, ignored or ridiculed. Meanwhile, both sides of the aisle continue to distract the populace with a 24/7 stream of political theatrics in order to keep the people divided and at odds with one another, blaming the other half of the nation and their preferred scapegoat and momentary figurehead (e.g. puppet) while either completely ignoring or becoming completely oblivious to the elite who rule over them.</p>

<p>This is one way, one key tactic used to perpetuate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">false left-right paradigm</a> and control the population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False left–right paradigm political theory</p>

<p>The &quot;false left–right paradigm&quot; is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.</p>

<p>The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class&#39;s hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.</p>

<p>Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can &#39;throw the rascals out&#39; at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: distract, divide and conquer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay? I see you edited your comment above to add the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re a mod of known TMOR outfits. Hmm...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I will note was not present in your original comment at the time I responded to it, so I&#39;ll respond to it now:</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said before, here and elsewhere, I have and want nothing to do with TMOR. That said, I have managed to get along with one of their mods, who added me as a mod of two of his subs. We get along because we have similar taste in music, which I discovered months back while I was drunk posting music videos, noticing he posted most of the same to his sub, so I started posting them to his sub as well while heavily intoxicated. Since then, we interact occasionally and briefly, albeit not discussing conspiracies, which is probably why we&#39;re still able to get along as we do. That&#39;s just the kind of person I am. I have a tendency to put differences aside and get along with people with diametrically opposing views, whether political, religious, conspiratorial or what have you. I&#39;ve also made it known to that individual and others that I want nothing to do with TMOR, do not support what they do, and consider it dickish and unnecessary at best. So there you have it. You can jump to any conclusion you want, as you tend to do, but the fact is the worst thing I&#39;m guilty of would be &#39;fraternizing with the enemy&#39; if you choose to even look at it that way. I look at it more as I occasionally shoot the shit with a dickish TMOR mod when I&#39;m drunk and now we&#39;re on relatively good terms. And I see no reason you and I can&#39;t get along as well, if you weren&#39;t overly defensive and antagonistic toward me as of late.</p>

<p>lol... Okie dokie. All one has to do is check your account history and what subs you mod, and the bullshit you post. You&#39;re not fooling anyone, now (lol)... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is it I post, in particular, that you have a problem with? If you look at my account history, there&#39;s nothing I post that is contrary to this sub or its ideals. I have my own opinions and political leanings, like everyone else, but I never shit on conspiracies or conspiracy theorists like TMOR mods, so implying I&#39;m guilty of the same isn&#39;t even remotely accurate let alone a fair comparison. I post regularly, to a variety of subreddits, about a variety of subjects most here would likely agree with, however never to TMOR because as I said I do not agree with what that sub represents and what they do, nor will I take what they do personally or seriously. The moment you do, whether you believe they&#39;re trolls or literal shills, they get exactly what they want, which is to ridicule those here and affect them in one way or another, whether to get a rise out of them or demoralize them. I&#39;ve been targeted by them in the past, when I was a mod here, yet I&#39;m still willing to put our differences aside and not take it personally, and to get along on areas of agreement in spite of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>answer the question, which was asked, or dodge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which question? If you&#39;re referring this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain his actions/words at the Catholic dinner, then... Those people (actual influential people did not like what he was saying or going to say). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I consider it irrelevant, because I don&#39;t buy into Vatican disinformation, and already answered the question: I&#39;m not sure what that has to do with anything, or why that would be proof of one concept or another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s archived, though (Top Minds hate that) ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good. I encourage people to archive anything they feel is necessary, but to compare me to a troll from TMOR is bullshit. Everything I stand for, post and do on reddit and in general should make that obvious. </p>

<p>Would a TMOR troll post even half the shit I do about the CIA, MKULTRA, the global elite, pedophiles in the elite, etc? Didn&#39;t think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait until you get the sick feeling in your stomach from realizing a lot of trash fed to us through movies really does and can condition us into a certain line of thinking or way of analyzing things. </p>

<p>Manipulating the co creative power of mankind through the use of subliminals and subversion techniques. Hijacking and capitalizing on the way our brain works and thus hijacking the course of humanity by use of large scale manipulation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fascinating and terrifying because it can be used for purposes of further awareness or used as a means of control, which it has.</p>

<p>Look at most main stream recycled movies that come out these days. Recycled jokes, cliches, boob jokes, over sexualizing the female body, dick jokes, dick pictures, crude and crass humor that is completely immature and illogical. </p>

<p>I get some people like and enjoy that humor but when movies keep getting further and further degenerate and keep pushing the moral bounds of what we accept as &quot;normal&quot; it gets really fucking dark and can become nefarious and used as a means of control and subjugating a whole population of people and corrupting them from the inside out to make them easier to mold into your liking...</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucked the more you research and think about it...</p>

<p>Thanks for the post OP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need MK Ultra to have someone snap under the pressure and insane expectations. Sure, MK Ultra might be there, but lets imagine MK Ultra never existed.</p>

<p>You have the entertainment industry, which is many many billions of dollars. To become a star you give up all semblance of a private life or being able to interact with anyone without questioning their motives. Some people are brought up in this from a very young age. Even with all the money, it&#39;s often misspent and mismanaged so people have tons of pressure. Along with this there is a ton of sex and drugs and the related temptations, pimps, and whores. You even have to deal with the &quot;vampires&quot; who thrive under these conditions. Now tell me, how would people snapping under those conditions look different from MK Ultra?</p>

<p>I feel like if MK Ultra exists, it&#39;s knowledge would not be used to break people down in those situations, but rather have them survive those situations. What you could be seeing is not the failings of MK Ultra, but simply MK Ultra failing. You&#39;re seeing people crash and burn because the pressures of society for a celebrity outweigh the mental conditioning.</p>

<p>Nicki Minaj has multiple &quot;characters,&quot; and she might play it up as personalities for the sake of eccentricity. Britney Spears? I&#39;d have to see the video. Again though, she&#39;s been in this for 30 years, since she was a teenager. I think she would have some bad days no matter what. I also knew people growing up who would play up on these things for attentions. Plenty of self-diagnosed autism/bipolar/schizophrenia ... hell even people with &quot;a touch of anyeurysm&quot; (no, you don&#39;t have that, you&#39;re not dead.) Real multiple personalities are incredibly rare, and not particularly functioning.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a new one, I&#39;ve never seen someone honestly try to argue for mind slavery. To make a diamond out of coal. Trauma based mind control victims are said to have photographic memory, amazing strength, and an unmatched pain tolerance. This is why it is theorized many great athletes and artists are most likely MK Ultra victims. </p>

<p>The human brain is capable of isolating traumatic events in order for the conscious mind to survive and persist. The traumatic event can break the mind into isolated alternate personalities created to deal with said trauma.</p>

<p>Your argument is moot in the grand scheme of things because these are people being abused into a slavery of the conscious mind. Every human has the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Who in their right mind would honestly argue for a positive side of MK Ultra? Is there a PR team out there that would honestly stoop this low? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Where&#39;d you hear that from? The False Memory Syndrome Foundation? Maybe once upon a time it was considered rare. There was a push to discredit DID by the FMSF in the 90&#39;s but these days that is a rapidly changing statistic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthyplace.com/abuse/dissociative-identity-disorder/dissociative-identity-disorder-did-statistics-and-facts/">&quot;Dissociative identity disorder has always been considered to be quite rare but it may be more common than previously thought and some estimate it to affect 1% of the population. This higher estimated prevalence may be due to the millions of now reported incidences of childhood abuse (Causes of DID).&quot;</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re right, their statistics are outdated and underwhelming. Here&#39;s a quote from the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.isst-d.org/default.asp?contentID=76#prevdd">&quot;Some studies indicate that dissociation occurs in approximately two to three percent of the general population. Other studies have estimated a prevalence rate of 10% for all dissociative disorders in the general population (e.g., Loewenstein, 1994). Dissociation may exist in either acute or chronic forms. Immediately following severe trauma, the incidence of dissociative phenomena is remarkably high. Approximately 73% of individuals exposed to a traumatic incident will experience dissociative states during the incident or in the hours, days and weeks following.&quot;</a></p>

<p>I really don&#39;t care what you&#39;re opinion of the organization is. ISSTD is ran by physicians and psychologists. They&#39;re more qualified to speak on the issue than most. </p>

<p>What is your argument here? I never claimed we live in an autocratic bureaucracy. You keep making up shit to argue with yourself about. </p>

<p>What does any of the blithering nonsense have to do with my point that you&#39;re humanizing predators that inflict trauma based mind control on their victims? Do you just like to hear yourself talk? What? You put a face to the monster and it changes nothing, it&#39;s still a monster. </p>

<p>You asked for a better source to my claims and I gave you a better source. If your not satisfied with the scientific method involved in procuring these results then that&#39;s not my problem. </p>

<p>I&#39;m giving you credible evidence from a group of doctors that supports my argument. Whether or not you find it satisfactory is irrelevant. The science stands on it&#39;s own merit, there&#39;s no need for me to defend it. There are far more credible doctors capable of that, you can read their work on the ISSTD website. No need to waste your time refuting the evidence with me. Unless that&#39;s your job...</p>
