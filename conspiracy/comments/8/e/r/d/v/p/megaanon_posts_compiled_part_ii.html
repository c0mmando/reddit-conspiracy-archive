       Mega made a note on how George HW will be taken out soon. A few months later: Barbara Bush passes away and HW looks like he's on he's about to pass on. Obviously these two are very old so it could be a coincidence -- but still +1 for Mega
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like we should create a running tab of things that Mega accurately predicted and things that have yet to turn out to be true (ankle bracelets, voter fraud)

       So you think she chose to exit in that manner for reasons of her own?  I thought that maybe some Share Blue person had hacked her email and posted that nonsense.  Do you have any thoughts on why those last posts were the way they were?

       She shared what she needed to, maybe a bit to early, and probably got busted.

       She threw up some subterfuge to exit, done.

      <p>
       There is a ton of money being made by Q and being fronted for Q apps and the like.  Mega had said that Q was 4 staffers being funded by Antifa (Soros).  I am beginning to think she was absolutely right.

       They also completely changed their tune on Q right before going AWOL. Q isn't profiting off of anyone. Only losers begging for subrscribers on YouTube while presenting their own false narrative are the ones attempting to profit.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A loose and informal group of Trump advisers outside the White House, some of whom think the President is being ill served by White House chief of staff John Kelly and White House counsel Don McGahn, have been aggressively campaigning to attack Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as part of a "deep state" plot against the President.
       </p>
       <p>
        The members of this group working to persuade the President and Trump-friendly media include ousted former White House chief strategist Stephen
        <strong>
         Bannon
        </strong>
        , former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, former deputy campaign manager David Bossie, President of the Trump Hispanic Advisory Council (and CNN commentator) Steve Cortes and many others. None of those reached for comment wanted to talk on the record.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group over the weekend seemed to win a battle with White House insiders and succeeded in convincing the President to formally side with Nunes over his own Justice Department.

       IMHO it’s all unfolding as Meg said, just on a very different time table.  I think the time table is fungible based on political strength.  There has been a clear correlation between Trump’s rising popularity and the intensity of the ‘storm’.

       I am still trying to absorb his response about Mega.  Disappointed and yet made sense how she just vanished.
As for your question, my answer is no.  I didn't consider her a CIA plant.  I'm not 100% sure of ETS either.  But his responses are enlightening.  We will see what happens on 06/11/18.

       I was thinking that as well, TW.  Is it possible that Q was posting earlier than he was picked up and followed?  In other words....did Q actually appear earlier but the Q Anon boards didn't collect those 4/8 chan posts?  I don't know how to search the chans so I am not sure if it would have been possible or whether even if it was, that Q's post would have simply been ignored or disregarded.  Until the Huma/Podesta arrests posts came out, I don't think anyone was really paying much attention to anyone by name other than Mega and the FBIanon guy, right?

       No, no such posts. If Eyethespy wants to discredit Megs they have to try harder, and stop larping about aliens.

       It's a good idea to re-read FBIanon because the laptop is in the spotlight again, per the OIG report the emails found on the laptop were and were NOT possible to review (see the
       <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/06/16/ig-report-peter-strzok-statements-about-weiner-abedin-laptop-conflict-with-fbi-claims-about-weiner-abedin-laptop/">

       I agree of course. I am hoping though he's just getting her mixed up with someone else.  It's amusing to me that they (Mega, Q, ETS) seem to agree on almost everything, all the important stuff anyway. Maybe differences in time table, but to me it kind of seems like they're all on the same side. And in ETS's case, he even eludes that Q is Assange. So doesn't it make them crappy controlled opposition if they basically all agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw my opinion on Assange in particular is I don't find it that far-fetched about him possibly being a member of the Q team (along with military intelligence, possibly Trump, etc). Or that Mega would get, for lack of a better phrase, "girly excited" about discovering his part in it, especially if they were friends and not allowed to be in contact or something.  I get the same way when I'm emotional, a personality thing I think. For instance, you guys should've seen my texts and emails after being reunited years later with a beloved pet I never thought I'd see again, with yeah, lots of freaking out from disbelief, !'s and caps.  I think it was that kind of situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when everyone flipped out about it, I think it was too hard for her to come back and know how to explain. I think she just took it as a cue from circumstances that it was time to leave. Just my theory anyway. I have a hard time believing that she's dead or even less that she was CIA. And yes, we should find out how valid ETS really is in just a week anyway.

       I couldn't care less what this ets thing says because I noticed it promotes some alien BS and that's where I draw the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to Megs, we'll see soon if she was right, just watch Mueller and Flynn, and the big picture to emerge. And if she was right, then we were privileged to hear it, quite convincingly, long before any Q showed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, do you know what her main issue with Q was? This: "I’m vague, but I DO NOT mislead." In other words, she noticed that the Qs were running a psyop and she was pissed to see how people started to
       <em>
        deceive
       </em>
       themselves trying to decode all that cryptic rambling. Which, unironically, might not be a bad thing because even good guys use some deception from time to time. A nice history lesson

       Read on GA that this EyeTheSpy was not real trustworthy with info.  I think even 8ch has mentioned that he/she is a disinfo agent.  So...take it as you will.  Just passing info I've read fwd.  Been a very long time since I've checked in here.  Glad I did.

       Definitely disinfo.  Thankfully he wasn't very bright because that was able to be confirmed on the 11th. Q on the other hand seems to be getting confirmed by Trump himself at rallies, super interesting

       I do think the Q being Assange thing has merit.  Timing of extraction from embassy (Mega), start of posting, going dark, potential deal for freedom reached for help draining swamp.  Hence we see an alternative forum for dropping information.  WikiLeaks has been comped.  Just makes sense, doing this at the instruction of the administration.  Plus, who would have or be provided with access to everything?  I think Assange and friends are working for administration to drain corruption worldwide.  So, if Q isn't a larp, there is an idea.  I never believed Mega was a larp and she did call it on her last posts.

       I was following the EyeTheSpy twitter feed on the day he said this about MegaAnon.  He blocked me for challenging his explanation quoted above.  I mentioned MegaAnon had been posting on 4 Chan for years, and then her posts became more frequent during the discussions about Kim Dotcom in May of 2017.  She was around way before the Q movement began.  EyeTheSpy is a total fraud.

       EyeTheSpy is damage control, in my opinion. That he even posts about Mega makes me hope that she's just fine, because he's put a lot of disinfo out. He claims fluoride is just fine in water, vaccines are mostly good, aliens exist but have never interacted with us (yeah, right), time travel is not possible, no weather modification--impossible, no portals, and on and on. He's a distraction. Trying to steal Q's base while Q's not posting, preparing for the storm about to hit, according to this reddit article:

       Anyone can post anything, of course, but almost nothing of what you highlighted above as disinfo matches his responses.  But whatever.  I'm just for us all being accurate and truthful and looking for other's opinions of whether they'd considered what ETS was suggesting.  TW's timeline for example is ACCURATE.  I can consider that as an excellent counter.  To suggest that the guy (ETS) said flouride was fine in water ( when he did NOT ) eliminates your opinion from my consideration.  But that's me.

       Ah, well it was someone in one of my FB groups who said EtS said that fluoride was okay in water, but I did not cross-verify that. It takes hours to go through his posts, as it is. I screenshot a lot of them, and then realized it didn't resonate with me and deleted all of them. I specifically remember him saying that aliens existed but did not interact with us, and that vaccines were "not all bad," that time was linear and therefore impossible, that we didn't have bases on Mars... but whatever. If ONE thing I posted was inaccurate in your view of what I said of him, then by the same token, HIS opinion doesn't count to me because he's posted multiple things I believe to be false. I'm not digging through his channel anymore to prove he said that about fluoride but I'll take your word for it that the FB poster got that one wrong.

       ETS did not claim that fluoride was okay in water.  SMH with the spreading of disinfo. Again, I don't know how legit he is.  But even Q wrote something like "what is up is down, what is left is right".  Perhaps on 06/11/18 we will indeed have a great awakening.

       As for his response about MegaAnon, well.. I hope she gives a shout out when she is able to.  And yes, I still re-read the posts gathered by TW.  Thanks again Todd.

       Thanks, Todd! I have amended my original post to take out the bit about fluoride. I will go back to that FB post where I saw it and say that I've now heard from two sources that it is a false claim, unless he could provide a screenshot. That would be a smoking gun, if he had posted it.

       I miss Mega, and I hope she's okay. David Wilcock said he thought she was okay, just laying low. I hope so. I loved how she laid things right out in an easy to understand way, but I understand now why Q did things so cryptically, if Q IS Military Intelligence.

       And I went back to the FB page and asked anyone if they caught a screenshot of it, and while some remembered seeing it, they haven't been able to find a screenshot yet, but someone else explained that EyeTheSpy has been sanitizing posts--she said her question had been answered about something, and then both her question and his answer got deleted, so they are doing some sanitizing on posts. I'm not sure what to think of Bill Smith yet, but he shows in this video an instance of this "sanitizing" going on, for he posted a video about EtS, who, 5 minutes after the video was posted, issued a response, which he then deleted (I think that was about 5 minutes in--Bill does whinge on a bit).

       My 2 cents:  All of these people, MegaAnon, FBIAnon, QAnon, EyeTheSpy--they are all pushing the same ballpark agenda:  Clinton is Dirty.  There is a Deep State.  A push to drain the swamp.  Not ONE of them has said "Actually, Clinton's not so bad.  It's all a misunderstanding."  So, as far as details are concerned, maybe some of it is disinfo, bullshit, erroneous.  Does it matter?  The truth is the DAMAGE is done for the loss of our societal innocence.  Public awareness is piqued.  People are paying attention and not trusting the mainstream message &amp; propaganda.  The evisceration of the Swamp is happening.  What I am TERRIFIED of, is what happens after?  After we are traumatized by all this, it will leave an emotionally drained and suffered society.  What fills that vacuum?  It could be WORSE.  Think "Game of Thrones" or "Mockingjay" we will be weak, and easily trust anyone who promises to be on the righteous path.  Maybe this is conspiracy overload... but it's not unrealistic.

       No. I have never been impressed with all those attempts to dox a fellow redditor but this claim is particularly easy to debunk. Megs is definitely not TB. TB's videos are archived and is super easy to compare what she had known and commented about BEFORE Mega appeared on May 23, 2017. Cheers.

       So you don't think the exact same tiles in the video are a flag? I mean, if she was LARPing...she would definitely try to use a different persona...that's my guess anyways. I think the whole thing is a little fishy. I wish it were true...I really do..but I have to look at the evidence. Someone who is into every single conspiracy theory and does video after video about Q and all the rest of IC leaks just happens to have the exact same tiles as the one and only Mega Anon...

       So many comments here, debating Meg's infamous statement that "Q is Assange". No, Q is not Assange. If Q is a psyop run by Trump's admin (highly likely), Assange would be the last person chosen the be its face, or one of its operators. Megs got it wrong, and that's why she stopped posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, why don't you focus on the big picture and the modus operandi how to drain the swamp that she started presenting more than a year ago? You would clearly see what roles Mueller, Flynn, and even Comey have, and
       <em>
        look forward
       </em>
       to see it develop, and happen.

       Megs alluded to Strozk being a sheepdipped spook, and that his public persona at FBI was just a cover.
According to this, she was correct (again).

       HLI stands for High Level Insider, the King of 4chan insider anons, in my opinion. He appeared in CF threads on 4ch in July 2016, that is before the election, and had many threads of his own until March 2017 (2000 plus questions and answers). His material has been archived and compiled many times, the most recent and most handy compilation link [here](hli.anoninfo.net). Highly recommneded reading!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       HLI (and his orbital ring space elevator!) was the sole reason I stayed on reddit until October 2017, researching and debating certain stuff, conteplating to leave as nothing much positive was happening, only doomy gloomy Vegas event. But, when a user brought MegaAnon's caps to reddit in early October, a lot she posted resonated with HLI's message, albeit in a much different style and on another, undoubtedly much "lower" level. But she was making clear that Trump was on the right path to
       <em>
        make the world a better place
       </em>
       , so I started reading her posts in detail, and the rest is history... :)

       I’ll need to read this if it’s about a space elevator.  My colleagues at work laughed at me when I proposed such with regard to an ‘infrastructure plan’.   My take is the reason investment in roads/rail/ports paid off so well is because they made brand new connections.  An infrastructure plan that focused on more/repaired of the same stuff would have  only marginal impact.  Folks were throwing around $1 trillion plans to essentially repave roads, I said we should use such a large investment to build a space elevator to make a new connection with ‘space’.

       Ha! That's actually a very intriguing question: was HLI correct and truthful in saying that Trump never intended to win, but when he did, he accepted Three's help?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Trump never expected to win the nomination. His original intention was to be a spoiler for Hillary a la Ross Perot. [...] Trump was going to serve a similar role this election against someone like Cruz, but
        <em>
         ended up winning despite his best efforts
        </em>
        ."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Or, was this particular HLI's comment an essential part of the disinfo &amp; misinfo campaing, a kabuki theatre?
      </p>
      <p>
       Something tells me it's the former, but sadly, history tells us that such aspects of the world events are usually fully revealed only 20 or 50 years after the events took place :(

       HLI saying they would seize the apparatus in 2024 - makes no sense.  you either quietly take action in 2024 or you announce you will do it in the future, but you do it today.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd Foundation (spoiler alert) was what i thought of when HLI described three.  Sci-fi story, galactic empire fell.  2nd foundation was announced 1000 years in advance IIRC to aid in coming out of the galactic dark ages, but they were always there from the start, working quietly behind the scenes.

       It definitely made sense to me, every time he mentioned it (August, September, November 2016, and January 2017). Here's one of the quotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We will seize the US government via presidential election in 2024 (or by other means sooner if necessary) and unleash decades of pent up technological development. "

       Have you seen the announcement that President Trump will be sending a test message through the wireless emergency broadcast system? Sounds familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for maintaining this, by the way. I was disappointed in how many things didn't happen the way Meg predicted or as quickly as she thought, and I think she made some educated guesses on matters outside her field that didn't pay off. But it's good to come back here once in a while and see how much things are generally proceding in the directions she talked about.

       I found very intriguing 'crumbs' in the recent Wilcock's blog. He wrote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Q admitted that they had to put out disinformation at times for operational reasons.
Therefore, the idea that these operations would begin in “the next several days” was incorrect.
However, Mega Anon told us that
        <em>
         there was indeed a plan on the books to do the arrests within this exact timeframe, as a reaction to the Vegas atrocities, and they had to be scrapped.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And, referring to another source (CG), DW added:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It was further revealed that the Secret Grand Juries were almost totally complete with their investigations when everything changed.
They had sealed indictments being prepared when they received a cache of new info that gave them a wider net to cast.
Their investigation has since expanded dramatically….

       It does sound plausible, but everything kinda has to, if we accept that the good guys need to spread disinformation too.

       I'm not  convinced it's her, but you might want to see for yourself:

       Why do you think so? Seems like her. She apparently posted on Sept 30 as well basically confirming that dropped an analysis I never thought of, said that fbi investigation would show nothing, Kavanaugh would be confirmed, that Dianne f is screwed, and showed a pic on ford's polygraph that i never saw before. a lot of tell tale signs of mega.

       In Lord_Mhoram's post, he links to a 4chan thread. The user with the ID of '1E/yXWjy' definitely appears to be Mega in large part because:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Distinctive voice
       </li>
       <li>
        Predictions which seem to be coming true
       </li>
       <li>
        Just a way of looking at the situation that is distinct and like her
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There was another post by this same person on Sept 30 FYI

       curious: why do you think that's not her? the main warning sign is that photo she dropped of her feet was already seen before.

       Why should I waste my time on analyzing such a poor attempt to impersonate /our girl/?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why do you keep searching for her? She's gone; and although she was a good companion in 2017, some things changed / got delayed. We'll see in December, at the latest, whether she was at least partially correct regarding the "big picture".

       Not to sound dramatic, Mega by far was one of the most eye-opening writers I have ever read.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have research politics, history, news etc for years...yet, when she posted, she just said things that were just so clear and mind opening in the matter of a few paragraphs. She clarified things to where I now have significant confidence in what I think (whereas before I would get into significant analysis paralysis).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's mega. Maybe its because I want to believe.

       Could be. She wasn't doing any of her y'all/brah stuff, but that could have been trying to keep a lower profile. The usual LARP-hunters got pretty worked up as it is. I haven't seen anything of her since, real or fake. She didn't try to give any explanation of where she's been all this time, which is where she'd have to start to get any credibility.

       It does sound plausible, but everything kinda has to, if we accept that the good guys need to spread disinformation too.
