       They're trying to make it ok to arrest people on suspicion of committing a crime; to create a literal thought police force with which they plan to quash dissent of any kind under the pretense of "y-you don't want another mass shooter, right? Haven't you noticed? Since we started arresting all the thought criminals we haven't perpetrated a single false fl... err. There hasn't been a single mass shooter!". That's the goal. That's what this is all about. "Well yeah we interviewed them and yeah they seemed crazy and unstable and their garage was full of guns but they didn't do anything yet so what can you do?". They're hoping the public will say "well lock him up if you're pretty sure! He doesn't have to actually do it!" This is so dumb and so evil and so obvious, but god damn it, it will probably work because we are a nation of idiots, by and large.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, remember that kid who had a folder of Jew memes, who wrote that dumb "Killing my first Jew" note, and got arrested last week for
       <em>
        attempted hate speech
       </em>
       or some such nonsense, despite never doing anything close to what these other mass shooters do and have done by the time they are met with by authorities? He's going to jail for like
       <strong>
        6 years
       </strong>
       , because he's not part of this psyop, and he made the people who are running this psyop scared of what he might do to them, so they locked him up on trumped up charges. This proves they can already do what they are supposedly unable to do, but that it is so wrong, so blatantly against all it means to be free, they need "wider powers", as they always call the goal of their myriad sordid power grabs. If he would have written notes about "gonna shoot the school up lol", he would have been questioned, released, and the Feinsteins of the world would be rubbing their hands in anticipation as they do, just salivating at the thought of the kids he'd kill and how they can use their still-cooling bodies to take more freedoms away from innocent Americans in preparation for the creation of their totalitarian world government. But he didn't. He had a joke folder and made a retarded note, which was on his PC and never posted anywhere, and they arrested him, because of the group he was talking about going after.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to talk about the elephant in the room: Zionists have the most to gain from all of this; a history of similar tactics; and now we have direct evidence of a bias in the way they are treated as compared to the innocent school children who are allowed to be massacred in order to further these same Zionists' goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so obvious but everyone is so afraid to stand up to Zionists for fear of being called a racist or an antisemite or a nazi that they just zip it, or they convince themselves that their comfy lie is true after all.

       Come back with an actual metaphor that accurately presents what youre trying to defend because you keep using completely different metaphores that dont accurately compare the two

       As I said. Op isn't telling the whole story. I bet theres a little more than a few memes and a single note saying killing my first jew.

       The shit in Britain is fucking insane. I cancelled my plans to go to the manchester united season opener and emailed the manchester mayor telling him why me and a dozen friends wont be going bc I saw an article that had some 12 year old girl getting jumped and cops not even bothering to look into it bc its a waste of resources while they have like 600 thought cops.

      <p>
       I think op isnt being honest. But in also think Britain is heading in the wrong direction.

       I just think theres a huge line between threatening to kill someone and simple thought crime :) life shpuld be preserved for when it is lost its lost for good

       "Sentence enhancers".... Our justice system is as stupid as spongebob. Also, if you look at the actual docket, it's not "making criminal threats". It is
       <strong>
        attempted
       </strong>
       criminal threats. Anybody who researches the crimes of states and writes "I really want to finally stand up and take action - by force if necessary - against these criminal scum" would be susceptible to these "charges".

       Dont threaten to kill people and you wont get in trouble. Its pretty simple. And far different than having a folder laveled child porn with flowers. But its ok. Ypure doing what op did. Trying to present your narrative positively while dismissing what doesnt show your narrative in a positive light.

       “Thought crime”. Unless the person was actually caught attempting to kill someone, these are both on the same category. By your logic, anyone who has ever said “I’m going to kill ....” should be arrested.

       I am disappointed in you. From what I have seen of your other posts, I would not have expected that you would stoop to pretentiousness in an attempt to mask hatred. You should also think about what it means that you downvote those with whom you are personally arguing.
