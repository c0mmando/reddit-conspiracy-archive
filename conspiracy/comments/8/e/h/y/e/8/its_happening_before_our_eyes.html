    <div class="md"><p>The disclosure of the truth of ET existence on and around (and <em>in</em>) this planet will happen first when the toppling of TPTB occurs, for they are the influence on this planet responsible for the dumbing down and the emasculating of the public.  We have allowed ourselves to believe them to too great an extent, and they have sold us little more than a pack of debilitating lies - lies meant to keep us sequestered in a state of fear and isolation and helplessness.</p>

<p>It is up to us to break out of that cycle because they - being the ones who <em>put</em> us in it to begin with - certainly aren’t going to help us.  They might be helping us by giving us the in-our-faces elements that obviously need to and should be fought against (not just physical fighting, but spiritually, psychologically, and emotionally), but it is up to no one but <em>us</em> to actually undertake the battle and overcome the quarantine of deep ignorance that has shrouded our lives.</p>

<p>Sounds about right to me.  It’s not an “on/off” switch.  It’s a light with a dimmer switch that has continuous gradients to it - one moment a little less aware, the next a little more…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Change is happening all the time.</p>

<p>Agreed and correct as far as I see it.</p>

<p>People are becoming more aware, both of themselves, as well as the deeper nature and layers of our reality, both in the sociopolitical, as well as the metaphysical level.</p>

<p>Not sure this guy doesn’t get it.</p>

<p>(That’s a double negative by the way - a thing I’m wont to use - which actually means the opposite of what it might otherwise appear to mean to some)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is happening and it has been happening for a while. Things are simultaneously getting better and worse (because for the new to come, the old must dissolve, which can be peaceful, but is often chaotic due to unconsciousness and lack of clarity on a path forward) the ups and downs, the polarities are more apparent and the insanities and corruption present on our planet are more visible than ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>This guy definitely gets it.  Yep.</p>

<p>Well-said, man.  Totally agree w/everything you said here.</p>

<p>Can’t upvote the rest of what you said hard enough as well.</p>

<p>I might not be <em>quite</em> as optimistic as you, but we absolutely share the same general sentiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s definitely a part of what you just said here that does in fact seem very true.  Yes.  However, I would be remiss to fail to mention that there has in fact been quite a bit of documentation regarding the ending of a big, civilizational cycle.  In Hindu literature, it’s called a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yuga">Yuga</a>, with this yuga/age that we’ve all been in called the <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/search?tt=waterfox&amp;amp;q=kali+yuga">Kali Yuga</a>.  It’s also known as the <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/search?tt=waterfox&amp;amp;q=kali+yuga">“age of the demon”</a> for what I think many of us would agree are rather obvious reasons.  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Emfpzv5.png">Although we have been in this age for quite some time, it’s also mentioned that we should be just about coming out of it.</a>  I imagine this is the reason why many seem to be “feeling” like times are a changing, etc.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say the feeling is <em>entirely</em> unfounded, but - again, and as I said above - I’m pretty darn ready for all this horrible bullshit this planet’s been afflicted with to just be done and over with (although I fully acknowledge that it very well may not happen for some time still, if at all).</p>

<p>Sure - and “not so smart” on many occasions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To think your life is being changed but some secret cabal is kind of funny</p>

<p>No it isn’t, as a matter of fact - not when there is so much absolutely in-your-face overwhelming evidence for anyone with eyes to see.</p>

<p>but the truth is much simpler than that.</p>

<p>The truth is rather more complicated, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day there is nothing mystical, magical, or spiritual going on. Aliens are not here.</p>

<p>You couldn’t be more wrong.  You only say this because you are ignorant of the truth - and you have been <em>made</em> ignorant by the society and civilization you live in.  You are definitely not alone, unfortunately, as there are many like this.</p>

<p>No idea who that is, but that is pretty badly incorrect as well.</p>

<p>This and various other statements on your part are what are called “trivia truths”.  It’s a statement where the most appropriate response is “Yeah…<em>and?”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technology ebbed and flowed with lack of persistent records.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that’s definitely the case with the lack of persistent records given to the 99% of humanity.  That much is absolutely certain.  This says nothing where it regards what covert individuals and groups are privy to, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many ancient architecture sites were crafted without exact knowledge so trying to explain them with current concepts does not work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a horrendously fallacious statement that says “The reason we can’t figure it out with our current instruments and concepts is because it was crafted without exact knowledge.”  Wow.  Really?</p>

<p>If there’s anyone that doesn’t have exact knowledge, it is the current incarnation of humanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans are a symptom of life, not the reason for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another trivial truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not special.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>AAaaanOOOTHER</em> trivial truth. lol.  Does it make you feel good saying things that are obvious, trivial, and borderline nonsensical?</p>

<p>You’re working hard at asserting a faux level of knowledge and superiority by attempting to spout pretty much useless data and trying to pass it off as…as…I don’t know…something that makes you look knowledgable?</p>

<p>Conspiratards are the bottom-of-the-barrel debate material since you find a nuanced perch from which to spew so much ambiguity that respondents can&#39;t keep up with providing facts, much less does anyone want to waste time providing facts when you&#39;re just going to plug your ears and veer further off into whatever somatic enclave of bullshit you&#39;ve established.</p>

Come gather &#39;round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You&#39;ll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin&#39;
Then you better start swimmin&#39;
Or you&#39;ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin&#39;.</p>

<p>Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won&#39;t come again
And don&#39;t speak too soon
For the wheel&#39;s still in spin
And there&#39;s no tellin&#39; who
That it&#39;s namin&#39;.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin&#39;.</p>

<p>Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don&#39;t stand in the doorway
Don&#39;t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There&#39;s a battle outside
And it is ragin&#39;.
It&#39;ll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin&#39;.</p>

<p>Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don&#39;t criticize
What you can&#39;t understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin&#39;.
Please get out of the new one
If you can&#39;t lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin&#39;.</p>

<p>The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin&#39;.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin&#39;.*</p>

<p>what are the celebrities speaking out against?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sexual assault mostly. There&#39;s also some speaking out against pedophilia in Hollywood too. Why should you care? Because breaking the conspiracy of silence that protects sexual predators is a good thing. As for the idea of ordinary people waking up? Polls show that trust in mass media is at all-time lows, and the Internet is being used for things like crowdsourced &quot;pizzagate&quot; investigations and the &quot;me too&quot; movement encouraging victims of assault to discuss openly what has happened to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, humans are just smart apes running around trying to make sense of things. To think your life is being changed but some secret cabal is kind of funny, but the truth is much simpler than that. At the end of the day there is nothing mystical, magical, or spiritual going on. Aliens are not here. Discounting some of the smartest minds in the world because you have feels is pretty absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you may find yourself
Living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself
In another part of the world
And you may find yourself
Behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house
With a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, well
How did I get here?</p>

<p>Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money&#39;s gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground</p>

<p>And you may ask yourself
How do I work this?
And you may ask yourself
Where is that large automobile?
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful house!
And you may tell yourself
This is not my beautiful wife!</p>

<p>Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money&#39;s gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground</p>

<p>Same as it ever was
Same as it ever was</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be tough, I know. </p>

<p>But if you start small and begin with yourself, then you can extend that to life in general.</p>

<p>Ultimately from my experience, if you really trust yourself, you are already trusting life, becaue you and life are not truly separate. Similarly, if you trust life, your self-trust will grow as well.</p>
