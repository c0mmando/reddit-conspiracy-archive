       The title essentially says it all, but this is something that weighs on me heavily, and I feel it needs to be expanded upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I think part of this orchestrated finale' divide and conquer strategy requires lots of politicization from the media and the social engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, the people who's job it is to monitor this sub, and assess the stuff we talk about, are aware of the large following we have gotten following the Pizzagate developments. If the stuff we talk about and discuss here, and the sources and information we share became "mainstream", it would be detrimental to TPTB. So, they have determined that a really great way to discredit us, would be to simply brand us as this uglier, crazier extension of the Rep. party, who are motivated to take down democrats with our wild Pizza shop sex ring witch hunt. This is being done by design to create animosity and tension from the liberals, onto us. The liberals still largely trust in the state, we need to be able to reach them and red pill them. The shills are protecting that from happening by politicizing us as alt right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it was the Clinton camp who was implicated in John Podesta's emails (he himself being the chairman of her campaign). It only made sense for the social engineers to paint us as a "radical alt right group that is politically motivated to put Clinton in jail".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget that our "buddy" Alex Jones, a man who once stood against the notion of wealthy and preselected political puppets, fully endorsed Trump in 2016. AJ has been a big face of the conspiracy culture for a long time. Many of us believe he is a limited hangout/controlled opposition. Is it possible that he (after years of getting the trust of his supporters and listeners), had been instructed to lead his massive following toward a "False Prophet"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy culture/community is notorious for being skeptical of government. It seemed to me very out of character for Jones to blatantly endorse a political nominee who wasn't consistent with the constitution and Bill of rights as Ron Paul was. By politicizing our movement as "right wing" and the stuff we talk about and try to expose as "politically motivated", it immediately dilutes the value of what we stand for, and discredits us. They immediately cut the amount of people we can reach in half (the entire left) by branding us as a conservative fuck fest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's important to note, considering how Trump has been portrayed by the media as racist (especially by liberals), and as a sexist pig, WE will be looked at as racist and sexist for being associated with Trump. Jones doesn't ever seem to address this for some reason, and it is a huge concern of mine. The CTR campaign is updated and filled in on the agenda, I'm seeing them prop up this narrative and labeling us as a Trump bee hive all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, the social engineers are very intelligent and know what they are doing. What is the long term effect of this? Can we try to come up with a way to reverse it? Do what you can to call out shills that try to push this shit. We need to be able to reach people on both the left and the right, and they are trying to prevent that from happening with this clever political psy op.

       Conspiracy minded people tend to be more Conservative. Though it is good to have bi partisan appeal, Alex Jones and people of his ilk do make good arguments against social justice warriors, leftists, and progressives. The problem is he probably spends too much time attacking them and not enough time focusing on the bankers.

       Conspiracy minded people lean left, its just the people whose understanding of conspiracies is separate from a systemic analysis of the world that lean right.  Capitalism and imperialism are the biggest conspiracies out there, after all.  And if you're honestly worried about the bankers you should be supporting the lefties, progressives, and "SJWs," Alex Jones and every other entertainers of that ilk functions by distracting their audience from the real dangers to their liberty.

       That’s exactly what The Young Turks does. They cover way too many stories of right wing violence and incidents of racism that just do not happen very much on the grand scale of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Minded People most definitely lean right. It is the leftists that have the most faith in the Mainstream Media and it is the leftists that parrot talking points from the mainstream media such as Trump Russia collusion and climate change and the idea that Assad gassed his own people. The mainstream media is clearly the most elitist, corporate, capitalistic, owned by bankers news that there is and it is leftists that tend to parrot the Neoliberal talking points from the mainstream media. Sure capitalism is a conspiracy theory but you act like there is no socialism conspiracy theories, when we can clearly see that more and more people are becoming dependent on government aid. More and more people need welfare. The idea of a Universal basic income and universal health care is very popular on the left. The left literally wants to expand government, the same government responsible for imperialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never support SJW’s. You do realize that there is an extreme overrepresentation of Jewish people on the executive boards of the biggest banks right? And SJW’s, leftists, progressives spend more time and energy focusing on the people that point that fact out AKA “Evil NAZIS” instead of actually covering the predatory practices of big banks, and the completely inhumane Banker bailouts, and corruption within the federal reserve and the effects of fractional reserve banking on the economy. SJWs work for the big banks. They are a product of mainstream propaganda that was paid for by big bankers. Look how you have hundreds of idiot leftist protesters at a Ben Shapiro speech and none of them are out protesting big banks and big corporations. Millions march in opposition to Donald Trumps “sexism” and none of you come out of your shells when he wants to strike a sovereign country in Syria based on a pack of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t even with you people, you leftists are so stupid. Alex Jones is completely right about you guys. You absolutely hate the Constitution and Americanism and you are pawns for the international bankers and the people that wish to control us.

       Capitalism works great, for the capitalists.  The liberal media just never pays any attention to the people who get ground up to produce that wealth for the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush administration and its appointees thought up the 2008 bailouts, and administered a good chunk of them.  BTW, if you think Obama and his economic team were left wing you're delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Canadian bill you're referencing does not allow them to jail people for not recognizing someone's preferred pronoun.  That's a transparent mischaracterization, and if you'd done an iota of independent research on it instead of just imbibing the propaganda, you'd know that.  Besides, shouldn't trans people get to enjoy liberty too?

       To the second part, I agree Bush had his hand in creating it, but both sides of the isle were in full agreement of it being “necessary”. And are you trying to say that Obama wasn’t a “progressive SJW liberal”?
      </p>
      <p>
       To your third point I’ll ask you... what do you think happens if you refuse to pay the thousands of dollars in fines that the law DOES allow?? I know very much about the topic, not just a “transparent mid characterization from imbibing propaganda” as you try to claim.

       Objectively speaking, Social Democracy has the best track record.  If you ask socialists, that's capitalism, and if you ask capitalists, that's socialist, but its certainly well to the left of the current US.  And while I'm not a fan of Leninism, its intellectually dishonest to directly compare the performance of two systems when one had to start from scratch while the other a) enjoys the accumulated loot of continents, and b) only functions thanks to the continuing exploitation of large swathes of the globe whose grinding poverty never gets factored into the verdict.

       Liberal =/= leftist (nice goalpost shifting), SJW is an empty strawperson, and progressive is vague to the point of meaninglessness.  Call him whatever epithets you want; his economic policy was not left-wing.

       Don't worry, I vote early and often, and bring a busload of undocumented immigrants with me each time I go to the polls.  Seriously though, someone with as tenuous a grasp on reality as you have really shouldn't be voting.  Unlike you though, I don't hope the coercive force of the system prevents the people I disagree with from exercising their franchise.

       Other than the ridiculousness of identity politics, which current policies of the democrats would you described as "left wing" ?

      <p>
       Socialized health care and education are nice, but such "social democracy" programs are entrenched in Europe and Eurasia because they support a capitalist economy, and are not in opposition to it at all.

       We have Central Economic Planning, and a plethora of Social Programs, both are Socialist-Marxist. So, we do have a "left wing" in the US, and most Democrats and Republicans adhere to it (unbeknownst to them - the goal)

        [F]ascism and communism are not two opposites, but two rival gangs fighting over the same territory—both are variants of statism, based on the collectivist principle that man is the rightless slave of the state.

       The Left in the US has been so hollowed out that all that remains is some unpopular identity politics an a democratic party that mouths platitudes whilst carrying on the same program of sucking up to their wealthy donors.

       Not really, actually. Take a look at the debt. That's like saying your neighbor who put everything on credit is more wealthy than the neighbor who has actual sayings, but little to no "fancy toys".

       The bigger the government, the more income disparity. Fact. Look at the stats.

       Tell me what is Capitalistic about the US. We have Central Economic Planning, Social programs, regulations, taxes, etc etc. What is Capitalistic about any of those? We are a Socialist country, but, Socialists do not want to admit it, or, they do not even know.

       Well, profits are still privatised while losses are socialised. That's not "socialism".
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO the old definitions don't really work to describe the current reality adequate so people see something which doesn't fit into their idea of what socialism or capitalism is and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the inverted totalitarianism concept by Chris Hedges the same inversion happened with capitalistic and socialistic methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classic socialism ideas like Monopoly laws have vanished for instance and these days Google/FB "should" have been classic examples of companies who should be dismantled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have distorted form of crony capitalism where there seems to be some socialistic understanding for the people inside the group which switch between these favoured corporations and the state.

       The debt is not held in common, it's a credit to "The Federal Reserve", there's no legal for the gov't to borrow money or organize itself as a for-profit corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The credit that the Fed "has" is an accounting trick called easing, which is legalese for lying.

       Another way of say this is, nobody has $14 trillion they can just lend out.

       No, it's not. It would need a) officers (it has none) b) a store front (it has none) and c) articles of incorporation from a gov't

       So, we've reached a conundrum. But this is solved by the fact that the Congress declared it can

       a corporation, to get around the legal requirement for the above mentioned duties.

       Lmfao. We pay tons more per capita for healthcare than we would under single payer even though many of us only ever see a doctor for emergencies and as a nation we're unhealthy as fuck with a comparatively garbage life expectancy and infant mortality rate. We pay tons more for secondary education than countries with socialized university systems do and yet our schools are falling behind. But yes, supporting the socialization of a few essential services that shouldn't be operated like everyday businesses makes an otherwise extremely capitalistic society a socialist hellhole. You know literally nothing.

       The US most definitely wants socialism.  Bernie was building quite a bit of momentum and before that we had OWS.  However socialism is outside of the media's chosen Overton window, so it is actively shut down and not allowed to be discussed.

       Mass immigration isn't particularly "left" or "right" except for those who see not being racist as a hallmark of the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see the 2nd amendment as left vs. right.
      </p>
      <p>
       More lenient drug laws is Libertarian which is traditionally associated with the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       More lenient policies for felons doesn't seem left or right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher taxes is left, perhaps, but only if it is used to support the people, which I don't think it is.  Expanding government spending and increasing government spending is a hallmark of Republican governments.

      <p>
       Agains, I don't see why "oppressing minorities" should be regarded as left or right-wing.

       My spidey sense tells me that this is pure GARBAGE. Alex Jones has done more to wake up America then anyone else I can think of.

       Donald Trump has always been a New York outsider who "TPTB" has tried to take down several times.

       People are starting to judge people by what they do and not what they are labeled.

       There is a MAJOR attack on Alex Jones and Donald Trump that is 100% coming from the top  aka "TPTB" as you generically coin it.

       Something major is coming and they don't want Alex to have a platform. Trump is the real deal and our only hope.

       Is it not fair to say that trump
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       selling your country out, considering his appointments of people like Scott Pruitt who ruthlessly exploit American taxpayer money for personal gain, his facilitating of clear quid pro quos between his son in law and foreign states to the tune of billions of dollars, his own personal milking of taxpayer money for golfing trips, the quid pro quo between Sinclair Broadcasting and his administration, etc...
      </p>

       Surely if trump was your only chance against America being sold out, he wouldn't be actively selling it out himself?

       Pruitt is an example of someone appointed by Trump, in which they
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-11/first-class-problem-pressure-mounts-over-epa-chief-s-spending">

        defended by Trump
       </a>
       . Thus Trump is facilitating someone who is exploiting the American taxpayer, as Trump himself does by
       <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/20/trumps-travel-costs-during-his-first-year-exceed-13-million-dollars.html">
        spending millions on golfing trips
       </a>
       (I thought he was a "billionnaire"? Why does he need to take money from the American public?)
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll have to enlighten me as to what the "bigger picture here" is. Because for all available evidence, as far as I can see, Donald Trump is doing nothing in terms of
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       selling out the US, whereas there is plenty of evidence that he is
       <strong>
        actively selling it out
       </strong>
       . I didn't even mention the GOP tax bill before. Trump has added an expected  trillion+ dollars to the national debt, while making the rich richer (including himself and his family!) at the expense of the children of tomorrow, who you say he is the only hope for? Can you explain that contradiction?
      </p>
      <p>
       And for "the children's future", surely the best defender is someone who actually believes in Climate Change, who believes in science, not someone who takes active measures towards ruining our ability to survive on the planet?

       sure. I don't think I was replying directly to you. But I honestly CBA going back to check :) I was reading through the list the other day, ofc some of it is just pruning back over bloated bureaucracy but holy shit at some of the stuff he has cut out that pertains to environmental protections etc. I honestly don't understand how anyone can defend this guy being given a position like this.

       I didn't say anything in defense of anyone. All I did was read this thread, and see
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       making claims of "staggering deregulation", and then dodging the question when asked to substantiate that claim by another user. Then, rather than link a source, or even provide a SINGLE example, you just accuse the other person as being lazy and to do their own research. Not only is that incredibly unhelpful in a forum like this, but it also makes people like me think that you are just parroting whatever nonsense is coming out of the TV this week.

       Verified emissions from a company’s industrial expansion are what the company says they are. (Now the EPA will simply take estimates at face value.)

      </p>
      <p>
       Required companies to disclose which hazardous chemicals they’re storing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banned the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos.

      <p>
       Protected tributaries of sensitive bodies of water (even though the EPA’s analysis showed it would cost less to prevent the pollution than to allow it)

       Repealed the Clean Power act. (this might not be as bad as it seems, I don't really know how this negatively impacted the US)

       This is before you even get into his background about all the shady shit he has been caught doing while shilling

      <p>
       From my understanding, the EPA was a bloated mess and needed trimming down, if this is all he was doing then fine, but to ignore all the other shit he is doing is just willful ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This took me like 30 seconds to find. I don't believe you are a stupid person so I can only assume you knew all this and either couldn't give a shiit or are just trying to make me out to be a liar for some other agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say again and double down Scott Pruit is a piece of shit and should not hold this position.

       Now THAT is how you reply to someone asking you for an example! Thank you for taking the time to do that. My point was not to defend Pruit or the other user, but simply to point out that telling people to look it up is a weak response to someone challenging your claims. The point is to have a discussion, right? You make a claim, I challenge it, you provide a source or an example of said claim, and then I respond with an analysis. Either explaining why I disagree with it, or not being able to disagree with it and we come to an agreement.

       the Iago comment was fine. I wasn't pissed off or anything lol. I actually looked it up and read a little about the character before responding, so that was fun.

       I am fine for having a discussion about anything with anyone, I don't ascribe to the whole split the public dynamic. People are people and there and good and bad people in all walks of life. I don't make assumptions on this just because of what they do and what their politics are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disliked you accused me of spouting talking points, I make my own decisions. People on this sub are far to quick to assume someone gets all their info and believes everything they see on tv
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is while I believe challenging fringe or outlandish statements/opinions are fine and should be encouraged, the statement I made was neither, it really is just common knowledge for anyone that is slightly aware and as such I found the source demand unnecessary. That said, I handled it badly and really should of just taken the 5 min and done it and then voiced my objection of having to  do busy work :) Sorry for being a bit of a dick!

       This is why it isn't worth bothering half the time on this sub. It is just full of partisan people that don't give 2 shits about anything other than making sure their party doesn't look bad, even if it means agreeing with dumb and horrible shit they do.

       I am 100% sure some of the stuff is just cutting the fat from a bloated mess off a bureaucracy (and that is more than fine) but it's all the other shit on the side, the stuff I listed was just shit I could find quickly that I could back up  if I had to. I am fairly sure there is other stuff relating to oil drilling off your west coast and stuff around Alaska way etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand (please correct me if I am wrong, I am not American) that deregulation and slimming down of government powers is one of the Republican tenants? (let not get into defence spending and alphabet support)
      </p>
      <p>
       So sure reduce waste, remove layers of bureaucracy and limit some of their powers, but there is
       <strong>
        no
       </strong>
       good side to shitting on the environment so your friends in an industry you are still intimately connected to can do whatever the fuck they like that without fear of being caught. Even if they do get caught now protections that were in place are now gone meaning nothing will be done about it apart from some bad press.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you can ignore the rife rumours surrounding his time in the Senate (rumours don't always mean there is fire) and other shit that is more than rumours (it's 2am here and I'm high, really cba sourcing) Put him in the cabinet in an Industry position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting a man that has spent his career shilling for organisations that shit all over the environment in charge of an agency that is supposed to protect said environment really is a disgrace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure some deregulations have deeper reasoning behind them but they could never cancel out the damage this man could and is trying to do to your beautiful country all in the name of $$$

       I only asked what you consider to be so important that it nullifies the committed efforts of the Trump administration to plow on with the exact same kind of shady dealings you rail against as "selling out the country".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't explain this then that's something you'll have to have a big think about. If you
       <em>
        really, genuinely
       </em>
       hate the selling out of America, why are you staunchly defending someone who does just that?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're a climate change denier then that sucks man, and you should look into it, it's not exactly disputed in scientific circles. Also the likely outcomes i.e. immense flooding/ecological damage and how this is likely to effect you personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned Pruitt in passing as an example.

       This is why your going to lose. We see you. You dont really care about any of these issues. Its just one big roundabout of endless dumb questions from some "person" who wants to come off intelligent with your copy and paste algorithms, not for me, but your average lurker who will scroll through this page.

       He's asking you why you're a hypocrite in principle. Why is it ok for one side to do something you accuse the other side of also doing? Pruitt's pretty obvious abuses of spending are ok?

       You can also drop the climate change stuff. We get it. You think it's unaffected by carbon emissions. Others do not. No point in arguing it, nor is it an excuse to avoid answering the questions.

       I am sincere in my questions, if you're doubting that. I'm genuinely curious to know your opinions and how you came to reach them. It's perplexing as your comments don't give clear answers and just leave me filled with more questions! Like, what can you tell about me from my reading of Trump as a self-serving huckster and charlatan? Do you think mankind has had no impact on our changing climate? ..in opposition to the vast majority of qualified scientists? and still... how is Trump the only hope for the children of tomorrow?

       Science is a collection of testable knowledge and facts that can be used to describe and predict the physical world. You'll find better phrased definitions online but that's about the gist of it.

       Nope. theoretical physics is based on abstractions; mathematics. The subject of the theory is not being observed. I can disprove your definition the other way too: Is reading a bus timetable science? Because you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       observing it. No, that would absurd, as under this definition almost everything would be 'science'.

       I am sincerely shocked how uninformed you are. The very genesis of theoretical physics was from observations in our physical world. Mathematics were used to try to wrap their minds around the theory.

      <p>
       If you were reading a bus timetable, you are observing just that. Science is observing details and recording the outcome.

       Black holes were predicated by theoretical physics correct? Ok, that has nothing to do with the physical observations that led to theoretical physics. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about and I can tell that you don't understand anything. No wonder you're stuck on stupid.

       Don't you think it's strange that every public facing thing the man has done has fucked every common man. Everything you're convinced he's done for you requires a blind belief in one conspiracy or another. I mean, in his life, Donald Trump has literally done zero things for someone other than himself. I just can't fathom your blind faith that in reality, he's behind the scenes pulling the strings in your favor...

       Alex Jones legitimately believes in Trump. Maybe you consider that ignorant or naive, but I have no doubt in my mind that Alex is legit and so far can give the benefit of the doubt with Trump (need I remind you he was up against Hillary?)

       I'm pretty sure they're just there to laugh at conspiracy theorists. I think a lot of them, like myself, have been through the heavy indoctrination of online conspiracy theories when they were younger/more naive and come out the other side. Now we kinda want to help other people break out of the cycle of believing everything that is contrary to popular opinion ("crank magnetism" it is sometimes called) but it is a very hard task as conspiracy theorists can be very stubborn, having attached their egos to the conspiracy mast, and don't want to get hurt by accepting they were wrong. Because its so hard sometimes we just fall back on taking the piss, which is also egotistical really.

       Claiming its a mental illness isn't "transphobia". Its a hard fact.  None has "thinphobia" when they express concern over an anorexic.
      </p>

       Its isn't political it is psychological. No matter how hard the talking heads on either side try to make it political.

       If that was the case id have a basis for calling you mentally ill sinply because i think your point of view is deranged and psycopathic.

       It takes a severe amount of pain to cross that threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transgenderism is a modern phenomenon. Any psychotherapists with a backbone will agree something is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       A healthy individual doesn't make those kind of desicions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guarantee you can't find ONE transgender who hasn't been through depression or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are people who are upset that the world doesn't see them how they see themselves so they change theirselves to fit the worlds paradigm. That is extremely unhealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is gender dismorphia any different than the standard body dismorphia?
      </p>
      <p>
       You dont have to agree with me. I know you have your mind made up. Im not posting this for you. I am posting this to let the unhealthy people know that there are healthier options to a happy and fulfilling live.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe encouraging them to change their gender instead of theirselves is dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of us have beliefs and both of us can be wrong. Only time and science will truly tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not "transphobic" because of hate or disgust. My view comes from love and sympathy. I know you can't see that right now but I dont dislike these people I want to help them. So do you, that's exactly why we can't agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may agree on a million other topics but we can't let one disagreement stifle the conversation. Otherwise we will collapse with no accomplishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if anyone reads this and would like help or atleast someone to talk to I am open to pms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transgender or not if you are facing difficult internal problems you HAVE to talk to someone. No one can do it alone and no one is ever truly alone. There are people willing to help each and every one of us. You just have to ask.

       The only one who ever once used the term deranged is you. Is this your attempt to deflect from the point that the way you conduct yourself is both childish and embarrassing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, you try to pretend like you're taking the high road by hiding behind how "accepting" you are. Someone else voiced a difference of opinion on the topic than you, and this is how you react? People that react like this when their ideas are challenged, typically aren't the ones with the best ideas.

       Lmfao. Semantics you jackass. So you dont take it as him insinuating derangement, but most others would.

      <p>
       I am not embarrassing myself at all. If im disagreed with on this point i couldnt care less. Theres a bottom line here, and its that you guys are kiserable horrible people if you honestly think and tell people that if theyre trans theyre fucking sick.

       I can have a civil discussion but he threw that put the window when he came up in here saying "FACT: Trans people are sick" with absokutely no data driven analyses or sources to back his beliefs.

       You are looking through a lens of rhetoric. I know this for a fact because not long ago I was on your side of the matter. I realised all my thoughts on the subject came from TV and media.

      <p>
       Everything Ive said in this thread came from my own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im fine with being wrong as long as I made the concsious choice to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For now Im done with you. If someone else on your side wants to chime in I will talk with them. As long as they articulate their ideas and actually try to debate. Name calling and vague arguments are getting us nowhere.

       'They' are realy good and subdiving and class deviding. No matter how much keft and right means nothing as the entire corporate run gov is one big corporate circlejerk, whilst the argument is still between religions, sexes, races, socioeconomic devides. The rich the 1% own most of the wealth, they set themselfs up to earn more in coming years. They set their wealth up to automate their empires and cast out the slaves, the debt enslaved, those who can never sit at their table. Their reach is global, it is after all their dream of globalisation. It is their banking systems, it is their corporate outreach that treats humans as consumers more than anything else. The conrtol the media, the militry the congress, the polical system if multiple nations not just US. They will fight tooth and nail ti retain their freedom from gov. The same gov they control, that control us all is not what they want. Thats why countries where gov controls the market and the rich under same umbrella of laws as the poor that they fear. For thos gov as corruot as they can get, still have one thing in common, a common sociatal law to encompass all. Thye think themselfs ebove us, they think they can, as they have been doing for decades influence all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people rose up and occupied wall st to shiw that we are not interested in their empire. They fought back ten fold. There is black lives matter, lgbq(and other pronounces), there is athiesm vs religion, there is the class devide, there is war on immigrants, there js a war with the others, the russians the chjneese etc. Its all a ploy to keep the emotional feeble minds of the masses occupies with primal insticts to band together against the 'others'. Them against us, whay ever subsection of humanity you may orient yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isnt the war for sovereignety of the masses, it is the war of the masses against the privilage of the rich. They think themselfs ebove the kaw, they write the law. They think themselfs ebove reprimend, they throw their own under the bus so the greater whole can survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity git away from religious oppression, from kingdoms and bloodline rule, to be juked back into class warefare, but the classes fight for semantics whilst the control and power is being ammassed by the true harbourngers of rule, those with the wealth and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We gave democracy a try until democracy was a farse, we gave a cry a try until we realised we were just crying to each other. Whilst the slaves bicker between thenselfs, the rulers stride on to ensure their power goes uncontested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fight as we must, but untill the masses unite the vile greed of wealthiest few rules the lands. We are strongest when we stand together, but we fail to see beyond our little worlds, as per design of the system. For if we were truely taught critical thought and true history of the world gone past, we would know not to trust the comforting lies of the devil, and to question the gifts of gods. We would be our own gods. Alas, humanity got this far by working together, why do you believe that the devide is unavoidable. We got this far by working together, but not at the expence of the few. Now the few are the many, and the many can no longer stand by and watch their world being taken away by the few. Or so I hope.

       It's a divide and conquer tactic, derivative of a hegelian dialectic, used to distract and ultimately control the masses.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False left–right paradigm political theory
       </p>
       <p>
        The "false left–right paradigm" is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book "Tragedy and Hope"—
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers."
        </p>
        <p>
         "Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy."

        Also, it's important to note, considering how Trump has been portrayed by the media as racist (especially by liberals), and as a sexist pig, WE will be looked at as racist and sexist for being associated with Trump. Jones doesn't ever seem to address this for some reason, and it is a huge concern of mine. The CTR campaign is updated and filled in on the agenda, I'm seeing them prop up this narrative and labeling us as a Trump bee hive all the time.

       Not only conspiracy people but it paints all conservative arguments as racist.  But people who want to be deluded will be.  We can counter with the truth, those who are willing to see will, those who just want someone to hate will find someone to hate.

       This whole comment is spot on, but this part is the most interesting. If you try to have a discussion with someone who only gets their information from MSM, regardless of left or right, you'll quickly realize how uninformed they are on almost any topic. It's crazy how strongly people will defend their ideas, even if they don't really know what they are talking about. And then when you expose that they have no knowledge on the topic, they fall back on the idea of being able to look up the info that proves their convictions are true.

       If you actually did spend time in this sub, you'd quickly understand the difference between anti-Jewish and anti-Zionism commentary. This is a common tactic often used to discredit r/conspiracy. Even the trolls that come here and post blatantly anti-Jewish posts get removed almost instantly.

       There's a lot of posts on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that are blatantly antisemitic. Even if it's just 1% of the community (though I think it's much larger), it's a vocal enough group to make it easy to paint the rest of the group as the same or at least sympathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The community also doesn't do a good job of having a very nuanced understanding of the political spectrum. It's either Trump Support or Liberal Shill, where I guess there is actually quite a diversity of political opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of diversity, there is no conspiracy community. There are simple places where people gather to talk about conspiracies. What conspiracy is is so diverse, with so many different opinions, that there is clearly no monolithic entity.

       The Greens are mostly legitimately
       <em>
        left
       </em>
       /liberal but, yeah, they're largely erased from every election via omission and well-funded character attack campaigns.
       <br/>
       What's left is two fascist puppet parties, one of which pretends (very poorly) to be liberal.

       I'm pretty sure they're just there to laugh at conspiracy theorists. I think a lot of them, like myself, have been through the heavy indoctrination of online conspiracy theories when they were younger/more naive and come out the other side. Now we kinda want to help other people break out of the cycle of believing everything that is contrary to popular opinion ("crank magnetism" it is sometimes called) but it is a very hard task as conspiracy theorists can be very stubborn, having attached their egos to the conspiracy mast, and don't want to get hurt by accepting they were wrong. Because its so hard sometimes we just fall back on taking the piss, which is also egotistical really.

       On the contrary there is 0 evidence showing there isn't. Nice try.

       Learn to talk to people. You wont be able to call everyone an asshole and walk off in the real world.

       Good luck. Get yourself in check please.

       I dont mind you disagreeing but to jump to insults without a true explanation of your view is immature.

       "Im right, because.........Im right" isn't a proper aguement.

       You are looking through a lens of rhetoric. I know this for a fact because not long ago I was on your side of the matter. I realised all my thoughts on the subject came from TV and media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything Ive said in this thread came from my own opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im fine with being wrong as long as I made the concsious choice to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For now Im done with you. If someone else on your side wants to chime in I will talk with them. As long as they articulate their ideas and actually try to debate. Name calling and vague arguments are getting us nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your are projecting. Seek help. Im sorry.

       I have a great life now and wouldnt change any of it. In fact being a project coordinator for a construction firm makes me pretty good with confrontation. So keep on analyzing me with your obvious professional psycology skills.
