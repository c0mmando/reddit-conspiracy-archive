       Their goal, (elites, illuminati, secret alien race) is to have a totalitarian world where everyone is a slave and they have complete world domination and control over everything. If you don't think this is the future of our planet, you can stop reading, but I encourage you to have an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illuminati's biggest threat is us, If we are able to understand what is really going on and unite as human beings to stop this chaos that we are witnessing literally every single day, (wars, pedophile rings, false flags, spying on citizens, pharmaceuticals, etc.) We have the power to overthrow them and make the truth come out, until it is too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the division of people got 100x worse during the 2016 election. The left hates the right and vice versa. Every single opinion of someone conservative is instantly labeled as alt-right, racist, anti-Semitic. This has caused us to not be able to listen, and work with one another, which is why I or any one else who tries to raise awareness of real issues  about the world like (Bill Cooper, Jordan Maxwell) instantly gets shut down or called a nut job. We are being labelled as such so we can never be heard by the ones who are being manipulated and controlled by the Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the man power, but without the power of unity we are doomed and the world is going to get fucked soon and it will be too late.

       I would teach people as much as possible as quickly as possible, and built a photon pipe mirror setup around the whole planet.

       Tengri 137 has given us the blueprint to a solar mirror/pipe array, and I think if we use high-enough quality steel made using graphene/pristine graphite instead of amorphous carbon we should be able to work out the kinks and make it cheap enough to commercially provide it to everyone within 5-10 years.

        People need to have an open mind and understand what is going on. Im doing this by starting with my family and friends and discussing the globalists agenda with them and how it is incorporated in our society. My sister just called me crazy and was making fun of me for being so paranoid, but I kept talking to her and bringing up evidence that eventually made her start thinking about it.

       yes, anybody serious about resisting the nwo cant go around this personal transformation, to be the (inspiring, creative) change we want to see in the world and to educate others by example.  deeds are more instructive than words and the young generations really need all the help they can get.

       Quit your job and pay extra for things. Okay cool.... I'm not going to do shit crashing on my friend's couch while he works at Chipotle. I'm thinking we should all learn a bit about cryptography so we don't unwittingly support blockchains that enslave us, then we can phase out centralized control and there's nothing they can do about it. It is goddamn important to take the internet back, and I mean, get fucking violent on your ISP CEO's important.

       Are there any blockchains that don't reward early adopters with riches? I mean it's great that there's no inflation, but making the switch on a mass scale is like a game of musical chairs. The people that can afford to buy in early will become the new nobility, while your average Joe ends up even poorer than before. And you can bet the banking elite are already well diversified in this space... so nothing will change.

       I decided to be a sheep the other day and watch the news. They had a segment telling people to stop watching conspiracy videos on YouTube due to disinfo. The irony hurts but it shows you that ‘they’ are scared people are waking up.

       To be fair, most of them are unwatchable anyway.  The overly dramatic music, the "fact saturation" strategy where they just throw claim after claim.  I'd much rather prefer a proper analysis of actors and motives with detailed citations.  But this doesn't fit well into a video format.

       They manipulate us since a long time, they silence the ones that try to help us, change our ideological view of the world, corrupted us and spread false information to control us.

       But we are not much better, we let them do it, we ignore the ones that need our help, we try to force our view into others and we would already started a war if we really wanted.

       The "aliens" have always been here, they seeded the planet with their genetics. Isn't it obvious? Suspend your disbelief for a moment and just think about the concept of evolution. Yea, evolution is real... but it doesn't happen
       <em>
        that

       fast. The white race is of the fallen angel / Nordic / Elemental race. Semites are of the Anunnaki race. Asians are either of the Greys or reptilian (dragon) bloodline.

       Imho Allow me to add::
Nwo (ie, illuminati types) Has the following goals which can be found around if you want to look. Im pretty sure this is the outline
1) create a massive gap between wealthy and poor while manipulating a global economy from the shadows. (Rich people are not the enemy, the elite that control the rich are)
2) create automation to the inth degree. Eliminate as much of manufacturing workforce as possible so that it can be controlled by a very small group.
3) slowly breed out, and manipulate population pools via immigration. So that gene pool can be targeted for depopulation.
4) remove or limit all rare earth and rare metals from general population access. Take as much from third world and store in first world RE banks.
5) Utilize false flags and Conspiracies to manipulate the non aware general population.
6) create a patch care health care for all that maintains and does not cure or heal. Leading to a drug dependent population.
7) establish hidden sciences that are advanced beyond what the current age believes exists. 
8) Manipulate turmoil until at a certain time the world will be forced to unite against a common threat. In which a one world government with harsh new totalitarian tones will be in place in the name of survival.
9) Convince the world they need the NWO and its the best way.

       geezer, im sure youve lived long enough to realize how futile the attempt is of expecting mankind to behave in such a way that is beyond the human condition. the last truth at the end of all this is that the true root of the problem is humanity itself. and you cant fix humanity, you cant 'wake' them up, theyre not asleep - theyre just acting the way nature intended them to. people are not children, you just have to stop treating them like mindless oafs that are just toyed with like fools.
      </p>
      <p>
       you will never be able to make them do what you all think is best. I suggest you live your lives the way you want to instead and maybe find people who agree with you and live together. abandon these fancy dreams of saving the world, the world doesnt want to be saved - it wants to be left alone.

       Nah man, even though im kinda young (19) I will try to make a difference so that my future kids and grandkids will have a normal life where they can succeed lol. Having a positive mindset is important imo, even if there is nothing we can do to save the world.

       you cant set the pace the world takes, unless maybe youre one of the few thoroughbreds and even most of them really just follow the script nonetheless. all you can do is teach your children how to survive through it and get them the goods necessary for the journey.

       its not about positive or negative, its having the mindset of pursuing what works and abandoning what doesnt. and that is where theyre caught, bec what works or could also lies beyond a line that people cannot cross.

       I don't see it as the Illuminati, I see it as a foreign govt operation. I think it is the Russians that ran this operation but there is just no fucking telling anymore. The waters have become so murky. I truly think Roger Stone had a massive hand in murkiness too. Whether he thought it was going to go this far, I don't know, but I also don't think he cared because his guy won.

       The silliest thing about alien overlords is the belief that human genetic and cultural evolution coincides with a perfectly timed alien invasion where we are just barely strong enough to make them work in secret but they just barely got here in time to support effective world governments.

       I would teach people as much as possible as quickly as possible, and built a photon pipe mirror setup around the whole planet.

       Tengri 137 has given us the blueprint to a solar mirror/pipe array, and I think if we use high-enough quality steel made using graphene/pristine graphite instead of amorphous carbon we should be able to work out the kinks and make it cheap enough to commercially provide it to everyone within 5-10 years.

       but you're definitely right.. There's not even another option they all suck.. And religion divides us even further.

       We're all humans on the same planet.. And most of us want the same thing (what ever that is) it's only a small percentage thats evil and they control everything
