        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Their goal, (elites, illuminati, secret alien race) is to have a totalitarian world where everyone is a slave and they have complete world domination and control over everything. If you don&#39;t think this is the future of our planet, you can stop reading, but I encourage you to have an open mind.</p>

<p>The illuminati&#39;s biggest threat is us, If we are able to understand what is really going on and unite as human beings to stop this chaos that we are witnessing literally every single day, (wars, pedophile rings, false flags, spying on citizens, pharmaceuticals, etc.) We have the power to overthrow them and make the truth come out, until it is too late. </p>

<p>In my opinion, the division of people got 100x worse during the 2016 election. The left hates the right and vice versa. Every single opinion of someone conservative is instantly labeled as alt-right, racist, anti-Semitic. This has caused us to not be able to listen, and work with one another, which is why I or any one else who tries to raise awareness of real issues  about the world like (Bill Cooper, Jordan Maxwell) instantly gets shut down or called a nut job. We are being labelled as such so we can never be heard by the ones who are being manipulated and controlled by the Illuminati.</p>

<p>We have the man power, but without the power of unity we are doomed and the world is going to get fucked soon and it will be too late. </p>

I mean it&#39;s great that there&#39;s no inflation, but making the switch on a mass scale is like a game of musical chairs. The people that can afford to buy in early will become the new nobility, while your average Joe ends up even poorer than before.

    <div class="md"><p>Imho Allow me to add::
Nwo (ie, illuminati types) Has the following goals which can be found around if you want to look. Im pretty sure this is the outline
1) create a massive gap between wealthy and poor while manipulating a global economy from the shadows. (Rich people are not the enemy, the elite that control the rich are)
2) create automation to the inth degree. Eliminate as much of manufacturing workforce as possible so that it can be controlled by a very small group.
3) slowly breed out, and manipulate population pools via immigration. So that gene pool can be targeted for depopulation.
4) remove or limit all rare earth and rare metals from general population access. Take as much from third world and store in first world RE banks.
5) Utilize false flags and Conspiracies to manipulate the non aware general population.
6) create a patch care health care for all that maintains and does not cure or heal. Leading to a drug dependent population.
7) establish hidden sciences that are advanced beyond what the current age believes exists. 
8) Manipulate turmoil until at a certain time the world will be forced to unite against a common threat. In which a one world government with harsh new totalitarian tones will be in place in the name of survival.
9) Convince the world they need the NWO and its the best way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>geezer, im sure youve lived long enough to realize how futile the attempt is of expecting mankind to behave in such a way that is beyond the human condition. the last truth at the end of all this is that the true root of the problem is humanity itself. and you cant fix humanity, you cant &#39;wake&#39; them up, theyre not asleep - theyre just acting the way nature intended them to. people are not children, you just have to stop treating them like mindless oafs that are just toyed with like fools.</p>

<p>you will never be able to make them do what you all think is best. I suggest you live your lives the way you want to instead and maybe find people who agree with you and live together. abandon these fancy dreams of saving the world, the world doesnt want to be saved - it wants to be left alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>aha! lol.</p>

<p>you cant set the pace the world takes, unless maybe youre one of the few thoroughbreds and even most of them really just follow the script nonetheless. all you can do is teach your children how to survive through it and get them the goods necessary for the journey. </p>

<p>its not about positive or negative, its having the mindset of pursuing what works and abandoning what doesnt. and that is where theyre caught, bec what works or could also lies beyond a line that people cannot cross.</p>
