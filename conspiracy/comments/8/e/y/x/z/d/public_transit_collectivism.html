<p>Everything is high quality when new. Then mass adoption sets in. Quality drops to keep s costs reasonable and to maximize profits. This always negatively affects quality and cars are no different. This is not the government&#39;s fault.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Government is why we can&#39;t have nice things.</p>

<p>Yes, but you neglected to explain why. Government loves to enforce legal monopolies. If government stayed out of the economy then the economy would eventually stabilize. But the government can&#39;t resist and so it makes &quot;Laws&quot; to try appease everyone and ends up fucking everything up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cheap because people are paying for it with taxes, and some are more than others (ie. wealthy people who don&#39;t even use it).  Furthermore, over the long run, you&#39;ll end up paying more for it, than if you only paid for it when you used it. </p>

<p>As for efficient, I think you really mean convenient, because nothing the government does is efficient. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s not run for profit, then why do you pay with taxes <strong>and</strong> when you use it? Riddle me that?</p>

<p>OP is a Libertarian. I&#39;m using Libertarian logic. And, while the South was indeed despicable for what they did, eventually mass action <em>did</em> end it, and Social injustices were set Right (to an extent). Self determination and the resistance of Blacks and Whites lead to the repeal of Jim Crow. By your standards- nothing anyone votes for means anything. You have to take the good with the bad and fight for the good. </p>

<p>Also- I am consistent with my beliefs. Even though what the South stood for was despicable, the Federal government forcing them to remain within the Union fundamentally altered the nature of the Republic. </p>

<p>So now you agree that a majority vote has nothing to do with rights? What about how this convo started when you told the other guy mass transit was a right as long as it’s voted on?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t slide anything- in this thread or the other.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A majority vote is the best way to obtain Rights- if paired with actual Free Determination of all men and women. The system isn&#39;t perfect but it is the best way we have to self organize. The People must always have power- and if they elect Representatives, then the Representatives must be Democratically elected and Rcallable.</p>

<p>And that is True. If the community agrees on it, then they can have it. If you don&#39;t want it, you can leave. </p>

<p>Absolutely false.  Jim Crow laws were only passed because democracy was suppressed by violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears you are right, that actually put me into an interesting rabbit hole of history. <em>the more you know</em>
I will instead point to the Patriot Act which was voted for by representatives across both parties and inarguably stripped their own citizens of several rights. The point remains the same. We can see various examples of laws democratically passed that infringe on the rights of people. Gay people not being able to marry was very much a function of democracy. Only once opinion shifted in its favour did the politicians finally do the right thing. The same thing can be said for the marijuana legalization movement. And prostitution laws still step on people’s rights to this day. Or various laws about gathering rain water.</p>

<p>My point is democracy isn’t just a tool that frees the people. It often chains us as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you&#39;re so dumb... There are 9,000,000 people in NYC. The infrastructure can&#39;t even compensate for the extreme minority who do drive. I used to deliver furniture in manhattan, the capitalist center of the modern world. It is a logistical impossibility. People couldn&#39;t give less of a fuck about the politics, they just need to get to work on time. At their capitalist jobs on wall street. Or Eat dinner at the capitalist restaurant they enjoy without a two hour traffic jam. Or go shopping in soho, the brand capital of the world. You get my drift... Also howabout posting an actual theory or piece of information on a conspiracy, not some stupid rant on something you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>Answer:  They want all the rules and regulations that must be met and now law,  to be licensed to provide a public service eliminated first.  </p>

<p>All the safety regulations, the no discrimination rules, the accommodation rules and others.   </p>

<p>Certainly these rules should be reviewed every year to see if they are effective for the  goal of safe public transportation or unnecessary.  (key word is public) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its geometry.  If you have large amounts of people, you need a more efficient way for them to move around than automobiles.  Conservatives just hate cities and anything that makes them acknowledge that other people exist and have needs worth respecting.</p>

<p>That&#39;s of course leaving aside that car culture destroyed the American community, is in the process of destroying the environment, is far less healthy that public transit or people-power, and oh by the way CARS GET MUCH LARGER SUBSIDIES THAN TRANSIT DOES YOU FOOL!</p>
