       People who advocate for subsidizing public transit more in America are a threat to the American way of life.  This is just the way of giving the state more of our hard-earned tax dollars.  Who agrees?  I find that most people who use/advocate for public transit are communists or some other rotten flavor of collectivist.

       Everything is high quality when new. Then mass adoption sets in. Quality drops to keep s costs reasonable and to maximize profits. This always negatively affects quality and cars are no different. This is not the government's fault.

      <p>
       Yes, but you neglected to explain why. Government loves to enforce legal monopolies. If government stayed out of the economy then the economy would eventually stabilize. But the government can't resist and so it makes "Laws" to try appease everyone and ends up fucking everything up.

       Where I live public transport is used to get people off the public roads and ease congestion. Either way your transport mode is going to be government funded. At least it's cheap and efficient if its run by the government. All the privatised systems I've been on have been shit.

       I was referring to the one I use it's cheap and efficient for me. It's quicker than driving and cheaper than parking at work. It's not run for profit so they service all areas not just profitable routes as well.

      <p>
       It's cheap because people are paying for it with taxes, and some are more than others (ie. wealthy people who don't even use it).  Furthermore, over the long run, you'll end up paying more for it, than if you only paid for it when you used it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for efficient, I think you really mean convenient, because nothing the government does is efficient.

       People pay for roads with taxes.  People pay for the oil industry with taxes.  People pay for a whole lot of other consequences of the car system as well.  Pretending public transit is unique in getting taxpayer subsidies is intellectually dishonest.

       It is a non sequitur, as you ignored my actual point.  If you want to argue about public transit, do that.  Don't run away and try to argue vague and generalized moral philosophy when your hypocrisy on the specific issue you raised is pointed out.

       If you want to know why property is theft you should go read Proudhon, but since you won't

Firemen and Police are collectivism too...if a city wants to publicly fund things like transit, and it passes a democratic vote, then it is within their right, as a Commune, to do that.

       Ok cool. I'm an Anarcho-Syndicalist/Socialist, but that doesn't really have a bearing on your CPP post or the comments in that thread. And if a free collective of citizens (i.e. people choosing to live in a certain city) hold a vote and a majority approve of the funding mechanism, then they are totally within their Rights to have public transit. If you don't like it, you're free to move away and not pay those taxes.

       OP is a Libertarian. I'm using Libertarian logic. And, while the South was indeed despicable for what they did, eventually mass action
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       end it, and Social injustices were set Right (to an extent). Self determination and the resistance of Blacks and Whites lead to the repeal of Jim Crow. By your standards- nothing anyone votes for means anything. You have to take the good with the bad and fight for the good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also- I am consistent with my beliefs. Even though what the South stood for was despicable, the Federal government forcing them to remain within the Union fundamentally altered the nature of the Republic.

       No, going through people’s post history is just a lazy way of trying to win an argument. But you are clearly not trying to convince the person you were talking to, so maybe it’s just more of a virtue signal for the reddit masses than a real argument.

       A majority vote is the best way to obtain Rights- if paired with actual Free Determination of all men and women. The system isn't perfect but it is the best way we have to self organize. The People must always have power- and if they elect Representatives, then the Representatives must be Democratically elected and Rcallable.

       It appears you are right, that actually put me into an interesting rabbit hole of history.
       <em>
        the more you know
       </em>
       I will instead point to the Patriot Act which was voted for by representatives across both parties and inarguably stripped their own citizens of several rights. The point remains the same. We can see various examples of laws democratically passed that infringe on the rights of people. Gay people not being able to marry was very much a function of democracy. Only once opinion shifted in its favour did the politicians finally do the right thing. The same thing can be said for the marijuana legalization movement. And prostitution laws still step on people’s rights to this day. Or various laws about gathering rain water.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is democracy isn’t just a tool that frees the people. It often chains us as well

       That's fair.  You're absolutely right on your larger point, unfortunately, I'm just fascinated by Reconstruction and hate how simplistic the commonly understood narratives of late 1800's southern history are.  It warms my heart to see I put you down that rabbit hole.

       There's been a string of trolls lately pretending to be either extreme right wing idiots or extreme left wing idiots. I don't know if they are just doing it to troll, or to start trouble and get people fighting, or just to portray a certain side in the worst way possible. I'm sure this has been going on forever but I've been noticing it way more than usual in the last couple weeks.

       How does this relate a conspiracy... you're just stating a political, well known opinion. It's also a pretty dumb one at that. Try driving in NYC and then get back to me.

       Bad example.  NYC is brimming with communist filth so of course they hate cars.

       Dude you're so dumb... There are 9,000,000 people in NYC. The infrastructure can't even compensate for the extreme minority who do drive. I used to deliver furniture in manhattan, the capitalist center of the modern world. It is a logistical impossibility. People couldn't give less of a fuck about the politics, they just need to get to work on time. At their capitalist jobs on wall street. Or Eat dinner at the capitalist restaurant they enjoy without a two hour traffic jam. Or go shopping in soho, the brand capital of the world. You get my drift... Also howabout posting an actual theory or piece of information on a conspiracy, not some stupid rant on something you have no idea what you're talking about.

       That's like saying modern plumbing/sewer systems are a collectivist entity. Everything you just described about public transportation can be said about the processes that allow you to comfortably take a dump in your own home.

       So why aren't all those libertarian entrepanauer's jumping in and providing a for profit service?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer:  They want all the rules and regulations that must be met and now law,  to be licensed to provide a public service eliminated first.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the safety regulations, the no discrimination rules, the accommodation rules and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly these rules should be reviewed every year to see if they are effective for the  goal of safe public transportation or unnecessary.  (key word is public)

       Its geometry.  If you have large amounts of people, you need a more efficient way for them to move around than automobiles.  Conservatives just hate cities and anything that makes them acknowledge that other people exist and have needs worth respecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's of course leaving aside that car culture destroyed the American community, is in the process of destroying the environment, is far less healthy that public transit or people-power, and oh by the way CARS GET MUCH LARGER SUBSIDIES THAN TRANSIT DOES YOU FOOL!
