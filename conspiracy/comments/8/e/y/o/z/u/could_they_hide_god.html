<p>“But you can&#39;t prove God exists. And isn&#39;t that what all science is ultimately about? Proving theories about the universe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Provability is not truth, Caro. Godel&#39;s incompleteness theorem tells us that, if we didn&#39;t already know it intuitively, which we do.” ― Anna Jarzab (The Opposite of Hallelujah)</p>

<p>What exactly is <em>Godel’s incompleteness theorem</em>?</p>

<p>&quot;Gödel&#39;s incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems (true mathematical statements), proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931. They are theorems in mathematical logic.
Mathematicians once thought that everything that is true has a mathematical proof. A system that has this property is called complete; one that does not is called incomplete. Also, mathematical ideas should not have contradictions. This means that they should not be true and false at the same time. A system that does not include contradictions is called consistent.
Gödel said that every non-trivial (interesting) formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent: [1]</p>

<ol>
<li> There will always be questions that cannot be answered, using a certain set of axioms;</li>
<li> You cannot prove that a system of axioms is consistent, unless you use a different set of axioms .</li>
</ol>

<p>Those theorems are important to mathematicians because they prove that is impossible to create a set of axioms that explains everything in math.&quot;</p>

<p>(<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).">https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).</a>&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, not all “truth” has proof that we can see – sometimes it is intuitive. Many people ask for evidence of God, claiming they cannot see proof of God in any way, but they may not realize proof may come in other forms. I am NOT here to prove or disprove God - you can do that on your own time. Again, I am not here to argue whether or not God exists – you can reach your own conclusions. It is also important to note that I understand that Godel’s theorem is about mathematics, but I still feel that its general notion can be applied to other areas, like spirituality. </p>

<p><strong>To reiterate, this post is not meant to prove or disprove God. If you hate God, this post may not be for you.</strong> Rather, this post is to discuss that hypothetically, if God did exist, then here is how and why “they” would hide him. Let’s start with how.  </p>

<p><strong>Creativity</strong></p>

<p>“Every child is an artist. The problem is staying an artist when you grow up.” – Pablo Picasso</p>

<p>In order to hide God, it starts in schools with the education system.  In order to understand a creator, one would have to understand the creative process. Now, unfortunately, there are misconceptions about “creativity.” Creativity is not necessarily artistic – and that is something many schools, teachers, and students get wrong. Rather, creativity, according to google, is “the use of imagination or original ideas.” This can come in many forms from art to music to writing to building. Creativity is not bound by art. </p>

<p>Creativity, further, is the highest level of learning according to <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a>. Verbs associated with creativity include design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, and investigate. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, opportunities for creativity in schools today are sparse, and according to Forbes, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darden/2015/03/19/how-americas-education-model-kills-creativity-and-entrepreneurship-2/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/">America’s education model kills creativity and entrepreneurship</a>.</p>

<p>The article states, “Based on scores from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, her study reveals ‘that children have become less emotionally expressive, less energetic, less talkative and verbally expressive, less humorous, less imaginative, less unconventional, less lively and passionate, less perceptive, less apt to connect seemingly irrelevant things, less synthesizing, and less likely to see things from a different angle.’ That is depressing.”</p>

<p>Schools reinforce the concept that all ideas must be taken from somewhere else. I want to caution here that there is nothing inherently wrong with that. As I write this post, many of my ideas are coming from different sources, and today, synthesizing information is important. However, the problem is that there is a lack of time for truly creative opportunities, and I lean on this side that this might be purposeful. </p>

<p>If one has little opportunity to create, how can one understand something that creates? For example, an artist may destroy an entire piece of art work because it does not meet his/her expectations, and others may not understand why. Only the artist could understand. By the way, I am not using this metaphor to justify a God who destroys. Again, I am just stating that the more opportunities we take away for students to create, the less they are inclined to understand creation (or the opposite…destruction) itself.</p>

<p><strong>To Enjoy Nature is to Enjoy God</strong> </p>

<p>“My profession is to always find God in nature.” - Henry David Thoreau</p>

<p>As our world becomes more industrialized, fewer and fewer have the opportunity to see nature in its truly, well, natural state. In fact, a Yale study says that there is a <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/digest/u-s-study-shows-widening-disconnect-with-nature-and-potential-solutions">widening disconnect with nature</a>.</p>

<p>The article also states, “Parents of children 8 to 12 years old said that their children spend three times as many hours with computers and televisions each week as they do playing outside.”</p>

<p>It is no surprise that there are many benefits of being in nature, such as <a href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/benefits-ecotherapy-being-nature-fights-depression-improves-mental-health-and-well-being-261075">reducing depression and improving overall well-being</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the article states that “nature deficit disorder” is a real phenomenon.</p>

<p>And even if you do not believe in a specific God, there is no denying that there is something “divine” about nature itself.
Yet, people are jam-packed in cities with little access to nature, and much of the nature that many see is manufactured, polluted, destroyed, degraded, or disrespected. Even think about tourist spots, where one cannot even truly appreciate the nature they see. </p>

<p>How can one understand a creator if they cannot experience the world in its natural state?</p>

<p><strong>Materialism</strong></p>

<p>“Many scientific disciplines begin by not observing any sort of vital spark or consciousness in material events and proceed to deny that these things exist in living things, including themselves. Because consciousness does not fit into their mechanistic schemes they declare it illusory. Magicians make exactly the reverse argument. Observing consciousness in themselves and animals, they are magnanimous enough to extend it to all things to some degree—trees, amulets, planetary bodies, and all. This is a far more respectful and generous attitude than that of religions, most of whom won&#39;t even give animals a soul.” ― Peter J. Carroll, Liber Null and Psychonaut: An Introduction to Chaos Magic</p>

<p>For those reading, I actually do not necessarily agree with the entirety of this quote, but I want to ensure I am bringing in different perspectives (not just my own Christian bias).</p>

<p>Today, many hold a scientifically material worldview, which states, “Scientistic materialism is a philosophical stance which posits a limited definition of consciousness to that which is observable and subject to the scientific method.” This goes back to my original point, though, that just because something is true, does not mean it is necessarily going to be “observable.” One may feel God in nature, but that is pretty difficult to “prove.”</p>

<p>I am not here to bash science, or say that this worldview is “wrong”, but the problem with this worldview is that it is possible that there is something beyond what we can observe through the scientific method. </p>

<p>From Scientific American, “<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/is-scientific-materialism-almost-certainly-false/">According to the physicist John Wheeler, quantum mechanics implies that our observations of reality influence its unfolding. We live in a &quot;participatory universe,&quot; Wheeler proposed, in which mind is as fundamental as matter. Philosopher David Chalmers, Nagel&#39;s colleague at New York University, conjectures that &quot;information,&quot; which emerges from certain physical configurations and processes and entails consciousness, is a fundamental component of reality, as much so as time, space, matter and energy</a>.”</p>

<p>With scientific materialism, comes materialism itself, which I will discuss a little later. </p>

<p><strong>Nihilism/Absurdism</strong></p>

<p>Today, in pop culture especially, I see the emphasis on the meaningless of life, particularly in the ever popular “Rick and Morty.” Here is a pretty fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWU25NiWC7A">video</a> about the philosophy of nihilism and absurdism behind the show.</p>

<p>If you do not feel like watching, here is a good summary:</p>

<p>“Drawing inspiration from the science fiction horror pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft and based on a philosophical school of thought called Absurdism, “Rick and Morty” explores the conflict between the human tendency to seek meaning in life and the subsequent inability to find any. Sharing a common theoretical basis with existentialism and nihilism, the absurdity that unfolds in each episode is based on the idea that its characters are relentlessly caught up in a dichotomy with meaningless, illogical situations and actual life.”</p>

<p><a href="https://studybreaks.com/culture/the-philosophy-of-absurdism-in-rick-and-morty/">https://studybreaks.com/culture/the-philosophy-of-absurdism-in-rick-and-morty/</a></p>

<p>Rick and Morty is not the only popular show that pushes this worldview, as it can be found in the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, and many more, and these programs have massive influence on the masses and their worldviews. </p>

<p>The point is that scientific materialism breeds nihilism, and popular culture reinforces this nihilism. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-is-nihilism-on-the-rise_us_5849ab9be4b0afda6e983ef8">Nihilism is certainly on the rise</a>, and even if you disagree with my beliefs on the cause of this increase, it is clear that we are living in a world where many simply and firmly believe life has no meaning or purpose.</p>

<p>The problem is, what if people are wrong? That is the simple question. Again, it is not that “nihilism” is wrong, but proclaiming the world is absolutely meaningless is as a profound of a claim that life is absolutely meaningful. Both require proof; yet neither claims have substantial enough proof to be absolute.</p>

<p>Let us be clear though, one rarely hears about “God” or “Godly” things in pop culture, pop music, or pop anything really, which leads to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Degradation</strong></p>

<p>“No one can live under degradation.” – Walid Jumblatt</p>

<p>In other words, how can we truly live if everything around us is in the state of deterioration?</p>

<p>Synonyms for degradation include shame, humiliation, debasement, degeneration, and deterioration. Though I cannot discuss every aspect of society in this limited post, I can discuss how degradation is celebrated today:</p>

<p><em>Comedy</em> - Modern comedy is really about humiliation. Look, I am the first to laugh, but humiliation involves bringing someone else down at their expense, or degrading them. Today, I see thousands of “humiliation rituals”, whether on YouTube or social media. For example, the widely popular Ellen DeGeneres is pretty famous for humiliating her guests, after all. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn3AgNC2TSk">In this episode</a>, she sets up a guest to steal something from her, and then she humiliates them in the audience. The point is that much of comedy today is meant to degrade others.</p>

<p><em>Music</em> - It may sound cliché, but earlier I was talking to an older gentleman, and he said, “Music used to be uplifiting!” Even if you disagree with him, today’s music is certainly far from uplifting. Rather, most pop music (92%) is about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/">sex</a>. Even if not about sex, music itself has been to scientifically be worse than it used to be according to the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/science-proves-pop-music-has-actually-gotten-worse-8173368/">Smithsonain</a>. A huge part of this comes from the fact that making money is much more important than making beautiful, creative music. Further, science really shows <a href="https://mic.com/articles/107896/scientists-finally-prove-why-pop-music-all-sounds-the-same#.pbSF3CzAM">all pop music sounds the same</a>. The themes in pop music today do not go beyond sex, drugs, violence, and everything that seems to be the opposite of “Godly” standards.</p>

<p><em>Art</em> While I cannot speak of all art in this post, I am pretty disgusted by much of art today, like <a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2013/08/gloriously-offensive-art-show-san-francisco-i-poop-you/6476/">poop art</a> and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2013/08/gloriously-offensive-art-show-san-francisco-i-poop-you/6476/">period art</a>. It is interesting because many complain about modern art, but maybe what they are not realizing is that they may not like modern are because it is often based on degradation - not creation.</p>

<p>For the sake of time, other parts of our society that have degraded are our food and water sources, our natural environments, families, and much more. </p>

<p>Our society itself seems to be near its end stages (or at least many seem to think), and this article goes more into its <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/49185/cultural-collapse-theory-the-7-steps-that-lead-to-a-complete-culture-decline">cultural collapse</a>.
Speaking of cultural decline, there also seems to be a rise of cultural decadence…</p>

<p><em>An analogy for you</em>: Nihilism is to absurdity as cultural decline is to cultural decadence?</p>

<p><strong>Worship of Everything BUT God</strong></p>

<p>“The greatest act of faith takes place when a man finally decides that he is not God.” ~ Johann Wolfgang Goethe</p>

<p>Finally, while many detest the idea of God, I find that they quite simply replace God with something else. </p>

<p>• There is a [sex addiction epidemic](<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/sex-addiction-epidemic-66289">www.newsweek.com/sex-addiction-epidemic-66289</a>). This <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/11/cheap-sex-explains-decline-marriage/">article</a> claims that cheap sex is responsible for the decline of marriage. </p>

<p>• Did you know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_worship_syndrome">celebrity worship syndrome</a> is a real thing, too?</p>

<p>What hole are we trying to fill? Are people feeling increasingly ‘empty’ in this nihilistic, apathetic world? What ‘void’ are we trying to fill? Is this void God? Are all of these addictions the false idols of today? As we see the rise in a world without God, we also see in a rise in addictions to other things. There is certainly a correlation, anyway. When something consumes a person’s life, it becomes an act of worship. </p>

<p>More than anything, though, people want to be Gods themselves. The worship of ‘self’ is what is changing, or degrading, society. Sure, addictions have always existed, but the world has changed drastically in the past few decades because of the idolization of oneself. </p>

<p>There has been a rise in <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2017/06/28/a-rise-in-narcissism-a-root-of-americas-crisis/">narcissism</a>, a decrease in <a href="https://www.livescience.com/51392-will-tech-bring-humanity-together-or-tear-it-apart.html">empathy</a>, and people are even marrying <a href="https://www.livescience.com/51392-will-tech-bring-humanity-together-or-tear-it-apart.html">themselves</a>!</p>

<p>Is it no wonder science says <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/8480505/Faith-good-for-your-health.html">faith is good for your health</a>, and there are some intriguing studies on <a href="https://onlinesurgicaltechniciancourses.com/2010/25-intriguing-scientific-studies-about-faith-prayer-and-healing/">faith, prayer, and healing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion…Why?</strong></p>

<p>“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.” - Buddha</p>

<p>Whether you believe in God or not, you probably agree with this quote. It means that the materialistic things that most try to use to fill a void simply do not fill that void. We cannot find peace in this external, materialistic world. I mean, here is a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/01/classic-study-on-happiness-and-the-lottery.html">classic study</a> on how winning the lottery really does not make anybody happier.  </p>

<p>But why would <em>they</em> want to hide God? For one, if people believe in a God, they are likely to put God first in life, especially over “the powers that be.” They may question the motives of those in power. Why do you think they control religion in the first place ? – so they can control God. </p>

<p>Second, if there really was a God, that means much of what we stress about in life may become somewhat meaningless – the money, the cars, the sex, the things we are all slaves to. People may question the reality they are living and realize how empty it is. They may change their lives, realizing they do not need any of those things to be content. Those things are literally “chains” for most people (including myself!).</p>

<p>Third, if there really was a God, then people cannot be Gods themselves, and there may be more to life than them. People’s entire paradigms would shift.   </p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Also, please do not downvote me because you do not believe in God, as this post is meant for discussion and learning! : )</p>

That early people would actually hear God as an auditory hallucination by way of one hemisphere giving insight to the other. Fascinating read regardless of your beliefs.

    <div class="md"><p>That reminds me of the CIA paper I read a while back explaining the Gateway process. In short, the universe, us, our brains, are all holograms and with this Gateway device they were able to combine the two hemispheres of the brain and access a higher dimension outside of time and space, as such, the universal consciousness that they interacted with in that dimension exists in all times and places simultaneously and we come from and return to it when we die with ur memories intact, but lose free will due to the nature of our holographic brains needing time to exist in order to operate. While a part of the &quot;All Together&quot; as I think they called it you also have access to everyone else&#39;s memories too. Supposedly other entities exist in that dimension as well, my memory is a little hazy. It was all pretty crazy, but it ties in well with what you were talking about.

<p>BAM. There it is.</p>

<p>Rabbit hole:
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/originsofchristianity/">https://sites.google.com/site/originsofchristianity/</a></p>

<p>Take this for example:
<a href="http://origins-of-christianity.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/there-is-no-longer-argument-for-jesus.html">http://origins-of-christianity.blogspot.co.uk/2017/10/there-is-no-longer-argument-for-jesus.html</a></p>

<p>I think the Gospel Of Thomas is one of the most important documents, that said, the name &quot;Jesus&quot; appears nowhere in it.
The &quot;nomina sacra&quot; is always in place of &quot;his&quot; name on ALL early documents. Who invented the &quot;nomina sacra&quot;? Sounds Latin eh?</p>

<p>How can you pray TO something if you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s proper name?</p>

<p>The Gospel Of Thomas writer copied down the sayings of the man called &quot;Jesus&quot;, they speak for themselves and are amazingly prescient:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(14) Jesus said to them: 
(1)‘If you fast, you will bring forth sin for yourselves. 
(2) And if you pray, you will be condemned. 
(3) And if you give alms, you will do harm to your spirits. 
(4) And if you go into any land and wander from place to place, (and) if they take you in, 
(then) eat what they will set before you. Heal the sick among them! 
(5) For what goes into your mouth will not defile you. 
Rather, what comes out of your mouth will defile you.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certain events and language used in the gospel line up historically with events going on in the region. The book of Thomas is missing a lot of the historical accuracy and also language used in the region. It&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t included in the Bible. There was a long reddit post about it recently in askhistorians and it was a really scientific way of looking at the Bible as a historical document and not a religious one. I wish I remembered the details more or even the link but they did a good job of showing how historically a lot of the events in the books of Mathew mark Luke and John (New Testament) line up historically and a lot of historians think that the book of Thomas is completely inaccurate or fabricated to pass as a document written around that time. There were other good reason why it doesn&#39;t hold up as well. They weren&#39;t talking about the religious elements in the book just historical. I&#39;m not catholic or religious at all really just thought I&#39;d add since you mentioned the book of Thomas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, basically *every* document we have mentioning &quot;Jesus&quot; does not have the man&#39;s real name in it. Little known fact. If you don&#39;t believe me, dig into it a bit.</p>

<p>The name of the guy written about is camoflaged with the so-called &quot;nomina sacra&quot;.</p>

<p>We have a complete original copy of the Gospel Of Thomas written in Coptic from 3-4th century.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a copy, but it&#39;s complete. Not a fragment of a book.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library</a></p>

<p>&gt;The contents of the codices were written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_language">Coptic language</a>. The best-known of these works is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas">Gospel of Thomas</a>,  of which the Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete text. After  the discovery, scholars recognized that fragments of these sayings  attributed to Jesus appeared in manuscripts discovered at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus">Oxyrhynchus</a> in 1898 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Oxyrhynchus_1">P. Oxy. 1</a>),  and matching quotations were recognized in other early Christian  sources. Subsequently, a 1st or 2nd century date of composition circa 80  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD">AD</a> or earlier has been proposed for the lost Greek originals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas">Gospel of Thomas</a>. The buried manuscripts date from the 3rd and 4th centuries. </p>

<p>Also, notice something here. Look at  &quot;Extant Tanakh Manuscripts&quot; chart and the NT section below it:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_manuscript</a></p>

<p>Vast majority of documents come from 4th century and later. And this is for copies of the OT!</p>

<p>Many of the NT copies are way later. They only have tiny fragments of anything from say, the year 125 etc.</p>

<p>Have these literally tiny fragments been properly dated? I highly doubt it. In my mind there is doubt about ALL these writings. OT, NT, whatever. </p>

<p>The use of the &quot;nomina sacra&quot; as the name of &quot;Jesus&quot; in even the Coptic copy tells you something. The use of the &quot;nomina sacra&quot; goes back to Greece...but I believe it can be traced back to earlier use in Syria. This raises more interesting questions. </p>

<p>When you get right down to it, look at all the words &quot;Jesus&quot; supposedly spoke. Get a &quot;red letter&quot; copy of the NT (highlights everything &quot;Jesus&quot; said). Compare to the Gospel Of Thomas. I&#39;m willing to bet not many people have done this. After all, what could be more important than what he said, right?</p>

<p>You will see that almost all the sayings match. The NT is like a watered down version though, like somebody wanted to take all the power out of what the man said. See for yourself.</p>

<p>Using the types of knowledge discussed in the link above I think the hiding of God you describe is attributed to the obfuscation of types of knowledge and the watering down of a standard of proof.</p>

<p>Due to our simultaneous inability to prove and inability to disprove God. God can be hidden or replaced by other constructs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus telling the disciples that He came not to bring peace to the world, but a sword. Jesus’ sword was never a literal one. In fact, when Peter took up a sword to defend Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus rebuked him and told him to put away his sword, &quot;for all who draw the sword will die by the sword” (Matthew 26:52). Why then, did Jesus say, “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.” What kind of sword did Jesus come to bring?</p>

<p>Among the names of Jesus Christ is that of Prince of Peace. Such verses as Isaiah 9:6, Luke 2:14, and John 14:27 make it clear that Jesus came to bring peace, but that peace is between the man and God. Those who reject God and the only way of salvation through Jesus (John 14:6) will find themselves perpetually at war with God. But those who come to Him in repentance will find themselves at peace with God. Because of Christ’s sacrifice, we are restored to a relationship of peace with God (Romans 5:1).</p>

<p>Still, it is inevitable that there will be conflict between good and evil, the Christ and the antichrist, the light and the darkness, the children of God (believers) and the children of the devil (those who refuse Christ). Conflict must arise between the two groups, and this can and does happen within a family in which some are believers and others are not. We should seek to be at peace with all men but should never forget that Jesus warned we will be hated for His sake. Because those who reject Him hate Him, they will hate His followers as well (John 15:18).</p>

<p>In Matthew 10:34–36, Jesus said He had come at this time not to bring peace to the earth, but a sword, a weapon which divides and severs. As a result of His visit to the earth, some children would be set against parents and a man’s enemies might be those within his own household. This is because many who choose to follow Christ are hated by their family members. This may be part of the cost of discipleship, for love of family should not be greater than love for the Lord. A true disciple must take up his cross and follow Jesus (Matthew 16:24). He must be willing to face not only family hatred, but also death, like a criminal carrying his cross to his own execution. True followers of Christ must be willing to give up, even to the point of “hating” all that is in our lives, even our own families, if we are to be worthy of Him (Matthew 10:37–39). In so doing, we find our lives in return for having given them up to Jesus Christ.</p>

If he meant that people were going to align against people that followed him wouldn’t it be more accurate, following the logic of your first comment, to say love the people coming against you or something like that.

</blockquote>

<p>Dude so did I.</p>

<p>Looking I back I can see how this reads as arrogant, or holier than thou. My only intent is to convey that anyone that continues to challenge their own beliefs, will have those beliefs change over time.</p>

<p>The point that I am trying to make, ineffectively, is that none of us have the answers. That the wisest man is often the first to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>Not everyone that is religious arrived there due to indoctrination. </p>

<p>Set your fucking ego aside, and see that I am only speaking for myself, from my experience. </p>

<p>In my experience, I was raised religiously. After time, and getting unsatisfactory answers to complicated questions, I railed against it. I had been lied to, my intelligence insulted, and I was offended. I was angry. With time and a little understanding, I was able to move on and gain a new appreciation for religion. Not the shallow shit I learned in church as a kid, but a relationship you can forge within yourself. Your attitude was my attitude at some point.</p>

<p>When I say my beliefs evolved, I merely mean that they have changed. Not that they have progressed to some higher form or understanding. In fact, I would consider it a deconstruction of my understanding -- an acceptance that I don&#39;t know a fucking thing.</p>

<p>It is no consequence to me what your beliefs are -- reddit is a wall for me to bounce ideas off of to try furthering my understanding. To learn from other people doing the same. To discuss and debate.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re just another person trying to figure out what the point of all this shit. I think that&#39;s why you&#39;re on a conspiracy sub, because this seems to be one of the last places people with differing views come together to challenge those beliefs. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m better than you, or holier than you, or any of that nonsense. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re condemned to an eternity of hellfire for not sharing my beliefs. I&#39;m not confident in what my beliefs even are.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about &#39;getting candy&#39; (unless you&#39;re part of one of those prosperity religions like Joel Osteen and the like). It&#39;s about being reunited with the universe. Once your body gives out, you&#39;re finally free of distractions and anything that held you to earth and you go back to being part of everything. You&#39;re just &#39;done&#39; and at peace. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not that God <em>needs</em> our help, he <em>wants</em> it, even though he doesn&#39;t need it all. He enjoys us because he made us even though we suck a lot of the time. It&#39;s like most people enjoy being with their kids while working. You don&#39;t need help from a little kid. They mess things up more than they help, but being with them while they babble and learn and grow is a great experience. </p>

<p>Personally, I <em>do</em> like hanging out with ants (if I&#39;m outside anyway)or anything in nature really. I feel like we <em>have</em> children and pets and &#39;lesser things&#39; to help us understand how God can love us. I guess that doesn&#39;t work if you <em>don&#39;t</em> love lesser things, but I feel like it&#39;s a rare person that doesn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find Terrance McKenna&#39;s and Jordon Petersons perception of God the likeliest account of the transcendental we can, currently, perceive. If God is anything like the Abrahamic faith, then on a literal interpretation, he cannot be hidden, becuase he is everywhere and has absolute power. And because this God can manifest at will, only he can conceal himself. If we&#39;re talking about the Gnostic interpretation of God, then the God we&#39;ve heard from is only a shadow of the true transcendental power, called the Demiurge. The true transcendental power is not preoccupied with being known. The deist God, is either the same transcendent power, or simply operates the same, as the gnostic one. So many interpretations of God. Its disarming how often I see people on this sub subscribe to a purely Christian Protestant interpretation. </p>

How was Abraham able to communicate with God without there being a bible written or anyone to tell him of? It’s because he sought after him.

<p>This is incredibly ignorant. You&#39;re basically lumping anyone who has <em>sincerely</em> searched for God and not found anything in with those who simply aren&#39;t interested in <em>your</em> version of God.</p>

<p>Yes. Yes you can. Simply because you <em>believe</em> that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s universal truth. What you accept as fact (without much hard evidence), others dismiss because of lack of evidence.</p>

<p>The Bible makes a lot of claims, many of which have <em>no</em> proof or are just flat out wrong.</p>

<p>For example, when I think of god, I think of a force from which everything stems and all conscious experience arises.  When another person thinks about god, they might think about a man-like entity that transcends our realm and has a vested interest in us.  And a third person may be thinking of a supernatural power or spirit with some level of omnipotence and/or omniscience.  etc etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s two really solid takes on God.</p>

<p>One theory I&#39;ve come to entertain is that God is just the human intent to explain what consciousness is.</p>

<p>Another is that God does exist. Any way you look at it, we are ridiculously complex beings. It took us how long to simply develop &quot;intelligent&quot; design. DNA, visulization abilities, complex problem solving and abstraction. These are not things to be scoffed at, we are created. I tend to lean this myself, but I have a slightly different view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what if you have just fallen for their lies? </p>

<p>imagine this: there is no god, so people who want power invent one. and to indoctrinate other people, they know they must start from young children. so they focus on them and push this lie on them from their very childhood when they are naive and gullible. when they get older, they are already indoctrinated and rarely challenge their belief. </p>

<p>they know that there is no proof for their claims, so they make a unquestioning faith a virtue instead of skepticism. they forbid by law to speak badly against their invented religions, so every dissent is quelled. wouldn&#39;t that be crazy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, in my readings and in my travels I have heard, like you, about men of a superior type, possessing the keys to all our mysteries. Somehow I could not regard this as a simple allegory, this idea of an invisible humanity within visible humanity. Experience has proven, I told myself, that a man can reach truth neither directly nor alone; an intermediary must exist—still human in certain respects yet surpassing humanity in others. Somewhere on our Earth this superior humanity must exist, and it cannot be absolutely inaccessible. And so shouldn’t all my efforts be devoted to discovering it? Even if, in spite of my certainty, I were the victim of a monstrous illusion, I would have nothing to lose in making the effort, for in any case, without this hope, all life is meaningless. “But where to look? Where to begin? I had already traveled the world, stuck my nose everywhere, into all sorts of religious sects and mystical cults, but to each one it was always: maybe yes, maybe no. Why should I stake my life on this one rather than that one? You see, I had no touchstone.

I will say I have no idea how you can be a conspiracy theorist and have absolute faith in the biggest conspiracy of all, GOD.... God was created to control the masses, to keep people in line and fearful by exploiting the one thing all animals fear.... death. We’re literally built for survival, as all animals are, and “God” pushes that survival button because it’s a way to survive after death. I think the reason it’s dying out, and by that I mean why people aren’t tripping over jesus anymore is because my generation and those under me, are more intelligent, we have more information and most importantly we don’t fear death as much because the world we live in is literal hell already so death can’t be much worse, and who gave us that hell, the jesus loving generations before us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a grow older my suspicion is that this is exactly what they do. I imagine that in my teens and 20s I was super typical in that I was an atheist because of school and religious conflict. Now I understand what school IS and who starts the conflict. Once you understand it’s all orchestrated you have to ask why. Once you ask why you can start to sort through how manipulated you were. I believe I spent a good 15 years sleepwalking and accepting my place as an atheist. The wiser I get to things the more I believe in a creator </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turned Buddhist why?  Because you dont believe in God but you do believe in the Buddhas heavily introspective teachings?  Couldnt you just apply some tenets of Buddhism to your life without adhering to the religion itself?  Care to expand on what went into this choice?</p>

<p>I am an atheist myself and its very interesting that you and the other commenter in this reply thread have gone from being atheist to some form of religious.  Because the way i see it, my not believing in God(s) doesnt mean i cant pull from the <em>ideas</em> of religion to become a better person.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Change is everything.</p>

<p>How does a light ray get from the Sun to our eye? Time.</p>

<p>How does an oscillation go from A to B and back to A again? Time.</p>

<p>How do you know if you&#39;re still alive and breathing? Time.</p>

<p>What is the ultimate factor in Schrodinger&#39;s Cat experiment? Time.</p>

<p>When you have an oscillation and you move it relative to something else, say a virtual void behind it, or even the cosmic microwave background, that oscillation in motion becomes what we call a wave. Now there are two factors of time at play, one for the oscillation and one for the relative motion. Another dimension arises, as the one dimensional particle or oscillation is now a wave consisting of two factors of time, and two dimensions. This two dimensional wave can interact with other two dimensional waves, as shown with electromagnetism (the 3D light you referred to), which is a three-dimensional phenomena. In this stage, since there are two waves and each wave has two factors of time, this electromagnetic wave has four factors of time, but as the waves synchronize into one &quot;object&quot; this eliminates one factor of time, and so we are left with three factors of time and three dimensions.</p>

<p>While Einstein was correct in his assumptions about relativity and time, what he didn&#39;t realize was that time governs all dimensions, it is not just icing on a 3D cake for making sense of gravity. It is a real dimension, and it is present in all spatial dimensions.</p>

<p>Just my theory anyway...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is a higher power, a universal code, an energy being tying  everything together, the &#39;god particle&#39;, the force. </p>

<p>Perhaps knowing how to tap the power of the universe to truely dedicating your life, through zen, through prayer, through will to decypher the miricales of your own existance as evidence for the existance of a higher source of creation, is not for everyone. Higher forms of thought, and factor analysation, perhaps ypu can attertain the reality of your being to yourself. Perhaps we are in a computor simulation, there is no proof of that either. Perhaps the source code of our reality ia sicretly there to appease us and out us onto our path, our desitiny, and each person is capable of said great destiny if he chooses to unlock the mind, and soul and be one with the universe. Math after all is the language of the universe, god is a major factor  of our creation of our religious upbringings. Perhaps educating your mind and your soul can help you unlock that power. </p>

<p>Perhaps our realities are just our own, and there is nobody really there. All our sensors could just be in a matrix, and skynet has truely won. Perhaps god, the force, force of desity, magic exists. But to unlock it, means u lcoking the workings of the universe itself. After all, there is some sort of order to this chaos. There are moments in my past memories where i should have died. Truely moments of a fork in my road of life. And the life i had now compaired to thw one i truely want. I have attempted to have an open mind, and to a part i have been successful in having a taste of many different lives of people. The depressed, the heartbroken, the father, the brother, the freind, the richer side of town, the poorer. The monk, and the buissness mogul. </p>

<p>I believe, there are possibilites out there for all of us. How they hide that, is through keeping the mind locked. Through fear, through manioulation. The population have to be just dumb enough to be productive. But just smart enough to do the job. They then sell that knowledge back to us through private schooling. And even then only allowing the prestiege levels of schools of though u der higher tier of pricing. Meaning, the richer you are, the better education you got, the better you are at playing the game of life. But to the answer of god, is religion just a tool to domesticate the primal man, to amke him civilised and police himself in the fear of an idea. Or is it a reality we tell ourself because we are afriad. Afraid of failing, afraid of living their monetery systems behind and forming our own. Having sovereign human identity and not bound under control of any diety. Well thats impossible, because as we see that man needs to rule man to get shit done to unlock more of the universe to command. In the search for power. But like schoulded dogs, cant figure out how to contain the nature of man his greed and lust, to make man, do as he speaks. And perhaps we will all know. But a smart man, a lazy man, an uncontrolled man, cannot be herded to make do the will of the ruling. And anarchy doesnt produce efficient progress. We are stuck between heaven and he, and pur lives are that middle ground. </p>

<p>To unlock.the universe and its rules.of the game, you must have thirst to play the game, you must have the capabilities and brains to play the game, you must gain knowledge, or religions, sciences, philosophies, you must learn to control your brain, your body and soul. Know the people, and know yourself. You must fight, you must think, you must play the sum of games in our lifetimes, we must listen and learn from our elders and build up enough for our kin to make this life worth while. </p>

<p>The porblem is the rulers need a flock able to be controlled, true freedom cant happen when savage beasts succumn to their emotions and unable to cooperate. And as science tells us now, the normative curve of population distribution, it means we still need to be flcoked. And if you can grow ebove the flock to lead, they money cuck everyone. Communism was one good attempt at sharing that kniwl3dge, but alas we arent allowed to have a hybrid. Between the good and the bad, one that works, because there is always the idiot, the aggressor, the manipulator, the weak, the brave out there and together we the people cant seem to overcome these withought just killing each other. And untill we can learn as a species, &quot;they&quot; will not give us the full codex, without us as a species to be able to handle that knowledge and not tear ourselfs apart with it, we have to maintain ourself on our own. Trying to evolove ebove savagery, and not go full AI zombie mode. </p>

I dont k ow how much time yoube spent around younger children around 10-12 but its scary how brainwashed they are.  Hell the local schools dont want God talk but show every kid from elementary to high school cnn news kids version every morning.  Pure propaganda.  God is real and can only be found in the quiet places sithin us when we take time to seek God.  But due to how many are so wrapped up in the day to day how many actually take the time to do so?</p>

<p>I grew up in a household where my parents spoke very openly against religion, but I have always craved the existential comfort that faith and god is able to provide. As an adult, I have begun to view nature, human connections, and love as god in various forms. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to write this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was raised in a Christian family but have been on a journey of spiritual discovery for the last 10 years or so. I&#39;ve been reading books on Buddhism, Christianity and various other spirituality books including some on psilocybin and it&#39;s role in communicating with the divine and/or extra terrestrials.</p>

<p>My viewpoint now is that &quot;God&quot; is not really the bearded old man that many Christians believe him to be. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s any sort of human form or any kind of singular entity. God is the universal intelligence that contains all of our spiritual selves that operate along side us, helping bring people and situations into our lives to learn and grow spiritually, to heal from previous traumas. Praying is helping to attract things and frequencies into your life to bring you what you need and to align yourself with other people&#39;s spiritual selves. It doesn&#39;t always work because what you&#39;re praying about my be the wrong thing. That your spiritual self has other things in mind at the moment.</p>

<p>I do believe that TPTB have been trying to wipe clean our knowledge and ability to connect with the divine though. Through pop culture, re-aligning priorities in life, capitalism keeping us focused on things that do not bring real joy and hurt us spiritually and emotionally. Society has been breaking apart the family and the communal willingness to help eachother out. Glamorizing divorce with television shows about it.</p>

<p>There is knowledge to be gained from learning about our universe and how nature works but to entirely write off any form of spirituality because of the damage that human influenced religion has done is clearly not helping us.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah ive been waiting for this, I full expect my comment/story to never be seen, and if it does i will most likely be downvoted, but here we go. </p>

<p>Hide god, hmmm truth be told I skimmed your post op, I very much envy you and any religious person, no matter what god they chose to worship. From the bits and pieces I skimmed, it would seem you are a traditional christian/catholic (all the same to me, just different interpretations of the rules).</p>

<p>Let me preface what im going to say by stating that, no I am not &quot;religious&quot; per say, but I am agnostic, as there is a higher calling within every molecule of lifeforce. Like the bible says, from the flowers, to the bees you can see &quot;god&quot; in everything, and I see that, but I dont believe it is a christian &quot;god&quot;, I just see the beauty and the strength that is life. As cliched as it sounds, life will always find a way. And as carl sagan really puts it best, 1. We are a way for the universe to recognize itself and 2. The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together. We are beings with souls of pure energy, of all different wavelengths. I always thought it was awfully silly from a awfully young age, that god would send you to hell or heaven to eternity, when nothing in our universe works like that, nothing is created nor destroyed, its merely transformed. </p>

<p>Also, this is the other problem I have with religions, is it just me or do the koran, bible, and sanskrit epics all sound eerily similar, if there is truly one god, why does every culture have its on spin on it. It would make way more sense to me that instead of these books being literal, they were copies of much older, older works, most likely from over 10000 years ago. 
Do we even know anything about what happened 5,000 years ago? lol, humans have a lost history, and its going to remain lost because apparently most people wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the revelation of our true origins. The more you dig into mysteries, and the history of humankinds beginnings (or lack there of really). It just seems like the bible was mistranslated over hundreds of years to help push whoever&#39;s agenda. I bet you never heard of the gospel apocrypha, it was cut out of the king james bible, I only know it exists because I have seen it with my own two eyes, in a bible published in the 1870&#39;s, in it a prophet takes a liquid and starts having visions, in one of these visions he describes what looks like flying swords dropping stars on citys and watching them burn up in a fireball. :|, I tried googling it, but not surprisingly you wont find it, anyone who really wanted to see for their-selves should be able to find a pre 1900&#39;s bible pretty easily, right? Hell even the bible today about soddom and gommorrah? Where buddy takes his family up the mountain and god sends a angel to protect them, telling them not to turn around, and then his wife and kids turn around and turn to ash, go look up the 1800&#39;s artwork for the artist&#39;s interpretation of the event. I kid you not, its a mushroom cloud with lighting bolts around it, do you get what the lightning bolts are? Most people dont, Nuclear Bombs create a huge electromagnetic build up which is released via intense lightning. And people think that our technology is new, hah were living in the new Atlantis, most people just dont realize it. </p>

<p>So my entire point to all this (bravo really to anyone who could read this far, well except the bots or the ones paid to), is what does being a god really mean. There has obviously been more than one god in earth&#39;s history, and I find it amusing, that the GOD, your god, would send you to hell if you dared to believe in another god, (i remember this whole religious persecution thing somewhere before yes). Does being god make you immortal, have the power over life/death, create everything from nothing, its quite a broad term yes. Do I think the illuminati are &quot;hiding&quot; your god, no, but they definitely worship another god, a god that if you believe the rumors is giving them information and technology, so that when your god returns, they are going to fight him instead of laying down and getting wiped out. I actually kinda believe that too, its one of the only thing that kinda makes sense, how else would you get these bloodlines to coordinate at least over the last few hundred years, I know a theme I keep hearing lately, is that no one can stop them now, everything has pretty much fallen in place, and of course it has they have been manipulating the pieces for so long now, helps when you start the empires that build countrys... (railroad, oil, guns,) heh..... what do you think it means when they say the 1% own the the 99%. :|. These familys are all about rituals and secrets, look at the shit they do in the skull and crossbones, this is what they do to the elite youth to brainwash them into fulfilling their missions, make them climb in coffins with real skeletons and kiss members of the same sex. Thats how you break someone........thats just the tip of the iceberg what they have to do to get people to go along with this crazy shit.</p>

<p>I really hope im crazy, maybe im a total hook line sinker of project bluebeam, but I have grown up watching the sky, and have seen to many things that cant be explained, and seen to many ruins, pictures to know we are not alone on this planet. 
But if I see yall getting sucked up in a beam of light and demons are flying around and shit, ill be joining ya realll quick. I try to be good, because I want too, not because Im scared of the big guy. 
Oh thats right but if your jewish then you want to be living in israel as thats where new jerusalem is going to land and pick up all the faithful followers of god who have been patiently waiting, some people think its gonna be a city, some people think its gonna be a cube, i do know that they did build 12 landing pads per instructed to them.</p>

<p>Oh you might get a kick out of this. &quot;Since Christianity originated from Judaism, the history of Jewish places of worship and the currents of thought in ancient Judaism described above served in part as the basis for the development of the Christian conception of the New Jerusalem. Christians have always placed religious significance on Jerusalem as the site of The Crucifixion and other events central to the Christian faith.&quot;, do you see what i mean about how all these religions are just built on top of older religions, things are not as clear as one would think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pantheistic universal God can not be hidden. Instead, they manipulate the way you DEFINE God instead. It is easy to be atheist when God is turned into the Abrahamic version which is then easily dismissed. By tricking you into believing that God is defined as the false God of Abraham it is easy to divorce you from the true pantheistic definition of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, it&#39;s impossible to be atheist when God is defined pantheistically. That is why the &quot;Strawman God&quot; must be created to distort how you view and define God. The false God of Abraham is easily debunked, however, it is essential that you not allow such Strawman Gods to monopolize the way you DEFINE God. False definitions of God should not become the gold standard by which you DEFINE the word God. The pantheistic definition of God is the Gold Standard of how the word God should be defined.</p>

<p>Yes. Yes you can. Simply because you <em>believe</em> that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s universal truth. What you accept as fact (without much hard evidence), others dismiss because of lack of evidence.</p>

<p>The Bible makes a lot of claims, many of which have <em>no</em> proof or are just flat out wrong.</p>
