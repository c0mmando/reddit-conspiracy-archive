       Of late, stories of Jew being attacked in Germany, France and U.S (one incident each) has been making headlines everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/i5mn6mz0n5u01.png">
        Photo: The Rothschilds - Germany gave these Russian Jews refuge and allegedly, they financed  Adolf Hitler to barbeque Jews in gas chambers.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the thing is Israel will not accept any non-Jew but everywhere else must not only give them citizenship, also must legislate law to protect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of particular interest is Germany. Proponents of "Six Million Jews" claimed all Jews in Germany have been holocausted.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, records show that Jews are in Germany all the time.  From some 20,000 in the 1950s to some 150,000 today,  which make Germany the home of the fourth-largest Jewish community in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most came from former Soviet Union just like Rothschild, and surprisingly many are actually
       <strong>
        Israelis
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why do Jews still want to live in Germany, and keep relocating themselves to the place they consider as hostile to their community?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a commentary by an
       <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-Jews-still-live-in-Germany-and-if-they-do-how-are-they-being-treated/answers/30122087">
        Anonymous Jew
       </a>
       (which seems to suggest Germany is "hell" for Jews): -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I’m Jewish, with my paternal ancestors were German Jews. German Jews are Jews who lived in Germany for generations. Some of them lived there for dozens of generations, other immigrated to Germany from Eastern Europe only at end of the 19CE or at beginning of the 20CE, after Germany granted emancipation to its Jewish civilians. Before the emancipation, Jews were not allowed to live in German cities, they had to pay special Jewish tax when entered to such city, they were not allowed to enter it through the main gates and had to leave it by nightfall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their history in Germany was really bitter one, meaning- they been massacred in tens of thousands many times, from early times and up to the 19CE.
       </p>
       <p>
        Germany was never a generous host for the Jewish people, though they contributed it significantly.
       </p>
       <p>
        People love to talk about how Germany changed its face. Well, pardon me- I don’t buy it and for good reasons:
       </p>
       <p>
        There is Berlin, a cosmopolitan city, and there is Germany. Two different things. In Berlin antisemitism is not very common. Outside of it it’s a different story.
       </p>
       <p>
        In surveys done once in a while, between 20 to 30&amp;#37; of Germans admit that they are antisemitis. Practically it means that every German have in his / her circles few people who don’t especially like Jews, so it’s not like their defeat in WWII (defeat, they didn’t stop for moral reasons) somehow uprooted antisemitism.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new and very popular line in German literature that describe the Germans as the real victims of WWII, a war they started.
       </p>
       <p>
        Germany is not allowed according to the international law to pay pensions to SS members for their “service”, even if they were not been trialed. As the international law define anyone who served in the SS as war criminal. However, Germany bypassed that by paying the pensions to their children and grandchildren. The pension sum is twice the sum that Jewish people who been in the death and forces labor camps for years, have most or all of their family murdered by the Germans, been through hell and remained with physical and/or psychological damage (and certainly, all of their property was confiscated by Germany) get.
       </p>
       <p>
        Germany made very little efforts to bring Nazi criminals to justice. In some cases Nazis that were directly responsible for killing of hundreds of Jews were sentenced to few years in prison but never the less didn’t spend even one day in it. For instance- Bruno Beger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Germany signed huge weapon deals with the worst of Israel enemies along the years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Suffice to say Germany is certainly no utopia to Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is Israel that will always accept any Jew, real or fake. And then there is United States that is a virtual "colony" of Israel. So is UK, France, and many other places including Uganda - which is the original Zionist target that escaped the "Zionist Holocaust".
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, the German culture is not even kosher - German are some of the biggest fans of PORK.  Lard is everywhere ... yet more and more Jews chose to settle in Germany and complain about antisemitism all the time.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Question: Why Germany? Why not live in Israel? Is there a reason (or perhaps a conspiracy) to live in Germany, or anywhere else ... that we don't know about?
      </h1>
      <p>
       And if there is a good reason, why then Israel is closed to non-Jews? How do you justify such discrimination?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why do Jews see fit everywhere else must legislate law to protect them, even blackout media (from reporting anything negative about Jews including lies and perhaps also crimes), but the same is not only absent in Israel, in fact, persecution of non-Jews is actually encouraged (by the Netanyahu Regime)?

       I'm Jewish and live in America. I was born here. I have no ties to Israel, so why should I go there and live? Judaism is a religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm 49 and have never experienced anti-semitism in real life, so I am not complaining. The only time I experience it is online.

       The truth is, NEVER, if you're smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       BASIC COMMONALITY.
      </p>
      <p>
       ever notice, the perception of people who are UNLIKE you, and unknowing of your philosophies in knowledge, viscerally think in subliminal instant, when you tell them you are in any way 'different'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is, that difference is so minimal in most people's lives, that it's not even worth mentioning, unless you bring up favorite ice cream and color along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, the only time for linking-similarity of conceptual associations is in trying to build a rapport. No one needs to like you, and if they have a good sense, along with yourself, you can love a person without ever knowing their religion.

       Also, people seem to assume it's jews in the US driving the Zionist cause. THIS IS HALF TRUE. There is certain Jews in the US who believe the US is their proxy protector whose only job is to support Israel's defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never met one of these Jews, outside Israelis who came to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the Jews in the US I have ever known are Americans who have neutral feelings about the Israel, make jokes about the holocaust, ask for jokes about the holocaust, and think settlements are against human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       We like to do all sorts of normal shit. Support the US, and think these wars for oil and Israel are morally WRONG.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other half are two fold, in and of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are zealots, masonic, biblical Babylon wanton and apocalypses friendly, insane people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those others,
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate looters and pirates from elite wealthy families who dictate foreign policy and align to 'paths of least resistance' for wealth - which means war debt, and costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's not 'the Jews'.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a 4000 year old religion with many schism and thus variant-philosophies. Then, there is this crazy 'ethnic-Jewish' thing. Which really mean, you have another contact to a sense of identity, or you're involved in a family that thinks by practicing Hanuka makes them observant by ethnicity enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not these Jews that are the problem, unless banquet identity and religion, like in Christianity and other religions, and all humanity, is the average.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's observant Jews who dont see kabbalah relevance in the Torah.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's those Jews who get sent to those indoctrination summer camps. Not kids who kick it with fellow americans, eating and trying to score beer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's those that want slaves for Jews at the end of the world, want 'conspiracies' like 'greater Israel', and want to deconstruct other people's cultures and replace them with convenient ethno-political ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not people that want to be middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average jew, histoically, has been a pawn also.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE MUST REMEMEBR:
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel was created for Geo-political reasons by the west - Suez canal and OPEC confounding. A nation of ethno-national conscripts whose life is looming-conflict, and they make perfect foot-soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds' are EVIL jews - if you can describe them as such by their non-orthodox qualities of observance or historical confounding of forign and domestic nations. They are actually evil Germans and English, ect. They are cultists originating from Jewish cosmological philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real rulers of the world is the BANKING CABLE that transcends ethnic/religious/class 'identity'. IF anything, is totally about class identity - but, it's much deeper than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real evil is the classic wall street, classic fed, classic Zionists and international bankers, and now globalist enablers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neo-cons, and Neo-libs in the US, and Zionist protecting conservative parties elsewhere, are just useful idiots for the real value of all this chaos - WEALTH AND CONTROL.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the lending class. It starts at all lending classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, be clear when you define a jew. You might be inadequately defining our friend from above, and not adequately applying culpability to those whose evil deserve it: THE BANKERS.

       If the "Good Jews" do not renouce the "Bad Jews", why would you expect others to see "good Jews" differently from the "bad Jews"?
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is now, it would appear "Jewish" is not only a tightly knit "tribe", but it's also a conspiracy that "Jews" will go to every developed nation, gang up to exploit and abuse the resources by corrupting the system and the respective country - bribing and or blackmailing politicians &amp; corporations into puppets ... Not only stealing wealth and opportunities, but also liberty of the people eg. free speech etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end what will be left is ruined bankrupted nations with nothing but debts. And that Israel is the supposed to be safe haven for Jews to run to hide once their conspiracy explodes in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not making accusation here. I am just telling what many people believe to be the "conspiracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I can accept what ManIsBornFree has said. But his explanation is only half of the story and makes no difference to the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like me saying my gang won't kill you, but my gang members are pointing their fully loaded AK47s at you. They have been proven will shoot without any hesitation (just like IDF on Palestinians). And    I don't even attempt to do anything to stop them from shooting you.

       Good question, and very productive intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took time to consider this,
      </p>
      <p>
       I meditated and napped on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond process, we must consider out intention: GOAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is to achieve a PERSONAL sense of understanding the material world with the conceptual, for the PURPOSE of satisfaction of ourselves. Well, This is already too deep for a darn post.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, without existential philosophy and metaphysics, we can talk about about process. . .
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's assume we can achieve this as individuals, in average-habitual means . . .not enlightened (practicing habits of change), but shown how to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, we must propose that the problem is knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) We project beliefs which are an inflation to prop up the meager facts we hold as TRUE knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is knowledge by experience, and knowledge by reference. Our synthesis of those exposes our TRUE KNOWLEDGE.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) True knowledge is facts without doubt. Doubt without end is not even a belief. So, I am assuming we must be pragmatic with our understandings and use them to ascribe a 'how', to the 'who, what, when, where, and why' - for our OWN GOAL of self-respect and other accommodation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others must be accommodated, but they also seem to the the screaming voices of problem for the individual who is innately lost from birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I would say, that you must regard all prior information as 'text book' training, and seek the experience of learning the true facts. This means mediation of your own internal value elicitation to information of all sources to ascertain the truth of multiple voices of variety intention. Use the synthesis of most common facts, and your own values, to makes sense of a situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOUR OWN VALUES. the ones that allow people to love others and befriend people who are nothing like them - basically, institution life exposes love in the oddest ways, homogeneous communities dont have a medium for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their intent is not yours, but their voice can be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next:
      </p>
      <p>
       BE THE VOICE OF REASON. I have my own wars, but no one else is  involved in them. Nor, is any one outside my walking life at war with me anymore than their own intentions. We create our opponents in most cases. Other people's wars are concepts for me in practice and process into understanding of a possible material reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       THEREFORE, we must detach from the effect to know the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only in practice of this, can you come to have a sense, no so much of they 'who, what, when, where, or why' - but you have the HOW in HOW you want to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all that matters, and when we come to know that as individuals, all of us, the self-organizing principles of our species will fill the gaps; when friends meet from foreign places and allow time and fun to fill the gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOT YOUR WAR. OUR WAR, as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, be a mediator of philosophy.

       You certainly wrote a mouthful, but it's only to deflect. The Holocaust isn't real. The "BANKING CABLE," as you call it, is dominated by a certain group of people. Freemasonry was infiltrated by them as well. Who benefits from Zionism? Who

       I will meet you in the middle and expose that I also think that the numbers were inflated for shoa.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also expose how I understand that the 'death camps' were only in soviet cleared locations, and this could fit a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will also expose how bankers, some Jewish, aided the nazies in thier endeavors that lead to shoa. I mean, they were technically zionists in their desire to make a jewish homeland someplace else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between communism and Nat-socialist, it seems there is a convenient Zionist cause being necessitated.

       Got all that, bro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, still, millions of HUMANS died, and many of them were innocent Jewish people. Many of them were homosexuals, and Romani, and polish. . .
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact millions of innocent people died is enough for me to say, the holocaust was absolutely real. The fact people claim it as their own, is kind of group-oriented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of those people were Jews.  Yet, The human separated from their cult or tribe will see, there is many mass killings that should be called genocides, and the strife of the German civilian - no matter how much hate they hold - was also a post-war genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is fairness in death, once we look at the human toll in suffering and EVIL.

      <p>
       This is very true in early capitalism and currency markets. The 'merchant' image is based on historical preference for trans-territorial merchentalism - or, that was the only accommodation to meeting a jew most medieval people had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, I dont see Wall streets early history dominated by jews. I see it NOW dominated by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I think the Anglo-american order, adopted Zionist banking funds and global-order, in time, has created the WASP-zionist (neo) agenda. I mean, Rhodes was part of this thing, and look what happened to Rhodesia after he was used up.

       You really think the average Israeli citizen, who is conscripted to perform evil, is the beneficiary of all this chaos?
      </p>
      <p>
       The wealth disparity in Israel is greater than in the US. It's a country of weapons manufacturing and technocratic masters, whose families actually live in Switzerland and the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'benefiting Jews' in mass, in Israel, are the ones fighting an endless turf war for some fat-cat who has shares in the fed and BoI, who lives in a nice European city.

       This isn't the Holocaust though. What you're describing are casualties of War and a harsh Wartime policies. Jews were targeted for being communist and their role in the November Revolution. There was no Final Solution and no "death camps."
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also ignoring some uncomfortable facts: Jews in America are twice as rich as their Gentile counterparts. They are far over-represented among billionaires and millionaires. Yes, the average Israeli or Jew might not always benefit, but ultimately, Zionism is about Greater Israel which benefits elite Jews who wish to rule the world. They will happily throw Jews under the bus as Zionist groups have done in the past.

       It's also your/OUR job to be intelligent enough to see people as persons, and not generalize a necessity on them, as one we dont hold as a constant for ourselves (kant).

       Yeah, expulsion for having royal debts to a private banker or the expulsion of Rome, and expulsion by proto-Persians. . .it adds up.

       Early Jews were Talmudist and were hated for NOT conforming. Now they lead progressive and conformist endeavors?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called Non-Talmudist exploiting niche markets of perceived 'taboo'.

      <p>
       That's a banker issue, and Prescott Bush was not a jew. Remember?
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, the feds control does not directly benefit the average jew, it's only really benefiting people who have shares in the private companies in charter.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the average Israeli jew with the BoI and the average American jew, with the Fed, are both fucked.

       You think progressiveness isn't also spreading through Israel?

       Quick response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appreciated you at least willing to accept the conspiracy theory is not unfounded and is reasonable for discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you have avoided answering the core questions directly by insinuating evil deeds is not carried out in the name of "Jewish". Rest assured most thinking folks see and feel otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       There remains no clear answer how should folks react in the event of apocalypse. I am afraid the same old "Six Million Jews" is the likely the consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since the post has been murdered right from the start, I 'd start a new post, and continue to do so till the end of time. Please tell your peers be classy if you may, stop doing the low life thing - downvoting to bury post, if you too believe the discussion will be beneficial to all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please continue to provide your view on all the question including those you have brushed off as NOT a Jewish thing, that everyone else also do the same thing ... Which I disagree cos ADL (and other Jewish organization all do thing under the "Jewish" banner. unless mass renunciation takes place, the "Jewish business" is still very much community specific, and Israel is 100% Jewish. And I also disagree it's "their Business is not my business" simply becos they are doing business in your name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: No apparent solution to the conspiracy yet.

       Because Jews cannot exist as a majority. They don’t do any work. They aren’t farmers, they don’t work manufacturing jobs, they don’t fight in the military. Jews need other peoples around them to survive. Forgive me for saying this but I find the Jews to be parasitical. A parasite always wants to find the strongest host. Jews will never live among weak tribes such as the Pygmies in Africa. Jews need to be around strong people. And there is nobody more innovative and industrious than the German people. So obviously the Jew has an easy time fitting in in places like Germany. Also they fit in with the German people in terms of skin color if they don’t grow those beards and speak the Language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel relies heavily on international support. I don’t think it would be in the best interest of the Jewish people if every one of them moved to Israel. That would probably lead to less sympathy for Zionism in the countries that are Israel’s best allies and they would wield less influence here.

       You live where you were born. If you were born in Germany and speak German, why would you move to Israel (that's not safe and has weird laws)? Only poor or fanatic Jews chose to repatriate to Israel.

       It would be most useful to study the lineage of the personnel in mid-level and upper-level leadership across the German government agencies and military before and during WW2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some modern historians are investigating and partially substantiating claims that large numbers of Jews and more specifically Ashkenazi Jews, as well as foreign intelligence agents, were in charge of everything. Over 2/3 apparently were in on some secret plan in compartmentalized units with limited views to the plan to emigrate the Jews to a new Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the documents referenced in this research are in Russian possession, after they stole the relevant archives and interviewed the key people involved post WW2 using KGB style tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes you really wonder what the whole holocaust was about, an inner struggle after some brainwashed ‘pure thinkers’ found out the prisoners they thought were ‘useless’ were being emigrated to Israel as they were instead seen as ‘prized possessions’. So the rebellion within the nazi party began and attempts to overthrow the rebellion allowed the allied forces to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusions would certainly be motivation to the opposing ‘pure thinking’ germans who weren’t in on it, likely leading them to go crazy in a ‘final solution’.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously if Hitler was in on the original plan, it wouldn’t make sense for him to order mass extermination until after he lost control of the nazi party. Or maybe he was truly mad, there is a lot of evidence to still back that up. But there is also evidence he likely survived into old age in South America. Go figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       To really take a step further into modern day....These observations by modern historians are being closely held for the tine being, and in my view, likely they are waiting because HRC gave Russia UR1 deal intentionally to create a Russian smoke screen in the US. Brilliant strategy until Trump was elected. Now it’s getting untangled and we may get a slightly modified, modernized view of WW2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the truth break?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not, otherwise my 5th-12th grade history and social sciences education in high school was a waste.

       What you said does hold water.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's said Hitler gave Jews 7 years to leave, Israel was already established, yet they are telling us 6 millions Jews were left behind and exterminated! Let's not argue over the "6 millions", if that number makes them happy, so be it, my question is,
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why the Jews wouldn't leave Germany, sure they could do it since they were given 7 years to do so. Or,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why wouldn't Israel accept them? (I was told he reason isZionists were playing with Eugenics, they wanted only perfect Jews).  Still,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why wouldn't they leave for other places? Many left for the UK and US, like Einstein, the first one to run away, why there are still 6 millions left behind to be brutally "barbequed"?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rotchschilds were already the richest family on earth long before that, why would they help to rescue the poor Jews? Hitler is after all their buddy (I imagine he would be too happy to let them go, instead of trying to find so many ovens to gas them, right?)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Anyway, let's just say if the "Jewish Boss" doesn't want us to know, we will never find out the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I care more is what I asked "ManIsBornFree" ... What's "Good Jews" going to do to free themselves from the "Bad Jews"?
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8eywwo/is_there_conspiracy_why_jews_chose_to_live/dxznbza">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8eywwo/is_there_conspiracy_why_jews_chose_to_live/dxznbza
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If what "ManIsBornFree" mentioned is true, and if history is anything to go by, then fate of the "Good Jews" will the same as the "six millions Jews". The "Bad Jews" will leave them behind as "sacrifice".... right?

        What is the definition for "Kike" according to your 3 degrees? And what wrong with the word? Why are you upset with the word?
       </li>
       <li>
        In case you're not aware, you're talking to a creative person here. A few of the new terms in this world are actually coined by me eg. "Kiko". (with no specific meaning yet. Just don't know what to call an angry "intelligentsia" like you. That's why).
       </li>
       <li>
        What makes you think I am a "Nazi"? What's wrong with "Nazi"? Are "Nazi" any worse than "Zionist"?
