        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy angle to this is, I think drugs are way more important than we think. </p>

<p>Bro I just tripped and saw all of my fleshy ideas of things strip away, like some kind of wheel, the Earth is. It just spins, crashing into all things, the creator of all things. </p>

<p>All people do this, but I especially suffer from <em>dwelling</em> on the past and future. I’m a huge history and science nerd, so times, dates, events, and experiences are always replaying in my mind 24 hours a day. When I lost the love of my life it just got worse, I remembered everything we had done the previous year, and paired it with what I was doing around that time the current year. I still do this, <em>another year later</em> </p>

<p>It’s horrifying. Like being trapped in the twilight zone. </p>

<p>I’ve noticed when I do drugs (my drugs of choice are cocaine, ecstasy, mdma, and adderall), which I have done more of this last 12 months than the previous 60 months put together, I live in the moment. The dates, the times, the places, the people; nooooonnnne of it matters. All that matters is how beautiful <em>that</em> over there is, how wonderful <em>this</em> moment is, how much I have <em>right now.</em> </p>

<p>But I can’t seem to fully drag those things into my sober life. I’ve had my bouts with paganism and meditation etc, but lately I can’t focus unless I’m doing some kind of drug. </p>

<p>I pay attention to myself and my own mannerisms, so take it for what it’s worth, I’m worried about myself, from myself. Like, how could I witness this change inside of me and <em>not</em> react to it? Why?</p>

<p>You need to be careful my friend. All of those drugs, used in a group setting, individually, and incredibly sparingly, will create no harmful long-term effects. But ultimately, what you are doing with sustained use, is burning out your dopamine receptors. Coke and Addie will quickly lead to Meth if you aren&#39;t careful- you&#39;ll always be seeking that next thrill. You gotta pull back, because while it may seem like a good idea now, you are in reality on a fast track towards self destruction. </p>

<p>You probably won&#39;t listen to me- I&#39;m just a random internet stranger, but I&#39;ve seen this before and am no stranger to these substances. I&#39;ve seen it play out even worse in friends. I beg you to take a step away from the amphetamines. </p>

<p>I worry for you because even though the rational part of your mind tells you this now, in 6-8 months when the Addie and Coke aren&#39;t doing what they used to, or you can&#39;t get hold of them, you&#39;ll be tempted again to go for that deeper high of Meth. You gotta get away from the Amphetamines in general. If you have an Addie scrip you need to let it lapse and not visit the Psych in 3 months time when it&#39;s up for renewal.</p>

<p>I hate to be the person that recommends more drugs in place of drugs, but I would seriously try just smoking some pot and chilling out. You need mellow, not uppers. And even then, the best thing to do is to avoid all substances and figure out a way to be happy with yourself as you are- and Reality as it is naturally perceived (from your un-chemically altered brain). </p>

<p>I know it is easier said than done, but I hope you will at least consider my words going forward. You&#39;re not alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Addie is a wonder drug for some...it will focus you in on even the most mundane of tasks, give you a clean, or perhaps what is better described as a more &quot;clear&quot;, euphoria (as opposed to coke), and lasts a lot longer.

    <div class="md"><p>Would really like to encourage you to keep being introspective! That is a very good thing and you&#39;re coming across as open and honest with yourself and others in here, that is a first good move. </p>

<p>u/Bradok is giving you some very sincere, strong advice and encouragement - please read his words and take them to heart. This is a good place with people that really care.</p>

<p>The next move I would ask of you is some real face to face time. Take the money that you would spend to get loaded and go see a personal councilor that <em>deals in relationships</em>. Did you see that I didn&#39;t say drugs? You&#39;re going to talk about the drugs but your <em>issue</em>, imho is indeed your grief over this lost relationship. Perhaps other relationship issues as well.</p>

<p>We learn to numb ourselves but you&#39;re talking about this loss and that is an important distinction! I&#39;m sorry for your loss, really I am but you&#39;re losing yourself in this process and you need someone to help you unpack this so you can heal up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re 100% correct I think, and thank you. I’m not someone who trusts prescription drugs (especially opiates) but I sort of just caught wind of adderall last year. The mental torture of losing my girl is what drove me into this; that I’m certain of. I remember myself before all of this. I was different. Happier but not “better” </p>

<p>I have these brief moments of intense happiness in life now like never before but mostly it’s come from drugs if I’m being honest. Every now and then I have a sober one. I don’t think I want to talk to a therapist because I personally don’t think there’s anything “wrong with me” I think my closest friend betrayed me and it hurt really bad, and I’ve just begun picking up the pieces. </p>

<p>That broken heart of yours won’t repair itself any time soon if you keep pumping all that jet fuel into it.</p>

<p>First thought is that this type of post doesn’t really belong here.</p>

<p>Second thought is that I would, as others have pointed out, start saving the money you spend on those uppers and start putting them towards a new hobby. Focusing your mind on a new challenging task is highly effective at reducing and eliminating heart ache. It’s also incredibly rewarding. (My suggestion is learning a programming language!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I could add to this-  imho - keep off the drugs and let yourself feel the pain of your lost relationship.  Heartbreak/ grief comes in waves and they get less frequent and less intense overtime. Just don’t fight it or block it - let the feeling happen and then it will pass. Also practice thinking about yourself in the future and thinking positive thoughts . Life does go on and you’re not alone with feeling like this. Also one final thought - keep busy .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. </p>

<p>It sucks to probably hear this so much. I mean, I haven’t even scrolled through the comments but I know it’s probably mentioned a lot...</p>

<p>It’s the drugs. Let me explain. </p>

<p>Your brain is chemically induced into dealing with shit from life - but in a chemically induced state confidence. Euphoria. Happiness. Excitement. Whatever - you name it. </p>

<p>Then you have these wild epiphanies.. that’s not your brains natural thoughts... you haven’t gotten to those yet. </p>

<p>When you do - you’re sober. And it hits you like a ton of bricks because you haven’t ACTUALLY dealt with anything yet...</p>

<p>If you want to get past this shit - actually deal with it. It’s okay to feel upset. It’s human. You just keep going until one day you’re doing great. </p>

<p>Doing drugs will make you feel that way... while you’re high. But it’s just that. A high feeling.. not how you actually feel. It’s bullshit and fake. </p>

<p>Drugs are less of the answer than most people think. </p>

<p>The answer is in your mind. Not what you put in it. ;)</p>
