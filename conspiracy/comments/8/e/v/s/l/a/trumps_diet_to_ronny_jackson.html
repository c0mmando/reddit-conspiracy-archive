       I'm seeing the MSM extort Ronnie Jackson.  Look at the minion posting articles on here.  Looks like TPTB want Ronny to dance to their tune.  Maybe they want some scoop on Trump's health.  Or do they want to create a health issue with Trump so they can heart-attack him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump should switch doctors and people should stop bullying Ronny Jackson.

       This is retarded.

       You post to T_D and got triggered a few minutes ago arguing that healthy people eat fast food because Trump can do no wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get over yourself. Trump is a fat fuck and hiring a doctor to head the VA makes as much sense as hiring a mechanic to oversee road construction.

       Having been around alcoholics all my life and recovery folks, I feel awful for Jackson in that, he's obviously a high functioning alcoholic.  The signs are all there: tales of drinking on duty, passed out drunk when needed one morning, terrible at leadership abilities, emotionally a child...all of it hallmarks of a lifelong alcoholic.
      </p>

       I hope he gets help.

       You are the one trying to smear Ronny as an alcoholic because of his characteristics.  When I read those characteristics I immediately thought of Clinton.  I believe she has more indications of being a semi-functional alcoholic than Dr. Jackson.

       No you are not trolling but many are on this very post.  Its a shame you share the same opinions as they do.  I would be willing to have good dialogue but I get worked up and then take it out on you.   My apology for being a jerk.

       They called him a Russian, a Nazi, a Klansman, a Misogynist, a cheeto, and now he's fat. What will it be tomorrow? They can't say he is a loser though and it must sting given how obsessed they are with him.

       Its crazy how their hate for Trump is greater than anything else important in their life. I'm thinking we will see a wave of Therapist who specialize in Hate Trump Syndrome.   We are seeing California try to become its own country.

       I knew alot of Republicans who obviously disliked Obama but this is something else. They didn't let Obama consume their entire being like this. They hated Obama's policies, these people hate Trump himself. Probably what inevitable with a generations of millennials who never lost anything as children be forced to admit defeat.

       It's effectively brainwashing by the national media. Two Minutes Hate in 1984 kind of stuff.

       They were certainly programmed differently.  We have a generation of self entitled dumb ass cry babies.  However I know a lot of older people who are right there with them.  I honestly believe the news is the biggest culprit.  When Obama was elected I couldn't stand to be around people who were listening to Rush.  They sure thought their world was over.  What we see now is pure ugly crazy HATE.

       Yeah the differences are huge. The average Rush listener wanted Obama's policies to fail because they were angry about taxes and healthcare.

       These people want to see photos of Trump's cock and to humiliate him. It's bizarre.
