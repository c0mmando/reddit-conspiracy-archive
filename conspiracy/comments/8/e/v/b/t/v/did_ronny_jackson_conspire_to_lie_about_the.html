        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s clear that Ronny Jackson has some serious skeletons in his closet related to drinking and leadership. But the worst is the allegation that he over-prescribed pills, particularly ambien and &quot;something to wake people up.&quot;</p>

<p>During Jackson&#39;s press conference after POTUS&#39; physical, it was clear that he was lying about the president&#39;s weight. Given the new allegations, there&#39;s reason to believe that he lied about other aspects of how Trump is doing and what he&#39;s being given.</p>

<p>Was Jackson asked/told to lie? Was he given the Secretary of Veterans Affairs nomination as a reward? </p>

<p>There needs to be an immediate Congressional investigation. I know it&#39;s hard for a Republican Congress to investigate something that isn&#39;t related to Hillary Clinton, but this is important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;it was clear that he was lying about the president&#39;s weight. &quot;</p>

<p>OP can you explain more? </p>

<p>&quot;there&#39;s reason to believe that he lied about other aspects of how Trump is doing and what he&#39;s being given.&quot;</p>

<p>Reason, evidence, facts? </p>

<p>&quot;Was Jackson asked/told to lie?  Was he given the Secretary of Veterans Affairs nomination as a reward? &quot;</p>

<p>Speculation is deep here but I noticed the MSM is trying to paint this picture as well.  Is this because more Hillary emails were released today?  Or is it due to the child sex trafficking circle going down with ties to billionaires and politicians?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is reality. It doesn&#39;t make you healthy because you don&#39;t eat fast food.  People can eat bad processed food from the store. A lot of &quot;healthy&quot; diets are not healthy.  Lifestyle, hobbies, environment and social life impact health not just food.  Genetics tops the list of health.  Did you know Radon gas kills 21,000 people a year?  More than gun shootings but you don&#39;t see reports of Radon water tests by the city or state - you don&#39;t hear about it because people are obsessed with stupid tabloid stories.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if Jackson fudged the numbers, although considering people tend to get shorter as they age he probably did, but I can tell you from personal experience that when I got my driver&#39;s license at 16 or 17 I was only 6&#39; and I had a growth spurt in the years afterwards and I am now 6&#39;2&quot;. I was never asked or had the possibility to change my driver&#39;s license though, so my height on official documents is still the same as when I was a teenager.</p>

<p>I had the onset of adult diabetes.  And what you find is it causes a bunch of shit you never thought like high blood pressure, hypertension, high cholesterol, bad blood sugar, loss of feeling in the limbs, low energy from the sugar spiking in the diet.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it is to avoid processed and packaged food.  They hide cheap sugar and carbs in it all.  (Look for carbs, those are sugar too).</p>

For a man that has spent a lifetime exaggerating aspects of his life (wealth for example) it is very unlikely that he would under report his height on his drivers license. Also how a known friend of Jeff Epstein and a man who has been accused of child rape has become the leader of the anti trafficking movement is beyond me.  I get supporting him politically if that’s your thing but if he is the face of anti-trafficking I think we have a fox in the hen house. </p>
