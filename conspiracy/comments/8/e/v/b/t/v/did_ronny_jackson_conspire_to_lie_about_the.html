       It's clear that Ronny Jackson has some serious skeletons in his closet related to drinking and leadership. But the worst is the allegation that he over-prescribed pills, particularly ambien and "something to wake people up."
      </p>
      <p>
       During Jackson's press conference after POTUS' physical, it was clear that he was lying about the president's weight. Given the new allegations, there's reason to believe that he lied about other aspects of how Trump is doing and what he's being given.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Jackson asked/told to lie? Was he given the Secretary of Veterans Affairs nomination as a reward?
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be an immediate Congressional investigation. I know it's hard for a Republican Congress to investigate something that isn't related to Hillary Clinton, but this is important.

      <p>
       Speculation is deep here but I noticed the MSM is trying to paint this picture as well.  Is this because more Hillary emails were released today?  Or is it due to the child sex trafficking circle going down with ties to billionaires and politicians?

       Here is reality. It doesn't make you healthy because you don't eat fast food.  People can eat bad processed food from the store. A lot of "healthy" diets are not healthy.  Lifestyle, hobbies, environment and social life impact health not just food.  Genetics tops the list of health.  Did you know Radon gas kills 21,000 people a year?  More than gun shootings but you don't see reports of Radon water tests by the city or state - you don't hear about it because people are obsessed with stupid tabloid stories.

       Isn't obesity based on BMI?
      </p>
      <p>
       A 6'2'' person could easily weigh 239 and be fit. At 5'2" the same weight qualifies as obese. I don't think the method of determination is as simple as you make it out to be.

       I've peaked at 230lb before (beer and ice cream were culprits) and I was still height/weight proportional and looked totally average, wore a 36 waist- looked half the size of Trump. The only way that tweedle-dum body type weighs 239 is if he's filled with stuffing. Dude is probably 300 these days, easy.

       And why even lie? Why not say that like many Americans, the president is struggling with his weight, making good food choices, and finding time to exercise? It would be the most humanizing thing anyone has said about Trump in years.

       If it wasn't obvious, Trump is a little insecure about his appearance. The combover, the ill-fitting suits, the orange...he's sensitive about his weight, baldness, and other things, and he's made some interesting decisions about how to remedy those problems. It wouldn't surprise me if he was obsessed with BMI numbers and the "obese" label. Having Jackson lie about his weight would fit Trump's pattern of drawing attention to a physical issue rather than fixing or concealing it.

       I don't know if Jackson fudged the numbers, although considering people tend to get shorter as they age he probably did, but I can tell you from personal experience that when I got my driver's license at 16 or 17 I was only 6' and I had a growth spurt in the years afterwards and I am now 6'2". I was never asked or had the possibility to change my driver's license though, so my height on official documents is still the same as when I was a teenager.

       All I know is that Donald Trump has more energy and stamina that I do! He is 71 years old and I'm 49. I should be running circles around this man, but I know I can't. Remember before the election how many rallies he was doing a day? It was a lot! He was going non-stop. He still does! I know for a fact that I couldn't have done it.

       He gets into the office at 11AM, and usually has no more that two events on his schedule. He's also spent over a quarter of his presidency at various vacation properties. That doesn't seem "non-stop" to me.

       My doctor prescribed it because I have symptoms of Chronic Fatigue. So I'm taking it for now (to help me keep going through the day).
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have been researching a lot and am going to get off it next month. I am going to treat it naturally, with the right food, vitamins, herbs, etc.

       Apropos of nothing, but your doctor prescribed that medication because it's shown the most efficacy at treating your illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If herbs or vitamins did that, that's what your doctor would prescribe.

       Yes, it helps. But it is just fixing the symptoms. It isn't fixing the problem that is causing the fatigue. So I want to figure out what is causing the fatigue and fix that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the first way to do that is to get body healthy, which means eating the right foods and exercising.

       Hey, have you read up on low carb diets?  As we've posted here lately, the sugar industry paid off scientists to claim the fats were the problem but now it turns out that sugar and carbohydrates are killing us and they are in all processed foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally got my mom (after she got diabetes) to go low carb and she reversed her diabetes, got off the pills and feels great.

       I had the onset of adult diabetes.  And what you find is it causes a bunch of shit you never thought like high blood pressure, hypertension, high cholesterol, bad blood sugar, loss of feeling in the limbs, low energy from the sugar spiking in the diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to think about it is to avoid processed and packaged food.  They hide cheap sugar and carbs in it all.  (Look for carbs, those are sugar too).

       If you can take one look at that walking pile of vanilla pudding and see anything less than 250 pounds you are delusional. For a man that has spent a lifetime exaggerating aspects of his life (wealth for example) it is very unlikely that he would under report his height on his drivers license. Also how a known friend of Jeff Epstein and a man who has been accused of child rape has become the leader of the anti trafficking movement is beyond me.  I get supporting him politically if that’s your thing but if he is the face of anti-trafficking I think we have a fox in the hen house.
