    <div class="md"><p>How is the ACA a perfect example? The GOP fought hard against it and it took some serious political maneuvering to get <em>barely</em> enough votes to pass. The ACA was the best option the Democrats had on the table that even had a remote chance of passing given that they weren&#39;t guaranteed to have a filibuster proof senate.</p>

<p>And brushing off everything that goes against the narrative of collaboration is disingenuous. Economic philosophies, social welfare, rights for minorities, abortion, the environment! - the list goes on and on. What you consider a &quot;wedge issue&quot; is someone else&#39;s primary issue. </p>

<li><p>To get anything through in the Senate you need to have a filibuster-proof supermajority (60 votes). During Obama&#39;s tenure, this only happened during two periods: 7/7/09-8/25/09 and 9/25/09-2/4/10. </p></li>
<li><p>The Dems also needed to ensure no defectors, meaning it also had to appeal to moderate Democrats. Anything to the left of the ACA would&#39;ve been a non-starter.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true in theory. The practice may be quite difficult. Realistically, local low-technology urban-gardeners and craftspeople cannot be expected to fully provide for themselves, in anything like a modern lifestyle. We either become primitives, with primitive expectations, or we retain some large chunk of the current economic system based on high technology and resource mining and inevitable income inequality.</p>

<p>A better possibility is to re-introduce analog technology in such a way that all humans can understand, utilize, and reproduce that technology to live comfortably. Digital technology in its current form cannot be &quot;crafted from scratch&quot; - you cannot manufacture at home the logic chips that run the show. We have to find an alternative that is as powerful as computers in the role of a common communication and information, but far simpler to understand, fabricate and operate. Something akin to to JRR Tolkienesque gazing balls and looking basins and rings of power, etc. This is how weird we must become.</p>

More than 6,000 Falun Gong members are being held.  The secret prison has a &#39;body incinerator&#39; as well as many medical doctors.  Nobody who goes in there comes out alive.

    <div class="md"><p>Well my point was more the difference between someones faith in say christianity vs islam as an example. Since they both can&#39;t be true then how can faith be a reliable way to determine what is true or false? I think faith is a horrible way to process data of the universe because it ultimately makes the human discount contradictory evidence to their own world view when evidence and repeatability with that evidence (science) so far is the best way to understand the world.</p>

<p>Also, a belief in a thing is also contextual. So when scientists tell me the universe is 13 billion years old because of red-shift I can &quot;believe&quot; it because it doesn&#39;t affect my life. If scientists came back and said &quot;you know what we dun goofed and the universe is 15 billion years old&quot; nothing in my life changes.</p>

<p>If those scientists said &quot;we need you to do these certain actions and read these books everyday&quot; because the universe is 13 billion years old then I would be much more skeptical and demand lots more evidence.</p>

<p>The demand of the claim is pretty important, context is key.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to prove it, your response is nonsense, no one knows if there is anything other than our material universe BUT we do know there is a material universe. The only thing we do know is that everything we experience comes from the material universe including all our thoughts which arise from our material brain and chemical reactions. You would need to demonstrate that something exists that is not material or arises from the material other than that to believe otherwise is fallacious.</p>

<p>The statement </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if there was no material universe there would be no &quot;A&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is based on the fact that every logical absolute SO FAR is contingent on the material universe, however as a caveat yes its possible something else not of the material exists and thus extends to &quot;A&quot; BUT there is ZERO reason to believe that because there&#39;s no evidence of it and our entire experience is related with the material world. No one has demonstrated that &quot;A&quot; can exist without the material so to believe otherwise is foolish, not that there&#39;s no possibility but you are pleading with the phrase</p>

<p>&quot;anything is possible&quot;</p>

<p>So yea there might be some aspect to reality which is supernatural but guess what theres zero evidence for it now move along</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to be able to explain how my brain formed sentences. That&#39;s an argument from ignorance, just because on cannot explain a thing doesn&#39;t mean its supernatural.

<p>I live in a country that is highly charged and there are white and black groups working hard to promote really bad agendas and propaganda that could inflame the whole country. Last thing we need are these northern hemisphere white guys who dont know shit.</p>

<p>Here is an example of some white shit that went down yesterday: <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/look-outrage-over-effigy-of-education-mec-panyaza-lesufi-14658769">https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/look-outrage-over-effigy-of-education-mec-panyaza-lesufi-14658769</a></p>

<p>Yes, they are genetically and biologically predisposed to violence, or, rather, have much larger brain stems and as such have much more pronounced compulsions which are harder to resist. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/N5Fi80B.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/N5Fi80B.jpg</a>  It is not comfortable, but it is still true, regardless of our feelings.

<p>If that&#39;s how you feel, I guess there&#39;s nothing I can do. The science is sound, the stats are from the BOJS and directly from the USDW. I can point you to more information if there are parts you take issue with in a methodological way, and I&#39;m not prejudiced. I go into interpersonal interactions expecting the best of anyone I meet. It&#39;s another matter to try and understand the world as can be measured.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think anyone saying that means the term in the sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_forgery">&quot;Literary Forgery.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Literary forgery (also known as literary mystification, literary fraud or literary hoax) is writing, such as a manuscript or a literary work, which is either deliberately misattributed to a historical or invented author, or is a purported memoir or other presumably nonfictional writing deceptively presented as true when, in fact, it presents untrue or imaginary information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a little bit different than painting the Mona Lisa and claiming it&#39;s the original or even it just being an unauthorized copy of the Da Vinci original. It&#39;s more like painting something entirely new in the &quot;style&quot; of Da Vinci and saying that he painted it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racial statistics and biological differences between the same. </p>

<p>Black people commit over 1/2 of all murders. They have an average <a href="https://i.imgur.com/r3poJVD.jpg">IQ of 78</a> which is a result of their being the original humans who did not ever migrate outwards to mate with and gain the advantages of Neanderthals and Denisovans. This is why they diverge so little from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yVfMnY0.jpg">Chimpanzees</a> (not saying black people are &quot;monkeys&quot;. It is a measure by which geneticists measure divergence) </p>

<p>The difference in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/N5Fi80B.jpg">brain structure</a> such as the much more pronounced brain stem and much simpler convolutions upon the supragranular layer directly explain the extreme difference in intelligence and the lack of ability to control compulsions (the brain stem is the seat of instinct). We do not teach this because it is uncomfortable in a world focused on equality in all things. Black people also are more intuitive and physically intelligent, which we are all more than happy to talk about and accept, but negative truths on the other side of that coin are taboo. </p>

<p>This forcibly creating false equality in the form of welfare and hiring quotas aka affirmative action results in black people costing <a href="https://i.imgur.com/N5Fi80B.jpg">$750,000</a> per person per lifetime. This means that the current population of black people will cost 26 trillion dollars, not accounting for new births, not accounting for inflation. As uncomfortable as it is, white men  and Asians are the only demographics who contribute to the bottom line rather than costing. White women also cost. White men contribute $200,000 over their lifetime in taxes. This means that it takes almost 4 white men to pay for each black person. Of course, if they reach 20% of our population, every white man would not be able to pay for the welfare of black people alone, much less that larger population of Hispanics who cost $250,000 per person. This is a huge part of why we run a deficit as a nation, and were it not this way, every working individual would see an increase of $24,000 per year in average salary. We pay far more in welfare than we do in military spending, as insane as our mil spending is on its own, yet we only hear criticisms of mil spending. This of course does not excuse blatant injustices such as well over half of all wealth being concentrated in the hands of 1% of the population, but it is a piece of the puzzle that is the question of &quot;why are we so poor when we work so much and produce so much?&quot;</p>

<p>People will probably choose to attack the genetic information I have presented with litigiousness, but they will ignore the devastating effect of the cost of their welfare.</p>

<p>IQ can be raised by study and environment by ~20 points on the high end of the estimate. If you have a natural baseline of 60-70 (as is true of Africans in general) then you can only raise so high. It is not comfortable but it is true. </p>

<p>What do you mean? In terms of IQ there is only so much a person can do with the hardware that came preinstalled. I don&#39;t understand what you mean by malleability, specifically, and how it related to IQ other than what I&#39;ve already talked about..</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Competence isn&#39;t the same thing as intelligence. Charlie in Flowers for Algernon was a very competent baker&#39;s assistant, for instance, but he was certainly far from intelligent. Not trying to be nitpicky, but again exceptions do not disprove rules..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what do you propose we do? Genocide the blacks because they score 20 IQ points lower? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. To be honest, I think we have two realistic options in light of the statistics I&#39;ve mentioned. First, we have to do something about welfare and violence. If we do something about the first, the second will rise. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t care about black people or that I wish them anything but the best, but we simply cannot continue to pay them the incredible sums we currently do. Not only is it not sustainable, but it creates within the black community a culture of dependence. So, we can educate people as to the violence of black people so that they will be wary when we remove welfare, or, we can help black people create a functional nation of their own. As much as it gets me hated, I think that the best thing to do with this problem is undo the damage of slavery and assist black people in creating their own nation, in Africa. We are judging a race of fishes by their ability to climb a tree, and it is harming so many people. Were it not for the violence aspect, I would say let&#39;s just remove welfare and teach people the skills they need to survive, but black people commit well over half of all murders and a greater percentage of violent crime in general, so I think what is best is to stop that, first and foremost, and it would only be made worse by removing welfare, so, logically, I would say they should go back to their homeland so that they can try, with all the help and guidance we can offer, to create a functioning nation of their own, by their own, or not, which is ok if they choose not to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you want to teach kids in school these statistics you posted and make whites them hate blacks and start a race war? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think the truth should ever be hidden. It causes more problems than good no matter the intentions. Race war would be a bad thing, so we need to take action before it comes to that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The blacks are here to stay. Only education and integration will fix the problem. What is your solution?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have tried everything we can in order to help them and for our troubles we are hated by them, while they, as 13% of the population, commit, again, over 1/2 of all murders. They simply can not get a free ride and a free pass for their crimes while we feel sorry for them and hate ourselves for what are the results of their own actions, and the traits inherent to their biology. It is not comfortable, but I&#39;m trying to find a workable solution that won&#39;t end up with black people getting massacred and stops the unsustainable drain of resources now required to keep them alive and relatively non-violent. All of those who are like you and willingly and consciously choose ignorance over truth are in fact making the problem worse, and we can&#39;t continue this way just hoping things will one day change. </p>

<p>Can you prove that? spoiler - no, you will not be able to prove that</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to prove it, your response is nonsense, no one knows if there is anything other than our material universe BUT we do know there is a material universe. The only thing we do know is that everything we experience comes from the material universe including all our thoughts which arise from our material brain and chemical reactions. You would need to demonstrate that something exists that is not material or arises from the material other than that to believe otherwise is fallacious.</p>

<p>The statement </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if there was no material universe there would be no &quot;A&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is based on the fact that every logical absolute SO FAR is contingent on the material universe, however as a caveat yes its possible something else not of the material exists and thus extends to &quot;A&quot; BUT there is ZERO reason to believe that because there&#39;s no evidence of it and our entire experience is related with the material world. No one has demonstrated that &quot;A&quot; can exist without the material so to believe otherwise is foolish, not that there&#39;s no possibility but you are pleading with the phrase</p>

<p>&quot;anything is possible&quot;</p>

<p>So yea there might be some aspect to reality which is supernatural but guess what theres zero evidence for it now move along</p>
