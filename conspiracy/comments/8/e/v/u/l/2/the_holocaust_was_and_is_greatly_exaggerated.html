       "He further argues that the scale of the Holocaust had been exaggerated by the Allies
      </p>
      <p>
       to hide their own guilt over such things as the atomic bombs dropped on Japanese cities, the air raids of predominantly civilian towns such as Dresden, and the Allies' own human-rights abuses[5]
and as a pretext for the establishment of the state of Israel, which he predicates on the commission of atrocities against the Palestinian population.[5]"

       Ever wonder why QUESTIONING the NARRATIVE means backlash and ridiculization? Forget about the arguments, just questioning it gets you labeled as an antisemite, a denialist or a conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       People from all over germany were imprisoned in concentration camps, from all kinds of religions and backgrounds, not just the jews. Slave labor, its what it was all about, cheap production, even worse than gas chambers was the fact that you had to work until your death.

       You joke out of ignorance.  Go ahead and look into it.  It's openly admitted that they were "refurbished/rebuilt" after the war.  They use those terms as a sort of white lie; they can admit what they must while omitting the rest.  The rest being that they plain didn't exist before.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must look into David Cole's work.  Watch his video on YT about auschwitz.  It should certainly give you pause.

       Even after the refurbishings, some of the pictures of the chambers make no sense, the chambers have wooden doors with windows that could easily be smashed and gas could leak through the bottom...

       It takes HOURS to burn 1 body. to get to 6 million by the end of the war, they needed to burn at least 20,000 a day in these tiny camps.

       There's a table there at the top that shows such "hidden" stats. Jews are listed at 5~6 million. Their number for freemasons is higher than what you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and if you combine the 6 million Soviet slavs along with the 3 million Soviet POWs, there were 9 million Soviets altogether. So that's weird.

       Wikipedia isn't really the source of the information. Wikipedia is not a primary source, and I never said they were. They cite their sources at the bottom of the page generally, that's how you know where the claim is really coming from. In this case, the table includes links to the various cited sources at the bottom. Some of them even have two sources cited. If you wanna blindly deny the veracity of all of these different sources cited, that's on you I guess, but encouraging blind distrust of Wikipedia isn't really helpful here.

       i think the most interesting side fact about the camps is they were isolated and cut off from supplies BY THE ALLIES!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       if germany were in retreat and being overwhelmed with crumbling or bombed supply lines, these sort of camps would be the first places where food and medicine would become scarce.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you look at the conditions at the camps by the time they were liberated they would have been without supplies for months, no food or medicine for months alone would have accounted for the deplorable conditions in the camps when they were discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       which then makes you question, were the truly awful deaths in those camps actually caused by the allies? not a question you would want asked post war.
      </p>
      <p>
       now im not saying the camps were happy summer retreats, or just slaves with jobs but i think its a bit naive to instead paint the picture as if germans were hell bent on working them to death being an effective final solution as they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       my opinion on the camps remains these were work camps, that turned in to death camps due to the allies, perhaps unknowingly, starving them of vital supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       were jews put to death, of course, was it 6million? im a bit doubtful on numbers over 1 or 2 million, which in the scale of death at that time was nothing compared to pols/slavs.

       The actual claimed death toll is 12+ million if you don't leave out the non-Jewish victims of the concentration camps. I think it's really weird that they always seem to be forgotten.
