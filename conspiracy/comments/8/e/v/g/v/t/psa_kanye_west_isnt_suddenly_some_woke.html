       This deification of people who confirm our beliefs has to stop. Every ideology will produce heroes and leaders but this shit is getting out of control. Cherry picking Kanye tweets to herald him as the MOAB truth bomb is fuckin absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social media seems to be fueling these failures as well. Liberals and Democrats were ready to carry Hillary through the streets. Bernie bros still swear that he was the true savior of the common man. Elon Musk is the messiah of the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, I'm sure many of us are baffled by people's sudden love for the Bush dynasty. Forget the lies and war crimes, GW is now a champion standing up to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like we've lost all nuance in the mainstream and its bleeding into a devotion of these personalities. Kanye embodies so much of what is wrong with Hollywood and celebrities. He's a megalomaniac music man and ringing the bells as if he's the 2nd coming of Christ because you think he's woke  is absurd.

       People who depend on being counterculture stars wave like grass in the wind. I've grown and changed in my own views so its hard to see what change is natural and what is forced, but I've known one friend at least that conspicuously chooses the less popular option.

       It seems to tie into this extreme partisanship as well. It doesn't matter what you believe so long as your tribe agrees with you.

       Let the man speak. If Kayne was "deified" it happened a long time ago and he is still an American citizen. No one this shit when Kayne was on stage saying he would have voted for Trump. Now suddenly his words are garbo and everyone worships the Bushs.

       No one likes the Bushs still. They just seem better in comparsion to a man that has people calling him the GEOTUS.

       I give shits about what is happening around them. I agree with what he's saying mostly but its irrelevant to the absurdity of suddenly taking him to be a reasonable voice worth hearing. He's always been a tool, that hasn't changed.

       To expand on why I believe this belongs here: personality cults are powerful tools. TPTB don't want you thinking freely and being unpredictable. They need you to stay in your demographics and produce expected results. They need you to be emboldened by rhetoric affirmation from any source. Freedom is a threat to the stability of elites and the cattle need to be herded at all times.

       Kanye is a sheep dog proving the viability of controlling herds despite his espousing of free thought. Figures like Maddow, Hannity, Cooper, Trump, Merkel, Putin etc etc have huge power to nudge public opinion in their respective spheres and too few people are looking for the fences as these sheep dogs tug them around.

       Watch his interviews and read some of his statements to get a feel for his actual life philosophy. He is constantly trying to red-pill people. I don't even listen to his music but appreciate him as an influential figure. I fucking hate Kim Kardashian and what she stands for though. It's easy to make implicit judgements when you've only skimmed the surface

       I don't view him as a Philosopher.  I see a bigger issue that is worth discussing.  Look at his handlers reactions - he failed to follow the mainstream establishment orders.  Any artist not at Kanye's level would have lost their career with positive statements about conservatives.  People complain about bullying - this is bullying! It is maintaining order through extortion.  Kanye is a slave to these people.

       When you see everyone around him lose their shit, you know something is up. The Scott Adams video nailed the significance of what he did. Shit, the reason he did it doesn't even matter, only the action.

       That kid may grow up to embrace the name wholeheartedly and only people like you will say it's messed up. I get a strong sense that you are spending your energy looking for reasons to keep hating a guy who is saying some good things. Why not focus on what he is actually saying rather than using one of his personality flaws to completely discredit his message? People are so so complex. Kanye can be an obnoxious narcissist, a brilliant musician and a voice of reason all at the same time. People are happy to see someone who has benefited from the system rail against it. It doesn't mean we're treating him like the second coming of Christ. It means we like what he is saying. Do you get all your wisdom from philosophers? Value can be generated from all kinds of perspectives.

       It really doesn't look like that will happen out of this to me (bringing bickering masses together). I just looked at Kanye's twitter and it's been overrun by hyperpartisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those disappointed in him keep parroting the 'Bush doesn't care about black people line'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those encouraged by him keep calling liberals 'triggerd' and making it about how 'libruls' specifically can't handle free thought and free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kanye was really inspiring people to 'just do you' and to let people have their opinions, then this has to cut both ways, right? People can let Kanye like Trump and wear a red hat all he wants, and people can also stop classing whole swaths of people as scum for having differing political beliefs.

       With his first album he shifted mainstream rap from gangster to a much more conscious direction. His lyrics aren't infallible but he rapped about jesus, quitting dead end jobs, black insecurities causing materialism, achieving goals, believing in yourself, recovering from trauma / injuries, and mocked authority figures black youth often feel oppressed by. He also called out George W on national TV with world watching after Katrina.

       If all you know about Kanye is what you've gathered from the MSM I have bad news for you and I question what kind of judgement you have accepting MSM portraits of celebrities while posting on a conspiracy sub.

       You're acting like no other rapper was talking about social topics prior to Kanye. What about Talib Kwali? What about Mos Def? Black Thought? The list goes on... Kanye was a keen producer, saw a new avenue of rap to capitalize on, and took the opportunity. He also only likes Trump because Trump reached out to him, and Obama wouldn't. He himself has said he's not political. There's no overarching 400IQ move that Kanye is doing here. He is an opportunistic person that will do anything to push his personal brand further. This recent Twitter "mental prison freeing" part of Kanye is no different.

       Read the first sentence of original response. He shifted mainstream rap, a multibillion dollar industry. I'm well aware of Talib, Mos Def, and many other conscious rappers that had their mark but it's entirely abysmal compared to Kanye. Your grandparents know who Kanye is. The radio hits we hear today are still echoing influence from 808s and Heartbreak, Graduation, MBDTF. He might only be pairing up against the left for publicity, but I really can't say. Regardless, it's going to have an impact. But the counter to your point of him doing anything to push his brand is simple: If he only cared about attention he wouldn't keep doing things his way, he'd conform, which he doesn't, and even while marching uniquely to his own beat, he still keeps making major impacts on society. That's something that takes a huge amount of talent and finess. He's more similar to MJ, Bowie, Nirvana, Mick Jagger than Mos Def.

       Name another rapper with such influence and ability to venture into other demographics both monetarily and intellectually. Hell not many artists in general can.

       You're missing the point. The point is that when a celebrity like Kanye says something against the narrative, he is attacked viciously. He is pointing out that fact, and I for one applaud him for doing that.

       This happens all the time. Theres nothing new about what's happening to Kanye. Anyone who speaks out against a narrative is going to be chastised by anyone who disagrees with him.

       This is SOP for culture wars. All kanye proves is that you can dip your toes into the Maelstrom of controversy surrounding trump and be ridiculed by someone no matter what you say.

       It really doesn't happen all the time, especially with celebrities who have a big influence on the black community. This is incredibly threatening to TPTB, which is why we see such a smear campaign against Kanye, and even involuntary hospitalization for "mental illness," when he goes against their narrative.

       I really feel like you don't have the ability to see the world through the eyes of another human being. This happens all the time but who the hell is paying attention? Only when it's someone you care about do you start giving a fuck. Kanye's waking people up who didn't even realize they were asleep. And you're here whining because "pfft, he's not original." Don't you have better things to do than waste your time telling people to stop listening to a single person because there are many others like him out there already doing what he is? Truly a waste of time.

       Kanye is an insightful human who prolly has Asperger's. Megalomaniacal, maybe. Unaware of how he comes off? 100% He's a genius in his own world but he's not to far from it in our world either. Kanye is far more lucid and far more down to earth than anyone will admit. Dude lost his mom and he had a breakdown from stress. You can't connect anything you see reported to him as a human if you don't know why it happens. I dunno this got convoluted but whatever.
      </p>

       It's almost as if you don't want people to garner any positive aspects from Kanye getting things right.

       They say that even Jesus will be called a liar. I wonder why even when people are being themselves and saying truth, some people stay blind? Could it be that darker side that resides in the bottoms of every man's heart? Trying to spread demise to the skies so it all falls apart? What Happened to this sub where we would all take to a theory and follow it through to see it more clearly. It seems like the owners of reddit and the deep state don't want us all using our brains, mate. Time to hop off this runaway train, I'm going back to where it last left the tracks. Knowing the world is run by Jews and not the good ones at that. Glad I know that the world is flat. Hope y'all find the answer soon enough while they all get fat.

       Excellent, thoughtful, and well worded post. Love the quote of loss of nuance in news seeping into view of celebs. Think this loss of nuance is cultural thing that will continue to progress as texting, emojis, and social media become the major forms of human to human interaction. Sad that your post is so heavily downvoted. TPTB don’t want you to think for yourself

       The guy literally has gone on stage at the beginning of a concert. For 15+ min saying "the radio lies to you, GOOGLE lies to you, FACEBOOK lies to you" &amp; also called out the manipulation of music video awards. Dude's put his life, career, and public view standing on the line. Is he perfect, nope. But from the amount of people at his level of fame, he's better than 98% of the rest mate.
