       For those that don't know, The Red Pill is a very popular subreddit where frustrated men go to vent about women. It has basis in reality, but it has been misdirected to lead men towards hatred of women, "going their own way" which eventually leads to homosexuality, and forced celibacy. It's been around for many years.
      </p>

       Today, Q gave us this link:

        https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/after-toronto-attack-online-misogynists-praise-suspect-new-saint-n868821
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It ties 8chan to a more extreme community (is it even real?) where violence is encouraged. We use the term "Red Pill" a lot around here talking about waking people up to conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prepare for a lot of confusion and misunderstanding. That's their goal.

       Its been interesting watching the war of words and phrases on social and legacy media. Its my opinion that this tactic of demonizing people and ideas though language is starting to backfire for those who employ it. Words like fascist, racist, Nazi and the like have become so over used they are losing their impact. I'd never been accused of being some kind of Nazi till after the election of DT and I didn't even vote for the guy. I'm middle of the road/left leaning and my views haven't really changed. What has changed is the application of labels and the line between "Nazi" and "leftist" keeps getting redrawn farther and farther left. What these people fail to realize is that every time they move the goal posts farther left they are shrinking their own numbers. Counter culture is becoming "conservative" culture as the definition of conservative keeps expanding to include the middle/left. A large amount of the younger people I meet see the left as the people who seek to oppress and silence everyone. This is a huge change from when I was young. Growing up in the 80s and 90s it was largely the Christian right that we saw as oppressors, but that whole paradigm is shifting. I remember the good old days when the only people we called fascist were the cops who took our weed and wrote the MIPs.
      </p>

       I guess my point in regards to this post is: Yeah this is happening right now and its just the latest phrase to be co opted by the would be thought police.

       Haha. You're trying to tell me that because you can't get laid it's going to turn you gay? You're either gay or you're not. If you want to use the excuse that you can't get a girl to have sex with you to have sex with dudes by all means use it, but it's bullshit.

       To quote a poster below:
"TRP is about men rejecting the feminist narrative and becoming self respecting, strong, articulate masculine men. It's about growing an actual set of balls and standing up for yourself. Doing what you need to do as a responsible MAN in todays feminist emasculated society...THAT is what the MSM is rejecting. TRP is the opposite of the Marxist/Feminist indoctrination that has infected the school systems around the world."

       TRP is about men rejecting the feminist narrative and becoming self respecting, strong, articulate masculine men. It's about growing an actual set of balls and standing up for yourself. Doing what you need to do as a responsible MAN in todays feminist emasculated society...THAT is what the MSM is rejecting. TRP is the opposite of the Marxist/Feminist indoctrination that has infected the school systems around the world.

       You can be a self respecting, strong, articulate masiculine man, and  grow a set of balls and stand up for yourself, all without hating or degrading women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was part of the PUA community, and used it's methods to get a girlfriend and eventually a wife. I still think the PUA community and it's teachings are very important for guys to learn, especially for guys who have little to no experience with women.
      </p>
      <p>
       The red pill community warps the views of the PUA community for wrong and unethical reasons, where it's about subjugating women instead of getting into a healthy relationship with them.

       That's not been my experience. In the book "The Game", the author talks about them and how they were reason why he quit the PUA community.

       This was all before the label "Red Pill" was used to describe them.

       I used to have a friend who signed up for that PUA bullshit.

      <p>
       He introduced me to terms like “negging” where you put women down to prime them for your advances.

       Not the same as the MRM.

       Red Pill was the name of a documentary that a woman who used to be a feminist made about the men’s rights movement. She highjacked the term for her movie.

       When you take negging to an extreme, it's a bad thing. But, there is such a thing as playful negging, which actually comes to most people as normal flirting around. I took it as a way to have playful banter, and whenever I did it, I never did it in a way that was never malicious or hurtful to the other person. I've practiced it a lot before I met my wife, and I never had anyone offended or hurt or whatever, and even if they don't voice it, I'm usually pretty good at reading people.

       No, red pill was used for a long while, and I remember how it started with the PUA community. I used to browse the PUA sub, but the red pilled people, thought it was too tame, so they started their own sub "TheRedPill" which was supposed to symbolize what it's like to take the red pill from the matrix. I remember checking it out when I was in the "game", and thinking how horrible the sub was compared to PUA subs. It was like as if they took the worse parts of the PUA game/community and embraced it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also read the book "The Game", that talks a bit about that type of crowd. Some of the people he mentioned in the book were at one point big in the "red pill community".

       So you're basically turning into a feminist woman except you're a man. Like a manimist? Sounds pretty lame but what do I know. It's not like feminism are stupid and annoying. We should act like them and try to divide ourselves but even more than the feminists movement because we'll never solve any issue by uniting.

       I think most people have seen The Matrix. I think most people could understand what the term "red pill" means in context due to that, even with various toxic groups using it. It'll be interesting to see if the corporate media would truly attempt to collectively denigrate the phrase with that in mind.
