        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Using critical theory to argue, we can show that conspiracy theorists are a class worthy of protection as we are a) a minority within the populace, b) historically persecuted by the powers of the state and other institutions, c) are often characterized as a group by the worst examples of those who claim our identity.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorism can be broadly cast for sociological purposes as a group of classes like a religion. Within the class, there are various schools of thought, mostly non-hierarchically organized but some are, that share all or some of the same beliefs about the &quot;true nature of reality&quot; as they see it. Functionally, it&#39;s the same as the broad class of religious belief itself. Take Christianity: there are some dogmatic and hierarchical denominations like Catholicism, but there are many other small congregations with no further structure, and people who believe in and practice the religion without adhering to anyone else&#39;s dogma. </p>

<p>In Christianity, there are a lot of good people doing good work in the world, and there are also people who abuse the name of religion for their own wicked ends. In Western culture, though to an ever lesser extent now, the Church was generally forgiven the misdeeds done in its name because of the good done in its name. Yet if you look at historically persecuted peoples, including so-called &quot;heretics&quot; of the church throughout the middle ages, these groups and individuals are judged on the worst things done in their name, which are often exaggerated. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorism is the modern day heresy to the modern day Religion of the State, in its necessary function in society, in how it threatens existing power dynamics, and in how those existing power dynamics seek to silence the voice of the heretic. <strong>Those who mock, ridicule, persecute, or otherwise try to silence the voice of conspiracy theorists are the modern equivalent of the Roman Catholic Church burning books and heretics.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate crime =/= thought crime</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there should be any such thing as a hate crime, and definitely not a thought crime, but as long as hate crimes are laws on the public books, I would like to seek for their protection. </p>

<p>If it is a hate crime to make a disparaging comment about a person because of their religion, it should be a hate crime to make a disparaging comment about a person because they are a conspiracy theorist. I disagree with the law, but if that is to be the law, I want equal protection under it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, this has nothing to do with conservatism or leftism, and if anything, I&#39;d consider myself a left anarchist. </p>

<p>This is about two concepts: should &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;hate crimes&quot; be a legal concept, and if so, should the law be applied equally. The first question is about authoritarian vs. libertarian and has nothing to do with left or right, and the second is about equal protection under the law, which should be agreeable to every fair person, whether left or right, authoritarian or libertarian.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5RNY79uHMY">James Corbett video about spontaneous order</a> for more on the topic. Also, I&#39;d check out agorism and voluntaryism on his website. Corbett has a wealth of good content on both, and I&#39;d also check out other people&#39;s perspectives. Anarchism is not what you might think it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree and i will explain why. Hate crimes are meant to serve as an attack on an entire group of people. If i kill someone because they are Muslim, for example, I am taking action to intimidate all Muslims. Just like lynchings were not really meant to just serve &quot;justice,&quot; they were meant to intimidate all black people and show them their place in society. </p>

<p>I believe hate crimes are effective in punishing people who are trting to frighten or harass an entire group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has nothing to do with criticism of <em>ideas</em>. I welcome that any time and always. </p>

<p>This has to do with language that disparages one person or a group of people based on a broader stereotype of a group which they belong to. As far as I understand it, that is one definition of bigoted language. If it is not considered civil to disparage a person because of the religion they belong to, it should not be considered civil to disparage a person because they&#39;re a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>And my skin&#39;s plenty thick. Like I said, I don&#39;t think there should be any such thing as a hate crime, but if there is, conspiracy theorist should be a protected class. If religion gets the protection of the law, conspiracy theorism should get protection of the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a dying breed at all. In fact, I think there are more conspiracy theorists today. More than half the country believe Donald Trump and Russia engaged in some <em>conspiracy</em> to rig the election. More than half believe Hillary Clinton has engaged in one or more conspiracies throughout her career. If you add these people up, you cover most of the country, and anyone who believes either is by definition a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to defend what it is to be conspiracy theorists, we just have to show other people that they already are conspiracy theorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree. The establishment today, which is broadly neoliberal and globalist, acts as the state religion of the day. It determines the Overton window of what is allowed to be questioned and what is not.

    <div class="md"><p>Picture a Cro-Magnon clan of a couple dozen people, who sometimes dealt with other clans. They would deal with rape, murder, and stealing from outside their clan by the innate understanding of mutual defense; they would just work together to protect each other. Internal to the clan, we can be sure there wasn&#39;t written law, and probably not even explicitly codified law, but someone who stole would be punished by the person he stole from.

<p>I do this by pointing out the absurd, arbitrary, and capricious nature of their laws. If the state and its bureaucracy can decide whether my beliefs constitute a religion or not, and whether I deserve equal protection under the law on the basis of that decision, then I do not actually possess religious freedom; I have freedom only to choose among those religions the state has deemed valid. In other words, by recognizing some sets or religious beliefs while refusing to recognize others, the state has established several religions in direct contradiction to the First Amendment (in the context of the US, at least). </p>

<p>I realize there is no such protection at present, I&#39;m arguing that if there is protection for religion, there should be for conspiracy theorists as well. I don&#39;t really see any functional difference between believing in a religion like Christianity or believing in a political philosophy like Marxism or libertarianism. They both have core tenets and beliefs about right action and the proper structuring of interpersonal and social relationships, both have significant variation between the beliefs of any two adherents, and are ultimately determined by an individual&#39;s preferences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t equal protection for Marxism or Liberatarianism either. They are not founded as religions. If you found them as religions, then they get equal protection.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even need to be a Christian or a Buddhist or a religion to get protection for the Hate Crimes. If the person thinks you are that religion and attacks you for being that religion, then it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you are that religion.</p>

<p>Again, you seem to think the law is this think that &quot;just is.&quot; You are acting like if you create an argument good enough it will be accepted. That&#39;s not how it works. That&#39;s why I was saying before (with the free speech example) that you actually have to exercise and defend your rights.</p>

<p>No matter how much you try to argue that your ideas are similar to religion, the court will not accept that. You will be laughed out. At the same time, you can actually get status for a ridiculous religion -- being a Jedi would be the example -- and if someone attacks you for that, that would be a hate crime.</p>

<p>Your ability to use language and loopholes is not going to fly in the court, nor should it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean the question as a gotcha, I mean it honestly. I think there are many well-meaning people working for the government, and many of them also do good work, yet it is the good things our government does for us that keeps us from fully rejecting the bad. Welfare, Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security keep a majority of the voting population dependent on the state, and therefore less willing to oppose the horrible things our government has done and is doing in our name.</p>

<p>I doubt myself that there exists a single shadowy cabal. I wouldn&#39;t be completely shocked if there were, but I wouldn&#39;t put money on it. I don&#39;t think that question really matters. What matters is that our governments do not represent us; they represent the corporations and the ultra-rich. By supporting the good parts of government, we enable the worst parts as well.

<p>I agree with that first part at least mostly, but not the second. </p>

<p>I think that enough people in the government are only in for their own gain. That muddies the water enough to let them get away with it and keep a population divided against fixing it. So not all politicians, but at least some are treasonous at worst, incompetent and/or greedy at best. </p>

<p>As for those social programs, I don&#39;t think those programs create dependence, and not for a majority of people. Not anymore than you are dependent on your job and healthcare from said job. There are people dependent on those programs. But suddenly ripping the rug out from those people isn&#39;t going to solve any problems. Those programs were put in place to solve some serious concerns, concerns we no longer think about in the modern day. Kind of like how the polio vaccine made it so we don&#39;t know anything about the dangers of polio. </p>

<p>I do not. If someone physically assaults a person because that person is a Christian and that intention is determined by the court, the assailant will be charged and convicted with a hate crime. If I am physically assaulted because I am a conspiracy theorist, even if that intention can be determined, my assailant will not be charged or convicted with a hate crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of protected classes is that a division among the populace can be identified, and that each class created by such a division has guaranteed protections from the law. For example, gender divides male from female, so a female cannot receive different treatment under the law from a male. With a religion, a Muslim cannot receive different treatment than a non-Muslim. </p>

<p>My contention is that being a conspiracy theorist (meaning, agreeing with some or all elements of a set of related beliefs about the nature of reality, i.e. a religion) should but does not currently receive the same protections as identifying as one of the state-sanctioned forms of religion. My contention is that <em>all</em> people deserve such protections for <em>any</em> set of beliefs that religious people receive for their beliefs. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the concept that &quot;black people can&#39;t be racists&quot; it&#39;s easily seen as a double standard. It stands out because racism is such a central issue in Western society.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to have a law about hate speech then it has to be general and can not be specific where some groups are codified as protected thus the law easily applies in protecting them while other groups are not mentioned specifically and are thus left vulnerable.</p>

<p>It creates a flow gradient of hate directed at the remaining groups of non protected classes.  Otherwise the free market of hate would more fairly distribute the hate to where it is needed most.  J/K</p>

<p>I get that you&#39;re being tongue in cheek about fairly distributing hate, but you do raise a good point. There is a flow gradient created by the unequal application of the law. If some people have more protections than others, than those without the protections are <em>less than equal</em> under the law. </p>

<p>I say we get rid of all hate crimes laws, but if we have them, I demand equal protection under them. </p>

<p>I do hesitate to compare conspiracy theorists as a class to race, sex, or sexual orientation, because those are essentially unchosen classes.

This is either evidence of heavy brigading (looking at you TMOR. you guys should not downvote in a sub of which the target audience you&#39;re not a part of) or of habit of violating the rediquette on the part of the regulars. You should downvote posts that are useless or are spam, not the ones you disagree with. You guys who are doing it are stupid (or, at best, violate reddiquette).</p>

<p>Hey OP, I agree with you. Like one Youtube comment said, &quot;They made up a term &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; [in the time of JFK assassination]. The only &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; is that you should trust the government.&quot;</p>

<p>On reddit everyone constantly regurgitates that one must deal with facts, not with emotions, but I want to say this, emotional thing to you, if I may. If you distrust both the government and the media, you feel safe, but if you distrust the government and trust the media, <em>you don&#39;t</em>.</p>

<p>On second thought, I&#39;m wrong, we&#39;ve got to have more censorship, we have to fight fake news, and we have to just kill everybody who disagrees while masking it as mass shootings. /s</p>

<p>Really though you make sure to enjoy your day.</p>

<p>See what you did there? You&#39;re stereotyping an entire class of people, and applying a prejudice to all of us based on the actions of a few. I don&#39;t judge all Muslims, or all Christians, or all Jews for the worst actions of those who claim to belong to these groups, so why do you judge me for the worst actions done by self-proclaimed conspiracy theorists?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But the class must be protected as a whole to protect the innocent within the class (I&#39;m not calling myself innocent in any of this; that&#39;s not my argument.) This is the argument behind religious tolerance as well. It&#39;s why Western liberals oppose bigotry towards Muslims, because they rightly understand that a peaceful Muslim person should not be judged on the basis of the hateful acts also committed under the name of Muslim. </p>

<p>And just as I would join you in calling out any person who demeans someone else because of the religious beliefs <em>of others</em> in their class, or demeaning that class as a whole, I would ask you to join me in calling out those who demean individual conspiracy theorists because of the beliefs that <em>other conspiracy theorists</em> have, and call out those who demean the class as a whole. </p>

<p>Can you join me in this?</p>

<p>This is about two concepts: should &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;hate crimes&quot; be a legal concept, and if so, should the law be applied equally. The first question is about authoritarian vs. libertarian and has nothing to do with left or right, and the second is about equal protection under the law, which should be agreeable to every fair person, whether left or right, authoritarian or libertarian.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5RNY79uHMY">James Corbett video about spontaneous order</a> for more on the topic. Also, I&#39;d check out agorism and voluntaryism on his website. Corbett has a wealth of good content on both, and I&#39;d also check out other people&#39;s perspectives. Anarchism is not what you might think it is. </p>
