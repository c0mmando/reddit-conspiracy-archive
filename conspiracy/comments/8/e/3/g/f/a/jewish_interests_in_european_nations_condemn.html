       I dare to say that white/European people also have the right to preserve their ethnic and cultural identity.  If the jewish elite who rule the Western nations can preserve their ethnic identity, then so can white/European peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a slight disagreement with you...the jewish people are not the descendants of the Israelites.  The Bible is not their book.  They are imposters who
       <em>
        pretend
       </em>
       to be the Israelites.

       Yes.  This is somewhat hidden, but most people of jewish ancestry actually descend from the Edomites (Esau), Canaanites, and the Khazars.

       No. The majority of Israelis are Arab (mizrachi) or African. Ashkenazi jews make up 36% of the total Jewish population, which is between 75-77% of Israel. People like to conviently forget that upon the founding of Israel 99% of mizrachi Jews were ethnically cleansed from Muslim majority countries.

       Yes, the irony is that the ancestors of those people never set foot in the Levant. The Ashkenazis are an Eastern European/Western Asiatic people from Khazaria who converted to Judaism, but have no blood relation to the biblical Hebrews whatsoever.

       What would happen if you didn't segregate animals at the zoo? Wouldn't be much room for surprise if a Lion at one of the gazelles, right? They are squishing populations that shouldn't be sharing the same habitat into the same habitat. Segregation isn't cruel. It should be resorted to when you realize that, on a fundamental level, two groups of people will not be able to integrate with each other.

       You seem to be along the lines of "if the Jews can make openly racist laws, so should we".

       I'm not exactly liberal, but this doesn't sound like the direction we should be going in. The thing is, if mass emigration wasn't an issue many of these taking point wouldn't be an issue. If we (us military) weren't so involved in inserting itself into international government- perhaps you wouldn't feel the need to protect your heritage (whatever you think that is- because when it come down to it we are all people who
Share the same DNA and the same universal history).

       Clearly they swallowed all this insane Anti-Muslim bullshit. Tabloid bigot journalism and caused a lot of hate and nonesense these last few years for sure. I actually went to the portion of my province where they brought the Syrian refugees and they all seemed like decent people. I didn't trust the MSM telling me to hate them as justification to hate them. I with you in the sense I'm getting really fucking tired of all the low-key hate against people from other cultures and religions. It's just veiled-racism you know ?

       That, and ignorance.  I get it though.  All it takes is one bad apple.  I fight that mentality with the homeless here in my city and its just another thing to bitch about.  The sad part is that most folks no matter what race, creed or color just want to survive, live well and take care of their family.  That goes beyond anything else.

       Ok, let's say it's low key racism; so what? White people don't have an exclusive claim to racism, it's pretty much the default state of humanity. We developed that way for a reason, it's so far back that we can only make educated guesses as to why, but there are plenty of reasonable, probably correct theories. We've kind of gone too far the other way in the last 70 years in regards to racism, I'd say racism itself isn't actually bad, it serves an evolutionary purpose, what's bad is discrimination based in racism. I'd also say at this point in time most extant racism isn't even actually based on race, but culture. If I liked, say, American inner city black culture I could replicate it myself and be loud as hell all the time, have my reputation be so important to me that I jump straight to violence at the smallest hint of disrespect or be seen as less of a man, front like I've got money by spending it all on flashy bullshit and skimp on necesseties. I could do all that but I don't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to, and I also don't want to meld our cultures, and I'm sure they'd see such a melding as a downgrade as well, because there's nothing stopping them from adopting my culture if they see it as desirable. And that's just two subsets of the same American culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get into immigrants that are from a completely different culture with a religion/political system that since it's founding has been against us and they believe
       <em>
        THEIR GOD WANTS THEM TO EITHER CONVERT US OR KILL US
       </em>
       , well, that's a whole other thing. It's not about saying individual Muslims are bad, they aren't, they're just people, and if you bring them in normal amounts for immigration they'll generally assimilate and it's all good; when you bring millions at once they stick together, insulated from their new environment they won't assimilate, and at the same time they're obtaining default political clout just from the votes they control they're also feeling out of place in a new country they don't understand, full of people who don't respect Allah, and they're likely to get more fundamental in their religion, possibly radicalize. In fact not the original immigrants, but the first generation born in the new country are the most likely to radicalize and carry out attacks, so we have that to look forward to in 20 years. With these people there won't be a melding of cultures, forced or otherwise, they have a mandate from God that it will be one or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to understand that even though I'm sure you see yourself as virtuous with your inclusive tolerance, they see you as foolish, weak, and easy to exploit. I see you as naive and suicidal, and I'm starting to feel a need to protect myself from not just them, but you too since you're obviously happy to see an end to everything our ancestors built just so some other morons that don't understand how the world works will think you're a good person.

       As a government/economics teacher, I worked with several second generation Muslims students who did not think that women should be allowed to vote and serve on juries. This was 2013. I was shocked because I figured they would have assimilated to basic American values. And this happened in Texas.

       Of course, they just need a dark skinned partner, and there are plenty of white woman who are into it.  So many in fact, that any attempt  to preserve the lol purity of the white race at this point in our evolutionary process is doomed to fail.   When you guys realize that immutable fact, give me a call, and maybe we can get some things done.

       There is no such thing as a "white race" it's a bunch of different European ethnic groups that, in Europe, didn't see themselves as one race. The "white race" is an invention of racist America to push anti-black racism back in the day. Fuck not even a century ago in the UK Irish people weren't considered human to English people. They didn't consider themselves the same race. That "white race" bullshit is pure American propaganda.

       It has nothing to do with my personal desire.  It has everything to do with the fact that the vast majority of white people do not see things as you see them, will never flock to your hateful banner, and will leave you exactly where you are now...on the fringe of society, while the rest of us continue to come together as a species.

       There was no Adam and Eve, that is an etiological myth.  There are no races, there is one human race.  There are different populations that can be grouped based on geographical distribution and historical experiences.  'White' is not a race, nor an ethnicity.   Racialism is conceptual framework which treats these social categories as real, and is used to structure our social world - is not an accurate framework. Racism is believing that these categories can be arranged in a hierarchical manner and acting in this manner - they can't.

       The problem with Israel is that it is rooted in a blood and soil ideology while other countries went through their periods and  that ideology was defeated, and people moved forward.  It is the fact that Israel is rooted in blood and soil that needs to be criticized, not that blood and soil is good, and needs to be exported.

       No.  I'm saying that only the white race descends from Adam and Eve (or Noah and his wife).  The non-white races were created before Adam and Eve.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is supported by the Biblical text.  The Hebrew name "Adam" literally means "to blush" or "to show blood in the face".  Only the white race does this.
      </p>
      <p>

       You still have not explained how two people can father an entire race when the only people their children could reproduce with is each other, leading to guaranteed long time genetic death.

       Do you believe the theory of evolution?  It's the same problem.  According to that preposterous theory, not only did one race come from a common pair of ancestors...but all human races came from some first "gorilla-human hybrid" mother and father.

       Also "gorrilla-human hybrid" give me strength.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is a GRADUAL process. That means their was never a gorilla human hybrid (I mean dear god that doesn't even make sense) but that slowly over time and generations, our nearest genetic ancestors slowly, through random selection, diverted from the evolutionary tree of other ape like creatures and developed down the path of homo sapien.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you care to read about it, their were actually multiple "homo" species around the world, like the neanderthal but more varied. They all died out/ we might have killed them / or bred them into our genetics. how does that fit into the creationist story?

       Assuming you believe there exists a universal IQ test which is even able to provide an analysis of ones ability to solve problems, and has been administered sufficiently so as to provide an undeniable sample of the world's population, how has this been established as fact?

       Yes, they have developed universal IQ tests that don't use any language, don't require any pre-learned knowledge at all. They purely use shapes and sequences to test your pattern recognition. They developed these tests purely in response to the criticism you've made.
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that it's very logical that IQ would vary, right? If you believe in evolution, then you must see that it would be nearly impossible for two groups molded by two wildly different environments to come out exactly the same, right? Have you noticed that the "First World" is the Northern world? North America, Europe, Russia, East Asia. And the "Third World" is the Equatorial world? Mexico, South America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't just a coincidence. Harsh winters had a dramatic effect on human evolution and psychology. And the opposite is also true, the natural cornucopia of the African Savannah also had a strong effects. In Africa, there was no mystery on how to survive. It was Summer all year round, fresh streams going by, trees all around with literal low-hanging fruit. Abundant game animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who mutated to have a particularly high intelligence in this environment, didn't have a particular advantage over those who had lower intelligence. And so, the intelligent didn't breed or survive disproportionately longer, which is what would start trending the population towards higher intelligence. In the African environment, where the survival puzzle wasn't particularly complex, it was actually fitness that provided evolutionary headstart.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is in contrast to the harsh, frigid winters of Eurasia, where every single year, those who were not intelligent enough to properly plan ahead for winter, died. Scientists believe that the initial behavior that sparked the human increases in intelligence, was deferral of gratification. This ability to defer gratification was strongly tested by winter, which required that you didn't eat that tasty stockpile of food now, but save it for later. Which required that you think ahead, and store water, wood, food, to prepare the right kind of shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every winter, the population of Eurasia was bottlenecked around the people intelligent enough to survive. Meanwhile in the Equatorial world, the more intelligent that were born didn't have a strong advantage, so that trait doesn't become viral in the gene pool.

       As a mixed person I appreciate this post, I'm getting fucking tired of all this new-age racism that is veiled in bullshit to act like what they are saying is correct. You know? "Well science and Jesus says all white people are the best people it's just fact you know, that is why there is a conspiracy to kill us all!" That mentality I've heard screamed across the internet in recent years and it really pisses me off. Western countries have always brought immigrants into their countries, all colonies are based on immigration.

       They were based off of immigration for our people. No one is saying White people are the best. We are saying that some countries are White countries, and that's okay. And that those countries are soon to be minority White due to massive colonial invasion from the third world, aided and abetted by our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Black people were becoming a minority in one of their countries, the world would care. If an Asian people were being pushed out of their country they would care. But you look at England, you look at Sweden or Germany or France. You look at Canada and the USA, and Australia. Whites are on a set course to being a minority in all of these countries by at least 2100. Canada by 2036, America by 2050, and England by 2066.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't strawman us, you are being intellectual dishonest with the "Science and Jesus told us White people are the best" comment. That's a drastic misrepresentation of what is going on, and I think you know that. No people, anywhere, ever, in recorded history, has voluntarily become a minority in their own country.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the canaries in the coalmine, we are the ones who see the writing on the wall before everyone else. That we are the Romans, and that the empire is about to fall. The rest of us Whites are drunk on porn and sugar and sportsball and social media, so no one notices and no one cares. When England, Ireland, Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, Finnland, Italy, USA, Canada, Australia are all multicultural and diverse, there will still be an India, a China, a Mexico, an Israel, a Nigeria, an Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       White countries are getting deleted off the map within the course of a couple generations through irreversible levels of mass immigration, of peoples that were NOT part of the immigrant pool you mentioned, when it comes to places like the USA, and people who are DEFINITELY NOT part of the ethnic identity of thousand year old countries like England. Something needs to be done about this to raise awareness, and if you really are mixed with White, then I find you to be disturbingly lacking in sympathy for what is happening to the culture and heritage and legacy of one of your parents.

       Bullshit the white-Europeans were the immigrants into the Americas. Which is now considered the "West". England constantly had shifting ethnic groups. You are legit claiming that only "non-white" people count as ethnic groups? What kind of fucking ignorance is that? So Angles and Saxons were just the same ethnic group right?

        There is only one race, humans. I appreciate your opinion but it is counter productive to the evolution and survival of our species.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Humans are a species, not a race. Race is a colloquialism for subspecies. A species divides into multiple subspecies when different groups within the species become accurately distinguishable from each, but continue to be able to interbreed and produce fertile offspring. If multiple groups within the species (those who you can successfully mate with) are distinct enough that one could tell the difference between them with over 80% accuracy, then those groups are different subspecies of the same species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you tell a Polar Bear from a Grizzly Bear with over 80% accuracy? Yes. Can a Polar Bear mate with a Grizzly Bear? Yes. Then Polar Bears and Grizzly Bears, while members of the same species, are different subspecies of that species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. Can you tell a White European person from a Sub-Saharan African person with over 80% accuracy? Yes. Can a White person and an African person mate and produce viable offspring? Yes. Then European Whites and African Blacks are members of the same species, Homo Sapiens, and they are also different subspecies of that larger species.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of subspecies in humans we colloquialize and euphemize into the word "race".
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as being counter production to the evolution of our species, nothing could be more counter productive for our evolution than for those of us who are already evolutionarily more advanced to regress to the mean and mix back into parts of the gene pool that are still only as advanced as they were 50,000 years ago. It makes no sense, on a rational level, for European Whites, East Asians, or Ashkenazi Jews to mix with Brown people. That will take the evolutionary strides made by those groups, and dilute them and mix them away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to talk about it from a moral position, that's a different question. But if the question is purely based around what is most productive to the evolution and survival of our species, then the high IQ races being mixed into the brown races is probably the worst case scenario for humanity. Be honest with yourself. How close do you think the Africans, or the Australian Aboriginals are to space travel, or to splitting the atom, to nuclear fission, without help from the Northern races? It would have been thousands of years before even electricity, let alone high science.

       Odd example, since Germans, Irish, Italians and Russians are all different races. I think you may not have the complete picture on race. If you are thinking of race as "White" or "Black", those are colloquialisms. "White" is an alliance of cousin races. For example, Germanic is a race. The Germans, the Austrians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Swedes, Northern France, they are all Germanic. Different ethnicities, one race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Irish, the Scots, the Welsh are also a race, the Celts. Multiple ethnicities, languages, cultures, but one race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russians, the Ukrainians, the Polish, and all of those other Eastern European countries share their racial Slavic ancestry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Italians, the Spanish, and even the Southern French all share a race as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Germanics, Celts, Slavs, Mediterraneans, while being different races, functionally become the same race in relationship to how distant all of them are from any non-European race. When these races met the Asians, and the Black Africans, in that moment, they realized that despite all of their differences, ultimately, they were all White. Clearly they had shared an ancestor at some point in history. The Germanics and the Celts seemed like strangers to one another before they met the Africans, but after meeting the Africans, the Germanics and the Celts realized that they were cousin races.
      </p>
      <p>
       This alliance is the source of the terms "White", and "Black". Which I'm assuming are what you are thinking of when you say "race". Because race isn't vague at all. That's like saying a dog breed is vague. Pug, German Shepherd, Great Dane, these are very specific taxonomic categories. The exact same thing holds true for race in humans.

       That's not remotely true. For example, the caste system in ancient Vedic India was a racial apartheid system. That was in 4,000 B.C. And when the Europeans first made contact with the Black Africans, or the Asiatics, they were keenly aware that these were a different type of human being. This was during the Roman Empire, 2,000 years ago. The Greeks and the Egyptians also wrote of finding other peoples, human, but clearly of a different kind. The knowledge of race is as old as two races of man coming into contact. It is impossible to see another race, and not acknowledge that you and that other person are both human, but also both clearly distinct.

       I'll check it out.  I've always been curious why there are different races in the first place and how that came out.  How it all started.  I would say the majority of humans on the planet are mixed race and that that number will grow daily.  What is special about keeping the race pure?

       That's like asking "why are elephants special?", and "why should we prevent elephants from extinction?".
      </p>
      <p>
       Every race is unique, special, and worth preserving.  God created us this way, and for a purpose.  Race-mixing destroys the races as God created them, and produces hybrids that He did not intend.

       Ah, you're right. Jews shouldn't mix with non-jews. It says so right there. That's got nothing to do with race mixing in general though. Thanks and goodnight.

       Dude. I'm not judging. White skin evolved roughly 7000-8000 years ago. Along with lactose tolerance which came a little later. Some of the oldest examples of genes for pale skin and blue eyes is from sweden some 7700 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who lived in the middle east (where I'm going to assume most events of the bible takes place) were not white. They may have been of lighter skin than many other people down there, but they were not white, nor are they in any way a precursor to white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course, I can expect that you will ignore the knowledge of this and instead focus on "the canon of what my book says". But it's one of those things where "my books says the sky is black" when everyone looks up and sees it's blue. It doesn't matter how much you deny it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence that can be confirmed by experimentation over and over and over stands a lot stronger than something that can't be proven except for by stories here and there. I'm sorry. I didn't wish to start a whole big discussion on this, I just wanted to know where you came from with those ideas. And I guess I do now.

       I'm sure you learned in school about Watson and Crick.  They discovered the DNA helix.  Well what you didn't learn in school is that Watson went on to study extensively how DNA relates to intelligence, and concluded that without a doubt there are inherent IQ differences among different races.  He was exiled from the scientific community for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should read about his studies.  They are what woke me up to this issue.  I should also point out, not that it needs to be said, but this doesn't mean that one human being is better than another because of their race, or kinder, or that their life is worth more.  But it does mean that there is a difference in IQ with different races, and ignoring that undeniable fact only leads to problems in society.

       Such as what?  If you have integration and racial intermarriage is permitted, you will eventually have a lot of race-mixing - as seen in the United States since segregation and laws against interracial marriage were struck down in the 1960s.

       A healthy way of preserving identity is via history and teaching your descendants about their heritage. As well as preserving cultural practices that don't infringe on the natural rights of others.

       It's approaching a decade since I took an anthropology course but your beliefs about race and genetics are flawed. It's more nuanced.

       Yeah... OP was on to something until he said Israel was the one getting it right and we should be "segregated to preserve heritage" also. I don't think unhinged mass immigration or emigration is the answer - but forced segregation is not the answer either. Natural Law is the answer, as always.

       great point and I've never thought of it that way.  The argument is always, "so what if white people die out, that's just evolution."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well in that case, so what if tigers die out.  So what if whales die out.  So what if black rhinos die out.  But if the specific race of a specific species which sent a man in a rocket ship to go walk on the moon, if they die out, I guess no big deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you forget about politics and racism and political correctness and all of that and just take a step back.....its really bizarre.  There's literally some kind of plan to eliminate the white race and its fucking wrong.  And the best argument they can come up with is "So, nobody is stopping whites from having kids."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well nobody is stopping the Masai tribe in Kenya from having kids either, but that doesn't mean they as an ethnic people are not under attack.  Their land is being taken by Arabs, but nobody is technically stopping them from having kids, so I guess as a people they're all good.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 20,000 years, if the white race is long gone, there will be stories about how man walked on the moon, and about how people could travel around the world in a few hours in things that looked like giant birds, and about how people could talk to other people on the other side of the world with a device in their pocket.  These stories will be considered myths that aren't to be taken seriously, and the long, slow process of evolution will continue, after a 200,000 year setback.

       Eh, that's a romantic thought if you're white, but I think Asians will carry the torch of technology.  What may go by the wayside however, is: a Christian culture that promotes intellectualism and equality, and capitalism all under one umbrella.  I have yet to see Asia retain these attributes all at once.

       The fact is, Jew's are succeeding with Israel in a way that any group of people would envy, should they wrap their head around it.  It is an ethnocentric nation, but which grants dual-citizenship to its citizens which then work in governments of most of the first-world nations.  The most powerful first-world nation pays the equivalent of $4xx dollars per person, per year.  This largest first-world nation also does it's bidding in warring against its neighboring nations, and turns a blind eye as it persecutes (and steals from) the people in the surrounding land.   Israel can boast that it's people control nearly all the megaphones in all first-world nations (CNN/NBC/reddit, etc.)....therefore controlling most of the dialog.  If you control a people's dialog for long enough....... (think for yourself.  If someone has controlled your nation's or your family's dialog for your entire life... think of all the differing thoughts
       <em>
        and decisions
       </em>
       you might have had/made, if the dialog in your nation was not manipulated.  Control the dialog, and you control thought.  Control thought, and you control the nation. There need not be official laws infringing upon free speech if speech largely occurs through private controllable networks.  One must simply control the private networks to control speech.... to control thought .....to control a nation.

Don't let the 88 in my username fool you, it was my high school football number.  I am remaining ideologically consistent.

       There is absolutely nothing wrong for any people to want to preserve their ethnic identity.  And it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with a view of "superiority".  What about blacks who just want their children and grandchildren to be black?

       Sure there is.  One thing which immediately jumps to mind is the elites who control us are counting on it.  By attempting to remain separate form your fellow brother and sister humans, you are making their job easier.  Just imagine if we all came together and shelved our petty differences....what could we accomplish did you think?

       It is evident from a basic understanding of biology that whites, blacks, and asians cannot come from a common ancestor.

       My contention is that whites, blacks, and asians are separate creations.  They were created by "God".

       Ah, I see. I disagree, as the underlying basics of biology are built upon the foundation of the modern interpretation of evolution. You are referencing anatomy and physiology when mentioning racial differences in bone structures, not biology, as one of the points of your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       And racial differences in physiology do exist. They stem from the environmental pressures and repeated genetic pushes exerted on the people's in that area. But that doesn't imply that there is no common ancestor, if speaking purely scientifically.

       People, can we stop with this garbage "TIS DA LEFT" bullshit please??
You can't put everyone who (thinks) they are on the (entire left half) of the spectrum
into the same basket lol. The elites want us to divide each other this way,
even though it's a huge spectrum and some people mislabel themselves anyway
thanks to corporate media propaganda false political definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual left wing economics has nothing to do with SJWs (including right wing SJWs) who push weird shit on us like "white privilege" and brainwash people into ignorant SJWs. Real left wingers don't want mass immigration for no reason: it reduces worker wages due to increased worker competition (when businesses should be competing, not us workers).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason good left wingers tolerate mass immigration is because it's unethical to deny immigrants fleeing from war or an even more rigged economy than the country they're entering.
This is the fault of the NEOliberal (extreme right corporatist)
globalists who move corporate jobs to poorer countries so the workers there work harder for less money/corps get more profit.....then the exploited workers move countries in search of a better life. Warmongers are also to blame for this mess too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting money out of politics is one step we can take
to moderately regulate against unethical corporate globalist activity like this
and stop corporations bribing politicians and parties.
The zionists are enemies of left wingers, centrists and moderate right wingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wallstreet, elite central banksters, big corporations, etc. are the extreme right wing elites,
hoarding extreme wealth at everyone else's expense.
Why the elites value Israel so much, I don't really know.

       Then by the end of your post you're saying "TIS DA RIGHT". You're conflating too much of what is going on with the economic stances. Left and Right as of "the current year" are much more subtle than just pro-markets or anti-markets. The anti-market Left is dead and has been since World War 2. Everyone in the world is in on Markets now, including the Left. The Left is equally if not more Neoliberal than the Right is, now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wallstreet, elite central bankers, big corporations, etc. are also filled with Left wing elites as well. Think of all of those big corporations and bankers and elites and celebrities, would they be on the side of the Left values, like diversity, multiculturalism, pro-LGBT, pro-immigration, anti-nationalism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are any of them conservative? Do any of them actively say that marriage should be between a man and a woman, that race matters and that White countries should stay White, or that one's own nation should come first?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously all forces with money will side with Leftists culturally, and never, ever with the Rightists. They are the very ones pumping out the propaganda calling people "racist, sexist, islamophobic", etc. They aren't going to fall into their own trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see that they are big money, and to you, for some reason, that tells you that they are "right wing". You can't be right wing, and be for mass immigration, against nationalism, against borders, and actively push all the progressive social issues. Just can't. All power is big money. All of it. Left wing power. Right wing power. It's all neoliberal big money. The Left wing cultural outlook is vastly winning though, nationalism is on the ropes and globalism and multiculturalism are what all the big "extreme right wing elites" as you called them are pushing. Which means they aren't so right wing after all, are they?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you should be able to figure out why the elites value Israel. The elites are Jewish. This should be obvious.

       I'm not saying "TIS DA RIGHT". Because 1) putting everyone who (thinks) they're right wing into the same box is foolish, some of them aren't even right wing. And another problem with that is moderate right is lumped in with retard far right corporate bootlickers. You didn't read my comment properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know what you're talking about, NEOliberalism is an EXTREME right wing ideology pushing for EXTREME DE-regulation. This is Reagan/Thatcher bullshit that has escalated for 30+ years, increasing the gap between richest (esp elites) and poorest. The issue is EXTREME income inequality, not merely just income inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no such thing as a left wing elite. Unless you categorize authoritarian state capitalists like Lenin/Stalin as left wing (but they violated many left wing values such as de-centralization/democratization of the economy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Left wing doesn't mean diversity, multiculturism, pro-LGBT, pro-immigration, etc. in the way you think.
Mass immigration is not something legit knowledgeable left wingers want: more workers in a country
means more competition between them, driving down wages. Left wingers are pro-worker, dude come on.
Snap out of the brain washing. The only reason good left wingers tolerate mass immigration temporarily is to allow
immigrants to escape war and even more rigged economies than the one they enter.
So who's to blame? Transnational corporations moving jobs to poorer countries
to work the people there harder for less money. Eventually the worker has had enough and looks
for a better life in a richer country. Also warmongers invading countries. To stop these people,
we have to remove money from politics and have better control of our own government
instead of the corporations and central banksters bribing them (the latter may require nationalizing the FED or having a different currency or something).
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros is a damn billionaire, you think he helped Bernie or Clinton? Answer: Clinton the far right secretly still pro-TPP wallstreet shill.
This goes against the stupid mainstream narrative of deceptive identity politics propaganda pushed by SJWs including right wingers who pretend to be left wing, e.g. hollywood who was obviously kissing Clinton's ass, yet people think they're "lefties". It's bullshit.
Actors talking about climate change and not giving a shit about workers getting screwed.

       White privilege, feminism (highly biased ideology esp. 3rd wave),
muh patriarchy, etc. this garbage is SJWism, not leftism. You've fallen for the smear tactic. SJWs knowingly or unknowingly (some are brainwashed while the shills know exactly what they're doing) push this crap to discredit ACTUAL left wing economics that harm the elites. Occupy wallstreet? Nah let's talk about MUH PRONOUNS and 58 genders!....SJWism is a relatively new invention,
and it's attempting to shit on ALL left wingers, divide left wingers, AND divide left and right instead of us uniting against
the EXTREEME right elites. There's a big difference between extreme right assholes hoarding
all wealth vs moderate right just interested in fairly running their small/medium business or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite puppets focus on social issues, wedge issues and SJW garbage
to appear left wing but social stuff doesn't even touch the elites, only econonomics do.
Trans bathroom? Oh Rothschild is scared....lol. Only economics do anything against them,
hence the CORPORATE media was shitting on Bernie. Big ass corporations are not left wing. Maybe small/medium
businesses, but not corps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-LGBT rights is about treating LGBT people fairly (rather than jailing them/hurting them/mistreating them just because they're LGBT)
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro-LGBT rights is NOT "let's advertise gay/lesbian and trans stuff on childrens' magazines and TV shows"
THAT'S SJWISM, an abomination pushed by the elites. I'm center left economically and non-authoritarian (thus libertarian left)
and I don't think this artificial push on children is moral because their brains haven't fully developed
and can't make decisions that well.....so indirectly influencing a child to get a sex change might make them regret the decision
for life, psychological damage, etc. Retard elites like this shit, not left wingers. And empathize with brainwashed
SJWs, they're people like me and you. Don't shit on them for having stupid beliefs, reason with them instead
or show them evidence breaking their worldview. As long as you don't engage in divide/conquer crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're painting left wingers all the same but not all left wingers are even actually left wing.
And even the real left wingers don't have identical beliefs (hive mind mentality).
Same with centrists and right wingers. It's foolish to lump an entire HALF of the spectrum
together as having the same opinion (moderate vs extreme shades, authoritarian vs non-authoritarian, etc). It also serves as divide and conquer fuel. Stop fueling it. Besides, people are confused/brainwashed in all directions of the spectrum.
Things are always over-simplified so people get into arguments over misunderstandings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feminists are SJWs, so while some feminists might be offended by
you saying "gender isn't only a social construct, there's biology too"
legit knowledgable left wingers won't get offended unless they're infected the SJW culture (but then
they wouldn't be knowledgable, they'd be ignorant). SJW culture, not "left wing" culture.
Left and right are not cultures. They're mostly economics, secondly social issues but not culture/fads/stereotypes/identity politics.
That crap is a new invention, promoting our division and pushing us to pick the retarded Dems/Repubs based on what
the TV talking heads say.
      </p>
      <p>
       People blaming all muslims or all Jews are foolish too.
Wahhabism (extremist interpretation of Islam) pushed by Saudi Arabian elites for years, is causing the
teear orist crap (along with western secret service funding). 
In the case of Jews, you really think all Jews are in on that shit?
This is divide and conquer BS again. Not all elites are Jews (they may even be satanists,
just like the Vatican is filled with false Christians, peeedo satanic scum)
but certainly not all Jews are elites. I read something about Khazaria converting to Judaism hundreds of years ago.
I don't know that much about the Jew and zionism connection but modern Israel was born from
the Balfour declaration (British government). Stop blaming innocents. Khazarian mafia or zionists
makes more sense than blaming everyone that identifies as a Jew (genetically or religiously).
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more nationalist than wanting what's best for your
fellow countrymen and women? (Tax funded social programs).
Not talking about bullshit Obamacare, that's crony capitalist with big pharma/insurance company
profiteering and rip off drug prices. Socialized single payer universal healthcare is far superior as 
profit is not the motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extreme forms of nationalism can be used by the elites against us.
"Your country needs you" bullshit for bankster wars. "You're either with us and the MUH PATRIOT ACT
or you're with the teeearorists! They hate us for our FREEDOMZ!" seems legit. More like NSA state spying bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       People artificially trying to make "white countries" less white clearly have an agenda
if they know what they're doing and not just ignorantly parroting propaganda.
Again these are SJW fools, not left wingers (many left wingers are white, why would they hate their race or any race?)
      </p>
      <p>
       To lump SJWs with left wingers is equivalent to lump racists with right wingers.
They are separate optional things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world isn't black and white,
and many people are as brainwashed as you are, if not worse. People who call themselves
left wing, centrist, right wing, are ALL susceptible to propaganda from corporate media,
shill comments on the internet, repeating brainwashed talking points, etc.
      </p>

       Hope this helps. Most people are far more aligned than the elite
want us to believe. We won't always agree but damn this system is rigged in favor of the elites.
Left/Right is not what many people think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting money out of politics will show just how bribed politicians currently are.
The NWO is either corporate rule or authoritarianism or both.
But they're just distracting us with divide and conquer bullshit about SJWs
and social issues that don't do anything to the elites' power pyramid.

       You really do have the polar opposite read on what is going on here. It is everything that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are advocating for that is "making it easier" for the elites to implement their agenda. You think they are doing this divide and conquer thing. If that were true, they would actually push White Nationalism. They would support our message and use it to drive everyone further apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual truth is that they are actually desperately trying to glue us all together. They are trying to create a functioning tax farm and corporate consumer market. For that to work, everyone needs to get along. But once they realized they could skyrocket tax revenue, precedents for deficit spending, and available labor and consumers by pursuing mass immigration, they couldn't resist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their goal is to gain all the "benefits" of mass immigration, but to keep us all properly glued together. This is why they tell us "diversity is our greatest strength". This is why they shame any White person who questions the corporate colonization of all of our countries as a "racist". You are completely wrong in your perception of what is going on. Why do you think Martin Sellner and Brittany Pettibone and Lauren Southern got detained on the way into England, and then banned from the country? Because they were going to cause division between ethnic English and the Muslim population there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you were saying was true, they would
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       that to happen, they would relish it, it would exactly fit their agenda. But instead they banned them. Why? Because what they are actually trying to do is somehow hold these populations together, to retain stability so that they can retain power.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to realize that everything you are pushing for is exactly everything that the establishment elites want, too. Which is fine, if that is what you believe in. But don't then pretend that the purpose of all of that is to stand against the elites, to make it harder for them, etc. People like you have bought the elite programming, hook, like, and sinker. You believe in everything they told us all to believe, and your hope for the future is the one that they are actively implementing right now. If this is what you really believe, then you can just sit back and relax, because the elites are working tirelessly to have us all the same by the year 3,000, so that they can institute a single government over the whole planet.

       Whites are the least to identify with each other on a racial basis. If you really think that it is racist to identify on racial lines, you should invest your energies with non-whites as they are the ones who are racially conscious.

       Genes don't blend, they pair. Simplified  this means that if a person with blue eyes marries a person with brown eyes (without any recessive blue eye genes), they have brown eyes kids. All the children may have brown eyes but all are carriers of the blue eye gene. That means if one mates with a person that also carries one recessive blue eye gene, their children have at least 50% chance of being blue eyed while the parents have brown eyes. The genes you inherit aren't blended, nor does one gene disappear from your DNA in favor of the dominant gene. Carriers are a thing.

       Something isn't a social construct when a DNA test can determine what group you belong to, skin color, height, weight, metabolism, bone density... etc. "Social construct" is Marxist terminology used to try and erode things like group identity, heritage and shared religions to try and rule over demoralized masses. Look at what the happened in the red revolution in Eastern Europe to the Ukrainians. Their strong sense of group identity and religious family oriented society made them particularly difficult to control so they ended up being slaughtered

       Great work!! Thank you for doing this!! We must begin preserving some of these stats, as well as some of the news; especially anything that is online only.  Many who are in control of much of the media have a way of re-writing (or deleting) history.  We must preserve it to hold certain parties accountable, and to preserve the truth of history.  Thank you so much for your efforts in this!!!

       The white/European race is the biggest threat to the ruling jewish elites and their plan for a Satanic "New World Order".  Muslims/Arabs have an average IQ of about 80 and cannot create advanced technology and civilization.  They are not a threat to the jewish NWO elites.

       Whites originated in the "mid east", or area of Mesopotamia.  Over one thousand years ago, the Mid East still contained many pure white peoples.  Over time, most of them migrated north and west into Europe.  Whites/Europeans are the ones who have been responsible for 99% of technological advancements.

       I explain it by Islam still being young and spreading out taking over stores of knowledge from antiquity and building upon it, while still being somewhat tolerant to other cultures and religions. How do you explain them not being able to recover after the fall of Baghdad and entering a dark age as we simultaneously achieved unprecedented, prolonged advancement?

       I just feel like the Islamic Golden Age is exaggerated, from what I can tell there weren't many unique works like in Alexandria, and even if there were, if they'd done the work once they could do it again, even with how many people died; Baghdad wasn't the only city in the Islamic world. It definitely didn't help, but what really got them was creeping fundamentalism, they've needed (still need) a reformation for a long time and until that happens they won't progress beyond the technology and knowledge we give them.

       Yes, because the mongols burnt them, originals and copies. Pretty sure every library in Baghdad was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while Baghdad wasn't the only city in the Islamic world, in ancient times it would have been a equivalent to Rome. Tear the heart out of the body and the rest will struggle to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It definitely didn't help, but what got them was creeping fundamentalism" Show me how an invading army had less of an effect of the downturn of a society then religious fundamentalism. Especially considering what we now call "fundementalism" was basically the standard extreme orthodoxy all abrahamic religions followed at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I totally agree Islam needs reformation, much more of that is to do with the House of Saud and Whabbism then the original texts. Just like the bible, they are brutal as shit. Its up to modern people to take a considerate interpretation .

       What I meant was that very few books were destroyed that there weren't copies of elsewhere, namely Cairo and Spain. I also believe that most of the knowledge gathered was from the ancient Greeks and pre-Islam Arabs, any progress built on those foundations was done in spite of Islam, not helped by it. And yes, the Saudis and their wahhabi sect are largely responsible for modern terrorism ideologies being spread, but Muslims have been at war since the day Muhammad died with the Sunni and Shia split, and they weren't exactly peaceful when he was alive. Christianity also had some rough patches and growing pains, though I'd point out that the crusades were largely defensive; regardless of what either religion has done since being formed you only need to compare the teachings of Jesus and Muhammad to see that they're fundamentally different.

       You could say most progress has been done despite fundamentalist Christian, Jewish, and Islamic interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you could say the most horrendous acts in history have been committed in congruence with ALL such religious dogmatic beliefs.

       It's all the same bite off the same bone: and to argue that Christian, Jewish or Muslim fundamentalist have any grip on truth is a fruitless battle.

       That was before Islam became backwards, and cousin marriage became a cultural institution. Inbreeding can lose you 15 IQ points. The entire Arab race is now widely inbred, and already was by about 700 years ago. Think of the heights of European civilization, compared to the accomplishments of Africa. Europeans did that by having about a 15 point IQ lead on Africans. That should go to show how much you can lose by losing 15 IQ points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arab Muslims were at one point a very intelligent people, but they ruined their genetics, there's no way to fix that. They will need to go through thousands more years of evolution to get back to where they were 1,000 years ago.

       I can appreciate natural and voluntary biracial relationships, but both extreme views disgust me. We have who ethnic groups that are the blends of races but the forcing of mixing due to conquest or prohibition on mixing based  on notions of superiority gross me out.

        The Israeli marriage system is an Ottoman relic. Back then, marriage only existed as a religious thing, and therefore it was managed by religious institutes. Jewish weddings were certified by a Rabbi, Muslim ones were certified by an Imam, christian ones were certified by a priest, etc. The system worked well, and after the fall of the Ottoman Empire the British decided to keep this system, and so did the Israelis after the British left. Nowadays there is a rather large movement to change the system to allow civil marriage to be performed in Israel, but due to pressure from the Ultra Orthodox(Haredim) the system stays. The state of Israel does recognize civil marriage not performed in Israel though, so a popular thing here is to fly 30 minutes to Cyprus and have the wedding there.

         The book wasn't "banned", it wasn't included in the curriculum. While I've read the book and enjoyed it, I think it's too difficult for 16 years old teenagers to really enjoy and understand. There are books(such as Katerina by Aharon Appelfeld) that also describe relationships between Jews and non-Jews that're still a part of the curriculum.

         Israel actually has 4 separate systems: state-secular, state-religious, independent-religious and Arab. Non of the is considered better than the other, and you're free to send your child to each of them, but they do offer slightly different materials that pander to different groups. The Arab one, for example, teaches mostly in Arabic, and includes more Arab history, literature and culture than the other ones.

       Wait how does your answer for number 1 show no segregation? It clearly shows the opposite. People have to leave the country to marry across religions. That’s incredibly oppressive/segregated.
      </p>
      <p>
       And doing a bit of look into Arab education in Israel shows Arab students receiving much less funding per student as well as having significant shortages in both classrooms and teachers.

       It's not just Zionists. There's a huge faction of powerful Jews that are NOT Zionist, and that faction is actually much more powerful than the Zionists. The Zionists are the Israeli Nationalists and Jewish Identitarians, and they basically control the Republican party in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a whole other faction, the Globalists. These are multinational corporatist Jews who are actually anti-nationalist and believe in Globalism and open borders. This group controls the Democrats. This is why Obama took a shot at Israel on the way out.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is any defense of the Zionists, trust me. But I feel compelled to point out that it's virtue signalling to say that it's not Jews, but just the Zionists. I would say that the Globalist Jews in control of the multinational corporations that push progressive, multicultural, open borders propaganda, like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, are 10x more dangerous than the Zionist Jews.

       The second part of this is 90% brainwashing tho. My fiance is Israeli, what they teach you in school about religion, the military, foreigners and wars is fucking mineblowingly ridiculous. From the kids are like 5-6 years old there they start being taught in school about how great Israel is and how they must protect themselves and what horrible things other countries did to them, even though these countries never did much at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another main part of why this works so well is because the general education/English lessons are absolutely awful there and they barely understand English at all. Obviously they understand parts but not in a deep enough way to critically evaluate information. And everyone there speaks Hebrew. So when you're trying to find information online about something, they search in Hebrew and Israeli propaganda appears.

       I can appreciate natural and voluntary biracial relationships, but both extreme views disgust me. We have who ethnic groups that are the blends of races but the forcing of mixing due to conquest or prohibition on mixing based  on notions of superiority gross me out.

       Mein Kampf, the unabridged Ford translation. Especially chapters 2 and 9. You may assume the book is biased but you’re more than free to draw your own conclusions. If Jews were a scapegoat how come the Jews have been driven time and again out of Europe? It’s on Wikipedia too. Look for information in places out of the reach of Jew influence. Then it’s up to you to connect the dots.

       Downvote away if you like, but this extreme-view stuff legitimately grosses me out. And losing the sub to one extreme voice is just as bad as losing it to another.

       Make your choice r/conspiracy. The more these posts hit the front page, the more the admins and the rest of the community have reason to suspect that this is turning into a hate sub.

       Everyone hates something.  Labeling something as "hate" is just a leftist ruse to censor speech they don't like.  The Left spews their hatred against Christians, whites, and conservatives on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does this idea come from that jewish interests or the state of Israel "cannot be criticized"?  I know the answer.  It's a rhetorical question.  It is because jewish elites
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       rule our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't jewish interests be opposed or criticized?  Do you object to criticism of Christians, whites, or Islam as "hate speech"?  Why are jews so special?

       I think ethnic isolationism is stupendously misguided and fundamentally tribalistic--it is a clear divide and conquer tactic that many r/conspiracy community members stand against. Your response to my criticism just proves that you would rather foment divisions than heal them.
      </p>

       Did I say don't criticize Israel? Did say jews are special? Of course I didn't, because I think we're all human.

       Do you think our shared humanity should transcend our ethnicity?

       By all means point out the hypocrisy of Israel's policies regarding interracial marriage. But that doesn't mean I have to make the leap to rejecting interracial marriage myself.

       You do, and that's pernicious and
       <em>

       taint this sub with the shameful mark of ethnic divisiveness. Put me on record as being against that.

       The fundamental difference between you and I is that I don't see myself as "united" with other races, including jews.  I am a white/European person, and am different from other races.  And I seek to preserve that uniqueness.

       While I agree with your arguments, I fear the borderline elitism. It's easy to slide from "I love my culture" to "my culture is the best."
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be going forward as a human species and try to work together for the right to be individuals. Diversity can be strength with proper procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to say you shouldn't celebrate white culture, whether German or Irish or what not, but we should do so and allow others to celebrate theirs and maybe partake to understand more of others ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can criticize but we should do so in a mind set of love and of freedom from the ultimate control, whether it be Zionism, Aliens, elites, corporations or kabals. They despise freedom and feed from chaos, they are the real enemies.

       Actually we all can’t interbreed naturally,
 look up negative blood types! What you will notice is native blood type women will abort positive blood type babies without special shots to stop it from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next look up the highest population of negative blood types. Here’s a hint it’s white women and men!
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly that sounds like a natural race barrier to me.
Think about it from an evolutionary standpoint. Why would this exist? Because nature is racist? Or are we different sub species?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes we all have the same organs but our dna? No or dna isn’t a carbon copy of each other it is different from person to person however these changes only account for small differences, this is why we share 98 percent of our dna with chimps but we are not chimps.

         Israeli Official: Natalie Portman’s Israel Snub ‘Borders on Anti-Semitism’
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        A minister from the ruling Likud party on Sunday said Israeli-born actress Natalie Portman’s refusal to arrive in person to accept an award at an event in Jerusalem because of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attendance at the same event “bordered on anti-Semitism".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See, Natalie Portman is born in Israel, that's why her action which is basically "treacherous" to criminal state of Israel is called “bordered on anti-Semitism".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else means it is 100&amp;#37; ANTI-SEMITIC and will face lawsuits (till you bankrupt).
      </p>
      <p>
       NB: Natalie Portman insist she doesn't support BDS - I say Natalie stop being a hypocrite, you either boycott them and stop the drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guys, stop supporting Israeli actors. Think about how many Israel actors in Hollywood will tell you the extend of tribal infiltration exists in our land, and the discriminate upon Americans ... Boycott them all, Gal Gadot, Mila Kunis, Scarlett Johansson, and many more . Not that they are talented ... They're in Hollywood simply becos of their ethnicity.... This is wrong.

       The thing is it's almost necessary to need a Jewish background in order to criticize the country, otherwise they pull the national equivalent of the race card when called out on the shit they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are more culturally homogeneous countries in Asia that don't do that crap, so it's also making it even easier to argue that many actions are being done in bad faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, many critics know your history and how bad it was leading up to the things done in founding your country. We don't necessarily discount or deny how awful stuff like the holocaust was either. However that doesn't excuse what you're doing now. It doesn't mean we hate you either when it's being pointed out, just clean up your act. That's not too hard to ask for, is it?

       Natalie Portman has 'Jewish Identity', just not a Jewish identity that includes massacreing Palestinians. Israel doesn't like her Jewish identity though.

       You are mixing human definitions of "species" into the equation.  That does not have any bearing upon whether the races were separate creations.

       Whites originated in the "mid east", or area of Mesopotamia.  Over one thousand years ago, the Mid East still contained many pure white peoples.  Over time, most of them migrated north and west into Europe.  Whites/Europeans are the ones who have been responsible for 99% of technological advancements.

       Do you really believe that the 80 IQ mixed race Arabs of today were responsible for that?  They cannot even create a high civilization today.

       Don't assume I'm associated with the Left. I'm just not associated with ideas like the protection or preservation of the white race.

       I think ethnic isolationism is stupendously misguided and fundamentally tribalistic--it is a clear divide and conquer tactic that many r/conspiracy community members stand against. Your response to my criticism just proves that you would rather foment divisions than heal them.

       Did I say don't criticize Israel? Did say jews are special? Of course I didn't, because I think we're all human.

       By all means point out the hypocrisy of Israel's policies regarding interracial marriage. But that doesn't mean I have to make the leap to rejecting interracial marriage myself.

       You do, and that's pernicious and
       <em>

       taint this sub with the shameful mark of ethnic divisiveness. Put me on record as being against that.

       I explain it by Islam still being young and spreading out taking over stores of knowledge from antiquity and building upon it, while still being somewhat tolerant to other cultures and religions. How do you explain them not being able to recover after the fall of Baghdad and entering a dark age as we simultaneously achieved unprecedented, prolonged advancement?

       That was before Islam became backwards, and cousin marriage became a cultural institution. Inbreeding can lose you 15 IQ points. The entire Arab race is now widely inbred, and already was by about 700 years ago. Think of the heights of European civilization, compared to the accomplishments of Africa. Europeans did that by having about a 15 point IQ lead on Africans. That should go to show how much you can lose by losing 15 IQ points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Arab Muslims were at one point a very intelligent people, but they ruined their genetics, there's no way to fix that. They will need to go through thousands more years of evolution to get back to where they were 1,000 years ago.
