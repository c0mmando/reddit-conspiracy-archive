       thermosphere gets to  3,630 °F (my oven goes to 500 max.) they have done spacewalks there. Put your camera inside an oven and put it on self clean. That's not even close to how hot they say it gets up there.

       Please unerstand basic gas properties. The atmosphere is so thin in the thermosphere that you wouldnt be able to
       <em>
        heat
       </em>
       solid objects with it efficiently at all. Not even to make them warm. The gas itself is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       thin and the effect of solar radiation heats the few molecules in that region.
      </p>

       And whats your point about the thermosphere's gas temperature since you think glass would melt on the Moon's cameras?

       Like i said, understand fluid dynamics and the physics of gasses...

      <p>
       The temperature(how fast the molecules are bouncing around) means that its 4000deg but you cant compare sea level air at 4000deg to gas thats thousands of times less dense. They dont behave the same way...

       lol. okay, so the contactor is mounted on the "Z1 segment" is basically a huge capacitor and then what? they bring that down with them to earth regularly with the soyuz to discharge?  are you sure?

       No... its the opposite of a capacitor. It expells gas plasma, plasma being electrically charged atoms.

       Shuttle didnt have such a system, and i assume most short duration(Apollo etc) space vehicles use the technique described there.

       Actually try reading instead. Plasma contactor, nothing to do with capacitors and is literally the opposite of one.

       Are you retarded? An arbitrary object floating in space isn’t heated to 4000 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       For fucks sake how is this the top comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand there is no conductive heat transfer in space, or convective?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s all radiative. If your sources of information involved more than Cletus’s YouTube channel you’d know most space objects experience +- 250 degree thermal fluctuations.

       There’s no “hand waving” here, just really basic facts.

       Here's where I think your wrong. Flat earth was specifically created to make the idea that NASA deception "sound crazy" moon landing hoax has nothing to do with flat earth. Flat earth is the turd in the punchbowl to make anyone who says ISS is fake look silly.

       I don't know. There are imaging satellites. 99 percent of data travels through undersea cable. I wouldn't feel right making an assumption either way. However The ISS is another story. Its the most expensive thing ever built, seems like a tax trap. That's before you even watch videos showing the obvious CGI and trickery that they employ. In recent years a mix of real time Augmented Reality is how they 've been able to fake these videos.

       Take a software defined radio and listen to the GPS signals.  You will find they are Doppler shifted and that the Doppler shift matches the expect Doppler shift from a transmitter moving at orbital velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would not happen unless the transmitter was moving.  With sensitive enough equipment you can detect different Doppler shifts from receivers relatively close to each other.

       I have. You're saying that the Doppler effect proves there are satellites in orbit. Really it would only prove that a signal is either changing in frequency or coming from a moving source, but the point is you haven't observed any of this nor do you have any way of doing it. You're just deferring to authority.

       You can derive speed from the Doppler shift.  I believe this video explains it
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-F7ege9Ai8">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-F7ege9Ai8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the Doppler effect is wrong or the transmitter is moving at orbital velocity in the atmosphere.  If it is in atmo why isn't it radiating a lot of IR?  You can point a FLIR at the Moon and see the IR it gives off so the GPS should be glowing in IR if in Atmo.

       I am upvoting it because its true. Most of the people who believe in Moon hoax stuff seem to do so because of gross misunderstandings of basic physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have said in previous Moon threads that i view a lot about the landings skeptically, but at this point i have not seen a single hoax theory that hasnt been debunked. And i mean actually debunked, not 911 style NIST fake reports that common sense sees through "debunked".

       I used to have a gross understanding of basic physics.

       For example, I did not know that the experts can

       What a shitty website. The article is long winded and never actually explains what is wrong with the Cavendish experiment. It links to videos and podcasts but I'm not about to wake my wife up with that shit. Just get to the point and say what the problem is. Sheepshead.

       sounds less like a problem with the experiment (which has a wiki) and more like  initial interest in physics and experimenting for one's self.

       Not from my house. I have watched many launches in person. They dont look fake at all.

       Clearly you dont realize how insulation is constructed on space vehicles. As someone who has family and friends that launched space vehicles for decades, i go t to spend enough time there at KSC and Michoud to see how theyre assembled, and in the case of Michoud how theyre manufactured.

       Idk how they look fake at all to someone unless you dont know much about advanced manufacturing processes.

       Next youll tell me the McLaren F1 isnt real because it uses gold foil in the engine bay, or the Lexus LFA or Bugatti Chiron because too much carbon fiber reinforced plastic?

       Defending the car in space is a dead giveaway. It’s admitting you put your entire faith in authority because not one person alive can say that bullshit looked real. All you can say is “gee golly, I trust that charlatan Musk”

       I live hours away from Cape Canaveral. Have seen launches since I was  boy. Want to know how they're fake. They never go into space. They always go up high enough, then horizontal, and if you use a telescope you see them come right back to earth over the ocean. every time.

       Those nasa rockets never go into space. It's all a show and has been for decades.

       You fuckin serious? They "go horizontal" because they orbit
       <em>
        around
       </em>
       the fucking Earth. They dont fly straight up and fall down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and it goes over the horizon(ocean in the case of FL) like the Sun does since the fucking Earth is round. Do you think the Sun is landing in the ocean at sunset too? I really hope youre not olden than 10 saying shit like that.

       Submarines and space vehicles have opposite problems, and therefore they are not interchangable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It only takes a comparably tiny amount of force to crush a structure designed to keep pressure in, because of the geometry of the pressure vessel.

       looked into it, well, if they honestly researched it and came out believing the official narrative, then that sir or madam is a damn fool.

       Yeah i suspect it was an inside/Israeli job. I know enough about engineering and physics to know that no fires from two 767s could bring down 3 WTC steel skyscrapers, and no 757 was aerobatically flown by a guy too shitty of a pilot to soloa Cessna.

       Sure let’s criticize others who hold differing opinions as being uneducated rednecks that’s a good approach to debate. Spotted the shill. Hey why don’t you disprove to us why NASA was caught time and time again editing rover photos and putting out fake press releases about finding life on mars?

       I do. There’s a side of conspiracy-land that involves citizens investigating shady people doing shady shit. Rational inquiry, get to the facts, ask hard questions from “weird” data even if it goes against the mainstream etc etc.

       Then there’s the crack pots. The flat earthers. The contrarians who’s goal isn’t to seek the truth but to

       For those who are paying attention,
       <em>
        this

       comment perfectly exemplifies the attitude and behavior of the newest generation of users who are attempting to destabilize

       In one breath they pretend to bemoan the existence of subs like TMOR, yet meanwhile they engage in the same divisive rhetoric and behavior.

      <p>
       It's an attempt to give themselves a free pass by denouncing TMOR, but it's pathetically transparent at this point.

       He called multiple users "retarded" and then after receiving a polite warning he complained that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a "safe space" because he's not allowed to call people fucking retards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he seems genuinely interested in having this conversation, he only received a temporary ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if he returns with a barrage of personal attacks, then the ban becomes permanent.

       But I don't see "personal attacks" being the basis of his conversation, nor do I see insults being the basis of his conversation. Usage of the word 'retarded' against another when frustrated is to be expected, especially when that other is perceived to be making things up (not an accusation), or when seen to be blatantly, objectively false while continually insisting it's completely true--that is not how an argument works, anyway.

       Perma ban for just this. Wow, unreasonable.

       It’s money too. Billions in funding each year. Far cheaper to make movies than to use space stations and land on the moon. SpaceX is also run by a charlatan in Elon Musk. Takes a real asshole to charge people 200k for cheaper more efficient energy.

       Look you don’t need math to know we live on a globe, moon cycles have curved shadows, constellations have a rotation so we know that we are spinning, the main one is if we are not a spinning globe then we are the only planet in the galaxy that isn’t
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to think about stuff find out why the moon doesn’t rotate with perfect placement like a satellite, it also rings like a bell when you hit it hard enough but leave flat earth alone its a waste of energy to even look into it

       Look at the 'planets' yourself through a telescope. I have. They don't look like spinning spheres unless you see a simulation. They look more like circular pulsing lights.

       1) Hundreds of billions / year. You fail to grasp just how much money and engineering power was spent on a dickwaving contest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without an economic incentive who’s going to pay for it? You?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) because it’s a frozen shithole that has more in common with the surface of mars than anywhere else. It’s COLD and shit doesn’t grow. Sure there’s resources but why waste $$$ going for them when there’s more readily available sources not at the South Pole? There’s snow there too. WHY DONT WE GO THERE TO SKII?! Because Colorado is better, duh.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) sure. Go make a telephone poll sized object, then put 3-4 of them 50+ miles apart. Measure the angle of the sun at each at exactly the same time. Use multiple people and synchronize the time via cellphone. Now, do some math, and try and figure out why people 1000+ years ago were smart enough to figure this out and you weren’t.

       Not only that but really...once you’ve been to the moon half a dozen times there isn’t kucb more to learn....we’ve pretty much gotten all the info we need from the moon. Going back anymore is just throwing billions at a rock that we’ve already studied plenty. This argument “why haven’t we gone back” fails to look at the scientific relevance

       Funny because I could link to NASA's own website to an article about why we
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       return to the moon, several space industries around the world are said to be preparing for lunar missions as we speak, and there's a quote from a NASA astronaut I could also find saying that the next logical step in space exploration is to return to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess no one told these people that there's no reason to go "back" to the moon.

       All that part of the documentary shows is how suceptible some people are to suggestion. There’s nothing in the actual footage or audio that implies it’s fake, the damn narrator is just pounding that into your head the entire time like a grade school teacher.

       This video simply questions things. The biggest question is how they could be filming in low earth orbit, let alone why they were recreating a distance shot of the earth, when the landing was going to be broadcasted 9 hours and they were 3 days away.

       Funny you call it fake, when to the trained eye many things stand out that make it authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, dust kicked up by the rovers doesn’t aerosolize, meaning it had to have been in a vacuum. Did they build the worlds largest vacuum chamber as part of the hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video you linked, the explosive debris follows a non-parabolic trajectory, consistent with micro/low gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So did they build the worlds largest vacuum chamber, shoot a movie inside it, and have the entire stage on a titanic-sized aircraft diving to simulate zero-G?

       Sounds easier to just go to the moon

       The last part may be a joke, but it sure did trigger you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trajectory of dust in microgravity is a straight line dude. That’s basic Newtonian physics. The parabola in parabolic comes from gravity continuously acting on an object to alter it’s velocity vector along the gradient of gravitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s very little to “research” about this, it’s inherently obvious within the rules of the system (physics).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t see stars because of the limited exposure range of the cameras. And guess what the moon is pretty bright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, humans and our ape brains have long associated hazy things as far away due to use living in an atmosphere. On the moon distant peaks are just as clear as close ones since there’s no atmospheric scattering. This is probably why you don’t think the mountain range looks real

        Trajectory of dust in microgravity is a straight line dude. That’s basic Newtonian physics. The parabola in parabolic comes from gravity continuously acting on an object to alter it’s velocity vector along the gradient of gravitation.

       Does the surface acceleration of the moon already count as "microgravity"?

      <p>
       Does the parabola result from constant gravitational accelaration?

       Is the gradient of gravitation really non-negligible for trajectories of such little height?

       Micro-gravity is technically incorrect, as the moon is far above 10

       G territory. Low-gravity would be more accurate.

       Yes, when you throw a baseball it is constantly being accelerated by gravity which causes it’s gradual deceleration then return to earth. This makes it’s trajectory a parabola, or parabolic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In low/no gravity, once you let go of the ball it will continue straight until otherwise acted upon.

       The world’s largest is at NASA and is ~100 feet wide or so.

       To fake the moon shots you would need one far larger to drive around it and then have the entire thing flying

       When it comes to moon landings the dogs are all over it still. They have a well rehearsed script on every anomaly. They really hammer the van allen belts like it’s ok to whizz through them and not get cancer. Even though they are a real barrier to anything getting through at the moment. But apparently it’s ok cos Apollo 11 was powered by crap technology or something like that lol.

       I don’t want it “bad”. It’s you who can’t stick to facts. And you have immured to answer the more difficult questions. And you perport to be more of an expert and camera technology than the director of the company that made the cameras. Sorry you aren’t exactly convincing me of anything other than you are a paid shill and your name is probably Cameron if I’m guessing right.

       And no, in your own video they corner the guy and try to get him to explain why there’s a “spotlight” (light source) on Neil that’s opposite the sun. He says he can’t explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Him not having an explanation doesn’t mean shit, it just means he doesn’t know. This isn’t me “claiming to know more than him” (baseless appeal to authority much?), this is you and this sham of a film taking words out of context to benefit an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I posted elsewhere, the Nvidia demo shows in a physically accurate simulation that light reflection from the other astronaut’s giant white suit was responsible for the light bounce that created that effect. Not entirely obvious so it makes sense that it’s one of the weirder ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re not burdened by reality, the point isn’t to argue with you. The point is so that others see your questions do have answers, and that the overwhelming body of evidence suggests we did go to the moon.

       The van allen belts radiation density varies greatly. It’s not one uniform area of high radiation. Some areas are thinner with magnitudes less harmful radiation. Mix that with them traveling thousands of miles per hour and they are fine. Not exactly healthy, but survivable.

       You’re misjudging how dangerous this is. State lights that go through these belts get 2500 rem per year. The Apollo mission want in it for magnitudes less time.

       It’s a bit like saying it’s ok to get shot in the face a little bit.   No one knew how thick those belts were. Nasa suggests 20k miles other 64k. I can just imagine the conversation

       Well the radiation in the belt isn’t light waves like gamma or X-ray they are mainly charged particles. Protons can be stopped by aluminum shielding and electrons from various other items, but electrons can hav effect on humans but with sufficient shielding you’ll be fine. You don’t need lead for this shit.

       Prove me wrong, the solar winds trapped by the magnetic field are charged particles. Aluminum is good against alpha, well most stuff is. While beta can be mitigated by plastics. Lead is actually more dangerous for going through the belts.

       I'm just venting about getting down votes for my comment despite the fact that I'm simply citing ball earth theorist's own figures. It's odd to me that someone would downvote a comment without disputing the claims or researching for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really coming from a Biblical perspective but Flat Earth and Evolution research has lead me to conclude that we are indeed created as is this realm we call earth. I think it helps atheists to think of God as some sort of super computer programmer. They are moral relativists and philosophical materialists so you have to speak to them in those terms.

Otherwise I can just say “to believe humans (the US) wasn’t trying to get to the moon and further actually did, just to show the USSR was a bunch of pussies, you really have to think like a child” and “this is the levels of pathetic we are dealing with”.

       That does about as good to a person trying to learn as saying “I don’t need to, it’s as self evident that we did go to the moon because there’s all those fucking pictures and hundreds of thousands of jobs related to going to the moon”....see how that doesn’t help convince me in any way shape or form?

       The Apollo program claims are such idiotic mumbo jumbo, actual childish gibberish, that for a person to believe in it probably does think that Superman

       Those that believe the Apollo program was mumbo jumbo probably think Superman is a real person. See you’re just saying things that I can change around a bit to you. You’re not putting forth anything other than “it’s obvious” and that’s a terrible argument if you want people to A) take anything you say seriously and B) actually be interested in what you’re saying.

       Why does he need to explain? What he said made perfect sense. That's like me saying it's raining outside and you asking me to explain because you don't understand.  People who are naive enough to believe we went to the moon 50 years ago have the mind of a child even though they're an adult. Like come on.

       So....you answered in the same sense he did. I’m saying I DO believe we went to the moon, and I’m far from a child, nor have I the mind of one. So the further you continue to call me a child the further I won’t aknowledge your argument. You’re hurting your own case of convincing people to come over to your all knowing side by saying I’d have to have the mind of a child to believe we went to the moon. Just stop my man.

       Nasa has admitted to going to the moon sonhow on earth are they using far more advanced tech than they’ve admitted to using? That literally doesn’t make sense...and don’t give me “we haven’t gone back”....we shouldn’t have gone back after the first 2 there was little more to learn at that point. The moon is a fucking rock of course we haven’t gone back. Now would you care to use actual evidence or would you prefer to continue as hocs and strawmans?

       God forbid someone believes in some conspiracies but think that NASA is legit. Yes that’s impossible right? It must be these shady characters violently defending their agency instead of some people disagreeing with a particular premise right???

       Good explanation.

       Almost as good as the one where people on yt say rockets need something to "push off of" when literally the whole point of the rocket is that it produces its own ultra high pressure gas...

        which pushes it

       Yeah and some other guy in here says that because rockets dont go straight up, theyre fake. Heres a fucking clue: to oribit something, you go AROUND it, not directly away from it 😂😂😂😂

       Okay so...I’m just a fucking idiot? It’s GENUINLEY IMPOSSIBLE for me to be right? Like full fledged impossible? You’re saying you have 100% proof that nasa as a whole is fraud and the earth is flat?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had just gone with nasa I would’ve discussed with you, attempted to present conflicting evidence (that you would have surely said the government faked despite you using pseudo-science bullshit as your “proof”) and we could’ve gone from there. Since you appear to think that flat earth is so obvious and apparent....I really have nothing to discuss with you. You say that a round earth and nasa are obvious bullshit and there’s no hope for me, I say you think a flat earth is real so there’s no hope for you. So now we have absolutely zero to discuss. See how those absolutisms really suck the air out of discourse? Good day sir.

       You’re not arguing it’s impossible we went to the moon you’re arguing it’s impossble for me to BELIEVE we went to the moon.....do you understand how insane that is? Or did you simply word your comment poorly? Arguing it’s impossble to go to the moon is one thing, and I genuinely enjoy hearing those arguments. While I disagree with them I certainly understand their eveidence and where they’re coming from. Arguing that i can’t BELIEVE we went to the moon is.....just.....I have no words

       Considering you’re responding affirmatively to a post in which I asked it was impossible to believe if something is true, while you never typed the word impossble you have affirmed my question, easily making it reasonable to make my assumption that you believe it’s impossble. If you believe otherwise state so, but your affirmation of my question makes it an incredibly reasonable assumption don’t pretend like you can’t comprehend me making hay conclusion.

       Well the post is inevitably going to blow up so I didn’t track the original. Impossible to believe ? No I believed it for years until a friend just said to check the van Allen belts. And I went from there. I think after a decent amount of research you’d have to really stretch hard to believe we went. But I don’t see it as impossible for people to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think it’s a shame that after all these years we aren’t told the truth. It’s like we can’t handle it. The moon project was simply about rockets. Ballistic intercontinental missiles. Which the USA didn’t seem to have in 1961, and since it appeared Russia had orbited the earth the Americans were justifiably worries they could drop a nuke from space without giving the US time to react.
      </p>
      <p>
       So impossible to believe ? No not at all. After all everything can’t be a conspiracy. But check out the French documentary on the moon landings. Here’s a clip. You can make up your own mind and what you believe is totally down to you

       Indeed. I’ll fully disagree with your van allen assertion due to evidence that I would certainly believe and you certainly wouldn’t. However I apologize for sounding confrontational in my first response to you. I appreciate the civil discourse. And isn’t agreeing to disagree one of the best rarities of our world these days? :) have a good evening sir.

       I wonder what satalites are up there sometimes. With the amount of antenna and radio towers being erected around the country (uk) I wonder if a satalite would be better, I can’t see why we wouldn’t have been into near earth orbit or that satalites are possible. But that is an area I really don’t know much about.

       Cell sites work by using directional beams to share frequencies.  For example a single town can use the same frequency multiple times to talk to different cell phones assuming the cell phones aren't right next to each other.

       If it was based on satellites this wouldn't be possible to the extent that it currently is used.

       You can also see the Iridium Flares.

       . - I know I know, Gish Gallop. Please know they don’t disagree with a theory. They disagree with all dissenters when it comes to the most corrupt of government agencies. For a community in which the majority believe 9/11 was a false flag, as was Sandy Hook, why is NASA defended at all? They lie. Plain as day. Why defend liars at all? It’s a stupid mentality to have and anyone defending NASA needs to raise their expectations significantly. It’s embarrassing the blind faith some have while providing google links as if their own hubris and faith in this government agency is enough to hold court over the entire discussion. We are seeing it play out in this thread. I’m excited that this is a sticky and expect many many downvotes coming my way.

       OP’s question deserves a response.

       Dish antennas are easy to construct, so you could test this empirically using a cheap hobby radio if you were so inclined.

       I’m operating under the impression that a fixed point in the sky can only broadcast a signal if a fixed transmitter is in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Geostationary satellites explain how a fixed point in the sky can transmit a unique signal which a correctly oriented dish antenna can concentrate, amplify and receive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aircraft can explain the same phenomenon, but only for limited periods. All aircraft, including balloons, fixed wing and rotary wing are subject to atmospheric conditions which means they either move around, or they burn fuel to maintain altitude and position. Given that a fixed position is one of the distinct (and empirically testable) properties of a geostationary “satellite” signal, aircraft are ruled out by the fuel burden alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I’m using a false dichotomy here by suggesting that only satellites or aircraft can produce “fixed position signals from the sky”, please help me understand which alternatives I’m glossing over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other possibility I can think of is a solid firmament or dome with signal generating points embedded in it, but that line of thinking opens a much bigger can of worms.

       Interesting. Even in conventional physics this is feasible. The ionosphere enables signals to be bounced off it like a mirror, and indeed this is how we are told shortwave radio works, ever since Marconi demonstrates it with his inaugural transatlantic transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortwave radio is omnidirectional and the antenna just needs to be correctly sized to pick up a clear signal. Pointing it in different directions improves signal quality, but it’s still possible to pick up a faint signal while pointing the antenna elsewhere.  A dish antenna is a point source concentrator that only works when orientation is set precisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea would require signals to be beamed very precisely from the ground to ensure a limited cone of coverage from the reflection. If that was combined with projection of the satellite beamed at the same spot in the sky, you’d have a pretty convincing fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all theoretical of course. I don’t know if any technology that can project an image or a radio signal so clearly from the ground, but it’s an idea worthy of further research.
      </p>

       I'm seeing a trend across reddit when it comes to taboo topics. It's not 100% shills. but tons and tons of loser, basement dwelling,
       <em>
        redditors
       </em>
       who have nothing better to do than troll particular subreddits and topics of niche communities trying to be the "voice of reason" for upvotes. Freakin' losers if you ask me.

       Some of us actually know about the nazi takeover of NASA, and think we went to the moon with their technology. I don't think anybody has any great love for NASA, well heretics like me at least, who think we actually went to the moon. They did this amazing thing, and then space exploration died. They have done nothing since then. And they monopolized anything to do with space, until just recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone actually likes NASA that gives a shit. It has been the smokescreen for the SSP for a lot of years. It has stifled any real progress.

       I used to think that. That there’s a base. Specifically because of testimony that I will link at the end of the post. Heck even the Drake equation made me certain there are aliens. Today? I think it’s all a play.  The Fermi paradox, project blue beam, Area 51, and recently the onslaught of ufo type links from the media. I think this is all a play from the beginning. Grab our money, I still fear, and capture our wonder. I just watch The Principle and a strong case was made that WE are the center of the universe. At this point I think it’s far more likely that we are alone and those in power use aliens as a means of control with the grand finale yet to come. This is probably close to a decade in the making. Anyway here is the video that initial led me to believe there is a base on the moon, the guy does seem pretty sincere

       I remember that video! Rumsfeld seems like he would be a gas at parties! I tried to find convincing evidence of Apollo 11 mission having actually happened and found less than nothing whatsoever. I recall it was Apollo 16 or something when convincing material could be found. I don't know what to believe except that I know how much big government loves a good boondoggle.

       Not the best documentary on moon hoax but one of the better ones. Its simple. If it was impossible in 1999 to go higher than 600 miles without getting ass-blasted by photon bursts, how did they do it in 1969 with worse tech and results that allowed them to go 236,400 miles further.

       Your missing the fact that the freemasons on the Apollo missions were able to pass it at all. They weren't in it for that long? That's a terrible excuse. How come we are still looking for ways to pass them now? Why don't we just "go fast" like on Apollo. Almost as bad as nasa saying they destroyed the tech to get the moon in the first place.

       I’m not going to write you a term paper on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google the radiation levels in the van Allen belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize that the dosage is not immediately leathal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, google the velocity required for trans lunar injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now figure out how large the belts are form available data.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there, you can figure out based on speed how long them spent in the van Allen belts and calculate a rough estimate of radiation exposure (before shielding).
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, “go fast” is a solution because less time in the belts equals less accumulated radiation exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you’ll find is that when moving at a velocity required to reach the moon you will not experience a leathal dose of radiation.

       I’ve seen this clip to, you’re Probably referencing that interview with that guy talking about shielding on the Orion capsule?
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern electronics use lithographic processes far smaller than 1960’s Apollo, and while this makes them faster of course it also makes them much more sensitive to radiation. Our transistors today are like bricks vs mountain size back then (this example is off by orders of magnitude). High energy particles effect these smaller transistors much more so we have to shield them much more. Humans are effected much the same as they ever were.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as far as “go fast” goes, have you ever looked up the thrust of a Saturn V? It’s the biggest rocket ever built. Nothing modern has even attempted the scale. Only SpaceX’s BFR will be larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA runs on a shoestring budget, and you’re asking why their dingy little rockets of today aren’t slinging things as fast as the largest rocket ever built.

       You're missing entirely the point. If the solution is to go fast, why don't we just do that now? Why haven't we done that since? Why do they say it's even a problem if the solution was already found so long ago?

       Because we spent hundreds of billions a year to build an absurdly large rocket more powerful than anything ever made and threw people at the moon with it for nothing more than national pride.

      <p>
       The amount of energy required to do this is absurd. You need huge engines and tons of fuel. Physics hasn’t changed since the 1960’s. And since you can’t be bothered to read more than a few lines of my posts: MONEY. Who pays for it? There’s no gold on the moon. There’s Not much to gain outside scientific goals and that’s not worth $100+ billion/year to politicians.

       CPUs didn’t exist in 1960. They do now. A modern computer is more susceptible to radiation because the same things that make it fast make it vulnerable to radiation. How hard is this to grasp?

       That said, shielding it isn’t impossible.

      <p>
       NASA tends to take the “custom hardware that was build to be hardened” approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       SpaceX tends to go with “let’s use 5x consumer grade systems with basic shielding and use quorum computing to account for but flips and errors”
      </p>
      <p>
       Shielding Electronic’s is harder today than the 1960’s. It is not however the sole reason we have not gone back to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I’ve said elsewhere, the reasons are economic and nothing more. No $$$ on the moon.

       Well for one very few countries have space programs in general.

       It’s an absurd amount of money. Bezos is putting $1 nil/year into blue origin and I doubt you even know who they are. SpaceX is finally making waves but they still have yet to launch people (hopefully this year!).
      </p>

       The problem is you need a lot of engineers with a 1st-world economy throwing tens of billions a year at it. No one who controls that kind of money wants to, they’d rather spend it getting richer here.

       Your excuse of "they just didn't" doesn't satisfy me or anyone here. China had plenty money to send man to the moon, they just knew they couldn't. Zionixt?! How do you believe pizzagate, and also believe that we went to the moon? You're aware satanic freemasons run the world. Why would you believe them if they told you they went to the moon?

       China couldn’t get ICBMs working until the traitor Clinton’s sold them the tech in the 90’s, laundering cash via donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was done under the guise of allowing competition for American satellite launch providers (Lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rockets are hard. Russia probably would have gone to the moon if their economy hadn’t collapsed. China wasn’t technically capable until the 90’s, and since then has been slowly growing their space program. The Saudi’s have no appreciateble space program AFAIK. They could start but they’ve never cared for such things and I doubt they will any time soon.

       As for your other point, the “elite” can absolutely be satanic. They can rule the world. They can drive us into false wars and do all sorts of terrible things behind closed doors.

       But they’re not God’s, they’re men. They can’t fake gravity. They can’t fake physics. An objective natural reality exists outside man’s bullshit and through science and understanding we can quantify and exploit it.

       We’re beyond government agencies now, private citizens are going to space and soon. The costs are plummeting and I fully expect mars colonization in my life time.

       With the money I make I now I expect to be able to purchase a sub-orbital hop on a BFR in ~10 years or so when they’re flight ready. I’ll make sure to remember this thread when I do :)

       They sure would like to be. They can fake gravity and physics, because gravity has always been misrepresented from the git-go. Things falling to the ground at a certain rate and the idea of mass=attraction, are not the same law. I do not believe the earth is flat, but I also believe there has never been a photograph of what it is we live on. I do not believe we are rotating on a 66.6 axis and I dont believe we are flying through space at 666,000 mph. Not for nothing Newton was a freemason too so maybe not the best source of info anyway. Seeing as these ideas of universal velocity and control are non provable concepts,(both in his day and today) we should not be building further theories upon them. They certainly can misrepresent ideas by giving us false base stones to work with.

       No fate is not inescapable. They are mere men and they will die. But I have yet to be convinced that there isn't a dome or barrier of sorts physically keeping us from the vacuum of space. It makes sense to me that the earth is closed off. The "waters above" if you will.

       LEO is not space. Outer Space would be the vacuum the planets are in. How can a vacuum exist without a barrier?

       I think it’s the opposite: vacuum and an empty void is the default, not the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s much more space then there is stuff to fill it with.
      </p>
      <p>
       We only have density here because of gravity. We know matter self-attracts (via gravity).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have “pressure” because we’re at the bottom of an “ocean” of atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without enough matter for gravity, things like gases just expand until the denisity is almost zero (vacuum).

       It may very well be that space is not a vacuum, and is actually a type of fluid we don't know. It would make sense though if it were a vacuum, that it would be impossible for ships to enter it. A vacuum is just that. A void with nothing. You can't add or take away because its pressurised too. Kinda makes me think space isn't a vacuum what with asteroids and junk. Who knows? What I know is that I don't trust freemasons and I don't believe man landed on the moon.

       Oh I didn't know you were replying to something I said else where. Cool to see you keep up with all my posts. As for the whole gradient thing, that actually can't be used to make a vacuum. There needs to be a barrier.

       lmao i like how you seem to have to answer to everything... except you completely ignored the fact that all the astronauts were high level freemasons. And this point was addressed immediately in the first reply to your post. Do you think this played a role in terms of the bullshit physics they proposed?

       Here is "astronauts gone wild", another documentary made by the same bret sibrel who made the documentary in this thread. He individually asks each astronaut to swear on the bible that they went to the moon. Being high level free masons, they are unable to do this, as they despise Christianity and all it stands for. For example, in the mystery school religions, one may be asked to spit upon a cross. If you do Not, you might find your self stuck at the degree you are at within the secret society, and unable to rise any higher in the rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
       So bret interviews all these astronauts and asks them to put their left hand on the bible and swear on God's name they went to the moon. Watch it and watch them squirm and hesitate, get angry, violent, and refuse to do so. Why? Because they are high level free masons and are not allowed to do so. Its against their luciferian religion. If you keep this in mind and watch it,  it all makes sense.

       Proxy for ICBMs. At last you admit it. It was always an ICBM programme and nothing more. It’s just that no president has had the guts to tell the public we didn’t go yet.  Clinton hinted at it and so have Nasa. Yet the old adage it’s easier to fool people than to convince them they’ve been fooled.

       The core reason is money. There’s no oil on the moon. That’s it fullstop. No economic incentive == no moon program.

       Hey I appreciate your comments so I wanted to ask something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's absurd to build 2018 spacecraft with vacuum tubes and punch cards, but why don't we adapt a special framework of computer tech that is large format for the explicit purpose of radiation resistance?
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be useful for space and nuclear industries.

       As a matter of fact, they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       exactly that and have for decades. Most modern rad hard by design CPUs are on old processes like 130nm. The Shuttle computers dated back to the 60s architecturally and used hand woven magnetic core memory up until the 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to being on physically more robustly sized old nodes, they also make them out of special materials that prevent electric charge displacement from radiation strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to that, they also can be made in cell configurations like Xilinx space ready FPGAs that prevent radiation from physically being able to go through two important things at once and cause an uncorrectable error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the packaging is also different. They often use column or microcoil grid array packages, coefficient of thermal expansion Invar or Kovar and ceramic packages designed for vibration and temperature fluctuation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consequently a single 2002 era(in terms of speed and architecture) rad hard PowerPC750(called the Rad750) or other true rad hard chip that is infinitely slower and older than even a shitty modern i3, will run you a couple hundred thousand dollars.

       Oh and they do use them in nuclear power plants as well. Also spy planes and anything that is likely to be hit with a lot of radiation can use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have mentioned too that rad hardening is a separate thing to electromagnetic interference(EMI) shielding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time with space based computers there is not much shielding, because of the weight penalty. The rad hard stuff needs to let radiation through it, without damage, and be able to correct errors caused by temporary upsets called SEE(single event effects) and SEU(single event upsets).

       One notable exception is this

       I addressed the CPU issue because rad hard CPUs are something i know a bit about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know about rad hard design for ICs you know that older chips and more specifically RAM was less susceptible to both SEU and TID damage because of their features' larger size, or in the case of ferrite core memory, the fact that it doesnt get upset by radiation at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Todays rad hard chips dont use small feature sizes like 14nm. Theyre still back in 2002 on 130nm. Rad hard ICs can use a number of different techniques, from cell configuration like Xilinx's rad hard FPGAs to silicon on insulator or sapphire, with different dopants to the dielectric layer to make it less susceptible to radiation effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of rad hard and rad tolerant computers now. They are in deep space and LEO as we speak. No reason to use the Apollo era stuff, although it is advanced for its time.

       lol I know this is from almost a week ago but I just couldn't help but laugh at your comment. You can't just "use" older computers. You know lots of nuke technology is still from the 60s? It's that way because very few people know how to use it. Less susceptible to hacking. There's just not enough people that know how to use that tech anymore plus it's completely illogical to spend billions of dollars and millions of man hours to recreate old tech and learn how to program and use it vs spending that time and money figuring out how to use our new more advance technology.

       MIght not be gld but there is Helium 3 which can be used as a replacement for multiple fossil fuels... (you seem smart enough to understand the logistical challenges of this, simply pointing out there are usable materials on the moons surface.....

       Actuually rad hard semiconductor and computer design is something i can comment on.

       This is just some facts for interest sake.

      <p>
       The SLS Orion is going to be using rad hard Power750 CPUs. It has triple modular redundant computers with voting, meaning three identical computers doing the same calculations, then checking against each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is an SEU(single event upset) caused by radiation, the errorneous computer will be outvoted by the other two.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further increase radiation tolerance, each computer consists of two Rad750 CPUs running in lockstep mode.

       If you escaped earth through the equator, you would be a vegetable by the time you hit the moon(1million X-rays). Escape though the poles and you had 5,000 X-rays that year.  This Is another reason not to send your rock star PR team back to space because they would be exposed to so much radiation that cancer would take them all out.

       The van Allen belt is variable and non constant so fly through the thinner areas. The radiation trapped there is alpha and beta particles. Alpha particles are easily stopped by most materials, while beta can be blocked with simple things like plastics. Nothing far fetched about flying through them.

       No, it doesn't, like I have already clearly explained to you, I never denied they placed the Christmas wrapping paper over the tent poles, for your analogy to work, it needs to have me deny that aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe go and learn what an analogy actually means and how to apply it, you obviously are having great difficulty, but then you actually believe humans walked on the moon, you literally believe in a Hollywood type media production as fact, so I won't hold out too much hope.

       You're better off realizing that the Van Allen belts are part of the bullshit as well. There's a reason no one can get their story straight about them, and why shills can always split hairs about some justification for why it's possible to traverse them: because they're made up window-dressing to posit a pseudo-explanation for why it's "hard" to go to space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, no one has gone to space and no one goes. No one can go.

       The lunar lander, made of metal kept cool for 18 hours on batteries ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The lunar rover ran all that time on batteries ? Not only that even the battery manufacturer said it wouldn’t operate above 40C. Yet it did just fine in 100c

      <p>
       Footprints don’t get left in totally dry sand and no moon dust isnt sticky.even totally dry talc you can’t leave footprints.
      </p>
      <p>
       No dust on the landing pads under 10,000 lbs of thrust ? Are you kidding ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just listen to Neil converse with housetop on landing ?  Less time lag than when I speak to my brother in the states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Launch from the moon and re dock with an orbiting space craft at 10,000 miles an hour ? Just fuck off
      </p>
      <p>
       No distortion on any of the photos. The cameras were not protected from radiation
      </p>
      <p>
       An ex CIA director died the night between an interview with a French tv crew about the space program saying he would tell them something but it could mean peoples lives (check it out very interesting)
      </p>
      <p>
       The press conference afterwards ? They looked guiltier than a dog who’s just ravaged your bin
      </p>
      <p>
       There was not enough fuel to get to the moon in those rockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thrusters didn’t spin the rocket around. How ? They didn’t have the computers to regulate the thrust properly spin would be inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s just tons and tons. Anyone looking into it will just be amazed at how we were fooled for so long
      </p>
      <p>
       And Neil Armstrong is a man I greatly admire. A true American and a decent man. Shame there are so few like him today.

         false, Van Allen belts are non instant killers. You’d have to spend a lot of time in them to die. The Apollo astronauts traveled very fast through them (25,000+ mph IIRC). The clip you’re mentioning is referring to the Orion capsule, which uses modern electronics. Modern computers use smaller lithographic processes that are much more vulnerable to cosmic radiation than 1960’s tech and have to be shielded more. People haven’t changed much since the 60’s and are fine.

       -Define “not working” on earth, and provide a source. Seems fishy
      </p>
      <p>
       -people not going twice has plenty of other plausible reasons besides the entire thing being fake. Inconclusive
      </p>
      <p>
       -engineered glass can easily handle +/- 250 degrees. If you think this is impossible go buy a thermal chamber and prove it. You’d finally have solved what could be the largest conspiracy ever
      </p>
      <p>
       -there is no convective heat transfer in space (no medium). All your incoming and outgoing heat is from thermal radiation. Proper design keeps thermal radiators in the shadow of the sun where it’s -100 or more and dump heat in the form of emitted infrared light.
      </p>
      <p>
       -source on the battery manufacturer’s claims? But again i’ve Seen this faulty logic before. 200+ degrees in space doesn’t work like 200+ degrees in an atmosphere that’s surrounding you. You have no data suggesting the battery got that hot
      </p>
      <p>
       -rover range: it didn’t seem like much more than an electric golf cart. There’s nothing spectacular or unbelievable about it’s range in microgravity with no air resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       -“something in atmosphere at a different temperature that isn’t even the same material as what i’m Comparing it too acts differently, so it must be fake!”
      </p>
      <p>
       -film behaves different than CCDs. Those flashes you see on digital cameras? That’s what it also does to the inside of modern computer chips. Maybe now you’ll see why shielding them has to be “figured out” (aka a cost + pork barrel gov contract + decade of work form an oversized team of mid-grade engineers run in a contractor’s office)
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s nuts is all of these are wrong, or otherwise semi-logical inferences from limited data sets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don’t know anything about computers, trajectories, or math then some of these make sense. The problem is the more you learn the more obvious these “problems” appear to be falsehoods.

       Here’s a Harvard paper on solar activity in 1969. It shows Considerable activity in the jest quarter. So what made them think it would die down ? Since we can’t tell today and the sun was still active.

       So your argument is “i’m too good”? Thanks :)
      </p>
      <p>
       And dig through my post history in this thread, i’m Glad one of you amateurs finally brought up the lighting issue! I have a surprise for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your first video says the camera angle is “too high” then complains about the light issue.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        “to high” is never adequately explained, he seems to be upset the curved visor distorts the reflection of the horizon? Lol I mean.. it’s curved.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now it’s my turn to make you watch a video:

         astronaughts hydrating means nothing, and by your own hoaxer positions no amount of water would have saved them anyways.

        <ul>
         <li>
          solar activity does not mean a flare, or that a flare came towards the earth. You need to show that a flare struck the earth/moon during the trip for this to be relevant.

       Oh dear we are starting with the insults. And lack of knowledge, the astronaughts suits were supposedly water cooled. Not for hydrating. So by your own admition no amount would have been enough or they didn’t need it at all ?   Which one is it you’re starting to tie yourself in a knot here

       And regarding light I’ll take the maker of the cameras word for it since he’s specialised and you seem to know about all of it. So probably not specialised in any of it. Would you say that the maker of the camera is a good person to rely on or is he just making it up ?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the camera angles which doesn’t involve light you’ll see a comprehensive explanation as to why the angles are impossible.

       In your own video, the camera guy can’t explain why Neil is “in the spotlight”.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video I posted, they show through advanced voxel-based light bouncing using physically based materials that the GIANT WHITE SUITE of the astronaught in front of him is the source of the relecting light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yes their suites were liquid cooled, apparently connected to a radiator on their back. I had assumed you meant drinking water which of course doesn’t send heat anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, how you cool things in space: objects in shadow will super cool, now run a liquid through said object and whatever surface you want to cool. Heat will be transfered via the liquid to the radiator and dispersed as thermal radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude that’s Jensen Huang CEO of Nvidia
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the hammer video is hilarious. You guys are finally delivering with the “movie maker Xp home edition” videos I mentioned earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have an open mic channel and he’s hammering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what, he’s physically connecteded to the hammer. Sound travels through physical mediums, and he’s in a hollow space suit banging on something. I hear cracks and pops coming from the mic when he strikes. Big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s the conspiracy, that they “left the audio on” on a camera filing on a sound stage? Why even use a camera with audio if they were making a hoax?

       Sorry no. You can’t hear the sound traveling up a handle. Through a suit into his mouthpiece and into the other astronauts microphone. That should not be heard It’s not a radiator. Sound cannot travel into a persons suit that’s jut ridiculous.

       Sound actually travels through dense mediums better than less dense ones.  The space suit is obviously much more dense than air on earth so the sound would travel better through the space suit than it would through air on earth.  The microphone isn't going to filter that sound out.  You are hearing the sound travle through the suit which is also connected to the microphone.

       Maybe, but no I’m afraid not he’s a shill. It’s obvious. Far too obvious. Perhaps watching the damn video and debunking the major proof that we didn’t go to the moon would help. But no one seems to answer this one. Ever. Not here, not anywhere else.

       Helps when he has a script in front of him and not using researched knowledge. Hasn’t even watched the documentary. I know this guy he’s on many other chat sites waiting to jump on every nasa discussion with pre prepared arguments. The are all wrong of course. But it wouldn’t surprise me if you sat across a desk from him.

       He has actually presented some interesting viewpoints. Your basis for discrediting him is he seems to knowledgeable and therefor must have a script?

       The point of these sites isn't to parrot an opinion, it's to be presented with alternate opinions and gain a wider understanding.

       Having different viewpoints is one thing but he hadn’t even watched the documentary in question. And still hasn’t tackled the main proof we didn’t go which is the time stamped nasa tape of astronauts faking earth photos. I’ve heard some of the same old crap regarding debunks etc. Some of it is fair point but when one thing after another is reeled off in lawyer argument lie fashion without once taking on board any points, then that is a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       No not the same on other sites I just recognise the writing and aggressive tone. When arguing the point against the owner of the hassleblad camera company and trying to discrete all and sundry people all but switch off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus he starts with the insults so I’m just going to bits aren’t I ?  And I’ve seen the concerted effort of shills when it comes to their precious moon landings.

       You have t even watched the video. There’s pretty conclusive proof in there we didnt.  But I advise not to watch it.  For you it would be like seeing a video of mom and pop having sex.  I can imagine the stunned shock and silence. It may just be a little too much for your brain to cope with.

       Your comment is totally fair. It's insane that you would be banned for this. Do the mods want a completely uncritical echo chamber where users can assert anything they want without proof? And if this sub is dealing with real and accurate conspiracies, shouldn't they be able to withstand criticism?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they banned you for that comment then they don't deserve your excellent commentary here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I consider myself to be very very skeptical about almost everything on this sub. But I both enjoy being exposed to dissenting viewpoints and arguing with people who are convinced of what seem to me to be strange or baseless theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for me, this comes specifically from my engagement with UFO research. Whenever I go to the actual documents, the real experts, and the scientific work that has been done, I almost always find that the common interpretations and claims are just plain ignorant and fanciful. In my experience with UFO buffs, they are very uncritical and prone to believing whatever stories support their assumptions. And with the exception of some fantastically knowledgeable users on Reddit (mostly the mods of
       <a href="/r/Ufos">
        /r/Ufos
       </a>
       , I wouldn't trust really anything people say on that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again if the mods here are banning dissent then they're just making it easier for the users here to assume that reality and facts line up with their assumptions without actual evidence. And what they do call evidence is so commonly based on clear misunderstanding of the facts they offer or reject.

       Because it takes a lot more character to do what you believe is right and keep that with you a lifetime. He also didn’t profit from it by selling the entire contents of his pockets like buzz did. He was a humble and good man and his reasons are his own for doing what he did. And to quote him. Judge a man by the efforts of his daily work not one peice of fireworks. He did what was asked of him otherwise he may have ended up like gus grisholm, I won’t judge men when if the circumstances were reversed I’d have probably done the same.

       Eh, I guess it depends on whether we think the Apollo astronuts were unwilling stooges or colluding conspirators. Judging by some of their performances, i.e. Alan Bean and Buzz Aldrin, I can see how you would assume the former. Armstrong does seem to have been a truly excellent pilot.

       Ah, a chat room hardman.  You’re the sort of weasel that hangs on the achievements of better men and claims them as your own.  Your ego rests on the fact “we” went to the moon when in fact “we” did no such thing, and to think such would crumble your ever fragile weak skinned ego into believe we are a fallible and limited race with still much to do.  So peel back truths protective layers, and actually understand the person who you professing would like to punch me.

       Interesting posts, but they’re contradictory. If we’ve never been to the moon, how do you have all this information on how moon temps/sand/situations act and react? You’re using that you say is made up to make your points

       It’s the temperatures we have been told. Plus I can’t see how the temperature couldn’t be worked out.  Plus they’d have to come back with some data. We have to work to something. But in honesty even without that I can’t see any evidence we went.

       Exactly moon landing conspiracy theorists (not meant pejoratively we're in a conspiracy forum after all) declare ignorance and malice for mainstream scientists then accept as fact the scientific claims of people they agree with. It's kind of astonishing how much cherry picking occurs.

       And explore what exactly ? A rainforest ? Starbucks ? Perhaps a herd of wilderbeest roaming the plains ?  Oh dear what a surprise more dust.  Then they went up again to find what ? More dust. But let’s take another rover. Maybe third time lucky we’ll find a pixie garden ?  Oh dear more fucking dust who would have thunk it.  Really you need to be five to still believe this.

       Well apart from admiral Byrd who else has traversed the ice for research ? They stay on the ice edge and conduct experiments there. No need to travel inland as I’m pretty sure they know it’s just more ice. So they stay put.

       You don’t want anyone to read my horseshit ? So we sent buggies up three times to traverse the lions surface because we wanted to cover ground over dust, not to mention taking up fucking golf clubs, yet we don’t need to go back fifty years later because there is nothing up there ?  Are you serious ? Are you that stupid you think they should have taken up three buggies, to cover either not a lot of ground because the batteries are no good. (So what’s the point) . Or a lot of ground in which case the batteries were amazing technology before we had a digital watch.

       Honestly listen to yourself. I’m not worried about anyone reading your crap. Anyone with half a brain can see you are resorting to insults and diversion.

       I dont want anyone to conflate your hubristic, authoritative way of spewing BS and think its actually you being informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are so ignorant about something as basic as Newtonian mechanics, thrust, and why a rocket works perfectly well in a vacuum, then your "information" is dangerous because its so batshit crazy and ill informed.

       They took 3 rovers because they had three landing sites. What, you think theyre going to walk to an abandoned rover, change the battery, fix anything that may have degraded in the interim of the trips? Its so much easier to take a new one! Wtf
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can read the damn math and stuff i linked to and see its easily verifiable!
      </p>
      <p>
       You conflated weight and mass, and think rockets dont work in space because there's no gravity to "push off of" or something that a 5th grader should have a fundamental grasp of.

       Whats the time in this mockumentary youre referring to? Where in the video is whatever it is so i can watch it and reply?

       Well there are some far cleverer people that you talking about it here. The only expertise I see you performing is the art of disruption and shilling. You have no real knowledge on the subject. One of your counterparts has the decency to at least engage in conversation rather than throw belittling insults.

       Ok you’re boring me now. You haven’t eluded to which bit you don’t understand. I’d suggest all of it, since you believe we went to the moon, as it’s possible to do that before a fucking pocket calculator was available.

       You can explain how a rocket works in a vacuum for one where there is no air to push off. Or a gravity to push off. Teach me oh wise one.

       Yes I know thy carry liquid oxygen aka it’s own air. But that’s not the point that is made. The point is because there is no up/ down. Anything to push against how does it move. ?  It’s a bit like blowing into the sails when on the boat.  I’m willing to be wrong on this one. But what I highlighted there was a discussion. And the fact you feel the need to skate it so hard makes me think rockets don’t actually work in space.   You should go back to shill school

       Hold with the fifth grade you are a paid shill to debunk.  I happen to have watched a couple of documentaries and done some of my own conclusions. So you’ll forgive me if I couldnt give a fuck what you think.

       So... you dont understand how a rocket, generating a large volume of high velocity exhaust gas, expanding in the nozzle and PUSHING AGAINST THE INNER SURFACE produces a REACTION to make the rocket move in the opposite direction of the gas expanding?

       The reason space travel is not possible is because the systems we claim to use to propel a rocket through space operate on gas pressure and there is no gas pressure in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gas pressure requires molecules to be in contact with each other, bouncing off each other, causing millions of collisions per second, etc… If you release gas into the vacuum of space, the first molecule that pops out will shoot off into the distance at a constant speed, so will the one behind that, never catching up with the first one. The third, fourth, etc… all fly off into the distance trying to fill the vacuum by finding their empty corner. So no matter how much gas you produce none of it will ever change the pressure under a space ship. None it if will ever push a spaceship. To push a spaceship there must be some locally high pressure under it, which is impossible since the pressure in space is 0 everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back the the Nozzle and the Massflow equation F=MA on earth
Think about a fire hose shooting water. A force comes directly back against the column of water shooting out. Why? Because the first drop of water has to pas through air, which is dense, causing many collisions, slowing down the drop of water. The second drop, directly behind the first, will not be slowed down by the air so it will collide with the first drop, the third drop hits the second drop and so on, the fast water coming through the hose pushing through the slower water outside causes Newton’s 3rd Law to push back on the column of water. This is why you need people holding the hose to add an unbalanced force otherwise the hose would not be able to push water through that column anymore, the water column would be diverted and the hose would flop around. It is obvious that one drop of water does not push back on the hose, you need a fast moving column.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nozzle and the Massflow equation in space
Since the molecules leaving the combustion chamber and entering the vacuum never slow down, never collide with any outside objects, nor with each other, their force is always moving forward, away from the ship. There is no way for that force to be returned to the ship. There is no way for the force of the moving molecules to be extracted and used for propulsion. Their force is carried off into the far corners of space. This is also known as Joule Expansion. Remember that as soon as the nozzle is opened, the combustion chamber becomes part of the vacuum of space as is subject to its laws. A closed chamber is under pressure but not an open one.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA is lying at the molecular level
But that’s OK because most people don’t usually look there. The awesome, spectacular and heroic nature of space exploration is enough to cloud the most logical minds. Most respectable engineering schools won’t touch space flight and those who do have tiny departments. If it was really a multi-billion dollar government funded operation, every school in America would have their hands out for government grants like the do with Engineering, Computer Science and Biology. But why train thousands of the best minds of a generation in a field that doesn’t

       It’s the lack of back pressure that makes it so they can’t work. That is exactly what he describes and it makes perfect sense.

       No ffs thats not how it works at all. The guy doesnt understand what a de Laval(convergent divergent) nozzle does. The expansion of the gas inside the bell shaped section of the nozzle is where you get a rocket's thrust from!
      </p>
      <p>
       The combustion chamber is where the gas js produced, and its velocity is subsonic. The throat converges after the combustion chamber. The narrow section produces a soically
       <em>
        choked flow
       </em>
       , which means that it accelerates to the speed of sound(local to the fluid). This then opens to the divergent section, where the increase in area causes the expanding gas to accelerate to supersonic velocity. The "resistence" to this expanding gas is the divergent section itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nozzle is filled with gas at high pressure. It doesnt need to "push off" the atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure has to be calculated into the equation to know how big and what geometry the nozzle has to be for it to work most efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not that it has nothing to push off of. It is expelling what its pushing off of.

       I understand that. But in order to compress the gas there must be air to compress (like the bellows) not just gas. And as the guy has pointed out you can’t compress anything because in order to do so there must be an outside air pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure somewhere we are getting crossed wires. I just can’t see how it can create thrust on its own without something to push against. Ie weight or air pressure. Maybe there’s something I’m missing. I tried to understand what you were saying but still basically sounds like the bellows again only gas. (Correct me if I’m wrong)

       The fuel and oxidozer liquids are pressurized by turbopumps, which feed the high pre-pressurized gas into a combustion chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       The combustion of the fuel and oxidizer in the combustion chamber produces
       <em>
        enormous
       </em>
       pressure(and high temperature)... as combustion of large quantities of fuel and oxidizer tend to.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bellows is a bad example. Bellows dont really produce thrust and they arent designed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I edited my post to add the example. You need to stop thinking about the rocket's thrust being between the ass end of the rocket and the ground or air. Thats not where the thrust comes from at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thrust comes from the
       <em>
        rapidly expanding high pressure exhaust gas
       </em>
       expanding WITHIN the nozzle bell section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nozzle is filled with expanding gas, trying to get out in all directions, right? Expanding gas just expands in all directions when allowed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats what the bell section does: it prevents the gas from expanding in
       <em>
        all directions
       </em>
       . It expands towards the wall of the nozzle but cant "get out that way" because its blocked by metal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It still imparts a force, pushes against, the interior of the nozzle as it tries to expand in all directions. The nozzle transfers that force to the structure its attached to(the spacecraft) and causes it to move.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gas does escape, but only in one direction where there isnt resistence(in the form of metal walls) to its expansion.

       Ok i figured out how i can explain it so its totally impossible to misunderstand. A shit and shower is great for thinking. Anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, you have to understand the difference between
       <em>
        mass
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        weight
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass is how much matter there is in an object. It doesnt change depending on gravity. A person or vehicle in space, in zero g has the same mass as they do on Earth or the Moon or Jupiter or floating in deep space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok for now just think of weight as the effect of gravity pulling an object to whatever is producing the gravity. Say the Earth for this example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok on Earth, you are standing next to an elephant. I tell you to push him as hard as you can. What happens? The elephant barely budges. Now i tell the elephant to push you. You go flying right? Why? The elephant has more
       <em>
        mass
       </em>
       . On Earth the elephant also weighs a lot more
       <em>
        because he has more mass
       </em>
       being acted on by gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok now you and the elephant are in space(hes got a suit too) and since theres no gravity you both
       <em>
        weigh
       </em>
       nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell you to push the elephant. What happens? You go flying in one direction pretty quick, but the elephant also goes slowly floating
       <em>
        in the opposite direction
       </em>
       to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didnt he fly off at the same velocity? He still has more mass, but since theres no gravity or friction holding him to the ground, like on Earth, you
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       go flying off, but at different velocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok reset the experiment. I tell the elephant to push you. What happens? The *exact same thing as when you pushed him. You go flying off fast, and he goes slowly floating the opposite way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you agree with that thought experiment's result, lets move onto rockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       As i explained before, a rocket basically takes dense liquid fuel and oxidizer, pumps them from sealed tanks into a combustion chamber, where they are burned. This heats the gas to thousands of degrees and pressurizes the gas many times higher pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       This gas goes from the combustion chamber where it is contained and is allowed to expand(which it wants to do very much since its basically a continuous controlled explosion).
      </p>
      <p>
       As it expands in the nozzle "bell", it pushes in
       <em>
        all directions
       </em>
       . It cant escape from the bell, but like you pushing on the elephant, the high pressure gas(which has mass!) imparts a force on the nozzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the nozzle is being pushed on by this matter with mass, which is the expanding gas within it, it is
       <em>
        moved in the opposite direction
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The elephant is the rocket, and you are the expanding gas. Only, unlike in the thought experiment where you pushed the elephant once, the gas is doing it for as long as the engine is turned on. Constant pushes from all that gas expanding, pushing against the nozzle wall. Because remember, the nozzle is
       <em>
        constantly being filled with a supply of high pressure gas
       </em>
       , which then expands even more behind the rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres where we can address backpressure from the atmosphere. As the expanding gas leaves the containment of the bell, it will keep expanding until it reaches equilibrium. Thats 14.7PSI at sea level or 0PSI in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, the force of the expanding gas
       <em>
        in the nozzle bell
       </em>
       already pushed the rocket away, so it doesnt matter if there is backpressure in terms of a reaction. The reaction happened in the
       <em>
        gas filled
       </em>
       nozzle bell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason backpressure is relevant is actually this: the mass flow from the combustion chamber has to be high enough to go sonic and choke
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       entering the nozzle bell, otherwise it wont go expand properly in the bell and go supersonic, and therefore it wont push the nozzle bell enough. Too much fuel and oxidizer and your engine goes boom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why backpressure
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       has to be taken into account, so you can put precisely the right amount of fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber to get choked flow and proper expansion, and therefore proper thrust(pushing) against the nozzle attached to your spacecraft.

       the reason why thrust cant work is simple
thrust equals = weight in order to have weight we need gravity.
see its like this in space everything weighs nothing so i would say a rocket weighs 0
or put like this rocket =0
                       thrust=0 because without gravity there is no weight behind the thrust
to cause a reaction so no movement would take place.
on earth if you sit in a chair that has wheels on it and throw a heavy ball you would 
move back, and guess why of course because of gravity.....see gravity makes the ball weigh something but if you did the same thing in space you wouldnt move because you and the ball weigh nothing at all .
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh dear. Explain this one. No weight.  Nothing to push against. No Newton’s third law here.   I’ll let you explain this one

       Really. This is just getting fucking pathetic. The Earth is in space. When you jump, why do you go up? You are fundamentally misunderstanding literally the most basic physics possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything still has mass in space. Thrust is generated by expelling mass out the nozzle of a rocket, which pushes on the expansion(bell) section of the fucking nozzle with however many pounds of thrust the rocket produces... producing the reaction that it fucking moves in the opposite direction of the thrust generating gas stream's motion.

       I'd be willing to listen to what one has to say on the topic, but I've literally never seen one make this claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a reminder (and this is neither here nor there when it comes to rockets in a vacuum), there's plenty of gravity in space. It's literally everywhere. The idea that when you're outside Earth's atmosphere the gravity vanishes is one that probably stems from seeing video clips of astronauts floating around in the ISS and such, but the reason they float isn't an absence of gravity, but the fact that they're in a free-fall orbit. (If you've ever been in a particularly fast-falling elevator, you get a small sense of that, and it can be duplicated in planes for short periods.) Even a quarter of a million miles away, the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon keeps the latter in orbit around the former.

       No weight in space. A rocket needs weight to move. There is no weight to move. So the rocket just blasts away. Newton’s third law does not work in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason why thrust cant work is simple
thrust equals = weight in order to have weight we need gravity.
see its like this in space everything weighs nothing so i would say a rocket weighs 0
or put like this rocket =0
                       thrust=0 because without gravity there is no weight behind the thrust
to cause a reaction so no movement would take place.
on earth if you sit in a chair that has wheels on it and throw a heavy ball you would 
move back, and guess why of course because of gravity.....see gravity makes the ball weigh something but if you did the same thing in space you wouldnt move because you and the ball weigh nothing at all .

       For Newton’s third law to work you have to have weight. Mass does not change no matter in gravity or not. There has to be weight for a rocket to push against otherwise how does it work ?
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory you could push a vessel of any size with the same rocket because there is no weight. Be it the size of a car or an aircraft carrier. So in other word my gas lighter could push an aircraft carrier through space just as well as a 10,000 llb thrust engine because there is nothing to stop it.  In theory.

       I don't know where you've gotten this idea, but it's incorrect.

      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The rocket fuel's chemical reaction expels exhaust from the thruster nozzle and moves the rocket forward by the same amount of force (the equal and opposite reaction). The absence of Earth's atmosphere makes it all the easier. Rockets don't stop working outside the atmosphere, they're made
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       effective because there's no drag. Weight and gravity have nothing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're correct, that your gas lighter could move an aircraft carrier in space, but its acceleration would be astonishingly slow because of how little thrust it would have and how quickly the fuel would run out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, even though you correctly said that mass doesn't change in gravity or not, you seem to be confused about moving mass in a vacuum. Weight only matters when you're trying to escape the gravity well of the planet you're launching from. The relatively high gravity of a sea-level launch is
       <em>
        problematic
       </em>
       for rockets, not a requirement for their operation.

       The "controlled explosion" coming out of the rocket's nozzle is forcefully expelling
       <em>
        mass
       </em>
       at high speed in one direction, propelling the rocket in the opposite direction in equal measure. That's
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle#Specific_impulse">
        thrust
       </a>
       . When the rocket's fuel is used up, the rocket has
       <em>
        lost much of its mass
       </em>
       but has moved forward as a result of expelling that mass out the back.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you insist on something "pushing against" something, think of the ignited fuel pushing against the top of the fuel tank opposite the nozzle. The fuel "wants" to explode in all directions, but it's following the path of least resistance, so to speak, out the nozzle opening.

       Not quite, that's a common misconception. The exhaust doesn't have to push against
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       , believe it or not. You may have heard of the law of conservation of momentum. This means that if you look at a closed system of things and add together their momentums, the result is fixed and never changes.  When the rocket engine shoots exhaust out the back, that exhaust has some momentum. Because the total momentum of the system cannot change, the rocket's momentum changes to negate the exhaust's change in momentum. In this case, that means a change in velocity. Thus, the rocket will accelerate (change velocity) in the direction opposite to the exhaust's velocity. There's a

       "Weight" is a term we give to the acceleration due to gravity on objects (typically objects on the earth). Objects in space still experience acceleration due to gravity, but acceleration due to gravity decreases with the square of the distance between the objects - in a very big and very empty area like space, you don't experience very much gravitational acceleration from things like the earth.

       There is effectively no weight in space. Everyone agrees with you. Because that is (sort of) correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       mass. Weightless object can have mass. Things with very large masses, like giant rockets, can have close-to-zero weight. Because weight and mass are not the same thing. So F=ma still holds true, and describes the behavior of weightless objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say it with me: weight and mass are not the same. Weight and mass are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are weight and mass the same? No. Weight and mass are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you use the word 'weight' in the same places you'd use the word 'mass' and keep the same meaning? No. Because weight and mass are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you substitute 'weight' into an equation for mass? No, you cannot. Because weight and mass are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using 'weight' instead of 'mass' is like using speed instead of distance. They don't even have the same units. A speed isn't a kind of distance. A distance isn't a kind of speed. They're different. Weight isn't a kind of mass. Mass isn't a kind of weight. They are different.

       Your mass increases significantly when you move at relativistic speed. With strong enough gravity (read: acceleration) like from a black hole or even a sling shot around some big space objects you could begin to move fast enough that you gain mass.

       Newton's laws don't say anything about weight. They talk about mass. Mass can be weightless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newton's laws say that mass requires a force to change it's velocity. Not weight, mass. These are different things. Don't confuse your misunderstanding with insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       F= ma makes not claims about the existence of gravity. For a given mass to achieve a particular acceleration, you need exactly the force given by that equation. That works in space or on earth. The mass doesn't change based on gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weight = mass * gravity. Weight is a Force. It's the F in F = ma, it's not the 'a'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if there's no gravity, then there's no weight. But there's still mass.

       Relativity changes some of the details. But not in any way that makes your comment correct.

       I think I’ve claimed the opposite of making myself 100% sure.  I don’t know about rockets as I’ve said time and fucking time again. I’m so bored of this now it’s just ridiculous.  A short google search and you will find plenty of arguments from people claiming to be physicists.  How do I know if they are or aren’t ?

       Of the fact there is no weight. To be honest I’ve replied to about ten people about rocket engines, and if it was Friday night I would probably have been in the pub getting fed up with all the rocket experts. After only pointing out there are issues with it.  To be honest no one has replied once. Even once regarding the faking of far earth faking by the astonuaghts. So whether they do or do not is immaterial to be honest.

       Well, you shouldn't be 100% sure there's 'no' weight, either. Because gravitational fields go as 1/r
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       so even in deep space there are small, but non-zero gravitational forces acting on masses. Which means those masses have small but non-zero weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're curious about the details of how rockets work, a better source for information than flat-earth blogs would be books on rockets. And rockets are super interesting. The basics of rocket motion are mathematically fairly straightforward (though still not exactly easy: variational-mass problems are a bit tricky and require a bit of practice with calculus.) But then the details of rockets, from an engineering standpoint, and controlling 3-dimensional motion in a precise way is super complicated. So is long-distance space flight-path dynamics because of the motion of the planets. Things like sling-shotting around Jupiter for a gravitational assist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if it's something you're interested in, you can really get super deep into it and never run out of things to learn. Something like
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Space-Dynamics-Aeronautical-Engineering/dp/0486651134/ref=pd_rhf_dp_s_cp_0_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=0486651134&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=EQQ79RH27KYCTZA6ETHG&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=RWmdW&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=K8aIP&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=EQQ79RH27KYCTZA6ETHG">
        this
       </a>
       might be a nice start, assuming you have a reasonable mathematical background.

       Mathematics is one thing I do well in. Certainly written English isn’t. I’ll look into it. Though I feel the rocket discussion got out of hand to divert from many other anomalies that show that Apollo 11 didn’ t happen.  But quite frankly Donald trump could write a signed confession in this thread now and no one would see it.

       By the way I’m not convinced at all about this sling shot thing. That really doesn’t make sense as you definitely need weight to do that. And not a tiny bit either since it tends to be g force that gives the object the momentum. But that’s probably not for now.  I’ll look into rockets first.

       It’s Astro physics, I run events lol. You are probably right But my instincts tell me something’s wrong with it. And I can’t exactly see what. With all the theory something just doesn’t add up, I don’t believe there’s a mars lander either by the way. But that’s another story. I just don’t think they’ve got this space thing anywhere near what we are told.

       Everything adds up just perfectly. Literally, in fact. Those calculations are done to the 10th decimal place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that scientists are all a bunch of scammers is silly. If we hadn't gone to space, scientists would want to try to figure out how to get there, not be wasting time making it seem like it had already happened.

       I don’t disagree that scientists are all scammers.  Buts unfortunately some are.  Take global warming. Scientists claim CO2 is warming our planet yet fail to say that warming and cooling is a perfectly natural thing and the planet is actually now cooling
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes there are physicists, or certainly those that appear to be, suggesting rockets don’t work in space, I don’t understand it myself. But that’s not for me to say rather than point out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish science was trustworthy these days, I really do, but I see a lot of evidence that some of the most important things  in this world like global warming are just nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I trust science. ?  Well after experiencing the mandella effect there are things I can tell you are rubbish. Such as evolution and plate techtonics. (Well actually plate techtonics are a thing, just but exactly like we are told). But that’s for another day

       Scientists don't fail to say this. The reason you know this happens is because scientists told you. The difference is, the scale of the warming. It's dramatically different from the 'natural cycles.'
      </p>
      <p>
       2017 was the 3rd hottest year ever measured. The 20 hottest years have all come in the last 20 years. The 5 hottest years ever have come in the last 8 years. The earth isn't cooling.

       And let me again repeat, in no uncertain terms. I
       <em>

       you, there are NO physicists who say rockets won't work in space. Because that would be an absurd thing to say. Really. Really actually really. What I'm saying now is real.

      <p>
       By denying all these things, you're denying yourself the opportunity to learn about the most elegant and wonderful and profound truths humans have discovered. If you have questions about the details of how these things work, there are thousands of scientists who are perfectly willing to answer your questions (again, many of them easily available over on
       <a href="/r/askscience">

       . They won't let you answer questions because they only want true expert-level answers. But you can ask anything, and experts will answer.) because scientists are generally very generous with sharing knowledge. It's kinda the whole purpose of the job!

       Firstly you are wrong about the warming cycle being so dramatic.  Secondly what you have failed to disclose is that 2017 may have been third warmest (on record, it has been much warmer before). Is because they have suddenly decided to take the sea temperatures into account.  It’s a historical fact that vikings settled Greenland, do you think it was warmer then ? also the Romans grew grape vines in Northumberland, was it warmer or cooler then ?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are SCIENTIFIC records kept if the co2 levels and there is nothing unusual about the levels right now, the co2 levels go up after warming not the other way around.  Again these are scientific records.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you knew where the fossil fuel propoganda came from you’d understand. It was during the minors strike in the UK and Marggy Thatcher wanted a scientific paper showing how burning fossil fuels was bad. So out came a paper with probably and possibles in it. Soon to be turned into fact and definites.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what can I say to a scientist who chooses to use one set of data and not another ?  That’s all we see.  But proof is in the fact.  You’ll see grape vines this year have been hit hard by frost. In 2020 you’ll see some harsh weather like in the 60s. And it’ll get worse. All the while you’ll hang onto scientific data that is purely screwed to suit a political narrative.

       Here's a nice visualization to show how dramatically the temperature has risen:
       <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/">
        https://xkcd.com/1732/
       </a>
       it's dramatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been measuring and tracking sea temperature for quite a while. No, scientists didn't make a trivial, basic mistake in comparing year-to-year temperature by comparing different kinds of measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there was a medieval warm era that probably overlapped with Vikings settling Greenland. You know how you know it was warm then? Scientists told you about it. Of course, if you look at the graph available right on Wikipedia
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period
       </a>
       you'll see that no, it wasn't warmer even during that unusually warm era. You can also see it in the graph I linked above. 2016 was _significantly_warmer than the peak for the medieval warm period.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       This is simply false. Writing it down doesn't make it true. For example:
       <a href="http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/5_2_13_news_andrew_co2800000yrs_1050_591_s_c1_c_c.jpg">

       </a>
       There is a lot of this data, and it's easy to find. Your claim, however, just exists in your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warming will in general result in a bit lowered C02 because it allows for a longer growing season, so plants have more opportunity to absorb C02. That's why you see a seasonal saw-tooth in C02 levels: C02 goes
       <em>
        down
       </em>
       in the summers:
       <a href="https://www.co2.earth/seasonal-co2-cycle">
        https://www.co2.earth/seasonal-co2-cycle
       </a>
       The precise opposite of what you said is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       How in the world would a UK minors strike convince every scientist everywhere in the world to suddenly unite behind Margret Thatcher?
       <em>
        This
       </em>
       is your explanation? Come one now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, no one has claimed that global warming means that every place on earth will only see higher temperatures and never ever see temperatures every go down again. That's silly. If someone did say that, of course, they'd be wrong. But those aren't scientific claims. If you have $50 and I have $50, then on average, we both have $50. If you gain $200 and I lose $25, then even though I went down, the average still went up, right? That's how averages work. One place can get cooler and the globe, on average, can still be getting warmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been saying: "just wait, it's about to get colder again, instead" for a long time. But as is typical, the predictions made by scientists turn out to be more reliable. Climate scientists have crunch enormous quantities of data. The opposite of selective analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       true about climate science that isn't well-reported in the media is that there is quite a lot of debate about the consequences of warming. It isn't at all clear or universally agreed upon that global warming will lead to catastrophic outcomes. But of course, catastrophe makes for a better new story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand doubting climate change. There's a whole political movement dedicated to discrediting it. It's silly to fall for it, but I understand how it can happen. Motivated reasoning can take a person to a lot of weird places.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 'rockets don't work in space' is an entirely new plateau of weird. I'm curious: how did you come to suspect something like that is true?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these arguments have been done away with time and again. They're straightforward to counter because they are wrong. But there remain a collection of people who just
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to doubt, and they keep recycling the same tired, long-discredited arguments. Don't follow along that path! Step out of the darkness and into the light! You'll like it here, there's lots of amazing things to learn about! I think you'll like it. You seem to be a curious person. That's hands-down the most important trait for a scientist!

       It's not a child's drawing, it's a drawing by Russell Monroe. I like it because it shows a nice sense of scale. But it's based entirely on real data. There are plenty other plots you can look at. But the scrolling effect in this one, I think, drives the point home in a way that's more visceral. It absolutely shows warming. Just ... look at it. Compare historical temperatures to the long vertical line, and compare those to current temperatures. Look at how much temperature has shifted right over a very short period of time as compared to that long vertical line. It's quite significant.
      </p>

       But anyhow, if I'm not a climate scientist. If you have specific questions on that area, you can certainly find a bunch of them over on

       Same I’m not a climate scientist. I do however have first hand knowledge of the vine growing in Northumberland uk and no way could they even grow there now. I did have other charts. My apologies re child’s drawing I didn’t mean offence. Rather there are better graphs showing the medieval warm period and Roman warm period. The younger dryas appears to have warmed about 10 degrees over the course of 15 years but that is still open to debate.

       Fact is climate scientists can’t seem to agree but common sense tells me the sun is a bigger driver of our climate than little ole us. But we shall see.  My prediction for 2020 is buckle up it’ll be cold.

       Would common sense tell you that your mass changes depending on your velocity? Common sense is a pretty poor standard; everyone has their own and it can't be validated or reproduced. You're common sense might differ wildly from someone elses. This is why we need methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose the following method:
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 1) Ask a question
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2) Make a guess at what the answer might be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3) Collect data to see if your guess is right. Focus on collecting the data in such a way that certain results will show you that your guess might be right, and other results would show you that your guess was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 4) Based on the results, make a new guess and start again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out we've got a name for that method: science. It's a substantially better tool for making good predictions about the world that saying "well, it seems to me that the sun is responsible, cause that's common sense."
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate scientists definitely
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       agree on a lot of things. Ongoing research is active on the parts they don't agree on because, of course, you study the unknown, not the known, right? That the earth is warming and that the warming is largely due to C02 level rising, which is due to human activity is something there is near universal agreement on, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your hypothesis that the sun is driving the current warming, for example, is a perfectly good hypothesis! And that's definitely something that could be tested and measured. It turns out, this work has already been done. Here's a nice, lay overview of some of those experiments and their results:
       <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/why-the-sun-is-not-responsible-for-recent-climate-change">
        https://www.carbonbrief.org/why-the-sun-is-not-responsible-for-recent-climate-change
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, the period over which we've witness the most warming (post 1975) we have also experience a
       <em>
        decrease
       </em>
       in solar activity. The sun isn't doing something different that would lead to warming. But C02 levels are.

       It is tested and measured. The simple fact is I can’t be dealing with long arsed explanations. Especially as there are probably some people better versed in explaining it than I am
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun spots create magnetic energy which in turn powers the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere protects the earth from solar rays. The weaker the magnetosphere the more solar rays get through.  This in turn causes more cloud formation bouncing more sunlight from an already weakened sun back out into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solar rays also appear to agitate or heat up the earths mantle ( how I don’t know but data certainly points to it) this in turn creates more earthquakes and more volcanic eruptions. So let’s say we have a ve 6 or above volcanic eruption when the sun is weak with a good amount of cloud cover. This is possibly what can top the earth into a prolonged (or longish) ice age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that the jet stream basically drops down, and wobbles all over the place, creating these polar vortexes we hear about. Sucking cold air from the north as far down as places like Saudi Arabia like we’ve seen this year and southern France like we’ve seen this year. The strange thing is that the North Pole tends to warm a little during a cold period and Alaska actually gets warmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all you need to do is see how the sun spot activity is. What the volcanic eruption activity is like and where the jet stream is to see if any of what I’ve said has made sense. No need for hypothesis or “science”.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for co2 Yes you are right it is a greenhouse gas. But next to methane it’s nothing and our contribution is 0.0001 % (data available) and water is by far a bigger greenhouse gas. Aka clouds. Though that seems to work both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps I have absolutely no interest in reading scientific propaganda. There is plenty of raw data available to make your own mind up about this. Unless you are east anglia university and want to fiddle with the raw data.

       That’s not how it works at all. All Newton’s third law says is that forces come in pairs. Gravity is not necessarily one of those forces.

       "Law" isn't really a standard, meaningful scientific term. Some older theories are called laws just based on history (Newton's laws, Maxwell's laws, the Laws of Thermodynamics) but there's nothing about those laws that are any different from any other theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, each of those has since been supplanted by more fundamental understanding of nature: specifically Einstein's theory of relativity and statistical theories of quantum mechanics.

       u/Mp5QbV3kKvDF8CbM has already done a good job of responding to you but I'm curious how you think the whole "weight is necessary to move" thing actually works in practice. Gravity pulls things on the earth towards its center of gravity (let's just say "down") - but rockets can accelerate in any direction (even
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       the force of gravity). If your explanation is correct, why would a rocket having more weight (remember, it still has weight in space, just a lot less of it) make any difference in its ability to accelerate, and since weight is directional, how do rockets accelerate in any direction, irrespective of the direction their weight is pulling them?

       Ok so I was making it aware there was a debate whether rockets could or could not work in a vacuum. I have a basic grasp of physics, but not of rocket engines. However your point of a rocket flying up down and side ways. With gravity there is still weight. Regardless of its direction there is still a weight to push against. Like you pushing a car. Your muscles vs the resistance of the car create a force, the only way that forces is created is the weight of the car pushing against your muscles. With no weight on the car there is no force to create resistance. (It makes sense in my head)
      </p>
      <p>
       I need to look into this more. Since physicists seem to debate about it there isn’t a simple answer to this. I honestly can’t be certain either way.

       Er, no, not exactly. If you shoot a rocket down towards the ground, the weight of the rocket is going in the

       I’m sure you are, and you clearly have a reason to be here reciting those verses. Which is why I don’t intend to enter into a debate where you wheel out idiotic talking points like a Scientific American fanboy. I’m not new to the “tactics” here.

       Here’s one that’ll keep you up at night though. Not one legitimate demonstration of 1/6 lunar gravity. None.

       What do you mean no demonstration of 1/6 gravity? The videos clearly show people kicking dust in 1/6 g and in vacuum. Same with the launch off the Moon that throws debris in a way that couldnt happen in 1g and atmosphere.

       Must know about the inverse square law, right? Apply that to dust being kicked up on the moon by the rovers. Now think.

       Sand doesnt do that on a beach on Earth with 1g and atmosphere, sorry. So unless they built a huge vacuum chamber theycould run for miles in, probs easier to just go to the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like how you punctuate your incoherent accusations with something condescending like people who think rockets dont work in a vacuum. Its telling, and you wanna know why? Indicates you have no proof to refute anything with.

      <p>
       Also explain the behaviour of this debris being kicked up at liftoff.

       Still waiting for you to really consider that one.

       Must have never been on a beach, and I'm sure that's not sand. But I'm really glad you linked that video as it's one of my favorites. Why? Because I(and almost every other human) can jump higher than that on Earth! Redchevron is spot on. You haven't really thought about this have you? In 1/6th g he should be able to bunny hop 6 times higher than an Earth bunny hop. Nothing about that video sells the moon landings, infact it disproves them.  Last vid looks like it could be a mineature. Wobble wobble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, look at his hops, remember only being held down by 1/6th the force - should be able to jump 6 times higher than Earth - barely gets off the ground. Sleep tight.

       Consider what about it though? The dust on the Moon behaves like youd expect in low gravity and in a vacuum. It doesnt behave like youd expect it to on Earth.

       And they could barely move on Earth in those suits and theyre bouncing and hopping around like they weigh almost nothing on the Moon.

      <p>
       And whats your point? They arent able to jump as easily because the suits are cumbersome. They do bounce around like theyre 70lbs though. They arent
       <em>
        barely able to move
       </em>
       like they were on Earth in those suits.

       It’s not the men who are called on by their country to do their duty that are to blame for anything. He said in an interview at the time it was the right decision. And it seems the defence of the US was the right decision at the time. The right decision now is to come clean. But the astronaughts did the job they were asked to do as would many of us.

       There are also photos of the Lunar landing sites taken by telescopes and moon orbiters. You can Google it and look at them. Why on earth would Russia or China play along if there were no landing sites? They would have released pictures of the empty landing sites, except the landing sites are there.

       It is the reason most of the time though. Can't just make up something new for the sake of it. The truth is the truth. But go on believing that the government is powerless if it helps you sleep at night.

       It's all laid out clear as day in 1984, the governments are all in collusion keeping the masses under control. It's merely a facade that they are against each other, they all benefit from working together and using the fake conflict as a means to their ends.

       Do i as well, by pointing out the basic comprehension errors people seem to have about physics, fluid dynamics, computers etc?

       I thought this sub was about
       <em>
        intellectual honesty and exposing frauds
       </em>
       of a conspiratorial nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying rockets wont work in space is easily disproved, and i took the time to explain several times in long careful explanations why they work in vacuum
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       than in atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am i also just some NASA shill or whatever?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is extremely frustrating because scientists and engineers call bullshit on the official narrative of 9/11
       <em>
        and then offer scientifically valid reasons
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       In this thread its literally people linking to videos on flat Earth forums made by people who grossly misunderstand Newtonian physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not quantum mechanics or advanced metallurgical science or anything even hard. Something as basic as why rockets will work in a vacuum is deemed "shilling for NASA".

       The problem is that the evidence supporting this theory is scant and no theorist has managed to paint a full picture that explains every piece of evidence. It's much more likely that the landing actually happened.

       In this very thread a guy calls out how they couldn’t have controlled a remote camera on the moon.

      <p>
       3 seconds of googling later and I replied that the round trip time to the moon is ~2.0 seconds. That’s well within remote control range.

      <p>
       He was wrong, caught wrong, and corrected.

      <p>
       Do you think he changed his mind? Did he see the error of his ways?

       No. He’s still here posting, cocksure as ever.

       Let's try this.  If at some point in the future, a NASA probe takes a photo of the remaining items from the Apollo 11 moon landing, what will you give us?  Money or property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I think unless you put something up or have something at stake you will also label any evidence as faked or doctored or coerced.  You have no proof that the thread is brigaded.  Maybe other people are jsut interested in the topic.  But you went right to brigading without proof.  So show us some server logs or a flood of fake accounts.  Prove the thread is being brigaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because right now the conspiracy is you guys trying to convince other people that something very important never happened.  So prove that it never happened.  Provide me with some proof a photo, audio recording, etc) that Armstrong was on earth when he was purported to be on the moon.

       What evidence do you have that NASA is military ? The entire point of Eisenhower creating NASA was as an attempt at deescalating the space aspect of the space race with Russia (really the IVBM race). There's extensive documentation of NASA as an independent organization outside the jurisdiction of the Joint Chiefs and their respective branches. I mean the Navy and Army were heavily invovled with early rocket development. Why even pretend to have a fake civillian front if there was zero public controversy of these military programs?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you declare that it should be obvious they're military, can you rlaborate on what facts support your claim? Or is it just your personal opinion? What facts do you have?

       The search terms you might want to start with are "full spectrum dominance". The United States military means to own outer space, or not lose their ownership of outer space. The exact situation is top secret and the most pertinent facts are not available to us little guys.
      </p>

       My personal opinion is they
       <em>
        own

       it now, since a long time, and for the foreseeable future.

       I am aware of the concept.  But that's not specific evidence that NASA is military. And if that's why you think it's de facto military, then isn't every organization in America de facto military because it is part of the full spectrum? If that's what you think, then it's still possible for NASA to be de jure civilian as it appears.

       NASA is a civilian agency which the military shares rocket knowledge with.

       Why is this near the top, i thought we've cleared away the hoax moon landing already.
Here's one argument to prove that we did go to the moon: the Soviets checked the Apollo's radio transmission source and did confirm that it was coming from the moon. If not, the Soviets would have clearly taken the chance to blow NASA's cover.

       You sure that’s proof ?  There are plenty of shared secrets that they wouldn’t blow on each other. I’m sure they had enough on the soviets to keep them quiet on the issue.

       Here's my honest take on the issue. We DID go to the Moon but what we saw there could not be televised publicly (either alien structures or ancient man made bases) so we made a film set to create a fascade.

       Oh absolutely. If you enjoy that, I urge you heavily to get into the Tesla VS. Edison/jp Morgan conspiracy, which gets further into coils, maybe zero point, etc. Basically he saw a complete reality where all energy demands were met. He said he had the technology. When he died, by the time the doorman was able to phone police, the FBI was already raiding his house. This was the most brilliant man of all time, one of the most famous after he lit up the world fair with AC. And he's misremembered.

       Yeah. Is a bit disheartening, but that's the conspiracy. Apparently it was was all live and broadcasted back to command. Yet the audio is cut out during the section in reference. Not to mention the 12 (I believe) rolls of film lost from the Apollo missions. Just too much shadiness. Sorry I got your hopes up with the reference!

       They are a government agency that WE pay for. An ounce of dishonesty, for any reason, is unacceptable. And this is the problem, the bar is set so low and “users” are tripping over themselves to excuse criminal activity. They lie and deceive and take your money and the response is “well sometimes they may be truthful”. Do you see how toxic and enabling this can be? Would any of us continue to give money to liars in our personal relationships? If so, you are an enabler. Raise the bar, for NASA and for every other corrupt agency that reaches into our pocket and fails to deliver on promises.

       Lol and his "proof" is that the Soviets "checked the Apollo's radio transmission source."  Ok dipshit, where's this telemetry data, which couldn't possibly be fabricated?

       Not to mention to believe in the fairy tale known as the moon landing you must believe that the Soviets, upon realizing that the US made it to the moon, scrapped their entire lunar program and said "Fuck it. If you ain't first you're last."

       One of the theories is that we
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       indeed go to the moon, we just used
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       more advanced technology to get there than was publicly disclosed in the 1960's.

       Yeah I get that perspective, but I also feel like downvoted can bury content and get people to disregard your opinion. Doesn't matter as much in a sub of this size tho.

       All the ones I remember browsing when I was younger are gone. They are still out there, just search whatever you are looking for + 'forum' and you'll find something. Just alot less volume of posts/users than it used to be.

       I have no doubt mass media companies (like Condé Nast, the subsidiary of Advanced Publications that owns Reddit) have an interest in consolidating internet discourse, they've done a pretty good job at it so far.

      <p>
       Is even go as far as to argue the entire format of reddit, with the points and the sub threads within each post that reward snarky one liners and generally gutless content and comments are part of the plan too.

       You're right, I was asking for more attention at that point. Welp, I may not subscribe entirely on this theory but it is informative on why others believe this. Better have discussion than no discussion at all.

       You must be new to this then, that's been the prevailing theory for decades.

       Also, it likely wasn't alien tech...we've been researching anti-grav stuff since the 1920's. It's almost definitely human in origin.

       Nazi type shit but yeah if you take V.A belts I really don't know if we really did go? I mean why fake the footage then? Wouldn't it be easier to fake that anti grav craft as a rocket?

       According to the recent declassified JFK files, the Soviets knew all about the JFK assassination and didn't say shit either. This black-and-white view of the Cold War is certainly wrong. Yet your comment is at the top of a pinned post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Different decision one can have different incentives. There was a space race and the Soviet’s were desperate to save face. Seems to me that they would say something.

       The way I see it both the soviets and the US were playing for the same side. The Cold War forced every nation in the world to pick one of the two super-powers to protect them, and when the USSR fell half the world was on US hands and the other half had to accept their supremacy. You can't come up with a more brilliant way to conquer the world than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just my two cents, but when you see it that way it doesn't come as a surprise that the USSR wouldn't say anything about the fake landing.

       Sarcasm aside, both the US and USSR sent probes to the moon. Radio trans could come from an unmanned craft (recorded or received and re-transmitted) or could be bounced off of the moon itself.

       Out of interest, assuming the Russians could detect the direction and strength of the signal, how could they tell the difference between the radio signal coming from the moons surface versus coming from low moon orbit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d suggest they wouldn’t be able to, so this alone doesn’t seem like proof of a moon landing. At best it’d be proof that they were positioned near the moon.

       That’s nonsense. They could position themselves directly in line of the supposed landing site but in low orbit. Remember, the moon is nearly 250,000 miles away - there’s no way any triangulation could have that level of granularity over such a huge distance.

       Not precisely, there’s a margin of error. Even cell tower triangulation which are only a few miles from you can only triangulate a cell phone to 50 metres.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider the distance to the moon - 238,900 miles - if the craft was orbiting 900 miles above the moon then the difference in signal strength between something 238,900 miles away and something 238,000 miles away would be incredibly minuscule.

       The reason they didn't blow their cover is because if the States didn't go to the moon, and indeed COULDN'T go to the moon, and such a space race is ridiculous and expensive, and your people are starving... Why expose it? Let them have their fake propaganda victory. Save it as blackmail. Besides, losing an impossible race means they can quit wasting resources on the fight.

       One possible reason why Russia never blew the whistle about the Apollo missions is that apparently we've had a treaty with them since the mid-60's to give them wheat. Apparently the Soviets were having trouble feeding their own people. So why would they bite the hand that's feeding them, literally?

       I am curious to ask: If this subreddit supposedly supports and upholds free expression of thought, then why are we seeing constant banning and removal of arguments?
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly did not read too much of the thread, and may have not taken in on an/the issue, but why was zionixt banned? Why are we fighting and banning over what seems to just be conflicts WHICH ARE TO BE EXPECTED in a subreddit like this? Are we just calling him an idiot because he had attempted to take hold of an argument for longer than 3 comments, and had been going on in full swing?
      </p>

       He was trolling every single rational argument with pre scripted debunks using well known shill tactics. Such as “there’s a very easy explanation”. “I can see you dang have a grasp on ...”.  “This is something a school boy would understand etc etc.  I’m fairly sure his name is Cameron and he is a shill for nasa on many sites.

      <p>
       I'm sorry, but in order to succeed in a civilized argument or conflict, you must provide objectively non-debunk-able evidence if you wish to enforce your claim, or at least some form of real math/real interview/real video or article that is NOT blatantly biased.

       I see where you are coming from in regards to 'destabilizing subs,' however he had only caused a stir amongst
       <em>
        your group

       that proposes that the moon landing was a hoax. That was the only 'stir' or 'destabilization' that had occurred as to what I have seen in the comment section.

       Was his username elsewhere, just made the call because no amount of evidence will stop the tactics of a paid shill. And yes I truly believe that, so what’s the point. It’s like trying to get in a nightclub when your names not in. Only way is to walk away or fight.  I fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hasn’t even watched the documentary, that was meant to be discussed. What’s your take on that ?And Yes I don’t care calling out shills paid to stop free speech is what I’ll do.

      <p>
       And I am more than willing to back up anything with links or videos and expert opinion. As I did if you read other posts. But anything that gets posted will be ridiculed, including opinions of the director of hassleblad cameras Plus five or six minions commenting on his post.

       He did well he disrupted the thread. As we knew many others would.
      </p>

       As for pre scripted. Yes a pre prepared list of debunks. For everything. I mean everything. Why not read through and see how many there are. No one. But no one can do all of that unless they are paid to do so.  I researched this for a few months and I don’t feel any need to list anything for a forum I’m quite happy having a discussion.

       You researched it. Noted: but what is your proof? All you say is "scripted, scripted, scripted. I studied this, but I'm not showing you anything," which is a blatant indicator of you not wanting to show me anything because you can't find it/the proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying you have not studied anything, nor am I saying that you are retarded--I am saying that you have provided
       <em>
        absolutely no proof, no references, no quotes, and no evidence
       </em>
       regarding what I had previously asked. All you are doing is asking me to look at your previous posts (actually, in your own words, telling me to read 'other posts') while avoiding the real work of finding evidence. I will not believe a single claim you have provided here unless you do so. If not, so be it--you will have proven that you are only basing this on opinion and devout belief of a conspiracy theory.

       Ok so there is a link as to how the lunar rover has to withstand massive temperature variations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is a debunking price on how there are no temperature variations

       <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/pseudoastro.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/apollo-moon-hoax-huge-temperature-variation-claims/amp/">
        debunk temp flux
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see, I don’t even have to use sites of anyone else’s opinion debunking it. It’s plain as say to see. One minute things have to withstand massive temperatures. The next minute it doesn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is it this is just one google search on one topic.

       Fact is it doesn’t hurt to ask for proof or actually watch the documentary in discussion does it ?  That was my main beef to be honest.  I’ll post you some other bits. Not other people’s opinions unless they are considered experts.

       More than a photo a minute. But there were two astronaughts they say ?  Yes but on Apollo 11 5 of Neil Armstrong. So he was taking most of it.  And I can provide you a link where he keeps saying he had to get “back to work”. Not much work between taking photos on a constant basis ?

       That’s enough to e getting on with. This is just off the top of my head. But anymore on anything else I can try and back up I’ll happily do so. There’s more on Kubrick but I think that could possibly be considered co incidental.

       Look:
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what? I have genuinely decided that I now don't care. I will respect your belief and why you believe it, but I just cannot take up the effort of leading another long-term back and fourth argument that will both not benefit my confidentiality or my life in
       <em>
        any way
       </em>
       , and will also evidently not go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live your life. I don't care at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying you are correct, nor that you are 100% wrong, nor am I giving you leeway for you to call me a 'shill' working for NASA, nor am I declaring you a victory, nor am I giving you an opportunity to brag about a supposed win, either. If you are going to brag, give them this link of the thread. I simply do not care enough anymore to continue bickering about a topic that is only of slight interest to me at the moment, as I can't give up time for study of a side topic that goes too deep into detail right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for advice,
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek to improve your writing skills. The difficulty of reading your first response was (un)surprisingly high, and I couldn't even tell a quarter of the time what you were referring to as you lacked punctuation in several points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually provide evidence when you make a claim. Don't spurt out a fuzzy estimate as a fact--you will be destroyed in an argument when someone who cares enough comes by. Also, don't present an opinion in an enforcing manner in high passion while also being backed with nothing as a first comment, it degrades your first-appearance on people and will only cause further firefight in a conflict that may form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be obnoxious. It only makes things worse, and only works as a cheap and unreliable tactic to madden and build up emotion in a potential opposer, distracting them.

       I do not believe the landing was a hoax, nor will I ever. Such is my standpoint, and I am not planning to look at it otherwise--over my life, I have seen viable proofs as to why it must not be a hoax. Please, don't try to refute this; I will not care, nor will many else.

       Because this subreddit is not a place for free thought it's a place to discuss anything anti mainstream. I can't post a single comment on a thread ever in the last few years without being instantly calling me a Jew, claiming I'm a shill, and flaming me for not agreeing. This sub loves to pretend it's full of independent thinkers but the truth couldn't be further

       This is exactly the notion I have been getting from this subreddit as of yet. It is unfortunate that there is such a place with such goals. However this I believe is only to be expected, as there will be many who hold the belief that, regardless of how blatantly backward their theory is according to objective non-refutable evidence, they are of the 'free thinkers,' and will pursue to push their belief and only be
       <em>
        encouraged
       </em>
       by the rules that speak of free expression of thought--while such is the co.plete opposite and all that is enforced is whether these 'snowflakes' feel good or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not come across such a place with rules that only suppress the truth found by means of objective evidence (which the devout conspirators seem to feel obliged to say it is false regardless, making resistance useless), since that truth may cause heavy dispute, allowing the suppression to occur.

       There is nothing wrong with skepticism and disagreement. It's important to recognize, however, that government-paid commenters do frequent this sub and take control of many threads. Sometimes they do their best to debunk conspiracy theorist comments. Sometimes they play both sides, posting lousy arguments and poorly-sourced info, just so they can then "debunk" their own post. And of course there are all the other forum disruption techniques. They are professionals and they are very good at it, and it really hurts the dialogue here and the search for truth.

       I see where you are coming from, but in my eyes the skepticism at times is simply childish. Not all of it, by any means, but some of the accusations made toward those who provide credible sources are outright unreasonable and at times shows a selective bias toward the info given.
      </p>

       You may have been giving a generic possibility, but where and how had you determined this government activity to be going on? I'm talking both agreeing parties and disagreeing parties.

       It’s super recognizable to authentic users. I’m actually starting to think the more they try to shit on the sub the more they highlight how deep and close the deception is to home. Every day those with money and resources are trying to shape our reality for their benefit. Once you recognize there is a fight you can start swinging.

       It’s just insane how pervasive it is. They’re very brazen about it too. Manipulating vote counts and comments in ways that just scream inorganic.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the information is available to discover that these disinformation campaigns are underway and have been for years.
      </p>

       The absolutely frustrating thing is that there really is no way to prevent infiltration and degradation of truth seeking communities.

       Its too simplistic to see it as an act of evil, if you consider the real threat of a possible pre emptive strike by the USSR dropping a nuclear attack from space giving no time or warning for a counter strike. Something had to be done.

       It seems plausible there was a real effort to make a rocket that could reach the moon. Given Gus Grisolm was quite vocal in his opinions of the project, I see no reason he would be hanging lemons on a fake project. It just seems to me eventually they were faced with the fact of failing in front of the World (oh but at least we got some ICBMs out of it). Or fake it.
      </p>

       I still wonder why such prominent figures would decide to take part in the “mockumentary” dark side of the moon, just for shits and giggles.  It sails too close to the truth.

       I love that conspiracists obsess on this issue, but ignore the fact that it was literally impossible to fake the moon footage. It was technologically simpler to put a man on the moon than to fake the moon footage at that point in time.

       Talking about shadows, the shadows on the moon from one object (or person) compared to another, should always, without exception, run parallel with one another and never intersect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do a lot of NASA's photos,
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q5XF6bI">
        for instance, this one
       </a>
       have intersecting shadows, for like you and I both say, could not physically exist on the moon. There are over 100 official NASA photos that have this impossibility.

      <p>
       How do you explain that?

       Also that video is complete garbage, he is assuming what NASA say they did use for video technology is true and just proclaims to be an expert, he is an idiot and a failed film director.

       The "explanation" that the shadows were not parallel because of the way the light falls on the Moon’s natural topography is unproven garbage.

       Multiple "debunkers" have tried and always fail.

       Even National Geographic did a television special and mightily embarrassed themselves, they went to a California desert at night to “simulate” the alleged conditions on the moon, brought in one electrical light to simulate the sun, and basically said,
       <em>
        “See! The shadows of the two people standing near one another do intersect in our moon simulation!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem you see is their shadows in their stupid demonstration intersected because their “moon simulation” was lit with electrical light!  All the while they claimed that this proved that the moon missions were real, when their very demonstration proved that the moon missions were fake instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       In their “moon simulation”, with electrical light, the shadows did intersect, just like some of the “moon” pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apollo pictures were taken with electrical light, not sunlight, meaning they were taken on earth, fact.

       You say "prove me wrong." Technically, you're the one that carries the burden of proof, but we'll ignore that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence that were on the moon is so overwhelming that doubt is unreasonable at this point. You can shine a laser at the moon and the plate we put there reflects your signal back. That could not have been placed robotically at the time. And that is just one example of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shadow shit you and others bring up is the result of people not knowing how shadows work.

       The Moon Landing was an obvious hoax, I can't believe any sane person believes in the official narrative on this one. It clearly shows how brainwashed sheeps most people are and how gullible and imbecile can a person be to believe totally illogical , sometimes contradicting things in their heads. Orwell warned us.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Oxygen/Fuel Issue
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck did they have enough fuel to go back and forth, most of their fuel was oxygen, so if they burn most of their fuel, how do they breathe?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a fucking movie where they make out an air filter from a fucking diaper. In reality there is just no air.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The lunar lander is a piece of garbage scrap metal made out of tinfoil, it insults the intelligence of critical thinkers to even assume that that shit can land on anywhere, let alone take off.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Communication: In order to send out radio signals just around the globe, you have to have fucking 45 KM long antennas. How the fucking hell can a ship that is not more than perhaps 11 meter long can transmit radio waves 300,000 KM away?
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let alone have the power to it, they make radio towers 100 meter high just to transmit nationwide radio, and they consume thousands of watts of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did a shit craft like that have batteries to have that amount of power to transmit radio so far. Let alone the lenght required for an antenna to do that.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       See just 5 fucking seconds  f thinking about it reveals that it was a hoax, yet people here still believe that it was real.

       I'd not call it crimes against humanity, since it's just a hoax. Perhaps a fraud but we have no way of knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the space footage is already faked, the international space station is just a joke, and they even have live feed from there but for some reason after a few hours they repeat the footage. Probably the animation crew is on low budget, can't fake too much footage.

       Hey! you and me. (see some of my other posts) Don't know if mine was supposed to be the original though. I saw it in England. The build was solid enough, but only for terrestrial activity. Like a lifeboat that can overturn, a mini-sub, armoured personnel vehicle or military heli.

       Sending a signal through 200km or so of air doesn't take as much power as sending one deep into the oceans.  Who knew?

       Yeah but let's put it in perspective, the space vacuum is not that much cleaner than the ocean, about 2 or maybe 3 times, and let's not forget the Earth's magnetic pole and the solar radiation which is also a big obstacle outside.

       So you need a 45KM lenght antenna to transmit globally from 1 station (13000 KM), so how long antenna do you need to transmit to 300,000 KM?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you manage to send off a signal to the spacecraft, how do they send the signal back?

       Well higher frequencies use even higher power. It only affects bit rate and power consumption.
      </p>

       I am not talking about how quick they can communicate, but whether they can communicate at all.

      <p>
       Radio towers that use high MHZ frequencies have entire power plants near them to draw power from.

If you engage past a certain point most of the good stuff is no longer visible. Regardless you’re not wrong brother, the moon landing is the most obvious of all hoaxes.

      <p>
       I don't know. Probably the software is configured that way. Regular cell phones have GPS in them, so if they go out of coverage, they would be "shut down", by the software , who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe they are really outside the coverage, and a satellite is basically just a drone flying above you that will relay it to the nearest radio tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GPS system can also be explained with radio tower triangulations, no need for satellites.

       You can transmit from a portable radio incredible distances.

       Well if you want to transmit a radio wave from 1 beacon, globally, then you do need a 45km antenna which was that used by the US Navy in that link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course in practical reasons we have multiple cell towers, and we use Skywaves to broadcast globally, so multiple-hops of towers could work on the planet.
      </p>

      <p>
       However if you want to broadcast outside the planet you need like a powerful antenna array to send signals outside, which they did use allegedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is how did they send back the signal from the Apollo 11 CSM back to Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       For that they also need a 45 KM long antenna and the ship was only 11 meter long. Did they lay cables on the moon to broadcast? Did they had thousands of kilowatts of power to do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how much power they could generate from the fuel, but I know that radio towers need like thousands of watts of power for just a daily radio broadcast nationally.

       At Aerospace I witnessed a ridiculous object - associated with claim of a fantastical voyage. A fantastical voyage that, as a kid (like the vast majority of boys) I so wanted to believe in; which was why I was there in the first place. Piece-by-piece a cynic was slowly being formulated in my analytical male mind.

       You know, I visited British Aerospace for an exhibition when I was a kid. I can't remember if the pod was a mock up or supposedly the original on tour, but I just thought "this is utter shit".

      <p>
       Casting aside what we may otherwise assume about the hostility of space (extreme radiation or particulate traveling at speeds with no resistance - like a total coverage rice Gatling gun) and even ignoring fuel-weight ratios and all the rest, there is a nother elephant-in-the-room: YOU CANNOT EMPLOY COMBUSTIVE PROPULSION TO STEER OR ALTER VELOCITIES IN SPACE. THERE IS NOTHING TO PUSH AGAINST. It's called space for a fucking reason. It's void! which creates even more conceptual issues. I believe energy jumps instantaneously between matter, which means distance is no issue and negates b/s theories like speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I proposed this once before and, not only did I receive the erroneously dangerous advice that I should have used Goolag, the respondent offered up the "official" info for me. This is when I got scared. I'm no physicist but I ain't fucking stupid. The article was shocking. It used cyclical argument (referencing it's own unfounded initial claims to prop up and carry forward the case) mixed up with unwavering authoritarian expert-in-the-field delivery. I'm supposedly uneducated, yet the fraud was unnervingly obvious. That's when I realised there were all these fucking dangerous people graduating from school, only to then prostitute themselves for money while propagating ridiculous notions upon the unsuspecting public. At some point I got fucking scared and suddenly wanted to wake up from my coma, where no-one alive could reach in to me. To this day, I still don't recall the accident that left me this way.

       And the cold of course. They say that it's extremely low pressure and extremely cold, some scientists have theorized that  if a human would go out, all of the body fluids would be sucked out due to the low pressure, and die a horrible death.
      </p>
      <p>
       They later retracted that theory (a lot of damage control shills on youtube now) and explained that in fact that was not true and people would just freeze to death, but completely ignored the pressure issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course theoretically they could make a ship cold resistant (though I dont know how since if you put a metal in a cold freezer it freezes and then it can be shattered in pieces, cold makes the metal very weak and can be shattered like a stone)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet they have allegedly also went out into space, in freakin plastic suits. How the hell did that keep them warm and pressurized? It's a complete nonsense.

       Holy shit I haven't even thought of that one. Suppose you could push yourself out from the atmosphere using the Earth's atmosphere to push yourself out as a counter-force, and then just glide until you reach the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how do you propell yourself back? If you glide towards the Moon with little or no friction, once you reach it, you would just orbit around it forever, and you could not come back from there, since there is no atmosphere to push yourself against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice observations, I am sure there are many more plotholes, and even engineers who call themselves experts, haven't sat down 10 minutes to think about these absurdities. No wonder people are so brainwashed, they believe in illogical things and don't even realize it.

       Yeah, there are so many discrepancies and we could keep adding theories all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       What bugs me is that they must have some insight as to what exists at the threshold upper-atmosphere if they were even foolish enough to attempt to send anything up there: more likely some sort of gaseous balloon than any intelligence-insulting rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to that no-atmospheric-resistance-to-propel-against situation, an astute mind can pull apart all their convoluted cyclical reasoning (referencing their own unproven theories to propose further theories). I just had an epiphany: Maybe that's what the initial space hoaxes were for. If cornered while bullshitting us with "PSYentism" they will often self-reference data claimed to be from such extraterrestrial endeavours. In reality, it's nothing more than an information firewall - a licence to continue to pile on the bullshit. They hold all the cards.
      </p>
      <p>
       What upsets and unnerves me is, I looked up to all such "experts" when I was a kid. The people who are the most uncritical are the ones who come from "higher" education. I've come to realise it employs time constraints so no-one in attendance can do any more than accept and regurgitate the text books in order to pass with the highest accreditation. Ask questions in school and you will not finish your assigned tasks and will fail. Being the type of analytical kid I was, I felt that even in (what everyone now refers to as) high-school.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have another theory that - if we are pulling in particulate from somewhere (now, I don't know what's supposedly in space aside from more likely void that may not sustain matter at all, so can't even uphold this part of my theory) so that it becomes elemental fuel - transformed to fire as it hits the resistance of atmosphere and to combusts through friction - we're probably also surrounded by a halo of fire (while not necessarily terrestrial "flame" fire). Likely all those stars are the same as us if, indeed, they are planets like us and not something else entirely. So, despite me suggesting we are alone, we may not be. Yet, due to the nature I describe, every sphere is in perfect isolation, with no means of escape. Maybe consider "as above, so below" in that all cells are independent.
      </p>
      <p>
       To others: Don't pick my simple theories apart. I can find holes myself which need plugging. I'm merely suggesting for others to not listen to these bastards and try to realise concepts for themselves - as good brain exercise if nothing else. Quite frankly you could do better than them. They're still making excuses and moving goalposts for holes they cannot plug. Whereas, we're not pushing an agenda or protecting any commercial investment so our minds are free to roam.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few more theories but they get very philosophical about the relationship of space and planets/moons/stars/suns to our planet and us; even concepts regarding the illusion of form. I'm really not good at describing anything with words, especially when knowing many words are corrupt. I also had next-to-no formal English education: I was to be factory fodder.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Even my adoptive mum attributed to me having a messed up vocabulary - where she didn't know the meanings of words she thought she did because of the context she'd heard them used in. After a few embarrassing moments where I'd parroted her usage in public I became extremely nervous about opening my mouth.]
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result I wave my arms around a lot and scribble diagrams in a conceptual manner. I can only do this outside of VR, in real-life(tm) - and, for increasingly apparent reasons, I ain't putting my face or voice on the web. My brain really hurts trying to convey anything written or in type, but type is all I can do here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's more than enough about why I struggle to communicate online - resulting in frustration due to all the potential conversations I want to have with realised people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for engineers etc. It happens in all industry that isn't critical to the day-to-day running of Swiss-Papal commerce.

       "Compartmentalisation" is one very critical keyword. Split everyone up and no-one knows the truth. They don't have to be co-conspirators. They simply have to believe the data that they are receiving from elsewhere is what it purports to be. I had a big argument with a neighbour who swears he had a job communicating with satellites. When pushed for evidence of the origin of the data his cognitive dissonance went into overdrive, he first started nervously mocking and when I wouldn't back down he got bloody angry and that was the beginning of the end of our neighborliness.

       Just a few points to quash any misinterpretation:-
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I stated "some sort" and "gaseous", to imply that they might use a changing mix of gasses and materials that would maintain safe equilibrium yet still allow it to rise, stay and fall through a controlled mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've ruled out rockets completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep referring to language tricks. It's called "school" for the behavioural pattern it relies upon. It's also called "acad[a]emia" because it's a continuation of the Assyrian/Akkadian empire and akkad+aemia = The Empire's blood. Doesn't that just say it all? That's where the Assyrian bullshit begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yep. those last points refer to the sort of direction I was going in. The illusion of form comes into play here as the chain of instantaneous energy transfer between nodes gives an illusion of position. You've reminded me I need to watch "Flatland" again. I have a feeling it's a lot deeper in notion than I initially thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Just checked, and it seems there a lots of animated renditions. I think it'll be safer to listen to the audiobook.]
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that this energy we call light - which is the electric source of life - is bound to the magnetic by laws that not only bend it to presume a visual position within our eye, but those same laws consistently place it physically in position (the concept of touch is also only comprised of the same two forces) so our perception paints a whole sensory concept of where things are. I know I've tried to explain this and done it really poorly. It sort of begins to leave the limitations of language behind. Knowing that the world has everything we need in nature - as we are a physically born extension of it, there are probably specific hallucinogenic plants out there that will trip you out and show you example of something like this, yet you still won't be able to explain what you thought you saw/experienced when you get back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget the quantum entanglement, as our masters have a suitably distracting proposal using similar language.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're actually talking about a whole lot of nothing here. I mean that literally. That's why it's difficult. We haven't factored in time yet. What is time? Time creates the concept of space: The difference between "here" and "there" is only determined by the concept we refer to as time. Or is it that the concept of space (distance) creates the perception of time? If "time" (whatever it is) changed, how would we know? It's relative. For argument's sake (in an easy to conceptualise physical sense) if all relationships between all that we refer to as atoms slowed or sped up we wouldn't be any the wiser, since it would apply to all and we wouldn't notice any difference. In which case, what if "time" also bends and ebbs and flows. Time seems to be related to actual physical activity. I can be physically busy, the day is long, I get lots done and still have lots of time to relax afterwards. However, if I sit at a computer, the day is gone in a flash and I can't even justify it with any sort of achievement, while I feel kind of dirty and disappointed in myself.

       And on that note I'm going to fuck off. Goodnight.

       Allright interesting points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think time exists, it's just a mental construct to deal with changing things around us. There is an order to things, things clearly move ahead and not backwards, so there is a direction, but I don't think it can be quantified at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like even the concept of light speed, how do we know it's not a variable and not a constant? Because if the speed of light changes, then that can explain a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact there are now some theories that are gaining tracktion that say that the dark energy in the universe doesn't exist, and in fact we can make up for that error by just assuming that the speed of light is a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it's crazy how much we don't even know about the world we live in.

       If you ignore their bullshit about what the Sun is (I surmise it's plasma - pure energy, and there's a reason your blood uses the same word, as the concept of the living you is your blood; not your body, not your brain. I guess that's for another subReddit) and add to that my theory that there is no speed of light and plasma jumps instantaneous between materials - the void of space between everything supposedly out there is likely -273K and, thus, hostile to all transient material. In fact, the true definition of "absolute death".

       This diatribe uses a rather typical ploy of attempting to insult the intelligence of those who oppose the poster's opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that whatever an amateur armchair denialist thinks using poorly reasoned maths and physics, the fact remains that the Chinese and Russians who were during this phase intensely unfriendly to the western world, would have to have colluded on this "hoax". They would have been fully aware monitoring telemetry and radio signals that the endeavour was a hoax and would have shouted it from the rooftops. Particularly the Russians who had already stolen a march on the US putting the first satellite and man into space and would have their noses put firmly out of joint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, those landing on the moon set up two mirrors which work even today to reflect back a laser signal to record the distance of the moon. To lie about this would extremely risky as the equipment used is not beyond the technology of any half-civilised country who would be only too happy to point out that this simply wasn't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, and for me the biggest piece of evidence, is the sheer number of people who would have had remained silent in this matter. In the decades since the landing, there has been ample opportunity for whole groups of NASA and associated employees to come clean on this. No amount of death threats would contain them. To assume that otherwise just underestimates the intensity of integrity of whistleblowers (Snowden, Assange for example) and the an overestimation of the abilities of the intelligence services who themselves would ALL have to be in on the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The need of the OP to liberally employ swear words in his arguments is a method frequently used by those whose argument is irrational or badly researched. "You can make up for poor logic and reasoning by intensive profanity." At times the more eloquent swearers among us can even sound impressive, but they are still irrational. As the late Christopher Hitchens once said, "Beware the irrational, however seductive."*

       why does a video that is routinely downvoted into the abyss here have 142 points rn? why are there so many people dedicated to defending nasa? why is there no real photo of earth from "space"? why do people think rockets work in a vacuum? why did it take like 80 years for rocket technology to advance even to the point of being able to launch and then land again without fucking exploding but that just coincidentally coincided with the advancement in cgi needed to fake such a thing? why would the us and russia go through all the trouble of teaming up and pretending to "race" in order to make people think the moon is a physical object? how many babies has buzz aldrin eaten to sustain his life up till now?

       Far more people in several countries around the globe were involved in the LIBOR conspiracy.  That affected trillions of dollars in transactions and probably you personally.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Libor underpins approximately $350 trillion in derivatives.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It was only exposed because there's money involved.  What's the incentive to spill the beans about a moon conspiracy?  And how many people would know?  The thousands of people that worked on the project typically have a small function and see their part of the mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest, most plausible explanation is usually correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.  Decades ago, NASA launched six successful manned missions to the moon, involving detaching a vehicle, landing successfully on the moon, launching from the moon and reattaching to a vehicle, and returning safely to earth.  Even once bringing a car to drive around on the moon, and all with 1960's technology.  All original video and planes for the lunar lander, some of the most important historical documents in the history of mankind, were not archived, but were mistakenly or carelessly destroyed.  No human since has ever traveled past low earth orbit, and manned space exploration ended with the last moon mission over 40 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or B:  It was faked, and a combination of rewards and threats bought people's silence.

       Yep, but it involved massively more people and multiple countries and affected virtually everyone on the planet who borrowed, lended, invested, or speculated.  It probably would still be a secret except for every winning trade there is a loser.  There were no losers involved in the moon landing, they only stood to gain. Much easier to keep a secret.  How many people were involved in abusing and promoting abuse within the catholic church, all over planet earth?  How many hundreds of years passed before it became a scandal and open knowledge?

        As you're well aware, no telescope on Earth can see the leftover descent stages of the Apollo Lunar Modules or anything else Apollo-related. Not even the Hubble Space Telescope can discern evidence of the Apollo landings. The laws of optics define its limits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hubble's 94.5-inch mirror has a resolution of 0.024″ in ultraviolet light, which translates to 141 feet (43 meters) at the Moon's distance. In visible light, it's 0.05″, or closer to 300 feet. Given that the largest piece of equipment left on the Moon after each mission was the 17.9-foot-high by 14-foot-wide Lunar Module, you can see the problem.

       You CANNOT see the landing sites with a telescope from Earth. There are no telescopes on Earth - Or near Earth (Hubble) that can see the landing sites, they're too small and too far away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to see the landing sites with what's presently available is to take the camera/telescope closer to the moon, which they have done with fly-byes.

       I mentioned the conspiracy within the catholic church to perpetuate child abuse.  That also was much more vast and lasted much longer before it came to light.  And again, these other conspiracies were extremely damaging to the victims, which would engender animosity and a desire to speak out. Much more simple to cover up a hoax where all the people involved can benefit.

       Whose life would be at risk?  Statistically, you are more safe building a rocket and lander with 1960's technology, putting what is literally a tinfoil-covered lander on the surface of the moon, then launching it from the moon back into orbit to dock with the reentry vehicle, and finally slash down in the ocean somewhere.  It's perfectly safe!  It's vastly more dangerous to take a space shuttle into low earth orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there 6 moon missions?  Was there a lot more for NASA to learn? Those weren't completely useless?  Why does every single administration claim we will go to mars?  Why have there been multiple private endeavors to get people into space?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's odd how people who defend the moon landings love to point out how absolutely useless manned exploration is and how there's just no reason for it.

       Not flying to the moon!  Flying to the moon in insanely flammable 1960's technology is perfectly safe!  Or did you not know that? They died on the ground during practice when a little electric spark quickly destroyed their highly flammable capsule which was also full of pure oxygen. Apparently there was enough cabin overpressure at near sea level (???) that three insanely fit astronauts could not get the door open.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modules that went to the moon had special components to prevent the single spark that would turn them into flaming death traps.

       Interesting aside, commander grissom complained about many aspects of the Apollo mission.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Grissom did complain vociferously about many aspects of the early Apollo program: by hanging a lemon on the faulty Apollo simulator, for example. He also warned in the moments before his death: “How are we going to get to the moon if we can’t even communicate between three buildings?”

       You’re aware that the fire in which your referring to caused massive changes in the Apollo program right? They no longer went with a pure oxygen atmosphere in the CM and also added an interior latch to open the door (those astronauts died due to not having a way to open the door from the inside, not “overpressure” as you claim....have you really never read about that incident in enough detail to realize there was no interior latch for them to use???)
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings up another point though, you clearly believe those astronauts died while practicing for the Apollo missions....why would nasa do all these public practices if their intent was to fake the entire thing? Seems that killing 3 astronauts (they would have to forcibly kill them if they weren’t planning on going, an “accident” really makes zero sense if they have no intention of going) is an uneccesary step in faking a moon landing no?

       The hatch could not be opened supposedly due to cabin pressure:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Immediately after the fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to determine the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere.
        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1">
         The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How could you not do all the prep for a moon mission?  Just the training generated constant pr. And real or fake, you still need to go through all the training and have everyone doing their jobs.  All of the people involved certainly believed there was going to be a moon mission.   The accident killed a commander who was grousing about many aspects of the program and was openly sarcastic about problems that would prevent an actual moon mission.  So there's your conspiracy-minded answer:)

       YES I believe I worded poorly so you misunderstood. They couldn’t open the hatch outward, it opened inward, so the high pressure inside the cabin prevented them being able to open it. Later improvements allowed for outward opening

       Highly misleading
heresjay9 May 2005
Writer/Director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA. He says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately Sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his "backstage" footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast (also on that reel) that was seen by millions, not hidden away in NASA vaults as he implies. And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not faking footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy Sibrel's hacked-up version of it. (He shows you more of the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination than of his "smoking gun".) Sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it. What's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth, destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on innuendo, inexpert assumption, misleading commentary, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence.
      </p>

       Bad science, bad entertainment
ranb4012 June 2005
I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One. The movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups, most not related to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. The video curiously ends with a showing of the Zapruder film. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography, and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against NASA, the astronauts, or American in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoking gun backfires
flyingswan20 October 2006
The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the "whole Earth" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, a response: "Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I'd say is a charming, but weak and gullible argument. What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U.S. government that the moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. Things are nearly never quite what they seem.. Just watch the movie, and I dear say you'll see things a bit different than before."
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, weather data doesn't come from NASA, it comes for met agencies around the world. Second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. Third, far from being "packed with irrefutable evidence", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked. Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims.

       None of you know the facts
sjensen-417 March 2006
Warning: Spoilers
I once also believed that the Americans did not land on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Partly because of this documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much footage from the moon can very well be fake. That is because the could not film there, supposedly, because there was too hot and too cold.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there is the thing about the wind on the flag.....
      </p>
      <p>
       But then there is the big problem: The Astronauts took home kilos of rocks from the moon - about 400 KILOGRAMMES. And the rocks ARE FROM THE MOON. The rocks have been spread around the world to all countries to further science. And there are for a fact from the moon, all laboratories from around the world has confirmed it: The isotopes of the basic elements of the rock could never have come from earth - only the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do all you crack-put-theorists explain that?
      </p>
      <p>
       How come that many professors and astronomers from around all believe that USA did go to the moon??? Can you explain that (the only ones who disbelieve all this are all out off a job, and needs money)

       That comment about Sibrel lying about where he acquired the footage doesn't contain any sources. Having trouble verifying that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good match between cloud patterns from the footage and that date is complete and total nonsense as far I'm concerned. Even so, a match does not somehow undo footage of them staging the shot.

       We've never sent anything up there, including all we suppose ourselves to rely upon - those last-millennia washing machine fantasies with solar panel wings we refer to as "satellites" ;-) - can all be explained away easily. All comms happen under/sea, under/ground and atmospherically transferred - and now we have the air guilds "COMMStrails" to carry/reflect increasing demand, while aiding global socialist techno-slavery. Yeah, you heard me, "COMMSTRAILS"! No bullshit scientism "contrail" excuse for them, nor paranoia-based controlled opposition of "chemtrails"/geoengineering. The reason we have no true blue sky and live in a Thermos(tm) flask - where it's dull and either horribly humid or crazy frozen - are the fucking metal-internet-skies. You wanted it. You got it. Now try to sleep under the enormity of it.

       We can't leave this planet. Earth doesn't work that way. We are an integral part - and extension - of it. We are not a blight. We can do no harm: lying Papal UN CO2 energy-as-a-form-of-control cunts. We are physically born out of Earth, as the magnetic Moon builds it via electrical charge she takes from the Sun. [Yeah, there's a head-fuck for you all. Lucky I'm crypto! - though I'll need to change my writing style soon, else Intel, Goolag and nV's AIs bust my cover!] We didn't physically come from anywhere else (no "annunaki" visitations - d'oh!) we're not going anywhere else and we're alone - which doesn't have to be assumed depressing. Atheistic Jesuit "scientism" is yet another Vatican material religion. Remember, there's a spiritual element to you as well. That's the mystery that has, and will, always entertain and drive us.

       Everyone needs to realise that they have been living in a controlled commercial environment since this now-global empire was once known as the Assyrian empire - before Rome or Britain were amalgamated. we'd seriously all be better of with total amnesia - including the language constructs you believe yourselves to know, yet have layer upon layer of interpretation within: interpretation deployed to deceive.

       Can you? Do you remember how the sun used to appear through atmosphere before 1997? Certainly not diffused around the circumference as it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, you really need to have been aware since 1997 - when they began -  so, as a general indicator, an outdoors type of around the age of 20 at that time and paying attention may have noticed the spraying start filling the blue skies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity? You mean like the rain before it falls? Gravity is resistance, resistance increases the closer to a material centrifugal core you get. The further from that core you are, the less gravity there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't perhaps suppose they would have done the calculations beforehand, do you? You know? in line with EVERY sensible scientific procedure to limit the amount of failure associated with experimentation before actual deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time you go in a plane, see them for yourself. A blanket of shit now exists up there. Again, only if you're old enough to remember what it was like before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, so, you know about thermal currents and all that, right? Also, have you not seen that shit spread out to fine total coverage? It may even be charged to do so, for efficiency. These are assumptions based upon observation. I don't know the composition of the crap. If I did, and I was telling you this stuff, I likely wouldn't have long to live. There's plenty of time-lapse footage out there. Just be careful, because it all comes under the controlled opposition heading of "chemtrails"/"geoengineering" for paranoids who aren't merely idiots who bought the utter shit they are "contrails".
      </p>
      <p>
       As children where I lived we used to look for contrails. They occurred at extremely high altitudes (that you can no longer view) and were never much different to the following example "___" (relative to the pixel width). Whereas, we could see all the regular air traffic fly without any trails at all. For ones that weren't flying low enough to be easily recognisable, dads (when dads were men) used to get their binoculars to see if they'd identified the type of plane correctly, or if they were classic/military planes, considering my dad was ex-military and liked all such "boys" stuff - which is why he was more than happy to take me to to see the supposed lunar module.

       "...remote place planes don't fly"? Who controls all commercial military infrastructure, including who flies the skies? The main culprit isn't passenger traffic. In fact, sprayers over London were never following passenger routes. A lot of what I clocked was FedEx flying over England from their European hub in France, beginning at around 5am.

       How possible is it that aliens started life here on earth as "lets see what happens" project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens much more advanced then our humans at their present state, would not have created so much pain and nonsense for a lets see what happens project. Unless a school child in another dimension we can not see and they certainly can not see us, create the Universe or Universes in a test tube like gas bubbles for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are simple tool makers. We just started to blow each other up with nuclear weapons. Our world leaders from east to west, are puppets of our monetary system, busy filling their own pockets, destroying, controlling and robbing small countries rogue nations with the excuse of terrorism, fear, while shaking their religious books and nuclear sticks at each other. We just started to send cargo to a very close Earth orbit and think that we are space fairing. Our drawings from the caves has just moved to canvasses we hang on our walls we are proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not have a cure for simple flu and many other thousands of diseases like Plague, Ebola, Heart diseases, diabetes, Cancer yet. We are popping anti inflammatory medications like Ibuprofens with horrific side effects all the time. (it effected reduced my cartilage in my joints.) We recently started selling each-other snake oil type very expensive medications and treatments that can treat some diseases but certainly doesn't cure most. Our Doctors study nutrition only about 6–10 hours total. They have no incentive to discuss diet and nutrition with patients. Low insurance reimbursement rates discourage in-depth discussions anyway. Instead, they are forced to see three patients for an average of 20 minutes an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a cost of great deforestation, 46% global warming and using about 400 liters of water we produce a pound of burger patty. We are neurotic about leaky taps but spend about 1000 liters of water to produce 1 liter cows milk. We domesticate and “humanely” kill and eat other non human animals for their taste while ignoring that it is causing us many terrible diseases like diabetes, hearth disease obesity etc. We hate animal cruelty we have RSPCA or SPCA we love some animals as pets still eat them. Genetically we are cousins with the weed in our gardens (50% similarity) We are so very proud of our masonry that we turned it into a religion Free Masonry but we ignore and step on the simple spider that can build very sophisticated structures with practically what is coming out of its back side without any bragging. We destroy bees with our chemicals or for competition, steal their honey without hesitation.

       When I was younger and more ignorant than I am now, I did not have enough knowledge and did not know much about Darwin. I was healthy and blissfully ignorant reading lots of science fiction. Thinking that space was made of fart in a giant, camel like creatures intestines about to be pooped out. There was no Internet and search engines. I watched TV and believed the dumbing propaganda and all the product advertising and placement, believed it all! When somebody said, they are the chosen ones and they have a soul and the best, soul they will go to heaven and live forever. When they said they were promised a certain piece of land on the planet by the God, whom was acting just like an estate agent, I respected their beliefs. I watched the Exorcist and shivered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought they maybe right and I did not have a proof otherwise. Religion offered eternal life to death fearing humans it also gave them somebody like Devil to blame for their wrong doings and God to pray to for their health and wealth or blame for their misfortunes. I did not think religion was a tax heaven business that promised heaven and was being used for political and financial gain. I didn't know that Emperor Constantine declaring Jesus as the new God for the Byzantium empire at around 325 was a good political move. The masses were given a sense of superiority by religion against other inferior belief systems and making it legal and easier to eliminate them to have slaves paid or unpaid. We call them salary earners and workers these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without question sacrifice becoming wholesale. The free demolition of building seven and the billions of dollars insurance claims received people are getting sacrificed by the millions. Shit hole countries and people who believe in an inferior, lesser God. They call it the war on terror and paid killers control drones from air conditioned offices to satisfy their egos, their banker bosses interests, their spirituality intact they collect their salaries and get to be called heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 800,000 people die from cardiovascular disease each year in The United States alone. (This must be why government do not want to provide people free health insurance too expensive.) But they reduce the tax millionaires and billionaires suppose to pay to encourage the poor people to eat less and healthy.

       It is now 2 minutes to midnight. I don't think they will wait for an asteroid like Apophis to do it for them April 13 2029. They are almost there. Most of them are so brain washed with the idea of an apocalypse they can not wait for it and want to induce it. Thanks to Abrahamic teachings. like they invented the cesarean section easy come easy go without the gut bacteria from the mommy's birth canal. sacrifice the immune system!

       Does this species look like they are designed by a superior being an alien to you?

       Maybe they were trying to destroy Earth, so they genetically altered us to self destruct and do it for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think we try and communicate with or try to genetically improve Mosquitos? Yes we do. We genetically modify them to control their populations.

       One thing I began considering that I have not ever seen proposed...
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If we faked the moon landing... what if the astronauts were NOT in on it!?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the government used a combination of experimental drugs and isolation to make the astronauts
       <em>
        truly think
       </em>
       they went to the moon and that the fake moon set was real?
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend reading “The Right Stuff” to get just a glimpses of all the bizarre stuff they went through in preparation for the space program.  Seems pretty easy to put them in an isolation chamber with a head full of ketamine and lsd and make them think they are in a spaceship going to the moon.

       I believe we went to the moon multiple times.  I also believe the pictures and videos we were shown of the moon landings are fake.  It would have been a national embarrassment to get there only to find a Russian flag, or for the astronauts to die as soon as they stepped out of the lander.

       Sure would have been embarrassing to find that they had by seeing the flag on the moon though.  Point being, there were so many thing that could have gone not in the US’s favor that I’m hesitant to believe they would willingly show the moon landing live.  Whether you believe the pictures are legit or not.

       Likelihood of accidentally landing near a previous landing size is essentially NIL. You can't just land on the moon and be like

        “to high” is never adequately explained, he seems to be upset the curved visor distorts the reflection of the horizon? Lol I mean.. it’s curved.

          solar activity does not mean a flare, or that a flare came towards the earth. You need to show that a flare struck the earth/moon during the trip for this to be relevant.

       All that part of the documentary shows is how suceptible some people are to suggestion. There’s nothing in the actual footage or audio that implies it’s fake, the damn narrator is just pounding that into your head the entire time like a grade school teacher.

(you seem smart enough to understand the logistical challenges of this, simply pointing out there are usable materials on the moons surface.....

       So if someone knows about physics and computers, theyre ignorantly parroting shit? This is why people ridicule conspiracy theorists.

       You suffer from being grossly ignorant or deluded and you act like its a virtue to remain ignorant, dismissing any scientific evidence(which is easily verifiable in any university level science lab when it comes to heating things up).

       I don't know. There are imaging satellites. 99 percent of data travels through undersea cable. I wouldn't feel right making an assumption either way. However The ISS is another story. Its the most expensive thing ever built, seems like a tax trap. That's before you even watch videos showing the obvious CGI and trickery that they employ. In recent years a mix of real time Augmented Reality is how they 've been able to fake these videos.

       And the cold of course. They say that it's extremely low pressure and extremely cold, some scientists have theorized that  if a human would go out, all of the body fluids would be sucked out due to the low pressure, and die a horrible death.
      </p>
      <p>
       They later retracted that theory (a lot of damage control shills on youtube now) and explained that in fact that was not true and people would just freeze to death, but completely ignored the pressure issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course theoretically they could make a ship cold resistant (though I dont know how since if you put a metal in a cold freezer it freezes and then it can be shattered in pieces, cold makes the metal very weak and can be shattered like a stone)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet they have allegedly also went out into space, in freakin plastic suits. How the hell did that keep them warm and pressurized? It's a complete nonsense.

       Holy shit I haven't even thought of that one. Suppose you could push yourself out from the atmosphere using the Earth's atmosphere to push yourself out as a counter-force, and then just glide until you reach the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how do you propell yourself back? If you glide towards the Moon with little or no friction, once you reach it, you would just orbit around it forever, and you could not come back from there, since there is no atmosphere to push yourself against.

       Nice observations, I am sure there are many more plotholes, and even engineers who call themselves experts, haven't sat down 10 minutes to think about these absurdities. No wonder people are so brainwashed, they believe in illogical things and don't even realize it.

       The Russians choosing to keep secret on their successful moon landing in the hopes that the Americans might get there and just happen to land next to it is so laughably unbelievable JK Rowling may as well write a book about it.

       I think I’ve claimed the opposite of making myself 100% sure.  I don’t know about rockets as I’ve said time and fucking time again. I’m so bored of this now it’s just ridiculous.  A short google search and you will find plenty of arguments from people claiming to be physicists.  How do I know if they are or aren’t ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since your a physicists and know everything about rockets. You can explain how “boosters” used to stabilise the lunar lander or rockets don’t spin the ship round and round since there is nothing to stop the rotation ?

       The cloud formation hypothesis is covered in the article I linked to, and covered in much more detail in the papers linked in that article. Short answer: nope, it's not the cause.

       I'm just venting about getting down votes for my comment despite the fact that I'm simply citing ball earth theorist's own figures. It's odd to me that someone would downvote a comment without disputing the claims or researching for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really coming from a Biblical perspective but Flat Earth and Evolution research has lead me to conclude that we are indeed created as is this realm we call earth. I think it helps atheists to think of God as some sort of super computer programmer. They are moral relativists and philosophical materialists so you have to speak to them in those terms.
