Basically, since you were thinking about a topic, such as flonase, your brain pays more attention to in the coming time. This can also be observed with new vocabulary words. Many times after learning new words those words seem to appear in your life much more often. In reality, your brain just pays more attention to them since you just learned them. </p>

<p>Phone settings have a bunch of things to disable too. Every phone is going to be different, even from carrier to carrier since they have custom installs of the os. </p>

<p>Rather, what appears to be happening is selective memory/selective attention.</p>

<p>Bullshit. Have you never had a conversation with someone about a particular item or topic, only to be bombarded with ads that are eerily on point to what was being discussed? It happens ALL THE TIME. And there are too many people who share the same experiences for it to simply be chalked up to &quot;selective memory&quot;.</p>

<p>Me and the wife were discussing an upcoming fishing trip. Next day I&#39;ve got ads on here about fishing. I don&#39;t even own any fishing equipment, her grandfather does. Selective attention though amirite?</p>

<p>People also fail to realize that whatever they google or search for on a WiFi network can also generate ads on their phone.. so if two people are talking about something and one of them decides to do some research on it on the same WiFi the other is connected to, ads will be pushed to your phone if you are on that WiFi network as well. </p>

You make 0 statement, &quot;omg they are listening to me!&quot; And then you give 0 evidence or proof that others could use to verify your claim.</p>

<p>Made it up? Come on, do you think people on the internet are that desperate for attention that they make shit up? Wait, don&#39;t answer that.</p>

<p>Yes. Yes they are. Of course they are.</p>

<p>Lmao how is it fact that they&#39;re listening to you when no one has been able to prove it scientifically? You can&#39;t just say &quot;IT&#39;S FACT NOW&quot; and believe it to be true. This is what happens when people are not taught basic statistics and logical argumentation in school. If you talk about something and get an ad for it, you&#39;re going to remember that. If you talk about something and don&#39;t get an ad for it, you&#39;re not going to remember it happening. So naturally you will only recall the incidents that fit your preconceived idea of what&#39;s happening - also known as selective memory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never tried searching for any guides but a familiarity with your phone&#39;s app&#39;s permissions is the best route. Go through each of your apps in your app manager and designate what youd like it to have access to. Most apps by default are installed (or people hastily click through accept and don&#39;t notice) with permissions far beyond what they logically need. Like access to your mic, your contacts or photos. Usually disabling these permissions will not change the function of the app in any way order than adding an extra step, like asking your permission. </p>

<p>Most phone&#39;s come with &quot;assistants&quot; loaded with complete full access to every aspect of your phone. Personally I deal with a notification once a day telling me Google Play won&#39;t function correctly until I give it full access to my mic and body sensors. It does still function correctly, and I happily click ignore once a day. Even if you choose to keep the assistant, your other apps most likely don&#39;t need mic access. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not happening. This has been analyzed to death by people who actually know what they&#39;re doing and there&#39;s no evidence it&#39;s happening. It&#39;s the equivalent of when people in the 90s thought that satanic day cares were all over the nation, when in reality it was people allowing their preconceived notions to fuel their paranoia.

For example, voice control in general I find most people don&#39;t use and yet nearly every app comes with permissions set to use your mic.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember how, but on Google phones specifically you can access a place where every single &quot;Ok Google...&quot; command you&#39;ve ever said has been recorded. The interesting bit is when you listen to them the clip is &quot;Ok Google, turn up the volume to 80%.&quot; Meaning the program is not recognizing your command and initiating the record, it is in fact always recording but only issues a command when the keywords are used. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true we give up much when we accept most companies Terms of Service in order to use their product, but too many people think their data collection is a battle they have no say in. Go through your phone&#39;s settings and you will <em>drastically</em> reduce your digital footprint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, but this is advice between or from one tech savvy user to another. It&#39;s one thing for me to &quot;crawl&quot; the apparently pseudorandom submenus of my phone to dissipate privacy-negating effects on my own good time and making a &quot;map&quot; while I go. It&#39;s entirely different to just want a checklist that&#39;s useful as a base of operations in and of itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to paint it real simple for you there, big guy. I know this is hard for your brain meats to understand but do your best. </p>

<p>When you install an app on your talky device (phone), it either automatically has access to your mic or asks for access to your mic. If you don&#39;t turn this permission off then the app has LEGAL access to your mic, because you (the retard) allowed it. If you DO turn it off, it would be illegal for the app to access your mic against your permission. Thus, no more ads. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good one to talk about too.</p>

<p>I like this phone one because I never thought about it.  It adds to yours though!</p>

<p>But like you said.  They know everything about you.  The full data that is me.  I mean we all assume that but we don&#39;t think about the implications of it.</p>

<p>My DNA, my fingerprints, my whole life is saved.  I&#39;m basically a random character they can pick from.</p>

<p>I mean to go to an extreme.  I could basically be framed for anything if they get the time and place right.  It&#39;s not like I have an alibi constantly.  OH, here is his dna and fingerprints and him posting that he hates cows!  They could fake the hating cows thing probably.</p>

<p>But they&#39;d know where I am and what I prefer by now.  I mean I&#39;m here right now.  Ahh yes, he&#39;ll probably go for a break in 30 minutes according to data and lives there.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in the future, shit be crazy on what they could time and who to choose from.  I just killed a frog and am framed.</p>

<p>YES they listen to you. So does Cortanq and a bunch of other shit.</p>

<p>You can make it stop advertising to you, and make it &quot;supposedly&quot; stop listening in the settings of Android and pretty much every version of Windows. Im sure Apple has similar features but i wouldnt touch Apple anything if you paid me to.</p>

<p>Also, Facebook allows you to turn off listening supposedly as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be that in those instances of related ads popping up conversations, the friend himself did a search? As we know Facebook will show ads related to things friends have searched.</p>

<p>Also how do you get ads to popup on your phone? You mean like in the browser?</p>

<p>How about not getting ads? Don&#39;t people hate ads in general, whether they are targeted or not?
I don&#39;t use FB. On my (Android) phone, I use the Brave browser which has an integrated ad-blocker and blocks tracking. I use a RSS reader (Inoreader) to get news, blog and Reddit posts. I use YouTube Red (which comes free with the Google music subscription). I don&#39;t use ad supported apps. I rarely see any ads on my phone. Same on the desktop.</p>

<p>all posts like this are explained because you, at some point, accepted and gave the permissions for it to happen.</p>

<p>you know when you installed that app, and just accepted all permissions because you didn&#39;t care. well that&#39;s when you accepted this to happen.</p>

<p>that time you&#39;l just accepted the terms of service without reading? well that&#39;s when you let this happen.</p>

<p>this is literally just the 2018 version of accepting toolbars in your browser.</p>

<p>Google serves most ads on the internet. Facebook is another. I can guarantee that you are using one of those two services in some way. Gmail, Maps, Instagram, Whatsapp. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreeing to it is not the same as the conspiracy to have your phone track and listen to everything people do</p>

<p>Some rich fucker out there with ties to Gov&#39;t agencies wants this to happen.  Not the people wh just simply want to use their phones with the pretty screen and the camera attached.  With all tbe features and helpful things our phones can do, they are piggy backed upon by the spy agencies. </p>

<p>Its not just about advirtising and marketing and meta data or whatever simplistic way you would like to look at it.  It is more than that.  Your response is almost like blaming the user as if we are deserving of such a catch 22.  How many spy free phone are out there as an alternative? </p>

<p>This is not the blame game and it certainly doesn&#39;t have to be this way if people were to demand it.  Phones only come this way right now because it is such an easy 100% sure fire way to spy.  They made sure this was going to happen with almost no way to bypass.</p>

<p>You almost sound like a rep here to ensure that people accept such a thing.  It shouldn&#39;t be accepted even though it is our current reality.  The matter of fact way you&#39;re saying this is bizzare.</p>

<p>I went into Rite-Aid to get a PayPal Gift card, and while looking at all the cards, I ONLY LOOKED at one for Regal Cinema, a company I hadn’t heard of in a LONG time, and had a moment of nostalgia, as I always went to our local, nor defunct, Regal when I was a kid. It caught my eye because of their new logo.</p>

<p>Keep in mind I never said anything to anyone, not even myself, just the thought, phone in pocket (so no camera view).</p>

<p>So I get my PayPal card, walk outside get in the car. I sit down, open up Instagram, and 3 pictures down is a between picture ad for REGAL CINEMAS with that big new logo right in my face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is to connect it to your phone, so you can start the machine, stop it, or soak items, etc. if you are not at home. I guess it you have a really dirty load of clothes, you start it up when you leave home and soak the items. The items soak and you leave the house. Then when you are out of the house and they have soaked long enough, you use your phone to start the machine back up to finish the load of clothes.</p>

<p>Maybe for people &quot;on the go&quot; a lot this is a good feature. But still seems odd to me. I don&#39;t want it and didn&#39;t get it on my new machine. Just seems odd to me.</p>

<p>I honestly thought it was a joke when I first heard about it!</p>
