       If somebody was going to do a controlled demolition of the twin towers would they not fall exactly like they did when they were apparently struck by planes ?

       Ask yourself what is the chance of planes crashing into the twin towers and them proceeding to fall exactly as they would in a controlled demolition?

       I've seen countless 9/11 debunking videos.  The government isn't innocent, but its highly incompetent.  How in the fuck could they create such a specific and vast conspiracy without leaks in the word we live in.  I don't believe it to be possible.

       Highly incompetent yes. But they also hide facts about every major incident which creates the conspiracy mindset. I don't know what degree the government played in 9/11 but those towers were demolished. Explain WTC 7?

       Is this the first thing you thought of this morning? There have been good analysis of how the tower were constructed using this "Steel border frame" design (not real name.. Forgot). Basically, the entire structure relied completely on the internal floors to make the square frame rigid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the floors fell in on each other, the outer frame was like 4 cards leaning to make a cube. It fell under its own weight.

       The reality of engineering and science is often highly counter-intuitive. I don't have the background to so it justice, save to say, qualified engineers have. This is one of the many reasons that buildings aren't constructed like the old towers anymore.

       What about the architects of engineering movement? They don’t believe they fell on there own. What about the squibs? The constant explosions, between the plane and the collapse, reported by many firefighters and police at the scene? The explosions reported by the janitor in the basement before the plane even hit the tower? The dancing jews that from their own mouth were there to ‘cover the days events’. 
A cell block in the UK was ravaged by a fire and never fell, surely that wasn’t as structurally sound as the twin towers?

       The fire in the UK never had an impact, nor jet fuel, nor the same height or strength to weight ratio.

      <p>
       Engineers make the best assessment they can, on available information. In the many years since 9-11, more evidence comes to light. Assessments must be reevaluated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video I saw recently showed a viable sky directly through front facing windows. This showed clearly that the building (at least one of them) was hollowed out before the fall. I have no doubt that poor engineering standards of the day helped lead to the building's collapsing.

       Well all the engineers I’ve seen have commented that to get the towers to fall, all of the core columns would have to be cut, and thats the only way the towers could come down in such synchronicity.  If you look at the columns after the collapse they show the signs of controlled demo as they are cut in a diagonal manner. Which also explains the squibs and all the explosions heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me about tower 7 then? How did that fall when there was no jet fuel and no significant impact to the building? And the fires were nowhere near hot enough to cause a collapse.

       "After 7 hours of uncontrolled fires, a steel girder on Floor 13 lost its connection to one of the 81 columns supporting the building. Floor 13 collapsed, beginning a cascade of floor failures to Floor 5. Column 79, no longer supported by a girder, buckled, triggering a rapid succession of structural failures that moved from east to west. All 23 central columns, followed by the exterior columns, failed in what's known as a "progressive collapse"--that is, local damage that spreads from one structural element to another, eventually resulting in the collapse of the entire structure."

       I can’t take anything published in popular mechanics seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       One column collapses and the whole tower comes down? Somehow that just doesn’t make sense to me. Again as the building was basically reduced to a pile of dust. The kinetic energy of one floor falling on top of the others isn’t enough to make the whole building collapse and basically disappear.

       Obviously there’s going to be some debris left behind. Wheres the other 100 odd floors? Listen to interviews of people on site, they couldn’t fond anything resembling a phone, a filing cabinet. Yet the main hijackers and other passports were found! It defies belief.
Also molten steel, described as looking like lava by firefighters, was found at the scene days after the towers went down. How do you explain this?

       The passport thing is coincidental.  Even if the passport burned up, we would  have still found out who did it.

       "Under certain circumstances it is conceivable for some of the steel in the wreckage to have melted after the buildings collapsed. Any molten steel in the wreckage was more likely due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile than to short exposure to fires or explosions while the buildings were standing."

       Completely false.

      <p>
       The new WTC7 uses the exact same design as the twin towers as well as the old WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a common design because of the increased floor space. And it’s very safe building within a building construction. It is not an empty hole in the middle for the walls to fall into, it is a dense cage of steel beams.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new WTC7 was the first building to be raised at Ground Zero and it was finished 2 years before NIST’s Final Report on WTC7 was complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they built it before any building code recommendations were made and it’s designed exactly the same as the 3 buildings that collapsed.
