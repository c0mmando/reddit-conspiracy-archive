       When you go to Disney world and I assume the other parks as well, they capture your fingerprint as part of selling you the day pass.  What do they do with them, do they share them or delete them? Anybody know or have any info?

       Have you ever seen how many cameras there are in the park? There are also thousands of finger print scanners on a lot of the railing in the lines. You know, just in case you get "out of line" with someone while waiting in line...

       So tell me this, if you were to get a state of the art security system installed in your home, and say you wanted to doxx everyone that came to your front door. Where would you put the EEG sensor? Me personally I would put 5 of them within a 3 foot proximity of the door knob. So next, tell me what are the most touched surfaces at Disney? You wont find what you are looking for "link about handrail installations" that is simply because there is simply no straight forward strategy as to where you can and can't install biofeedback sensors. I mean come on man, we can go around about this all night if you want but even when you sit face to face with the truth, you are simply going to reject it no matter what. I can't argue with that.

       It's not technically finger print readers. How can you be so naive, You just got handed the direct answer to your question and then you shot it down. I guess next you will me that there isn't biometrics in your cellphone and it can't read your fingerprint either right? Or maybe you believe that IoT is not in your DVR or your TV? Go check again.

       I don't see how I'm being naive. You're saying there are fingerprint readers in handrails, I asked for proof, you gave a handful of articles about EEGs and biometrics but nothing about them being used in handrails. While interesting, they don't support your claim. It's a simple as that. Show me proof of hidden fingerprint readers in handrails at theme parks.

       Today, there are microscopic computer chips based on nanotechnology  whichcan be inserted into a person by means of an injection, capsule, or  tooth filling, with or without the knowledge of a doctor or a  pharmacist, and these computer chips can track the implanted person by  radio or microwaves. These microscopic computer chips can also be made  invisible to detection by means of C.A.T. [ Computerized Axial  Tomography ], M.R.I. [ Magnetic Resonance Imaging ], and P.E.T. [  Positron Emission Tomography ] scans, by some means of electromagnetic  degaussing.

       An example of EMF Brain Stimulation:

      <p>
       Bioelectric
Resonance Frequency
      </p>
      <p>
       Information Induced Through Modulation Motor Control Cortex 10 HZ
      </p>
      <p>
       Motor Impulse Co-ordination Auditory Cortex 15 HZ
      </p>
      <p>
       Sound which bypasses the ears Visual Cortex 25 HZ
      </p>
      <p>
       Images in the brain, bypassing the eyes Somatosensory Cortex 09 HZ
      </p>
      <p>
       Phantom Touch Sense Thought Center 20 HZ
      </p>
      <p>
       Imposed Subconscious Thoughts
      </p>
      <p>
       This modulated information can be put into the brain at varying intensities from subliminal to perceptible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each  person’s brain has a unique set of bioelectric resonance/entrainment  frequencies. Sending audio information to a person’s brain at the  frequency of another person’s auditory cortex would result in that audio  information not being perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets even sweeter, imbue the projection with Schumann resonance frequencies such as

      <p>
       And  it will allow the person a chance to perform a "reflex kneejerk" and  "leak" their mind. Meaning, that you can in theory "download" people's  memories up to the most recent point of their life.  ...maybe even allow  you to connect your psyche itself to the internet if the internet is  the source.

       I listened to a computer security lecture by a guy who worked on the system (or perhaps just knew about it). This was some years ago, so it may be different now, but he said they only capture a few points of identification for each finger print. So it's more like giving a blood type than a DNA profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their website says you can show your ID if you don't want to give them prints.
