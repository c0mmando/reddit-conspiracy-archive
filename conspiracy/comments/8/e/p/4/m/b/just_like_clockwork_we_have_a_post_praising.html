       We can probably expect more praise to him in the coming days as well, depending on what happens of course. No surprise though, the system has to elevate the image of their puppets in the inner circle up till death and beyond.

       Carter had a great vision that people wanted at the time because the economy was horrid.  Carter would have been historical had he examined the content of his policies and variables required for a smooth implementation.  His policies were much like Trump on reducing foreign competition but his execution was similar to Obama.  Carter &amp; Obama failed to look at their dependencies.  You cannot make a dramatic change without doing your homework on what could impact outcomes and people of all income levels.  They sound good but fall short.  Carter killed manufacturing and impacted the middle class and poor with increased cost.  He was more eager to follow his ten principles to conserve energy than working with others and listening to the populace.  He preached national sacrifice and cooperation while forcing his policies through.  He overlooked coal demands and impact of mining unions, cost to meet fuel efficiency on car manufacturers and their foreign competition, imported oil cuts to overall inflation impacts and wages.  These are things that should have been discussed and collaborated before implementing.

       I was hoping, not so much for someone to save us, but someone from a different cabal(organized crime) to come in and disrupt the current power structure. Not that we won't be screwed again in the end I just know when the system gets shaken up it opens up opportunities.

       I feel bad for the military personnel who sign up based on the faux patriotism Bush and his kind projected on the masses.

       My favorite line is the military needs to occupy some far off country to protect our freedoms or they are jealous of our freedoms so they attack us. I guarantee Joe Blow in far off country gives zero fucks that I have the freedom to go to Walmart whenever I please.

       i understand that the UN heavily lead by the US invaded.  I also understand that the vast majority of actual military was US.    As in 10 times larger then the next member being KSA who has an active interest in Kuwait.

       the real point i am driving at is we constantly play world police despite our nations interests. By our nation i mean its citizens not the corporations that run it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say you work 40 hours a week.  Lets say 30% of your paycheck goes to taxes.  Lets say 30% of those taxes go to discretionary spending.  Lets say over half of that spending is for the military.  How many hours a week do you work for the military?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are our citizens drowning in student loans, healthcare costs, housing costs, infrastructure collapse, etc ,etc while we spending Trillions on playing world police?

       You just completely changed issues and moved goal posts. The idea that the first Gulf War was a UN mission is completely seperate from a discussion around what the US's role in the UN should be, or if the US's military budget is desirable.

       not intentionally moving anything.  Discussing the topic from a greater perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       On paper a UN mission.  In actuality a US invasion.  Made of stories of babies being thrown from incubators on nightly news to drum up support.  90% of the forces being made up of US military and operation being run by a US general.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i dont believe the discussions are separate which is why i touched on the rest.

       Agreed on the drumming up of support, but that doesn't change the fact Iraq had in fact invaded and tried to annex Kuwait...
      </p>
      <p>
       And it does matter that you changed topics because you're original statement was that it should have been a UN mission not a US mission, which it was.

       The seocnd link I included as a counterpoint to my argument, but in the end, the US gave him permission to invade Kuwait. The argument currently going on is if it was by
       <em>
        mistake
       </em>
       or on
       <em>
        purpose
       </em>
       but we told him we did not care.

       The third outlines our ambassadors communications with Saddam over his tensions with Kuwait, and while the Headers of the blog it is posted too suggest that it is us giving permission, literally none of the actually primary text says that, your 4th source is almost identical to your third.

       I actually had to back track on this because the US
       <strong>
        technically
       </strong>
       did not give him permission. This was after thoroughly reading the Wikileaks cable and the Foreign Policy.com article on this fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We knew he was going to do it, and allowed him to do so, and did not stop him until he went
       <em>
        past
       </em>
       the area that they thought that he wanted which was in all the links I sent you.
      </p>
      <p>
       He stated that he wanted to get X area of Kuwait.
       <em>
        We never told him no
       </em>
       . We never told him not to do it. We NOT ONCE said don't do it, and in the phrase above that you seem to not understand, told him we did not care while giving us
       <strong>
        plausible deniability
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If we did not want him to invade Kuwait at all, we would have unequivocally told him no. We did not, instead we told him that...we did not care, and
       <strong>
        most importantly
       </strong>
       that the US would will still be friendly to him regardless of his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically using power talk vs straight talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       We only began to take action after he went past the area that he stated that he wanted.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot separately charged during the televised debate Monday that on the eve of Iraq's invasion, the administration had instructed its ambassador to Baghdad to tell Saddam "in effect" that he could "take the northern part of Kuwait." Perot said his claim was based in part on an Iraqi transcript of the well-known meeting between the ambassador, April C. Glaspie, and Saddam on July 25, 1990.

       unless you want said maniac to go to war.

      <p>
       So, you are correct. The United States of America never
       <em>
        officially
       </em>
       gave Saddam permission to invade Kuwait. Knowing all the information that we knew at the time though, not once did the US ever tell him NO, and even told him we will still be friendly with him regardless of the outcome. How else is that supposed to be interpreted?

       My reply isn't for you.. It was pointing out that you spent 6 paragraphs and literally didn't say ANYTHING. Other than in a few places you made a logical jump where you just straight up said this is because we must have wanted the invasion, based on nothing.

       The paragraph you just quoted agrees with everything I said, including the fact that the US did not give explicit approval for the invasion. I then explained how they did not give explicit approval, but they did give
       <strong>
        implicit approval

       Against my better judgement, I am going to give you some advice. Go read the 48 laws of Power and the Gervais Principle on PowerTalk. Then you will begin to see what all politicians and leaders all see, and the actual language that they all speak. It will help you in the long run.

       Because I have studied how politicians talk, varying levels of conversation, conversational nuisances, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, etc., I can see the statements made as they were and why they gave implicit permission for Saddam to takeover Kuwait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you have not looked into this, nor have you read through all the other articles given to you, you at a fundamental level do not understand this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying this as a knock on you. Trolling you is over, at this point I am trying to give you a lesson -- up to you take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stated that the US gave him permission, but I took that back later because you were right in that we never gave him
       <strong>
        explicit
       </strong>
       permission to invade Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did it implicitly. Anyone who understands subtlety and nuance can
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       see that.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         FACT: We told him we did not care about him and his conflict with Kuwait.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FACT: We told him we are friendly towards him and come as friends.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FACT: We told him at we will remain as friends regardless of actions taken with the USG.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Under the Gervais Principle, with straight talk (which you are reading these statements as) you are taking them 100% at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, with PowerTalk (which all of these politicians speak and know) it literally says we'll back your move no matter what, have at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, if we really did not want him to invade Kuwait, the conversation would have been: We are friends as long as you do not invade Kuwait -- we do care about your Arab-Arab conflict. Done. Fini. Fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's start simple: Go look up the Gervais Principle and learn about it. Then go back to those articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or don't. At this point, it does not matter. If you do, you will learn something that will help you for the rest of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not...well, you can live the rest of your life not knowing these principles. Just do not become a politician, or a high level manager if that is the case, or you will be fucked.

       Exiting conversation. I think you should take your 3 facts and ask yourself if a diplomat would act any other way in any other situation. Hint: You don't really have to imagine, that is literally what we do in EVERY situation, in EVERY country.

       I'm very glad you are finishing your Freshmen year psychology courses and think you now have great insight into how everyone is thinking all the time; I just hope you can have enough self-reflection to see that this entire thesis is based on your understanding of other people's motivations, based on nothing but your own supposition and a Ross Perot quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want you to seriously think what it means that after you spent time looking for evidence that you couldn't find, you didn't adjust your thesis at all.

       Kuwait was slant drilling into Iraq and stealing their oil. Saddaam was led to believe by US ambassador thst we would stay out of it if he invaded. We had previously allied with Saddaan against Iran in the 1980s iran iraq war. GHWB decision to invade Iraq was complete BS...and probably an order from KSA or Israel who bith benefit from keeping ME unstable.

       Well, it could be something as simple as people tend to say nice stuff about people who are on the brink of death.

       I learnt yesterday that the Ashaninca people of Peru refer to animals in varying degrees of familial terms. Animals and plants are ancestors, family members, in other words. Brother-in-law armadillo, for example. But some animals, they don't refer to in familial terms. They say 'beings that were formerly human'. Poisonous snakes are an example of these.
      </p>
      <p>
       So perhaps the way it works is that if you use your human life to cause death and misery, you are given the body of a lesser being for your reincarnation. And as a snake you are condemned to a life slithering in the muck, and utterly alone. Snakes are alone; many of them even fuck themselves to reproduce, I think?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't be part of the human family, you get demoted for a thousand regenerations. I hope the Ashaninca are right.

       I'm talking about anyone who worked for or has an immediate family member that is active/retired Intelligence history.  I don't care about extended family so much unless they had a big role in the life of the candidate.

       If someone disagrees with the people and agrees with the state, they are shilling. And it can of course be unknowing; I don't believe people are evil.
