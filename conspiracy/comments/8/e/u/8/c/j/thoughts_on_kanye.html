       That’s tough for him though because he’s never really been known for drugs. I’m not sure how they could take him down. Sexual assault allegations would be really out of place for him too. He’s a tough one to get rid of haha

       Maybe Trump has ended the MK ultra program and Kanye is now free and that’s why he is expressing his support for the President.

       Alternatively Trump hasn’t ended the MK ultra program and instead has took control of it and now Kanye is working for him.

       I felt that all of his albums encompassed the plight of black people (men especially) never being able to live up to their standards in a society ran by whites. Each album better than the last in understanding that many won't even catch, not even those who he wrote it for in the first place. At the same time, humble enough to know that he too is a hypocrite. A genius of our time that most won't take into consideration until he is gone. That's when people will search his work and testimonies and find the flaws of both him and ourselves as we do with all great men.

       I agree but I feel like he’s said so much that it would almost be too obvious if he “suicided”. Like how Terry Crews kept saying “if anything happens to me....” right after he spoke out against TPTB too. Kanye is almost too influential. Although I definitely would’ve said the same thing about Michael Jackson and we all know what happened there

       I feel like they are trying to make him look like he's crazy (not genius crazy) but actually gibberish crazy with the news that keeps coming out about him everyday, so if he does end up dead they'll just point to his tweets.

       Hilarious to me that people who weeks ago were yelling, "SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE" now care what an entertainer has to say. Other than that, couldn't care less. Why should I let a dude I've never met, with more money than I'll ever see, influence what I think about really anything? He's a musician.

       Why though? He (and other entertainers) has gotten to meet and do business with some of the most influential and powerful people in the world. Why does him being a rapper nullify anything he says? Again I genuinely don’t see the logic.

       Why would you go to him for opinions if he's not an expert? I'm saying I don't care about his social thoughts because his social experience is totally different than any other person's. Yes he is black, but he's also super rich.

       ...that’s not what I’m saying whatsoever. If you took 5 seconds to look at his recent tweets you’d understand what we’re all talking about. Instead you’re just arguing from the outside. I’m not sure what your endgame is here. To win a Reddit argument?

       The normie celebrities who became famous by selling their soul either get super brainwashed, or just switched out by clones or look-alike people (for example Paul McCartney, Stephen Hawking, perhaps even Kanye after his first "Meltdown").

       Other celebrities are born into their roles from birth and have no reason to let the secrets out. I haven't looked into the Meek Mill thing though.

       For sure. When it comes to rapper, I’ve just always taken it as “sell your soul to our industry or you can stay your ass in jail”. It’s a lot easier to convince people to literally give your their life when they have to sit in a concrete box every day. Obviously a lot rappers do live a criminal lifestyle, but I find it very coincidental that a lot of up and coming rappers end up going to prison right when they get big (meek, xxxtentacion, bobby shmurda, gucci mane, etc)

       I wonder if Kanye saw shit in the music business that enlightened him. Remember that Trump was once a celebrity who the Democrats and powerful people wanted to be buddies with. And then all of a sudden he turned into a counter culture folk hero.

       I want to believe he is real (in the sense that he is against tptb) but he is associated with the witch Kardashians and might just be under mind control.

       Oh not at all. Used to seem crazy to me but not anymore. Plenty of celebs and entertainers who disappear for a few years and come back entirely different. Taylor swift is a good current example imo

       he is deep undercover. brainwashed w hero/messiah programing.

      <p>
       there's plenty of footage of him blanking out, having mental breaks. wich could suggest serious brainwashing.

       I'm thinking at some point white hats made contact with Kanye and covertly installed the hero/messiah script as a firewall.

       The normie celebrities who became famous by selling their soul either get super brainwashed, or just switched out by clones or look-alike people (for example Paul McCartney, Stephen Hawking, perhaps even Kanye after his first "Meltdown").
      </p>
      <p>
       Other celebrities are born into their roles from birth and have no reason to let the secrets out. I haven't looked into the Meek Mill thing though.
