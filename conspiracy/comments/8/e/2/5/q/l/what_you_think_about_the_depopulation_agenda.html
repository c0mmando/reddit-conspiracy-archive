       Not many people talk about this. The main reason why many wars are going on is simply because the Illuminati want a lower population so that it's easier for them to control us. Unhealthy processed food, chemtrails, drug and violence, all a part of depopulation agenda.

       Behold a Pale Horse is an old school conspiracy book written by Bill Cooper. It's a little outdated now, but it touches on a lot of different conspiracies and is pretty well regarded for what it is as far as accuracy goes. You can find free PDFs of it to download.

       It would make sense. Assuming the economic "elites" view us largely as chattel to work their machines and provide them their services, they still have use for us. If and when artificial general intelligence is perfected, between that and AGI-designed and produced robots and other autonomous systems, they don't have much need for us. 90% of jobs can be effectively eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even about money, nor has it ever been, but about Power: the ability to impose one's Will on one's environment. For the last several thousand years, money has been a key component in this, but it was really just a placeholder for power. I pay you this much to provide this service or good. With a true AGI, it's "controllers," if they're hubristic enough to believe they can control it, would simply command that their will be done and it will be so.
      </p>
      <p>
       At such a point, the 7 billion people on the planet would be not only superfluous and useless but positively dangerous to these masters. Depopulation would be a necessary consequence of such an endgame.

       A human can’t be defeated by a robot when it comes to on the spot problem solving. They can be made to preform specific tasks in a controlled environment but when the power goes out in a rainstorm you’re gonna need a human or you’re doomed.

       I was just thinking that as I was reading a post about the snipers taking out the one in pink post ( I used to read extensively on that theory) - what if all the wars going on and the mini wars that we don't know of, along with sickness outbreaks, diseases and mass shootings could  some what  be a part of the population control and maybe even depopulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depopulation as the agenda for an ease of control is plausible but it can't be practical without a mass outrage by the public if it happens to get out or someone snoops somewhere and it can be exposed easily (as it is extremely inhumane) to the purpose and end goal for the reason to depopulate the world. The whole idea of the theory on depopulation I think is propaganda, a scapegoat. To trick the public into thinking or even the people who are aware of evil deeds on this world into looking elsewhere but I think it is right in plane sight under our noses more for the management to the rise of population in other ways (like war, plague, disease outbreaks, DNA mutations, cancer, flu, poverty etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       They already have us under their control, there really is no need for depopulation but more so the management of population increase yearly and since we are all mini corporations or from the day we are birthed into this world we are creating money for the higher up one way or another and it seems that's all it matters and there are paradigms set in place in society that makes sure of that through life or through death money will still be made. Population isn't a problem for now but they already have protocols in place that control the rate of births  so it doesn't become a problem.

       It’s all about depopulation. On a grand cosmic scale keep open the possibility that WE are everything. Now imagine having the ability to weed out whatever you want to weed out (people) and create your own heaven on Earth. Rulers of the universe. With time money and resources they literally shape our reality. We sit here on a stage, props for those running the show.

       I thought it was just a made up bible bashing myth until the Ebola outbreak in North Africa. It appears that the strain was a man made varsity of the Congo virus and it was airborne. The perfect killer. And how that small Canadian company came up with a vaccine so quickly I will never know but it struck me as a bit too convenient.

       Depopulation is real possibility. For two reasons. One we are simply fucking up our planet and at some point we will screw it up for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two we are entering a solar minimum which no one knows how bad it will get. It could mean mass crop failure and sky rocketing prices. Here in the uk we can support 25 million people. Yet we have 65 million living here, if the sea freezes for any period of time there will be real trouble. And it has happened and it will happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with Russia and Canada. Two vast food growing countries could see crops devastated. Will we be subject to de population before or after the cold spell ?  It will happen it’s just when

       The sun has an 11-ish year cycle where it oscillates in irradiance. The low of that oscillation is referred to as "solar minimum". I'm not actually sure what th3allyK4t is implying about it though. We've been through literally tens of thousands of these throughout human history. They aren't a big deal at all.

       Our last solar maximum was incredibly weak and did nothing to slow the decay of the magnetosphere. The current sunspot trend is similar to that of the Maunder minimum in the 1600s which caused a 'mini ice age'.

       Yeah my 'question' was a bit devoid of context, I suppose. As was mentioned in the parent comment, we are likely in a solar minimum cycle, which will further weaken our already unsteady magnetosphere. On top of that there are clear signs that we are well into the process of magnetic pole shift, which historically coincides with tumultuous if not cataclysmic global events such as 'Great Floods' and massive volcanic eruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I'm fairly convinced that over the next few decades we're going to see increasingly powerful natural disasters until our planetary magnetics begin to stabilize, and there's nothing we can do about it except try to survive. See? Even I think I sound like a fear-mongering loon...

       No, since I sound like a fear mongering loon when I talk to anyone about it. Plus everyone is so indoctrinated with global warming.  Though now the term is climate change. You’ll notice on space weather even the teeniest of sun spots is considered a sunspot.  It hard to know how deep we will go, some suggest it may be the ice age others that it’ll be 30 years. Everyone seems to agree the earth is about to cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also depends where you are, if you are south of Atlantic city area or in the Southern Hemisphere things shouldn’t change that much. But Canada, northern Europe’s and Russia will feel it without a doubt. As dusk it’ll be the poor countries that get it first since grain prices will rocket and they will be priced out.
      </p>

       I think the main issue will be if it gets bad and sanctions imposed on already hungry Nations there will be war. So guess if you live in the west then it may just mean colder winters and the price of bread triples.

      <p>
       Going to assume you meant "variety" there instead of varsity. Crimean–Congo and Ebola are similar in that they both cause hemorrhagic fevers and are negative single stranded RNA viruses, but the similarities end there. They belong to distinct Orders, have different life cycles, different vectors (Bats for Ebola, Ticks for Crimean-Congo), different capsid shape (Helical for Ebola, Icosahedral for Crimean-Congo)and different genome structures (Ebola's is Monopartite while Crimean-Congo is Multipartite), among others. Zaire Ebolavirus (the one that broke out in 2013) was similar to other Ebolaviruses and Filoviruses.

       Not really. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty good at killing, but it has a relatively tough time getting around compared to other viruses. You want to make a truly perfect killer? Airborne retrovirus with a long incubation period that still leaves the person infectious. Plague Inc. basically.

       A lot of that seems to be inconclusive/speculation. The WHO states that Ebola can be transferred through the air by water droplets expelled through the coughing of infected individuals, but that isn't "truly" airborne. Even so, the main way it moves from human to human is 100% through body fluids.

       Okay now you're saying something different. Congo Strain =/= Congo virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congo virus usually refers to the Crimean–Congo virus. A whole separate beast. A strain is a subtype of an existing virus species. Do you remember the exact name of the strain suggested and the arguments put forth as to why it was man made?

       Unfortunately even WHO cannot be trusted after their swine flu fear mongering just to shift flu vaccines. Then the zika scare just before the Olympic Games which seems to be not newsworthy anymore, and yet there were plenty of scientists discretising the link between zika and deformed babies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t get my info from forums it is online but I do try and cross check it. I found it suspicious the Canadian company came up with a vaccine and like magic it disappeared. That’s what got me wondering.  But I have no proof of course and yes I’d like to trust scientific papers. But again I’d like to think scientists worked purely for the answer to a solution and the truth, which as we both can agree they work for grants. And as honourable as they may be when a grant provider asks for proof on a subject they can simply cover their backs with words like. Potential, possible, probably etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree there are better ways to kill a population than the very scary Ebola virus. Bird flu looks like a good contender for the next round.

       This is the only line I could find attempting to describe how it was done. Holy crap is that a dumb statement. Let me list them out.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        How do you expect a virus that targets eykaruotes to target a prokaryote? Did you just get the viral sequence in there through a bacteriophage or something?
       </li>
       <li>
        How exactly do you expect to get a virus to start targeting Humans if you attempt to replicate it in a Bacteria?
       </li>
       <li>
        How do you expect a virus that evolved to infect eukaryotes to replicate in a prokaryote?
       </li>
       <li>
        How do you expect the virus to get it's envelope?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why even use Bacteria? Mammalian cell lines (human included) are a thing. Just replicate it in it's host cell and keep exposing it to human cells. Viruses can species jump naturally and you can enhance that if you create the right environment. Again, WHY WOULD THEY USE BACTERIA?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It would be very easy to see whether or not some sketchy man-made virus was out there. We can't make a virus from the ground up, especially complex ones. The best we can do at the moment would be to splice parts of existing viruses together or "breed" an incredibly infectious strain of an already existing virus. The former is much easier to spot than the later. Using some form of sequence analysis would very obviously show a frankenstein's monster looking thing, with different sections showing homology with completely different types of viruses.

       It's important to separate what the Media is saying about these things with official statements from the WHO. The media tends to blow things up, or not get the severity of the situation across. Swine flu was definitely over hyped, and a lot of people remember the whole Ebola event as being blown out of proportion as well. This is untrue in the case of Ebola. The outbreak was bad. Like, REALLY bad. Early on, infrastructures were falling apart, people weren't following directions or staying in/out of quarantined areas. Early worst case scenario predictions put death tolls at ~500,000 to 1 million by January 2015 because it was being handled SO poorly. An international response took WAY too long to come through. If that strain was more easily transmitted, we would have been in deep shit.

       The severity of Zika was very much tied to the Olympic Games. You have a virus that we didn't know much about with what appeared to be pretty significant side effects to pregnant women in a region that was about to be visited by millions of international tourists. That's like, the nightmare scenario for epidemiologists. I don't blame them for being careful in that case.

       Wouldn't say like magic. The speed isn't that surprising. We're familiar with Filoviruses. Plus, the Ebola vaccines are pretty much the go-to thing to do when you want to make a vaccine fast. They just made a recombinant virus (ChAd3 or the vesicular stomatitis virus as bases) that expressed the Zaire Ebolavirus glycoprotein. They were both decently effective but were pretty janky compared to more refined vaccines. The later of the two caused quite a few side effects and the virus itself was replication-competent. Not fun.

       I did say it was claimed to a be a tampered with strain of the Congo strain of Ebola rather than a man made virus. You seem to know more about the potential of that than I. Though I am just quoting some sources, but still whether or not there is a rational explanation behind how quickly a cure came along for Ebola, I still find it odd that they must have been working on it years yet came up with it in a few months of the outbreak, and yes it was very serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes zika terrifies people but there is ample argument that it doesn’t cause the abnormalities  in babies, again this seemed over hyped without proper scientific study. And surprise Brazil is a BRIC nation.  Are we to believe there was no political motive behind the scare ?  Why is it not a scare now for tourists ?  And surely the people of Brazil matter enough that it should still be news ? And since mosquitos travel how far has the virus reached now ?  You see how it’s hard to believe what we are told when the omissions are as glaring as what they do say.

       If you want, you can try to talk to an immunologists about the validity of the speed at which the vaccines were made. From my perspective (I'm working to become one) it's not that crazy. The vaccines were clearly rush-jobs for the reasons I listed in the last comment.

       I agree that proper study at that point had not been done. However, regardless of a political motive, regardless of whether the abnormalities had been (beyond a reasonable doubt) confirmed to be associated with Zika (it has since been confirmed). I think the choice to heavily warn people of the potential dangers was justified. Again, millions of tourists were going to come to see the Olympics. The overwhelming majority of which would return to their home country (potentially with the virus). Are you willing to make the risk?

       The epidemic was declared over in November 2016. Furthermore the research on Zika has not at all stopped. I personally know two individuals who are directly working with the virus. If you aren't involved in the field, you won't hear about MANY low risk epidemics all over the planet. Not everything goes international.

       The "activated by electromagnetic frequency" part is a bit jank, but the other things you listed can be done. Retroviruses can insert themselves into your genome and then stay silent in the lysogenic phase (yes it will replicate when your cell goes through DNA replication). HBV and Herpes can just chill in the nucleus for a while. HPV can accidentally insert itself into your genome, allowing the cell to have a much higher chance of becoming cancerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can potentially get all of these to activate by exposing the individual to whatever the virus finds as a "sign of stress".

       That's an interesting one definitely. There are many cases of cells reacting to EM waves in the visual spectrum, so it's not that unreasonable to think they could react to EM waves at other frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a couple of issues with this though in the context of "stealth viruses" (btw that term is really only used for computers, not biology :P ).
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The study specifically analyzed DNA loops, which includes stuff like bacterial Chromosomes and plasmids. Human cells don't have circular DNA, save for the mitochondrial chromosome.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Not all viruses use DNA as their nucleic acid. Not all viruses have a circularized genome.

       3) Usually cells that interact with light use some type of receptor (on the surface or otherwise), to kick start a signaling cascade. Good luck getting a receptor under the radar of human cells. A surface receptor will probably set off quite a few alarms. Local immune cells won't like that.

       That can be seen as a very pro-capitalist argument that ultimately arrives to the dismantlement of social nets and privatization of functions of the state. Based on historic examples from South America in the 70’s, and the privatization of US’s military apparatus, these tendencies have only perpetuated inequality and the power of the rich over the poor. But ideological and political implications aside, to stop giving welfare to the poor is a very rhetorical and hideous argument to make, just philosophically and argumentatively speaking. Instead of arriving to such conclusions one should think about perhaps think of measures that provide better education, which leads to people to become aware of the implications behind having many children.

       Uhm.......if you really want to know why we need to decrease population *(and we definitely do!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Its because humans are destroying the earth at an alarming rate and making animals go extinct and creating so much trash and pollution the earth cannot replenish it self as fast as humans are reproducing - and human populations are doubling every 38 to 40 yrs *(worldwide totals) and with each doubling of population comes drastic linear increases in pollution and trash and farming and cutting down trees and --- destroying the earth

       I think selected populations are targeted for depopulation. The subsaharan African population is exploding and many of those nations receive food aid. Why give so much food aid to third world countries if you truly want to see the population decrease?
      </p>

       However, people in Europe and other first world countries are encouraged to have fewer babies. I think they want to create a low-IQ world that is easier to control.

       I think there is selective depopulation of first world countries and encouagement of overpopulation of third world. I think there's a plan to mix these groups up and dilute the races so that they feel less of a connection to their homelands and are thus easier to control.

       They're not particularly worried about control. It's resource depletion that's the issue. Before the industrial revolution (1700s) there were fewer than 500m people worldwide with an average life expectancy around 40, and the annual growth rate was around .001%. Over the course of the next century, and With the help of the industrial revolution, the world population doubled to over 1b. With scientific and medical advances, the average life expectancy climbed to about 50 by the early 1900s and world population had grown another 50% to 1.5b.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all a quickly climbing trend. Now in the last century or so, world population has quintupled to a staggering 7.5b with an annual growth rate around 10-15% and average life expectancy over 75. This is even with war, drugs, cancer, natural disasters, processed food, and any other deadly thing you can think of killing people off every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine how vastly overpopulated the would be in a few decades (years maybe) if there was a cure for cancer tomorrow? If all wars just flat out ended today?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, maybe I'm jaded, maybe I'm an asshole, but even if I am just chattel to TPTB I can still see that my holding pen is starting to get a bit cramped, and something's gonna give eventually.

       True, but if you think about it, more children surviving birth is more taxing than people living longer, as far as resources go, since children are unable to contribute to the workforce.

       People don't talk about it because it's not really gonna happen. Depopulation would be bad for them because there wouldn't be as many people around to buy things and fight for them. It's not to say that there's things like the food and drugs that kill some of us off but that's a small percentage they're willing to live with. The cattle are more valuable alive than slaughtered.

        as a threat to their dominance. They realized that eventually a large number of people will inevitably overthrow and remove them from power. They are particularly concerned with the middle class whose intelligence and capacity to organize makes them the biggest threat. Consequently, the elite plan to destroy the middle class and make all the of public equally poor and thus incapable of rebelling. As written on the Georgia Guidestones, they want a global population of just 500 million. This means 6+ billion people must die over the coming century.

       <p>
        It is important to understand the the goals and beliefs of the eugenicists never went away. In fact, they have been conducting eugenics operations on the public in the west since world war II. Fluoride in the water, mercury in the vaccines and GMO crops all contribute to the creation of a sick, dumb and compliant population.

       Population Control Implementation (Hard Kill)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The overarching desire for population reduction has been implemented in two forms - hard kill and soft kill. The hard kill versions created in bioweapons research labs include AIDS, Ebola and SARS. These programs were designed for large scale population reduction.
       </p>

       Population Control Implementation (Slow Kill)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As Henry Kissinger said population reduction has different characteristics in different parts of the world. In west, the slow kill method has been implemented. This includes vaccines containing mercury and Simian 40 cancer viruses; fluoride in water supplies as used by Hitler and Stalin in their concentration camps; the introduction of the excitotoxin aspartame into the food supply; the presence of xeno-estrogen / bisphenol in plastics; the introduction of GMO crops and their well understood destructive side effects; the use of cell phones will result in brain cancer for millions in coming years as a result of the radiation; and the use of microwave ovens - which the Soviets banned in the 1970's due to the fact that they destroy the nutritive content of food.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, the combined effects of these programs has manifested itself with a 75% reduction in the sperm counts in the western males according to the UN (ask yourself why aren't the alarm bells ringing and a crisis announced to the public) and an increase in the rates of cancer from 1 in 66 to 1 in 3 over the past 50 years.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A critical aspect of control is the compliance and acceptance of the population of allopathic medicine and medical orthodoxy and its partner big pharma under which the population can be drugged. A critical part of this agenda is the suppression of alternative/herbal medicine and the advancement of Codex Alimentarius which severely restrict natural health products available to the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        Codex Alimentarius if implemented as scheduled by the end of 2009 could result in the deaths of billions of people from malnutrition and the diseases related to poor nutrition.

       Persistent Contrails (aka Chemtrails)

        While the true intent of the chemical spraying of the skies that has been going on full scale since the late 1990's is unknown, since the governments refuse to tell the public the true purpose, we do know that the chemicals being sprayed include aluminum, barium and cadmium, all of which have detrimental effects on the human immune system. Consequently, we could conclude they are softening the immune systems of the public for the upcoming pandemics which we are repeatedly told are inevitable (the spraying is fact but the purposes are speculative).
