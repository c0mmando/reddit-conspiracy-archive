        Under the assurances of these conditions, the results described above

        another OP that I submitted a while back detailing another FOIA-released documented from the CIA indubitably showing the proof of the continuance of personal identity independent of the physical vehicle
       </a>
       , here against lies yet another example where we find a document showing the CIA running tests and experiments and absolutely showing that psychic/psionic phenomena absolutely do indeed exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is the CIA we're talking about here - a global corporation, one of the strongest, most powerful influences on the entire planet.  They didn’t get that big and powerful chasing dead ends.  They aren't wont to waste time pursuing things that aren’t valid, don’t work, and don’t yield actionable

       My only conjecture is that this would have do somehow be brainwaves interacting with strings to harmonize then and allow the particles and thus atoms made of said strings to pass through one another unobstructed. It’s sounds out there but it’s the only way I can try to make sense while tying in physics and some unknown mental mechanism.

       What you’re talking about sounds like resonant frequencies and sympathetic vibrations, but what strings? Which is a fairly well known subject, especially in acoustics and musical instruments, but what’s the context? What strings?

       Morphic fields/Morphic resonance. The idea is that consciousness isn't located solely within the body, but acts as a field around the body. And morphic resonance could be a good explanation for psychic/telepathic phenomena. Check out Rupert Sheldrake! He's got plenty of decent lectures on the topic available to watch on YouTube. He's got one called "the extended mind: Recent Experimental Evidence" which is very good and I'd recommend.

       I don’t think I’m going that far but a wave is a wave and it has a frequency and a distance. I mean the whole idea of auras has tried to find backing from the idea that your body is emitting electromagnetic waves and other waves. The question is can we measure it at a distance? What’s this guys brain like with EEG nodes on? If everything really is motion or vibrational strings can you impact other strings through a sort or resonance or tuning? Cool thought at least.

       Personally, nothing exceptional. Just a much better ability to accurately predict and see outcomes of certain situations (i don't wanna say foresight, though to the outside observer it may appear that way, because I'd rather say it's as a result of a far better understanding both of time, and cause and effect). Also I would say I can "read people" far better from the get go than I used to be able to. This one, in my opinion, does seem rather exceptional with regards to the change in my ability. It's very intuitive and I feel it out, as opposed to attempting logical deduction and reasoning, which results poorly in my experience.
       <br/>
       On the extreme end of things, I think it's possible for people to exhibit full-on telepathic/telekinetic/pyrotechnic/clairvoyant/remote viewing abilities, but  to achieve these would require years of significant education, training, and exercise under conditions that promote their development. Look at shamans, gurus, and shaolin monks for examples of those extreme abilities.

       There's a whole slew of information online really.  Just look around and investigate.  Know that you'll likely find some charlatan/dead end oriented places, but don't let that discourage you, and know that at the end of the day, the phenomenon, again, is absolutely real.  Investigate online, look for whatever you can, don't get discouraged with shite sites, just move on past them, and continue educating yourself with regard to the reality of these abilities we have latent within us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also try to be as sensitive as possible to the moments in your own life when things might happen that you can't easily or readily explain.  You don't necessarily have to immediately jump to a "it must be psi!" conclusion, but don't go to the other end of the spectrum and immediately, unintelligently discard anything that happens as "definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being anything but basic, physical mechanisms going on."

       What I’m specifically researching at the moment involves president Dwight D. Eisenhower’s signing of the Secret Space Program into law and all the ins and outs regarding what happened there, so I don’t have much information specific to psionic phenomenon.  I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know of various figures that have accounts
       <em>
        involving

       psi phenomena, but it’s not anything specific to the subject, as their main subject isn’t directly related to it.

       I don’t see how declassifying and releasing this is disinformation. It’s 30 years later, which is standard except for matters of national security. How would this being available be beneficial or covering up their real crimes. The real crimes are already covered up. National Security remember? And calling people who take interest or investigate “idiots” is a big claim. What was your dissertation on? Statistically half the population are “idiots”.  What’s your Mensa score? Do you know your real percentile? Not to be rude but what you said sounded regurgitated.

       You sound like a person that's paid to make sure and discourage others from investigating valid phenomena.

       At least I hope you're getting paid and don't actually believe what you just so immediately said here.  The kind of unthinking, knee-jerk rejection you just demonstrated to something that's been demonstrated over and over again throughout history is something that only the most ignorant, and frightened individuals would engage in...unless, of course, like I said above, you're getting paid to do what you're doing here.

       Is it? Look how many people are duped -count the number of views on videos about “aliens”, “spiritual gurus”, “mind powers”, or the hundreds of other vacuous topics. 
Here are some valid concerns for elite crime. 
The use of cults-mind and behavior control, trafficking of drugs/weapons/humans, cloning and genetic engineering.

       Compile the information here with all the other accounts of psionic phenomena throughout the ages, and anyone would be pretty incorrect to discount what's accounted here regardless of whether it's "disinformation" or not.

       It's not really about "jarring" to me but about concrete reproducible proof.

      <p>
       It's known that the Russian "experimented" with it and then the US did too but that says nothing about the quality of the results or that both just did it in the end to screw with the minds of their opponents, aka. disinformation. It would definitely fit into James Angleton's modus operandi.

       Because things are complicated -
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       complicated, Daniel-san.  The cabal is globally powerful - yes, absolutely - but not
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, there are actually various globally powerful cabals working.  Various groups posses very powerful information and understanding/awareness of a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of extremely deep truths - truths that turns science fiction into 100% science fact.  Problem is, however, that these factions aren’t necessarily chummy chummy with one other, and some of them are actually in direct conflict with one another.  Some say “fuck these 99% piece of shit mouth breathing cattle.  Let’s just continue using them like the useless eaters they are, continue keeping them in the utter dark about what’s really going on in this world and universe, and keep taking advantage of them.”  Some other cabal factions say “We’re causing the species and thereby the
       <em>
        planet
       </em>
       and thereby OURSELVES harm by continuing to keep them so in the dark.  Let’s start trickling a bit of the truth out to them bit by bit.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And it’s some of those factions that have been disseminating information, little by little.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it all comes down to it, however, fuck the cabal factions.  I and many other humans didn’t need any “cabal go ahead” to have experienced psi and ET phenomena on our own and independent of them.  There are many individuals that have simply had first hand experience with what the rest of humanity has been brainwashed into thinking isn’t real - so it doesn’t matter that this cabal faction or that cabal faction or the CIA or whoever has documents proving it.  It’s all kind of “Meh.” to me since I’ve always known it’s real.  I’m just putting it out for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the cabal(s) control the MSM, and have convinced the majority of a monumental lie.  There are, again, various cabals at play, however, and some have been releasing more and more information to the generally gullible masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, many will need their “Big Brother Government!” to hold them by the hand and
       <em>
        tell
       </em>
       them “Yes.  ETs and psionic phenomena is all real.” before they go “Ohhhh!  Okay.  Then I guess it must be true if you say it is!!  Thanks!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the short answer to your question is essentially that the reason you’re getting info even though it’s secret is because there are various powerful cabal factions pretty much at war with one another and releasing/not-releasing ET and psionic information to the public.

       Look into the many lectures given by people like Marine Captain Randy Cramer, like Tony Rodrigues, like Andrew Basiago, Kevan Trimmell, and the great grand daughter of president Dwight D. Eisenhower - Laura Eisenhower.  They all speak extensively about the cabals (especially Captain Cramer) and the influence various factions within it wield.

       Good post, OP. Keep this stuff coming. To anyone in doubt about the big picture- smoking DMT will convince you of "paranormal abilities" and that the world is not the meaningless materialist thing we've been told. Biggest lie there is.

It’s all kind of “Meh.” to me since I’ve always known it’s real.  I’m just putting it out for others.

       At the end of the day, the cabal(s) control the MSM, and have convinced the majority of a monumental lie.  There are, again, various cabals at play, however, and some have been releasing more and more information to the generally gullible masses.

       Unfortunately, many will need their “Big Brother Government!” to hold them by the hand and
       <em>
        tell
       </em>
       them “Yes.  ETs and psionic phenomena is all real.” before they go “Ohhhh!  Okay.  Then I guess it must be true if you say it is!!  Thanks!”

       Either way, the short answer to your question is essentially that the reason you’re getting info even though it’s secret is because there are various powerful cabal factions pretty much at war with one another and releasing/not-releasing ET and psionic information to the public.
