    <div class="md"><p>If you really want to delve into the intrestingness of quantum mechanics, check out quantum field theory. In an ELI5 version (which is really the best I could give you because I dont know the math behind it):</p>

<p>For each of the 17 different types of elementary particles, there exists a field that permeates throughout all of spacetime, with (almost) infinite excitation corresponding to (almost) infinite particles. A local excitation of this field gives you individual particles. Normally, the particle is in a probability distribution because it is a part of this wave that permeates throughout all of spacetime. But then in order to make a measurement upon the particle, you must disturb it. Normally this means hitting it with a photon (EM wave). When the EM wave interacts with the particle&#39;s wave, it causes the particle&#39;s wave to collapse into a specific state, the probability of which can be found from the square of the wavefunction. This is how QFT is the basis of our QM observations. So QFT says that every particle is just a part of an energy field that permeates throughout the entire universe, and the interaction of a local excitation of these energy fields with other particles causes these fields to locally collapse into what we consider as the classical particle with momentum and size.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If reality is an &quot;illusion&quot;, then the obvious question to ask is: &quot;What isn&#39;t?&quot;</p>

<p>Because the word illusion means that there is something there that is not an illusion, something more real than what we term, reality. In my view, reality isn&#39;t really an illusion per se, at least not in the way most people use that term - it is more like a gradient of realness, where parts of it are very real and solid, while others are far more ephemeral and transient (this is related not only to physical phenomena, but also subtle phenomenon, including beliefs and thought forms).</p>

<p>In general, reality is is very real, but there is something even more real than the world around you, your body or your mind, all of which are phenomena that are various gradients of reality/illusuon.</p>

<p>That thing, the most real thing, is you. It is your deepest self, it is the freedom, peace, the stillness behind all phenomenal experience. That Being is present both as you and as the core foundational and source element of all existence. It is the Source from which all reality springs. It&#39;s basic flavours are that of love, peace and joy, but ultimately it is beyond even that and from it all phenomena, both gross and subtle spring. It is the Unmanifested, the Tao, the Void, Source, Being, Nothing and Everything, the Alpha and the Omega, some call it God. </p>

<p>If you allow yourself to be still, take a few deep breaths and let go, at least for a moment, of all thoughts, emotions, sensations, beliefs, identifications, past, future. ....and allow yourself to simply rest as being, as the &quot;I am&quot; of awareness, you will experience that stillness and peace, which is the scent and fragrance of that which is changeless, timeless, spaceless and beyond all conceptual understanding. </p>

<p>I should add that the end goal should be to experience this more and more in your daily life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not an illusion. The Wheeler test is about trying to find out how and when a photon &quot;decides&quot; to be measured as a wave or as a particle. The solution - or the bit that has been &#39;solved&#39; - is that the photon is neither a wave nor a particle. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the measuring instruments that we designed, and the way we use them, that makes us think photons are &quot;shapechangers&quot;. They aren&#39;t, they are just ambiguous in a way that is very hard to think about.</p>

<p>The jury is still out on most of Wheeler&#39;s stuff, but the core of the experiment doesn&#39;t prove that reality is an illusion. Only that, in some very very limited circumstances, two empirical certainties about the same phenomenon can be mutually exclusive.</p>
