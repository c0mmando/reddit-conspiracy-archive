    <div class="md"><p>I’ve heard a couple, one is it was mind control but it failed. Another was to break the Russian programming but that’s weak because none of the Russians were loyal to the ideology they were loyal to their country. And the one you stated as well, a method of truth serum. They show case that in the good Shepard film. I believe they are all true except one thing they didn’t fail. They discovered other methods of remote control. Hell getting lone assassins to go out on limb for a suicide missions goes back to ancient Mesopotamia. I think LSD only proved to be a good time so that makes me think that is a shallow theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget, &quot;MK Ultra&quot; is more often used as a go-to &quot;alt&quot;-media conspiracy excuse than it&#39;s likely ever in practice in this day and age.</p>

<p>For example, you&#39;ll often see it mentioned as likely being used to programme mad bombers, schools shooters and the like; thus safely detracting from the fact said so-called crazy perps never existed in the first place, as did none of their claimed victims.</p>

<p>&quot;Occam&#39;s Razor&quot; is often the best tool. The true conspiracies are much more in-your-face, it&#39;s just that no-one is thinking clearly any more - and that&#39;s to do with other tentacles of the same overall all Swiss+Vatican+knights+masons global socialist conspiracy. When you already run everything it&#39;s very easy to co-ordinate grand scale fraud. Now have firms like Image Metrics and software such as Adobe VoCo - and with the sheer amount of info passing through us without time to process correctly - by the time any flags errors several more frauds have been perpetrated upon the global populace while the dissenting voice has already been buried by corporate socialist big tech&#39; on their digital platforms.</p>
