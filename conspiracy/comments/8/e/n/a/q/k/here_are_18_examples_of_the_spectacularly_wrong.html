       <li>
        <p>
         Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In January 1970, Life reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say,
         <code>
          Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say,
         </code>
         I am very sorry, there isn’t any.’”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”

       Shit, you're telling me you found
       <em>
        18
       </em>
       wrong predictions out of the literal millions that have been made since the 1970s. Crazy, science must be a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a bunch of those examples involve guys who aren't scientists in the relevant field, were giving a general opinion, were making predictions that were lambasted at the time as unrealistic, or said things that were true then and continue to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only overall prediction that really had widespread concern and turned out wrong was mass starvation and overpopulation. The population boomed as predicted, but humanity got way better at producing and distributing food than many people expected.

      <p>
       That's kind of circular, because by nature an "alarmist" is someone who got it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in general predictions of average temperature rise and sea ice decline have been largely accurate and followed models.  If you want I can find dozens of people saying "temperatures are going to rise in the next four decades," but you probably get the gist.

       You really don't believe a single scientist made a correct prediction in The Year of Our Lord 1970?  I mean, that's a proposition so absurd it's not worth taking effort to disprove -- anyone believing something so ludicrous is certainly going to just move the goalposts if evidence is presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the whole point is that it doesn't matter what 18 people happened to say. What matters is whether the scientific community as a whole is moving towards a better consensus understanding of the situation.  And temperature rises over the last decade fit well with the climate models as they've been refined over time.  You can go back to the early IPCC reports and global temps have stayed within predicted bands.

        Medium post cataloging published papers from the 1970s
       </a>
       , which generally predicted a rise in global temperatures:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One of the early quantitative predictions of global warming came from J.S. Sawyer, who predicted in 1972 that by the year 2000, atmospheric CO2 levels would rise 25% and that global temperatures would rise 0.6°C. In fact, CO2 didn’t rise 25% until after 2010; temperatures rose about 0.5°C by 2000 and about 0.7°C by 2015. The prediction was remarkably accurate, considering that it came before the first computer models, it came before the climatologist community had fully analyzed the issue, and it came during a global cooling trend.

       I am copying my other comment here....
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof requires evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Models are not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try not to think of it as "right or wrong," or "black and white." Everyone, climate scientists, paid activists, politicians who have a clue, all acknowledge that there are many factors that govern the surface temperature of the planet. One such factor is albedo - the ability of the surface to reflect incoming radiation from the sun. If we do something that changes the albedo of the planet, the amount of energy the Earth absorbs changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that having been said, we humans have managed to affect the albedo of a significant percentage of the planet - maybe not most of it, but certainly the number is greater than zero. So, with that fact alone, the theory of human influenced climate change is validated. Of course, that is not what you are asking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is "does the emission of GHGs from the burning of fossil fuels cause enough damage to the climate that we should be worried about it? Can you point me to peer reviewed science that addresses that question?" To answer that, we need to look at a number of factors. What is the actual ECS and/or TCR of an increase in GHGs - most importantly CO2. There are peer reviewed estimates of ECS that range from 0.2º all the way to 4º. Which one is correct? How do we know?
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Circulation Models that are being used to estimate the near future surface temperature anomaly from known CO2 emissions have been shown to over-estimate sensitivity by as much as 3 times. This is why, in only 35 years of estimating, they have managed to over estimate the near future (five year) temperature every single time they produce an estimate.
       <strong>
        Not most of the time, every time.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at the 1988 predictions, the temperature anomaly would be nearly twice as high today as the central estimate suggested, let alone the high end of the projection. We just barely make it into the lowest end of the range, sometimes. We spend other times below the lowest boundary of the estimate.
       <strong>
        This means that the estimates are wrong.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, recently several climate scientists have written papers cutting the long-term rate of change in half, saying "we have more time" rather than, "it's only half as bad as we thought." The "you should be very worried about the future" estimates are all high end of the possibility scale findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the scary stories you see that justify doing whatever it takes to combat climate change are several times higher than the central estimate, and the central estimate was at least twice as bad as observations. What does that tell you about our need to rush about and make drastic changes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the theory of Climate Change wrong? Well, if by wrong do you mean "exaggerated by a factor of 3 to 5?" if so, then yes, it's wrong. and you don't have to go looking for some obscure result by a right-wing scientist to find that. It's main-stream science published in most of the highly respected journals today.

       All of your evidence is just copy pasted from the same source, because it's oil company lobbyists on one side, and the entire global scientific community on the other. The only source for your bullshit graph is Roy Spencer, who has made a career of being wrong about climate science in exchange for money for decades. He gets paid to tell you what you want to hear. He does it by lying. The journal that published that paper later rescinded it for not adhering to basic scientific standards
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The problem is that comparable studies published by other authors have already been refuted in open discussions and to some extend also in the literature (cf. [7]), a fact which was ignored by Spencer and Braswell in their paper and, unfortunately, not picked up by the reviewers. In other words, the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view (which was later unfortunately much exaggerated by the public media) but that it essentially ignored the scientific arguments of its opponents. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The graph was made with nonsense data:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Spencer focuses on the temperatures measured far above the Earth’s surface in the troposphere and the stratosphere. Generally, over the past few decades these two scientists have claimed the troposphere temperatures are not rising very rapidly. This argument has been picked up to deny the reality of human caused climate change– but it has been found to be wrong.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What kinds of errors have been made? Well first, let’s understand how these two researchers measure atmospheric temperatures. They are not using thermometers, rather they are using microwave signals from the atmosphere to deduce temperatures. The microwave sensors are on satellites which rapidly circle the planet.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some of the problems they have struggled with relate to satellite altitudes (they slowly fall over their lifetimes, and this orbital decay biases the readings); satellite drift (their orbits shift east-west a small amount causing an error); they errantly include stratosphere temperatures in their lower atmosphere readings; and they have incorrect temperature calibration on the satellites. It’s pretty deep stuff, but I have written about the errors multiple times

       <p>
        It’s important to recognize that there are four other groups that make similar measurement estimates, so it’s possible to compare the temperatures of one group against another. The new paper, completed by Eric Swanson and published by the American Meteorological Society compares the results from three different groups. He focused on measurements made over the Arctic region. His comparison found two main differences amongst the three groups that suggests the errors.

As obvious and serious errors in that analysis were made public, Spencer and [current ESSC Director John] Christy were forced to revise their work several times and, not surprisingly, their findings agree better with those of other scientists around the world: the atmosphere is warming.

       Jesus Christ you're illiterate too. I'll just paste the relevant section in case anyone who isn't an idiot is reading this, since you're obviously too far gone to acknowledge reality:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So why, after a more careful study of the pro and contra arguments, have I changed my initial view? The problem is that comparable studies published by other authors have already been refuted in open discussions and to some extend also in the literature (cf. [7]), a fact which was ignored by Spencer and Braswell in their paper and, unfortunately, not picked up by the reviewers.
In other words, the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view (which was later unfortunately much exaggerated by the public media) but that it
essentially ignored the scientific arguments of its opponents. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal. This regrettably brought me to the decision to resign as Editor-in-Chief―to
make clear that the journal Remote Sensing takes the review process very seriously.

       Here is the
       <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/climate/intro_background.jsp">
        National Science Foundation introductory page on climate change
       </a>
       . It lists some of the many, many pieces of basic evidence of climate change. Every single one of the topics below on the NSF site is linked to the research paper from which the findings were drawn so you can read the science yourself.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The evidence we have for a changing planet goes well beyond any one field of science or engineering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ecologists have noted marked changes in the habitats of the species they study--changes in the places where they find a particular species, changes in the dates plants first sprout and bloom, changes in plant growth rates and even signs of evolutionary adaptation brought on by a warming climate. In some cases, species extinctions appear linked to climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ocean scientists have recorded higher temperatures and higher ocean acidity, which alter the characteristics of the most fundamental organisms of the ocean food chain. Coral reefs--some of which have thrived for centuries--have died off suddenly as a result of ocean temperatures that exceed the corals' ability to survive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Polar scientists have watched vast tracts of Arctic sea ice melt away, leaving behind more open water than anyone can remember seeing during any previous Northern Hemisphere summer. Glaciologists have witnessed ice shelves--once thought too large to be influenced by anything short of cataclysmic environmental change--break up into a churning sea of icebergs in a matter of days.
       </p>
       <p>
        Social scientists have recorded the bewilderment of indigenous people. Their cultural knowledge, which stretches back in time through numerous generations, holds no record of the kinds of environmental conditions they are encountering today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paleoclimatologists have discovered--through tree ring data, ice cores and other corroborating records--that the concentration of carbon dioxide, and the Earth's average temperature, are nearing levels that haven't been reached for hundreds of thousands of years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When you're done getting the most basic introductory information, head on over to Google scholar and search for "climate change" and just start looking over the many thousands of studies from thousands of different researchers all around the world, using different methods testing different hypotheses in different fields that all add up to the same conclusion. And that's before even getting into the specific sub-topics like permafrost methane, deforestation, thermohaline circulation, etc.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which part of this is wrong, exactly? Industrialized and industrializing nations face environmental problems. This is well documented and easy to observe. If unaddressed, those problems can threaten their survival and habitability in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the
       <em>
        very next one
       </em>
       on the list:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, what's wrong here? It's true, if you don't have efforts to curb pollution and conserve resources, you will eventually deteriorate living conditions, and pushed far enough, whole populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pretty basic stuff. There is nothing factually wrong with that statement. All it is is a statement saying, "For our long term good, we should do a better job of protecting the environment."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's supposed to be an example of something "spectacularly wrong?"

       As for saving the world, the world literally was saved in the 1970's when cooler heads believed in science and banned ozone depleting CFCs. That would be after Earth Day started, and a direct result of environmental consciousness.

       Wouldn't it be more productive to explain why you don't think humans are impacting the planet's temperatures?
      </p>

       Some general predictions some dudes made 50 years ago really doesn't carry all that much weight imo. A whole hell of a lot and more has been done in the sciences since then.

       I didn't say that. I am not a climate scientist and don't have that formed an opinion. What I am saying is the predictions, based on models have been wrong for 40 years. When your theory does not stand up to experiment , it is wrong.

       But science stopped a long time ago... as soon as Climate Change became a religion.

       Their predictions, obviously, were (mostly) wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The models for interpreting the earth's climate are constantly evolving, adjusting to new data all the time, and today we know more than we ever have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course a bunch of dudes from almost half a century ago are gonna get some stuff (very) wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smartest people have made the weirdest predictions, for example Einstein didn't think plate tectonics would pan out, or that quantum theory made any sense, Chaplin was convinced TV would never take over from live theater, Ford's peers thought he would be out of business soon because the car fad wouldn't last, some random dude I can't remember his name thought the USA would need 4, maybe 5 computers at the most and see where we are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't perfectly analogous, but my point simply is that those old predictions were made using equally old climate models that they interpreted how they wanted to, and their fear was "what kind of world I'll be leaving my children, and their children" and gave voice to their concerns that maybe, just maybe, we do have a lot more affect on the health of this planet than we give ourselves credit for. And then described the worst case scenario they could think of in the realm of possibilities, because for all we know, they could (have) be(en) right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather avoid the potential problem all together, rather then just keep trucking and get to the point of no return, just to be absolutely certain.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think "Climate Change = Religion" then I'm no so sure you know what a religion is.
