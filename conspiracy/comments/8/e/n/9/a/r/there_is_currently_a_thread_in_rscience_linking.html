       is the thread.  This is the most blatant display of vote manipulation I've ever seen.  19k points, but nearly ever single comment is talking negatively about the study.  The mods have left it up so far, even though it is a terrible study, but I bet they take it down soon since the comments aren't panning out as they expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually nice reading all of the comments, and it appears that a lot more people know that we are all being manipulated than "they" want us to think.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which an unskilled person makes poor decisions and arrives at erroneous conclusions, but their incompetence denies them the metacognitive ability to realize their mistakes. The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority, rating their own ability as above average, much higher than it actually is, while the highly skilled underrate their abilities, suffering from illusory inferiority. This leads to the perverse situation in which less competent people rate their own ability higher than more competent people. It also explains why actual competence may weaken self-confidence: because competent individuals falsely assume that others have an equivalent understanding.”

       Which bring to the forefront how the term “conspiracy theorist” is bullshit.

       So many people who just ask questions trying to understand what is beyond the text get swept up.

       Agreeing with these statements makes you a conspiracy theorist:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places,"
       </p>
       <p>
        “Even though we live in a democracy, a few people will always run things anyway,”
       </p>
       <p>
        “The people who really ‘run’ the country are not known to the voters,”
       </p>
       <p>
        “Big events like wars, economic recessions, and the outcomes of elections are controlled by small groups of people who are working in secret against the rest of us.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...sounds about right, actually! Doesn't make those statements inherently false just because you attach the term "conspiracy theory" to them.

       I never downvote submissions unless they are blatant reposts. I do upvote posts whether I agree with the content or not if I read them and leave a personal comment on it. This is my take on using the system. I dont downvote some person because they submit an article from some legitimated source just because I dont like the article.....thats kinda self centered.

       I really think most authentic users see through it. Though I am of the opinion that Reddit comment sections are almost always 50% bots/shills. I think if you removed them you’d see a very different comment section. I mean I don’t run into these type of turds in real life. A good portion of people are down to discuss and entertain a conspiracy in real life

       If you check the comments, lots of them were deleted (suspicious) but the ones who weren't still didn't agree with the article's narrative. I don't think there's nearly that high a number of bots or "shills" (in the actual sense of the word; people being
       <em>
        paid
       </em>
       to knowingly throw disinfo online).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a bigger problem throughout the site where anyone who disagrees with a certain worldview is labeled a shill. But just like labelling anyone a racist, a Nazi, etc., it dillutes the word's meaning and just creates a mock term. I don't think most users take the accusations of shilling seriously nowadays, exactly because of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shill should mean malicious knowing disinfo intent. There's few of those. But by calling everyone you disagree with a shill, the actual shills can masquerade in the background while real users (liberals most of the time) just mock the accusation. We're a part of the problem, believe it or not.

       Well, that depends 100% on where you live. IRL discourse might be totally different on one coast of the US or the other, not to mention other countries... Personally I've never, ever talked conspiracy theories with people irl, at least not the kind that you see on this sub. So I really think it comes down to what you perceive discourse irl is vs discourse on Reddit.

       my biggest beef with this is that questioning American exceptionalism is usually the first step we in the US take into the "conspiracy" world. Just off the top of my head, I'm thinking of how RT used to present itself a decade ago. I mean, Abby Martin and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being: they're shifting the goal posts now. a conspiracy theorist a decade ago was questioning 9/11 and the american empire. Now it's just dog whistle for Trump supporters, I guess.

       i think you missed the point of the original topic. When they refer to collective narcissism, what they are talking about is more like an intense nationalism that suggests superiority, kinda borderline third reichy sort of thing. This, in turn, leads to the belief that anyone who tells you otherwise is part of a large conspiracy to try and subdue that thinking. Sort of like how trump keeps referring to a ''deep state'' that has absolutely nothing to do with whoever is really pulling strings under the surface.

       a LOT of people care about their fake internet points.  Sometimes I'll go back to a back-and-forth I was having with someone to see if anyone else replied to them and their comments are all deleted at 0 or -1, -2 votes.  It's crazy to me that people are willing to post something but unwilling to stand by it when when people dont agree

       Worth noting, the term collective narcissism showed up in a news article earlier today. I can't remember what publication but basically talking about Trump supporters. Sounds to me like the phrase du'jour.

       I find it very strange that a conspiracy theorist would even agree with the statements the researchers said associated with narcissism. One of the most popular conspiracy theories, one that overlaps into many other conspiracy theories and is the foundation of the creation of the term itself, is that the US govt is not to be trusted. With this in mind, it does not seem likely that a sampling of people who identify with the term “conspiracy theorist” would agree to the statements in the study (‘the world would be a better place if the US was taken more seriously’ ‘I don’t like when people criticize the US’ ‘the US deserves more respect’ I’m on mobile so I cannot pull up all the questions now so I am paraphrasing. A person posted the statements in a comment on the original post).
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who don’t trust their government would likely be leery of their government’s heavily involvement in world affairs. And if one does not trust their government, suspects the govt is trying to harm its people (or is ambivalent to the people’s needs), believe there are bigger powers controlling ones government, then that person is extremely critical of their government and nation themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most conspiracies boil down to a strong distrust of and heavy criticism of the government and nation as a whole. Whether it be anti-vaccination conspiracy beliefs, chemtrails, Sandyhook conspiracy, Vegas Shooting conspiracy, fluoride in the water supply, the existence “Illuminati” and/or Freemason, Bohemian Grove, alien coverups, pizzagate, lizard people, the moon landing hoax and other alternative history beliefs,  or the one that started it all... the JFK assassination conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all fosters a distrust of the government and a lack of respect for the US as a nation. So this study just does not add up to me.
