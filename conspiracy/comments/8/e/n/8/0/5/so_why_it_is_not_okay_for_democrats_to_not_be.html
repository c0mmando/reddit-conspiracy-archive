       Let's not forget how much Republicans and conservatives lie and slander to get their way.

      <p>
       My favorite part is the "tax you at 90%". Such lies from conservative capitalists with money. He really told these people Bernie is going to leave them with only 10% of their pay. I like to think conservatives aren't stupid, so I say they lie!
      </p>
      <p>
       Had Democrats adopted the Bernie meme. Republicans would have branded them as socialist commie liberals coming to take your guns and tell you they are female. Uh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie was independent his entire political career until now. Democrats want to remain capitalist and somehow that's the big crime. I highly suspect real Trump supporters and shills use this strategy of virtue signaling constantly. Among lie because they will stop at nothing to win or change the culture instead of letting it evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah there's a lot of socialists in the U.S.A. Lot of people don't even know how socialist/communist they really are. So maybe Bernie would have gotten the 100,000 votes between three states difference. He also might have lost the rural areas because we all know how American they are and how much they hate socialist commies the Republicans are against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I know the easy response is going to be, "Well, they colluded with media". It's pretty clear Fox News is an arm of the Republican party and it's as big or bigger than all the liberal networks put together. It seems like liberals like different networks but Republicans all like to go to the same source so they can all get on the same page with talking points.

       And let's be honest. Popular vote isn't how this nation decides its president. It's entirely an irrelevant argument. Especially considering the fact that without the state of California, Hillary would have lost the popular vote and the electoral college by one of the largest margins in history. California is just home to the largest number of fake leftist neo-fascists in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, most likely the largest number of fake voters.

       Fuck the Democrats this is about actual democracy, and the 2 party system IS THE PROBLEM. Not being a slave to the corrupt democrats was arguably Bernie's most appealing quality, and it alone made him more qualified than any other candidate running by a large margin. If they agreed to let him run in their primary, as they did, then yes, HE WAS ABSOLUTELY ENTITLED TO A FAIR CHANCE AT WINNING THE NOMINATION! This is not even an arguable point.

       Oh really? Your state has open primaries?

       I didn't realize independent, democrat and republicans can vote for whoever in whatever parties' primaries in your state.

       That's the only way you can actually have a democracy where the final two are even somewhat decided by the people. Closed primaries are for fascists.

       TBH, even though the media was for Clinton as well as the DNC establishment, I think the votes would have spoke loudly if Bernie had the Democrat support in the primaries. In a lot of states you can't vote in Democrat or Republican primaries without being affiliated with that party. Which makes sense, the party is figuring out who to run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton barely beat Bernie in California. But still a recorded win. Which gave the democrats the go ahead to stay capitalist. Which is what my post was about.

       Hey man.....we’re a sanctuary state! And since we’re already giving them sanctuary, what’s the big deal if we give them free healthcare and schooling and support their families? Also, they’re going to need a drivers license so they can drive around right? And if we’re already giving them everything an American Citizen gets, why shouldn’t they vote for the people who gave them all the free stuff?

       Again it's not difficult to understand that the popular vote has nothing to do with electing the POTUS.  Plenty of boxers have lost a fight where they had more points.  And like Hillary's POTUS run, it's because they got knocked the fuck out.

       I don't agree with some socialists about free college. While in theory it sounds like an investment of sorts, that would cost entirely too much money. I think medicare for all is doable. Since an insurance company is just a company that takes your money with other people and might some to help get you healthcare.
      </p>

       Unfortunately that's how Bernie hooked the young people. Free college over healthcare or just both.

       It only costs a ton in the United States because universities are spending massive amounts on marketing,top level admin salaries &amp; stadiums.

       Most of the time people talk about this violence against free speech is because they want to express "white" ethnic nationalism without receiving hate.

       Yeah we have other laws that address violence.  It's called assault, battery, attempted murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your don't get to commit violent crimes against people you disagree with.  The first amendment ensures that the government doesn't claim to have special authority to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we stop assaulting people or encouraging other people to assault people.

       There is a huge difference.  And I'm not a troglodyte because I disagree with you.  Also I've seen you on here for a while and you openly support using violence against people speaking so I don't believe your shit excuse for your name.  Just admit you support violent communist.

       The worst thing about Antifa violence is that it is mob rule, dope fiend violence. They won’t attack one on one and they prefer to catch you when you aren’t looking so they can throw a punch and then run away and hide behind black bloc. They are complete cowards and the only reason they get away with it is because the media is complicit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they don’t just “punch Nazis”, they knock old ladies to the ground who are waving American flags, they slap peoples phones out of their hands that are just standing on the side watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s pretty sad when the Nazis they claim to be standing against behave better than they do. Not to mention, there just aren’t that many Nazis in the US so most of the people they are attacking are just regular people.

       I guess this means they know he is going to run again. Good news. I need to start stockpiling free printers/ink on CL, Paper, sign pickets, and manila envelopes for information packets for the campaign.

       -He also might have lost the rural areas because we all know how American they are and how much they hate socialist commies the Republicans are against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude you have no idea do you? In the 1930s-1970's farmers &amp; rural workers almost exclusively made up the Socialist Labor Party because they felt the establishment (bankers &amp; pols) intentionally caused the great depression to bankrupt people &amp; buy their assets for pennies on the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until the Reagan era you had Socialists meetings by the thousands in small backwoods areas for socialist conventions/picnics during the summer time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know because my family was all farmers/heavy equipment operator/repairers when I was growing up &amp; I was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have old custom vinyl cut live recordings of thousands of people meeting for massive socialist conventions around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all working people with hard labor jobs from every race &amp; ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie went under the Democratic party because he knows the commission in charge of presidential debates will NEVER ALLOW anything except establishment grifters/criminal Dems or Repubs up on the 'debate' stage with all vetted preapproved questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are either naive or at the very top of the food chain if you think the Dems or Repubs are working to help the common person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie isn't even considered a real socialists by socialists. He just wants a better deal for students &amp; workers instead of them basically being debt slaves,eating shit on job forever &amp; have decent healthcare.

       Here is the reason you are naive and grasping.

      <p>
       You are grasping because you only reply to one small portion of my comment &amp; ignoring the main statement of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are naive because you had a choice to pay for an overpriced degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefit of free college education is that we end up with a higher median level of education which helps society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all people will take advantage of it, but having a less educated more easily manipulated populace is not the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you afraid of that someone will get something you had to pay for in an overpriced unjust glossy university marketplace that places a very small value on actually educating students?

       Sounds exactly how Hitler's youth would justify violently intimidating their ideological opposition.  Which hilariously enough is exactly what the Nazi movement did in it's early days along with a couple of other abominable political movements.
