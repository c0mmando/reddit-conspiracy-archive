       <strong>
        Facts:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact 1.) In 2012, the Obama Administration attempted to pass the "Smith-Mundt Modernization Act (2012)".  This would have allowed the U.S. government to LEGALLY use propaganda on U.S. Citizens without their knowledge or permission.  It was stopped at the house.
       <br/>
       Fact 2.) In 2013, the "Smith-Mundt Modernization Act (2012)"
       <em>
        in its entirety
       </em>
       was inserted in to H.R. 4310, and passed as law since nobody bothered to read down to section 1078 to catch it.
       <br/>
       Fact 3.) Prior to 2012, the U.S. averaged 1-2 "mass shooting events" per year.
       <br/>
       Fact 4.) In 2012 alone, there were 7.
       <br/>
       Fact 5.) Since 2012, we've averaged 6 "mass shooting events" per year.
       <br/>
       Fact 6.) The Trayvon Martin shooting was in 2013.  This is when Obama announced that the thug involved in the attack "could have been [his] son."
       <br/>
       Fact 7.) Since then, we have seen dramatic negative changes in relations between:  Sexes, Races, Sexual Orientations, etc.
       <br/>
       Fact 8.) Yuri Brezhnev (Prior head of KGB Propaganda 'Ministry of Truth') warned us in 1986 that they had been working on the U.S. for "25 years" to push the "Socialist / Communist / Welfare State agenda" and that it had "worked better than we had ever anticipated."  Check out his interview on YouTube.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Theory:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point after the USSR fell, the "Deep State" realized that they could pick up where the KGB had left off.  The groundwork had already been laid to turn the U.S. into a Communist country, and had been for 25 years.  They realized that this would allow them to be in power permanently, and essentially turn us into an oligarchy with themselves in charge.  So they began work to complete the KGB's 4 step process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even before Obama, as far back as Bush Sr. and the Clintons, the groundwork was being laid.  9/11 was a strong jumping off point.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time Obama took office, the "Socialists" (liberals/sjws/regressives/etc.) were poised to create the "crisis" required for step 3.  According to the KGB plan as laid out by Yuri, a "crisis" was needed that would take 5-6 years to completely destabilize the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama started the final phase.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his first term, his job was to destabilize the economy.  Laws were passed, and executive orders passed
       <em>
        that would purposely destabilize the economy
       </em>
       .  Welfare skyrocketed, unemployment, recession, etc.  For the first time in history, in 2011, the U.S. lost its AAA credit rating under Obama's guidance.  The national debt doubled, the existing health care system was destroyed, forcing the taxpayer to finance unpaid college loans skyrocketed college costs, and put the young socialists deep into debt, unable to find a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2012, while drafting the act that would ALLOW them to LEGALLY use propaganda on us, they
       <em>
        began tests to see if we were ready
       </em>
       .  Those tests resulted in the drastic spike in mass shootings in 2012.  The propaganda was enough to spur the mentally unstable over the edge, and start giving the government the excuse they wanted to disarm the law-abiding.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2013, they legalized the propaganda entirely, and started in earnest.  It started with Trayvon Martin. Bit by bit, the Obama government split us along race lines, gender lines, sexual orientation, religion, etc.  The goal was utter destabilization in order to allow for a true "crisis" that would make the people more likely to agree to a complete replacement of the existing government (step 4 of the KGB plan).
      </p>
      <p>
       With propaganda in full swing, there was
       <em>
        no question
       </em>
       that Hillary would win.  They could cover any illegal actions easily enough, and those less ethical ones were now at least "legal" - once they won.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they didn't win.  Despite having Soros buy the companies that made the voting machines, despite having millions of illegals vote, despite having untold dead votes, despite having untold people vote multiple times, it still wasn't enough to win.  They didn't expect it, and didn't see it coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's job was to create "The Crisis" to allow them to dismantle the democratic republic, shred the constitution and start over.  So what is "The Crisis?"
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Islamic Extremism
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply import millions of backwards thinking people who want to put wraps on the heads of women, murder gays, and enact Sharia Law on U.S. soil.  Get them angry, and let them start a small "civil war" that "the government" can then swoop in and "fix" after "being forced" to shred the constitution.
       <em>
        Islam was the left's "end-game."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But President Trump won.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Trump is a businessman.  Whether he saw the overarching plan of the past 50 years or not I don't know, but he definitely saw the decisions that were destroying the economy.  His first move was to simply "undo" a ton of the damage Obama had done with his Executive Orders
       <em>
        by doing nothing more than negating hundreds of Obama Executive Orders
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Deep State is desperate to unseat him because not only do they have a chance of going to jail, but he's
       <em>
        undoing decades of work
       </em>
       .  The damage he's done to the deep state (uniting gays / minorities / conservatives / moderates / classic liberals / etc. against those that would destroy the country, rebuilding the economy, spurring patriotism, etc.) is unknowable.  I imagine he's already done at least 10 years worth of damage in the gun rights arena alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they are attempting a scramble now on 3 fronts.
       <br/>
       1.) Kick up the time table and try to implement the "End Game" anyway, without Hillary in office.  Thus the fights to get Islam rooted into U.S. soil.
       <br/>
       2.) They desperately need to get enough seats in the house to prevent themselves from being put under investigation.  This means spewing as much propaganda (through the Soros owned media) as possible to unseat the GOP in the mid-terms.
       <br/>
       3.) Take back the presidency in 2020.  They
       <em>
        have to take it back
       </em>
       before President Trump is given any more time to win any more Americans over to his side.  According to Yuri, it takes
       <em>
        one generation
       </em>
       to undo the damage the KGB did.  And if President Trump serves 2 terms - 8 years - Making America Great Again, there's a very high probability of another non-socialist (not necessarily Democrat) in 2024.  If THAT non-socialist gets two terms, that's 16 years of patriotism - enough to start us down the track of permanently reversing the damage done by the KGB in the 50's and 60's.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is their final push.  It's now or never for them.  THAT'S why they're out of their minds.  THAT'S why the U.S. is in this chaotic state, and THAT'S why we're seeing increased attacks from both Islam and the Mentally Ill world-wide.  The propaganda used to trigger the ill can't differentiate.  Finkle IS Einhorn!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the irony here is the very propaganda used to spur the mentally ill into violence - their goal in order to justify disarming us - is also spurring Islam into violence - which is negating their goal to disarm us, as well as showing their hand too early for their "End-Game" crisis.

       If you've never listened to Jordan Peterson, he too believes the education system is important. And he would know. I believe Andrew Breitbart had a theory that everything started at the Frankfurt School.

       Regardless of how Marxism was seeded here, everything does flow from universities. Our youth are mortgaging their futures and being indoctrinated with ideologies that are counterproductive to Western Civilization.

       So say we've done that, what then? I guess we don't have to vote, but to be honest, due to the radicalization of the far left I feel I have no choice but to vote for the right. Don't get me wrong, I wish there was a third option, but their not getting through anytime soon. So what now?

       Forget left and right. The entire Truth movement needs to focus on educating the rest of the general public, that they are essentially feudal slaves to a system of a ruled by a class of elites. We need to show them that the political aspect of left vs right is a tool this class used to divide us, and our entire lives this class has sucked off of our labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What information/research did you do, to wake you up? Show the people you love and those close to you the same information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the cocksucker elites are now pitting
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       , the truth movement against one another with different sides and factions, so it's becoming increasingly difficult to unite us, let alone the general public. However, what are your options? Keep trying, or give up. Giving up sounds pretty depressing and humiliating to me personally, so I will keep trying to educate the masses, probably until I am dead. Regardless of what people tell you, there is a massive political awakening unfolding. Even the elites themselves admit it.

       My sisters (now in their 30's) were both homeschooled.  They were "socialized" with all of the extra curricular activities (eg; soccer, piano, karate, theater, ad infinum).  There were also just general "social" events.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they did spend considerably more time around adults than "normal" kids, and as a result they both were very smart, and mature for their age.  They could hold a conversation on current events in their mid-teens, and today both are very successful.

       Perhaps you're blinded by your desperation for a "savior" to take down the elites? It's not going to happen with a president,
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       need to unite and wake the masses, to show them that the table is tilted.

       No political demagogue is going to do that for you, you're being fooled into lending your support to the very person we need to shine a light on.

       The conspiracy community needs to drop this Trump favoritism and partisan-right bias, it's holding us back.

       I'm putting no "faith" into anyone.  I'm living in the world as is is today, and doing what little I'm capable of to wake up others to what they can do to change it in some small way. You seem to have some unknowable goal that convinces every "dissenter" that they have no power. What's wrong with you? Do you really feel so impotent?

       Personally, the hysteria from the mainstream media -- despite losing profits and ratings, combined with the attempted suppression of conservative voices on YouTube, Facebook, twitter, and yes, rddit -- are a pretty good indication that SOMETHING about the Trump presidency is different.

       I agree with your sentiment... but I disagree about Obama intending to destabilize the economy.  If he had wished to destabilize it, all that needed to be done was let those various banks fail which were in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead....he signed off on taxpayers lending to ((the bankers)).  People with money at that tremendous dip in the stock market did extremely well.

       I disagree.  I think the banks are very much a part of the Deep State, and how the Deep State is being funded.  They
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to take care of their own.  And it only gives them a bonus if they can add to the national debt by doing so, then reroute the "re-payments" by the banks when they come back, diverting the funds to their own slush funds.

       No, so I can understand what i'm "actually" looking at. I apologize if I come across as rude but I don't take everything I read on reddit at face value.

       Ah.  Fair enough.  I'm just used to that being a "get out of debate free card".  I have no intention of writing up an APA formatted paper every time I post on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act">
        original Smith Mundt Act
       </a>
       laid out the rules for the U.S. to use propaganda, specifically stating it wasn't permitted for use on citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5736/text">
        So for the Smith Mundt Modernization Act
       </a>
       , this is the one that was allowed to just die in the house in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4310/text">
        Here it is in its entirety, stuffed into the NDAA under section 1078.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The important sections are here:
       <br/>
       Section a. clarifies that the Internet is now included in this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       b.1:
       <em>
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors may, upon request and reimbursement of the reasonable costs incurred in fulfilling such a request, make available, in the United States, motion pictures, films, video, audio, and other materials disseminated abroad pursuant to this Act
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This effectively allows the government to use propaganda "made for other countries" on American citizens.  Repeal of the Smith-Mundt Act outright would've been too obvious, so they used a go-around to completely neuter it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do throw this sneaky bit in:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In General.--No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what they've already said is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Nothing in this section may be construed to require the Secretary or the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make material disseminated abroad available in any format other than in the format disseminated abroad.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, so long as the propaganda is "intended" for use abroad, it's perfectly fine to use it on American citizens too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now ask yourself, why was this "modernization" act written at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I strongly recommend watching the Yuri Bezmenov videos on YouTube.  They're a giant eye-opener.

       I'm not the one putting faith into political demagogues for actual "change". That's pathetic. Good luck though 👍

       My sisters (now in their 30's) were both homeschooled.  They were "socialized" with all of the extra curricular activities (eg; soccer, piano, karate, theater, ad infinum).  There were also just general "social" events.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, they did spend considerably more time around adults than "normal" kids, and as a result they both were very smart, and mature for their age.  They could hold a conversation on current events in their mid-teens, and today both are very successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to public school and I'm a social pariah.
