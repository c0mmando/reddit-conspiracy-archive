        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You all may already be aware of this, but I wasn&#39;t. Last week my reliable old-fashioned washing machine died, so I went shopping for a new one. I discovered lots of the new appliances are Smart Appliances and connected to the internet! They respond to voice controls. You can use your phone to control them while you are away from home too.</p>

<p>So now, not only is your Smart TV watching and listening to you, but also your washing machine and stove (if you purchase one of these).</p>

<p>Here is a link to an article telling all about how wonderful these new Smart Appliances are!</p>

<p>Submission Statement: This is my first post using the Submission Statement rule, so I&#39;m not sure what to say except that they are determined to listen/spy on us in every room of our house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Parents urged to boycott VTech toys after hack</p>

<p>Cybersecurity experts have said parents should boycott or at least be cautious of VTech&#39;s electronic toys because of how it has handled a hack attack.</p>

<p>They gave the advice after it emerged that VTech&#39;s new terms and conditions state that parents must assume responsibility for future breaches.</p>

<p>More than 6.3 million children&#39;s accounts were affected by last year&#39;s breach, which gave the perpetrator access to photos and chat logs.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35532644">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35532644</a></p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s also the issue of surveillance. If every product becomes connected then there&#39;s the potential for unbridled observation of users. If a connected fridge tracks food usage and consumption, takeaways could be targeted at hungry people who have no food. If a smartwatch can detect when you&#39;re having sex, what is to stop people with that data using it against the watches&#39; wearer.</p>

<p>“In the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,” James Clapper, the US direction or national intelligence said in 2016. Wikileaks later claimed the CIA has been developing security exploits for a connected Samsung TV.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The good news is you&#39;d have to manually connect it to the internet, and wise decision not doing so.  &quot;The Internet of Things&quot; has the equivalent of a rubber duck holding a squirt gun in terms of security, and are specifically sought after as weaknesses in a network.  I would NEVER connect it.  </p>

<p>I fear internet connectivity will become required to fix known issues eventually...issues purposefully put in place to <em>get</em> you to connect it.  Hopefully I&#39;m wrong and just being my usual paranoid self! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting really tired of everything being capable of connecting to the internet. Oh but the convenience! And? It&#39;s things like this that slowly turn me into some sort of Luddite. We already know hackers can hack into the cars. What&#39;s going to stop them from hacking ovens, turning them on in hopes to burn down your house? Shut down your refrigerator to ruin your food. </p>

<p>My ma had to replace the A/C unit to her house and they installed a  Smart A/C unit so you can control it from a phone app and the company has the ability to access the Control Panel to run diagnostics. After it was installed, she and I supposed that, considering we live in California, at what point will the State just access it and shut off our units during &quot;peak hours&quot; to save on electricity usage? It&#39;s not like they already do that in a sense with brownouts or blackouts.</p>

<p>Who I truly feel bad for are those who install home security systems that connect to the internet. </p>

<p>We have enough technology to:</p>

<p>Harvest free energy from the sun/wind/tides</p>

<p>Fly using drones, which are powered from free energy.</p>

<p>Hydroponics that can be powered from free energy.</p>

<p>Water recycling facilities that cane be powered from free energy.</p>

<p>Yet, we spend our time and precious metals making a fucking washing machine that...I don&#39;t know, what does it even fucking do?</p>

<p>This &#39;convenience&#39; excuse I hear all the time is just a marketing bullshit buzzword. People make out that they are super busy in their lives, but in reality all they want to do is finish their chores so they can sit in front of the idiot box and watch another &quot;omgz super important sports match of the century : 5&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern stoves don&#39;t have pilot lights, they use a piezo igniter (that clicking sound) that automatically engages whenever the gas is turned on.</p>

<p>So if one is worried about remote access to a stove the hacker (or whomever) would have to figure out a way to extinguish the flame before they could fill the house with gas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some stoves have a specific part of the dial where the piezo operates. If you start in the section outside of it, you could still do as I suggest. Not to say they won&#39;t have safety hardware preventions, but it could be modified.</p>
