    <div class="md"><p>What I think a lot of theorists get wrong is the idea that mainstream media provides a narrative or a dominant theory.  They don&#39;t.  They repeat things that other people have told them up until they are told different.  The media doesn&#39;t even claim they are facts or the truth.  That&#39;s why they are called &quot;stories&quot;.  Because it&#39;s a story.  </p>

<p>But their stories stand up to rudimentary checking.  Conspiracy theories don&#39;t begin that way.  They take a story and then assume a lot of motivations and explanation which do not stand up to the same level of scrutiny.</p>

<p>&quot;Then pentagon was hit by a missile on 9-11.&quot;  There&#39;s no proof of that.  Or I should say, there is the same amount of proof of that as there is that it was blasted from space, or that a vending machine in the C ring became self-aware and then committed suicide.</p>

<p>There is some proof that a plane hit it.  There is contemporaneous eyewitness accounts.  There was plane debris found at the scene. etc.</p>

<p>If you start to question that, e.g. if you question that the plane debris isn&#39;t froma plane but from a missile, even though you have no direct expertise about plane debris or missile debris, then you have to question everything.  Is Donald Trump really the President?  Is the map of the world really the actual map?  Do you live where they tell you you do?  Etc.  You&#39;d have to question every single fact the same way, and you end up with &quot;we live on a flat earth in an Illuminati simulation of Aleister Crowley&#39;s brain.&quot;</p>

<p>The part of the media narrative to question--that reasonable people always question--is the conclusion.  For example:</p>

<p><em>&quot;There were gas attacks in Syria.&quot;</em><br/>
Ok, I guess.  I wouldn&#39;t know either way, so sure, what the hell.  Gas attacks in Syria.
<em>Therefore the US has to go to war in Syria.</em></p>

<p>Wait, why do we have to do that?  That doesn&#39;t follow.  </p>

<p>See the difference?  Accepting the facts ast the media presents them doesn&#39;t automatically mean accepting the conclusion.</p>

<p>No.  Just theories.  Zero proof that Hillary the DNC or anyone beyond a robber killed Seth Rich.</p>

<p>But there is proof of scummy internet sleuths and smear merchants are being sued for this nonsense:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aaron Rich&#39;s lawsuit seeks damages for harm to his reputation and emotional distress, among other things, against Butowsky, Couch, America First Media, and The Washington Times for suggesting he played a role in the supposed email theft.</p>

<p>The suit alleges those people and media companies pushed a conspiracy theory about Aaron Rich that used his background as a defense contractor with technical expertise to suggest he worked with his brother to leak DNC documents to Wikileaks, received money for doing so, and then worked to cover-up the crime.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, if we get proof then great, but in the meantime, you can&#39;t follow a bunch of tangential leads and then say, yeah, there&#39;s proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zero evidence for Seth Rich? Assange hinted that he was the source of the DNC leaks and one of the Podesta emails contains a statement that he would make an &quot;example&quot; of any suspected leakers. In my mind, that warrants a certain degree of skepticism regarding the official story.</p>

<p>The elites are a relatively small circle of people that seem to cross paths quite often. Although probably on the low end of the spectrum, I would still consider the Podestas and the owner of Comet one of them due to their connections and influence. The podesta bros and the owner of Comet seem awfully obsessed with pedo art. I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t want them babysitting anyone&#39;s kids.</p>

<p>On specific topics such as the ones you&#39;ve brought up, most of the real people in this forum would already be aware of the official story, so there really isn&#39;t any need for others to blindly reiterate it with general statements such as &quot;it&#39;s been debunked&quot; or &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot;. We already have heard this by the time the subject reaches this forum. Unless more detail and hard facts are offered up that counter the ideas presented in this sub, parroting the official narrative with empty blanket statements is really a waste of your time.</p>

<p>And then your last paragraph is more conspiracy gatekeeping.  I&#39;ll make it simple:</p>

<p>I hate shitty weak no proof theories that then become believed as some kind of gospel.  I poke holes in those theories. I also hate lies.  A lot of these theories started as political lies.   The two together are in my ballywick.  They make me happy.</p>

<p>&quot;George Soros is trying to bring about the one world government by funding uprisings in the US&quot; is not an opinion, it is a positive assertion which is either factually correct or it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like that cartoon which depicts two people looking at a numeral from both sides one sees a 9 and the other a six.  The cartoon implies they are just seeing things from different angles and both are correct but this isn&#39;t true.... It either is a six or a nine, they just don&#39;t have sufficient context to know which.  Later more information may be discovered proving the number is in fact a 9.

    <div class="md"><p>On a fifty fifty position each one is equally valid  but only one is factually correct.  Correct is better than valid. </p>

<p>The number reflects something factual whether or not you can actually determine the answer.  So in the case that it is actually impossible to determine which is correct then the correct stance is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; not &quot;I think it&#39;s 6&quot; or &quot;I think it&#39;s 9&quot;.  But if you are going to hold an opinion either 6 or 9 and you put it out there along with faulty reasoning then you can expect others to shoot that logic to bits. Especially if the belief you hold could impact important actions like how to vote or who you should hate or love. Etc.</p>

<p>The best arguments are those where I&#39;m proven wrong.  I gain by better aligning my world view to reality.  People already believe they are correct for the most part, so they gain nothing personally from winning an argument. </p>

<p>But the idea that any idea has an equal chance of being correct and should be given Credence is not a basis for a Logical world view.  How do you ever establish a cogent and coherent model of reality of you have to view every possibility to explain a set of circumstances as valid until the issue is settled.  This is why I and many like me prefer a skeptical world view.  I will believe something once sufficient evidence has been presented and before that I reserve judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of reasons that trigger a conspiracy theory. They generally stem from one piece of information that doesn’t make sense.  That others may turn from and just say, oh well it’s probably one of those things. But I for one have an inquisitive mind. </p>

<p>Let me give you some examples. </p>

<p>9:11. Enough expert proof and testimony to the fact wtc7 was demolished. The owner and John Kerry said the words. “Pull it”. These are very credible and worthy points to investigate.  </p>

<p>Sandy hook. No triage used, kids declared dead in the school, no injuries. </p>

<p>Moon landings: the picture of the C rock and the fact that the astronauts looked so damn guilty at the press conference </p>

<p>Boston bombings: crisis actors that appeared to have been at sandy hook. </p>

<p>Syria gas attack: well everything </p>

<p>Jfk:  so many witnesses to a grassy knoll shooter. Plus a witness and police mishandling. </p>

<p>Each one has various different anomalies that when stacked up start to form a picture. Naturally some investigation means filling in the blanks but then so does the official narrative. “They were just nuts”. “They wanted to destroy our way of life” etc etc. Very convenient. </p>

<p>We get tatted with the brush of nutters with nothing better to do than create problems. But whilst people do question the truth it means others can’t just steam roll through and we can try at least, to ensure people question what they are told and think for themselves again. </p>

<p>Skeptic is one thing. Trying to belittle and name call is a another. I’ve found myself in a nice fight with four or five “skeptics” in the moon landing post. </p>

<p>Now I throw the ball in space. And the ball indeed should fly forward. The energy in my arms should still transfer into the ball. But because the ball has no weight it doesn’t force against the chair sliding me backwards.  </p>

The horizontal force to push a bowling ball is the same in gravity and in relative zero g or zero g. Weight isn’t some magical property it’s just the force of gravity pulling the mass inward.

<p>when water comes out of a hosepipe with high pressure it is simply chucking out
weight, and thrust is weight why do you think rocket engines are said to create pounds of thrust, so then what are pounds.....see pounds are weight. the explosive gasses of a rocket engine on earth are chucking more weight out than what the rocket  weighs thats why it goes up. In space the water and the hosepipe wouldnt have any weight so  no recation would take place .  have you ever asked yourself why all the satellites and space station included are all only in orbit, there is not one item of any sort further than orbit because they cant get there. they call something a space station but in fact it is not in true space it is still in the earths boundarys which we call orbit and guess what thrust works there and guess why?</p>

<p>Of course, flat earth is a good example. Flat earth I personally think is wrong, but almost every debunker I&#39;ve come across doesn&#39;t take the topic serious at all.

<p>Flat earth is one of those special cases that you can see is wrong just by taking a passenger aircraft flight. They exists. The whole melting temp of steel and the moon landings one also fit in this category for me. It&#39;s on people who support those very exceptional cases to disprove very overwhelming evidence. If somebody provides evidence the earth is flat then I&#39;ll be very happy to change my view but given they haven&#39;t people who believe it* kind of deserve the derision.</p>

<ul>
<li>I always thought of the flat earth thing more of a thought exercise which i totally buy and it&#39;s interesting in that respect. However, there are people who actually believe that the earth is quite literally - physically - flat and there&#39;s a conspiracy to convince everybody it isn&#39;t which makes no sense at all from literally any perspective even if you&#39;re very very open minded. It&#39;s a red flag to me - it&#39;s the kind of thing that makes people who don&#39;t believe in conspiracies very generally assume the people involved have mental health problems.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there, and no where near 100% are true. I&#39;d be surprised if 10% of &quot;solid&quot; conspiracies were true. </p>

<p>Makes kind of sense then that in a community like this, there&#39;s automatically going to be a lot of disagreement on what&#39;s true or not. </p>

<p>Some who do the debunking might not want in-their-opinion-wrong conspiracies to taint their own which they think are correct, simply by association. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at it like an attack then maybe your views aren&#39;t as rational as you think they are.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give anybody the benefit of the doubt, but if you expect people to not point out fairly blatant errors, especially when you&#39;re in somebody&#39;s area of expertise you&#39;re out of your mind. For example I have no trouble believing the <em>potential</em> of some of the 9/11 stuff but I&#39;ve not ever, once, seen any actual <em>hard evidence</em> supporting it, often there&#39;s fairly basic engineering and science failures underpinning the claims like the steel beams melting temp stuff that evolved into a meme is just <em>so absurd</em> it&#39;s hard to even laugh at; it&#39;s vomit inducing. There are still people who believe this stuff. Also by the way on conspiracy theory points when you have countries that are at effectively war and competition and one side acknowledges what the other side did like for example lets say as a completely wild example - landing on the moon - you are probably going too far.</p>

<p>I find conspiracy theories utterly fascinating, very few of them I believe but I think they say a lot about us as a species - not all of it good, but it is what it is. Conspiracy theorists shouldn&#39;t be afraid of constructive criticism and people providing alternative views and data, it&#39;s how we learn - or at least it <em>should</em> be. If conspiracy theories become all about dogma then you become the very thing you&#39;re really trying to fight against. It should be about truth and facts not memes and gospel.</p>

<p>Conspiracy debunking is just as interesting as coming up with them in the first place. I&#39;ve never seen any evidence that the objective of this sub for example is a place devoted to people who only support theories. I have an open mind and I personally believe that&#39;s all I need to be able to post replies here; but there&#39;s being open and there&#39;s ignoring things that are blatantly invalid and allowing them to sit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I value truth and knowledge more than almost anything. I value solid logical thinking. I don&#39;t mind speculation, but it holds little appeal without at least some sort of proof. </p>

<p>I dislike fantasy, and the deliberate or wilful ignorance of someone who chooses to live based on nothing more than belief; there is a certain wishy-washy type of thinking that leads people to fall for new agey, spiritual, crystals and psychic Star children feel good bunk that really gets under my skin.</p>

<p>The truth fucking matters. There are people being paid to spread disinfo far and wide; if the truth didn&#39;t matter, this wouldn&#39;t happen. The truth fucking matters. </p>

<p>9/11. 3 steel framed buildings fell due to &quot;fire&quot;; no other steel buildings had ever collapsed due to fire before. Building 7 was never struck by a plane. There are so very many strange details of things that happened on this day. </p>

<p>We know that war is used by the people in power for their own ends, to accumulate money or power, and it is not in the interests of the people or the greater good. </p>

<p>It takes all kinds to make the world go around. We can not find the truth, without debunkers. The truth fucking matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To you, someone&#39;s way of life may seem like willful ignorance, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true. Your way of thinking isn&#39;t the only way, nor is it necessarily the correct way. Everyone is different.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seriously believe that these &quot;debunkers&quot; are the sole reason for truth, do you?  In reality, most of them are mindless, and simply regurgitate other peoples findings. A great example of this would be the 9/11 scenario:  You obviously believe the towers fell due to controlled demolition, and for good reason. How many &quot;debunkers&quot; have you seen on that topic telling you otherwise? And of those people, how many had their own genuine and logical reasons for thinking so?</p>

<p>Using 9/11 to strengthen my point: I feel that on this topic, the people that believe the official story should be trying to prove that story true, not attempting to disprove the opposite.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some:</p>

<p>There are people out there that think conspiracies should be presented with something more than a knowing name drop. It&#39;s not that they disbelieve or disagree, it&#39;s that they think it does a disservice to the conspiracy community to not address their ideas in a rigorous manner. If we are to talk about the thin veneer of &quot;the truth&quot; as presented by mainstream media and history, we need to be better than that. Even saying &quot;full evidence is possible due to the nature of the conspiracy,&quot; is better than just saying &quot;conspiracy so there.&quot;</p>
