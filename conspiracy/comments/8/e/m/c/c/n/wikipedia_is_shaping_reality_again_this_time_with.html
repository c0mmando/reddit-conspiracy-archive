       Hey guys! They're literally referring to you here. Up to and including all the comments sure to pop up ITT which continue the Russo-Iranian narrative in support of the Assad regime. Its kind of interesting to watch geopolitical conflict take place in realtime on the internet's battlefield. I'm not even saying the accounts that parrot this propaganda are actually all Russian bots. Those guys found plenty of alt-right saddos in this country to carry on the message for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its so telling that the one defense so many Assad supporters keep coming back to is that Israel must be behind opposition to Syrian regime in power. As if supporting radical Sunni groups in opposition to Assad would pay off so well as to be worth the potential for further chaos next door. But you guys think Israel devised ISIS so there's really no attacking this with logic, is there?

       true true but typically when i want to reach a particular site via google, i have to add the site name in the search to guarantee the result, for example "is obama the antichrist snopes."

       Why is it always Israel and liberals who are responsible for the world's woes? Whenever you infuse a theory with your own political biases you instantly loose credibility.

       Every second week a conservative is caught with his pants down, yet "pizzagate" was all about the DNC. If you genuinely believe this type of sex abuse goes on, and that all sides aren't involved, then you're delusional. This is why people like me post threads to TMOR. I use to love this sub but the levels people go to, to demonise the left, are ridiculous. It just comes around as biased ramblings

       When the leader of the organization is refused entry to the US on terrorist grounds it gives you a good understanding of the checkmate situation the US has gotten itself into regarding the white helmets
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny truth is that there may be small slivers of truth involved with white helmets being an organization that helps out in crazy situations - in fact Iâ€™d be disappointed at the propaganda effort if not - however they are western funded to tune of hundreds of millions (openly admitted by uk via Boris Johnson) and itâ€™s painfully obvious that the UK and US want to overthrow Assad at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theyâ€™re (the white helmets) inseparable from terrorists however and no doubt involved in the massive propaganda effort to portray Assad as an evil man.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the evidence exists for this and is so well known by alternative journalists is worrying. To deny it now means that western journalists must either live exclusively in a bubble of western propaganda or be so thoroughly uninformed and misinformed that it begs the question - how!!?

       covers it very well.
The harm caused by things like paid trolls for pesticides or various industries like soft drinks, mobile phones, oil and drug companies, it huge.
The worst bit is, that when you debate someone online, they can just refer to Wikipedia and ignore all the issues with it.
You can ever state that Wikipedia is a known tool for powerful interests who spread doubt, and they'll laugh you off.

       They lie about history and politics to shape current day political agenda. There are lies everywhere and some of them are so in the open that people don't even question it.

       For example, Syrian conflict was labeled as 'Syrian Civil War' right out of the gate. In reality its a foreign proxy armies trying to destroy Syria and its leaders in an attempt to take that land. There is nothing civil war-y about it.

       While Wikipedia is easily compromised in terms of having the politically charged aspects of any given entry be a likely target for obfuscation,  I've found that it is very reliable if your intention is too find what concepts and other entries are related to (and therefore linked on) your initial entry search. This helps me to quickly discover new topics in relation to my original topic of interest whose deeper meanings and context etc.. I can flesh out elsewhere outside of Wikipedia if I so choose.
