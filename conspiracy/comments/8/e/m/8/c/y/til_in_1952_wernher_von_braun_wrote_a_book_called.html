    <div class="md"><p>That is pretty sweet. I have been watching through the Marvel Cinematic Movieverse, and can&#39;t help but feel like it might be doing something similar. Mind you, it is pretty far out there, but you have the earth being invaded by aliens and the technology being reverse engineered to be weapons by a secret organization called Hydra. Then you look at the AI getting out of control, and you start to get an eerie sensation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very interesting how the collective conscious creates our reality, independent of events in time. Philip K. Dick wrote a short story and then had the same exact thing happen to him in real life years later--then wrote an essay about it. We can manifest our reality through intent, whether passive or active. Someone writing about a leader on Mars being named Elon primes time to create a leader named Elon. The X-Files episode on a plane being flown into the twin towers, combined with the unconscious expectancies of a terrorist attack happening in the future after the bombings, primed all of reality to anticipate and expect a large-scale terrorist attack on the twin towers, which manifested itself in time. </p>

<p>McKenna had some interesting ideas about time, how it&#39;s not linear like we perceive, but events sort of cross over and reconnect and create events in time, like a line doodle swooping and intersecting and tangent-ing across a page. An event in 1970 can influence an event in 2000, and an event in 2000 can influence an event in 1970. It exists on a dimension we don&#39;t perceive, because we only perceive reality washing over us, rather than seeing the &quot;big picture&quot; of reality we live in. </p>

<p>This story probably inadvertently created the possibility for Elon Musk to become all hype about colonizing Mars, and lead the way. If this all sounds hyperbolic and crazy to you, that&#39;s fine. But time and events in it aren&#39;t as simple as we&#39;d like to believe.</p>

<p>There is also the element of the potential for the human unconscious to &quot;unconsciously&quot; delve into, and perceive the future, as Phillip K. Dick talked about in his essay on his short story manifesting reality. Like we can dip into time and learn about events in the past, or the future, regardless of whether we were there. Like when events in fiction become reality, and not just vice-versa. Organic psychedelics also have the ability to allow us to examine time outside of human events, as Paul Stamets talks about with his vision of seeing &quot;a field of dead cows&quot; and then a month later being at a flood where there were hundreds of dead cows.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &quot;time-traveling&quot; conspiracy or anything, or Elon&#39;s a robot, or a Martian, or blah blah blah--it&#39;s way more likely (as wild as it may sounds) that reality and time are much, much weirder than we know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it seems that infinite realities do exist, but your consciousness can only experience one at a time. Due to this, there is some level of control as to which reality your consciousness chooses to inhabit. Not sure where I read this idea, but...

Every time you try, your consciousness &quot;shifts&quot; to the reality in which you survive, the gun jammed, so on so forth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah sounds like you&#39;re talking about quantum suicide! Very interesting concept. I do believe in infinite reincarnation, and I think that when you kill yourself you generally come to in your astral body, looking back at the life you just lived and analysing it. Though I suppose that there&#39;s no reason why quantum suicide shouldn&#39;t occur in some cases. Say, you commit suicide, then come to in your astral form, realise that wasn&#39;t what you were meant to do with that life, then jump back in to a parallel timeline where everything was exactly the same until that moment (much like a video game save file) and then forget that out of body interim experience, because that would be incomprehensible to a human brain... Well, that, and what&#39;s the fun in life if we know all the cheat codes? </p>

<p>and even more likely still is that its a coincidence, or even that part of Elon&#39;s interest in space travel is knowing that reference to his obscure name</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with that. To me Elon comes across as someone with a lot of stuff going on on the inside, but in order to express(and sell) that stuff he has to find the words to make it understandable for everyone. Which leads to a lot of stuttering and such as he searches for easily understandable words.</p>

<p>Ie he sounds like a smart guy trying to be understood by the unwashed masses. Also maybe a tad of Asperger or autism, or at least a large dose of introversion in the mix. Watch his eyes, he looks down to the right all the time in interviews, which means he is searching his memory/internal belief system for the answer.  The implication being that whatever he is asked about, he has already thought it thru and is looking for the same chain of logic he once followed himself in order to answer.</p>

<p>He is either genius or above average smart with a rich inner life and a compulsion to think constantly.</p>

<p>He might very well have recieved the task to take mankind to Mars by TPTB, but he is genuinly passaionate about it at the same time.</p>

<p>Also consider that he started Paypal because he dislikes banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s not so much time and reality is weird but that we can influence our reality around us by the things we think and the intentions we focus on.</p>

<p>People talk a lot about coincidences and synchronicity and when you notice it in real life it really hits right to the core of your being as you realize you&#39;re more than just a physical body that has to &quot;manipulate&quot; the physical world.</p>

<p>We can create our realities and our life&#39;s however we want to yet thousands of years of fear has held us back, and made us think we are not as powerful as we really are and that we can&#39;t create the life we want to unless it&#39;s through &quot;hard work and working for the man and paying your taxes&quot; </p>

<p>There are a ton of books on this and the spiritual journey to the light will answer many questions about life and the meaning of why we are here. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I agree with everything you said after personal research into this and the implications are so amazing that I wish more people discussed it and talked about it.</p>

<p>Love and light, thanks for posting your perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two possibilities the way I see it:</p>

<p>1] Braun can see the future.</p>

<p>2] There has been a multi-generational plan to control the colonization of Mars down to the name of the person that will lead the movement to colonize mars, and be the spokesperson and advocate for said colonization. Oh, and Braun was aware of this plan, too.</p>

<p>Elon, the name, has its origins in Hebrew. Elon Musk was born in South Africa.</p>

<p>Coincidences do happen guys. What evidence do we have to suggest that this is not a coincidence. Genuinely interested.</p>

<p>Some translations say &quot;sky&quot; instead of firmament but those translations could have been more recent when translators took it upon themselves to literally change the &quot;word of God&quot; because they didn&#39;t think there was a real firmament. I find it interesting that Braun supposedly became more of a Christian and less of a Nazi occultist toward the end of his life, and could possibly have found a conscience. He allegedly leaked to his friend the elite&#39;s plan for the masses which included a fake alien invasion. The mentioning of the firmament on his headstone seems like it could have been a kind of deathbed confession.</p>

<p>Kabbalah having merit would mean Elon Revees Musk, Kerosene Velum (Falcon 9 uses kerosene as fuel)and Von Braun&#39;s Elon the Martian are all related pieces of a part of the universes superstructure, glimpsed as coincidences but nothing of the sort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Werner von Braun is well known to those who remember the Apollo moon landing. During the Ford administration, von Braun was almost awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom—until one of Ford’s senior advisors, David Gergen, objected to his Nazi past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He designed the most powerful rocket ever Saturn 5. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Von Braun&#39;s team, which was transferred to NASA&#39;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville in 1960, went on to develop the Redstone, Jupiter and Saturn rockets that launched America&#39;s space program. Von Braun became the center&#39;s first director, and presided over the development of the world&#39;s tallest, heaviest and most powerful rocket, the Saturn V, which lofted Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon in 1969.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://newatlas.com/falcon-heavy-saturn-v/53090/">Falcon Heavy vs Saturn V</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the two-stage Falcon Heavy has nine Merlin 1D main engines in each of its first stage elements burning supercooled liquid oxygen and kerosene to <strong>produce 5,548,500 lb of thrust</strong>. Then the second stage takes over with its single Merlin 1D engine to punch 210,000 lb of thrust</p>

<p>now let&#39;s look at the Saturn V. Its S-IC first stage has five Rocketdyne F1 engines that, when set loose, generate a <strong>staggering 7,610,000 lb of thrust as it burns kerosene and liquid oxygen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Wiki</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The origins of the Saturn V rocket begin with the US government bringing Wernher von Braun along with about seven hundred German rocket engineers and technicians to the United States in Operation Paperclip, a program authorized by President Truman in August 1946 with the purpose of harvesting Germany&#39;s rocket expertise, to give the US an edge in the Cold War through development of intermediate-range (IRBM) and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). It was known that America&#39;s rival, the Soviet Union, would also try to secure some of the Germans.</p>

<p>Von Braun was put into the rocket design division of the Army due to his prior direct involvement in the creation of the V-2 rocket.[8] Between 1945 and 1958, his work was restricted to conveying the ideas and methods behind the V-2 to the American engineers.[citation needed] Despite Von Braun&#39;s many articles on the future of space rocketry, the US Government continued funding Air Force and Navy rocket programs to test their Vanguard missiles in spite of numerous costly failures.</p>

<p>Little Elon probably got pshyked about mars by reading this very book, or his father named him after the character for the same reason and his son ended up sharing his interests for space exploration.. who knows!
But I cannot help but think about his name, &quot;Elon&quot;, from &quot;Elohim, meaning &quot;God&quot; or &quot;the one that came from the stars&quot;... also there&#39;s some theorys about Elohim being the name we gave the aliens that came on acient times and accelerated our evolutionary process, but that&#39;s a whole other matter for another post, lol</p>
