       This combined with the waterboarding thing makes him one of the most dishonest and least trustworthy people on TV.  Not to mention the daily bullshit he spouts.  Sean Hannity is  a terrible person, he's 2 faced and a piece of shit liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sean Hannity is a part of the media that tries to convince people, mostly the right wing, that it is poor people who take hand out from the govt that are our enemy.  That somehow the poor, with their govt dependance, are destroying our country.  Yet he. Gladly takes millions from the govt.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this revelation it is now more obvious than ever that the media in conjunction with the highest positions In our govt (in this case, the president ) is pushing a distract and divide agenda.  This is proof that can convict anyone.  And the reason they do this is because they are afraid of a unified populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say, let's give them something to truly be afraid of.

       Media, like politicians, are defenders of wealthy class. They are there to make sure that people are divided and that they fight each other. What they don't want is people waking up, uniting, and holding the rich people accountable for the damage they have done. You see, immigrants didn't move factories to third world countries, nor are they introducing automation.

       Given Hannity’s annual salary of $30m+ and apparently a bunch of shell company profits on the side, he’s very much a part of the wealthy class. A man’s entitled to defend his own people right?

       Hannity literally talks to Trump regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's propaganda stemming from the highest position in the US. The media itself is a propaganda tool, but he's one on his own rather than because of the network influencing his reporting.

       Any media whose goal is to manipulate the thoughts of the masses through selective disclosures, conscious manipulation of information, and pandering to emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Hannity decides for himself what he reports on, but that he actively decides to report propaganda that he knows for certain is untrue or a false representation of the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty others who do this, but I feel like a majority have simply fallen into the business side of media and blindly report whatever serves their beliefs or what they consider to be the ideal political ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hannity is knowingly spreading propaganda because he's a piece of shit with no integrity. Others (based entirely on my flawed intuition) seem to just be ignorant or flat put stupid people with no integrity.

       eh, Maddow has a liberal slant but she pretty much just presents news. Hannity shouts his opinions, and has done so for things he has a personal stake in without revealing that personal stake. His rhetoric towards the (completely legal) Cohen raid was alarming and that was even before we learned Cohen was also his lawyer

       The only thing I was stating originally is that there seems to be a coordinated effort to smear Hannity right now (and for multiple reasons, not just one story being talked about everywhere). The fact that Hannity is coming under so much fire right now, makes me suspicious.

       To be clear, I'm not "defending" Hannity for anything. If anything, I'm arguing that he's just as much of a shitty newscaster as anyone else on cable. It's the people here trying to defend newscasters they like as being "legitimate news" while Hannity is just 100% propaganda.

       And yes, I had a lot of questions when Brian Williams go canned too. If reddit, and Apple news, and Twitter, and every cable news channel was pushing articles about what a piece of shit George Snuffalufagous is, I'd ask the same question which is.... I wonder what they know...

       I didn't mean to make it sound like Hannity was the only talking head who spews state sponsored propaganda. I agree that Cooper and Maddow are trash, and I actually disagree with their politics moreso than Hannity, but there's just something about the way the dude talks and the way that he conducts himself off the air that gives him a few extra slimeball points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how to articulate it exactly. It seems to me that he has more I dependent control over what he does, yet he actively chooses to spew bullshit because it serves him personally. For the others it seems part of a larger ideology, while Hannity just seems to enjoy that he's got so many people hanging onto his every word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: I'd rather have lunch with Cooper or Maddow than get a quick coffee with Hannity, and I have no idea why. Just a skeevy feeling about him.

       Better question. Why is this in this sub? To all crying hypocrisy out there, you can be against a program and take advantage of it at the same time. The only thing dumber than paying for something you don’t agree to is to not take advantage of it if eligible. Much the same way all these rich libs that didn’t want tax cuts aren’t sending what they see as a “fair share” to the IRS.

       Yes. That’s what I said. I don’t see Amazon advocating for higher taxes while paying less. I also don’t think Amazon should pay more taxes than they are obliged to but I do think they should be obligated to pay more.

       A better analogy would be all those that decried Ayn Rand for being vehemently against social security her whole life then drawing on it when she was eligible. According to them, she should have paid her entire life into a system she didn’t agree with then not take her money that was owed to her. Absolutely stupid. Had she been given choice I’m sure she would have gladly not paid in and not drawn a penny. Same with Hannity. If he is eligible to use the program, then that’s what it’s for and what we are all paying for, doesn’t mean he doesn’t have the right to think it shouldn’t exist.

        this

       And as others have said, you can still be against something while benefitting from it. That part of the conversation has absolutely zero merit, and only serves to try and damage his credibility for being a “hypocrite”. What would be hypocritical is if he benefitted it, and then talked about how great it was on his show.

       Possibly, though it would be hard to prove since Amazon doesn't really yet have dominance in one specific market. However, if we stopped subsidizing the USPS with billions of dollars every year, then this wouldn't even need to be an issue. Either Amazon would help them out, or they would go under and Amazon would have to take their business elsewhere to private companies.

       The government IS 1/2 of that contract. That’s the whole problem. No one would care if It were Amazon/UPS. The problem is Amazons shipments are subsidized by us all while they pay dick in taxes.

       There wasn't any content in the post that referenced brainwashing. Are you alleging that he is using mind control or some similar nefarious science? Now that would certainly be conspiracy worthy.

      <p>
       Unless, of course, you were just using the word "brainwashing" to mean "saying stuff I don't agree with." In that case, it's not a conspiracy. It's a guy saying stuff you disagree with.

         spent $90 million buying
        </strong>
        hundreds of homes across the U.S through the help of foreclosures and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),

      </blockquote>

       So he is buying foreclosed houses through the HUD system which requires you to jump through a shit ton of hoops, inspections, and all to be done on a time limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does nobody here understand what HUD does? Good for Hannity for putting his own money into urban housing.

       People are mad because he bashed Obama over HUD and then he uses it to his advantage and because he had Ben Carson on his show without saying that Carson was in a position to help him out financially. Like how last month Hannity's mortgages were replaced with HUD loans possibility from Carson and how Carson can allow Hannity to convert his rental complexes into for sale condos which will make him.....or I mean his company.....a shit load of money.

       HUD doesn't make you do anything different than buying a home in a private sale. There are zero hoops to jump through and every contract has performance deadlines. And there are HUD foreclosures everywhere, not just urban areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a problem with him buying Foreclosures, although I bet there some sort of backdoor he has to them from his coziness with the current administration. If he doesn't, foreclosures aren't really that great of a deal right now. At least in my area and others I speak to about them. HUD knows most buyers see the word "foreclosure" and automatically assume it is a good deal so they price a little higher, or at market value, regardless of condition.

       This is why that was such a huge lie.  "the market will supply low income housing."  It was just the way to steal the funds for people like Hannity, Trump and others.

       I’m convinced the Fox News surge was astroturfed by right wing propaganda designed to help Trump get his messaging across.
      </p>
      <p>
       The generation that is too young to remember living through 9/11 and/or the aftermath of it don’t know how pathetic Fox became to shill for war and the Bush agenda. What followed was unprecedented open attacks on president Obama for 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Older generations had their biases confirmed by the network and the talking heads that shifted from giving you information from behind a desk to sitting on couches and sharing their own opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn’t a critique on network media. Only Fox News. Save your whataboutism to try and deflect from the point I’m making. Fox News is the lowest of the low and is the first network to remarkably fail the bullshit test. It’s disheartening that a younger generation is buying into it just because they openly mock others and it’s branding itself as the only unbiased network.

       They're buying it because they know that younger generations don't watch TV - so they know their places they hang out is their version of TV - that's why /pol/ and other places are astroturfed to hell and back - to solidify another generation's compliance with the system.

       I mean, if you're against government handouts and think you're getting taxed into oblivion, then taking the money is the only way to prove your point. Instead of taking his money and then giving it back through a program, stop fucking taking it in the first place.

       Fox has gone down the drain over the past few decades. They used to have a reputation of giving ideas a chance to be heard. Now it appears that many of the higher-ups in the company harass/assault their own female co-workers, use their power to get more rich, etc.

       Fox has gone from bad to worse with Hannity actually being in connection with Cohen. Now we find he has hundreds of homes from HUD money? Wow. Just wow.

       Better question. Why is this in this sub? To all crying hypocrisy out there, you can be against a program and take advantage of it at the same time. The only thing dumber than paying for something you don’t agree to is to not take advantage of it if eligible. Much the same way all these rich libs that didn’t want tax cuts aren’t sending what they see as a “fair share” to the IRS.
