<p>No, they did not conspire with the democrats.</p>

<p>No, they did not have access to confidential or classified or top secret information.</p>

<p>No, they were not involved in pay to play.</p>

<p>No, they did not have any blackmail on any politicians.</p>

<p>You all have NOTHING to prove that Wasserman-Schultz or the democrats participated in dirty/illegal/unethical deeds with the Awans. </p>

<p>Meanwhile I have decades of experience and reality to show that democrats don&#39;t operate outside legal/ethical boundaries.</p>

<p>The democrats are the party of ethics and doing things right.</p>

<p>The democrats are the party of justice: legal, economic and social.</p>

<p>The democrats care about people other than the 1&amp;#37;.</p>

<p>The democrats actually treat minorities with respect. </p>

I posted links because I wanted people to think for themselves, rather than spoon feed them biases, as your previous comment is dripping with them.

<p>I appealed to you in a separate chain in this same post asking what you thought about the content within, hoping we could discuss the actual content instead of the external factors like the source. If your intentions were pure you would at least attempt to discuss one single piece of content, but instead you dismiss everything outright, providing no supporting evidence with which you can back your claims. </p>

<p>It&#39;s debunked because the conspiracy is that Wasserman-Schultz/democrats conspired and worked directly with the Awan Brothers to operate some kind of blackmail/classified information/pay for play scheme amongst other things. That&#39;s not what happened. There is no conspiracy. If any wrongdoing occured, the democrats had no play in it.  The democrats aren&#39;t stupid. Wasserman-Schultz isn&#39;t stupid. Again - unlike the Republicans, the democrats don&#39;t play dirty and actually adhere to ethics and the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that you say it is debunked. </p>

<p>Awan brothers were in 1.1 million in debt, they are also being sued by 6 people.   The main brother in question has been arrested of a DUI and driving while license is suspended.  To be in IT for a government with access to classified information you must pass background checks.  If your credit score is bad - you get put on a performance plan.  To say there is no conspiracy here is crazy.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the father of the Awan&#39;s worked for BCCI and was VP of a program that laundered Noreiga&#39;s  drug money.  He was also a CIA operative.  </p>
