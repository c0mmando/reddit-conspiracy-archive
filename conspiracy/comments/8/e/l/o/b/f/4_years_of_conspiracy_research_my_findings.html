        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been researching conspiracies for 3-4 years now, perhaps more, but got into it in the last couple years in my spare time mostly. I was always interested in the truth and finding out how the world works, so I have an open mind to anything alternative. I&#39;d like to share my knowledge of my research thus far, I won&#39;t detail it, just a short description of my findings so far.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>1) UFO/Aliens</h1>

<p>I don&#39;t think aliens have visited us, and even if they did in the past they probably have cloaking tech so they didn&#39;t interacted with us, would have no reason to. Either way no alien contact. Crop circles are hoaxes, alien abduction stories are just sensationalism, people wanted 10 minutes of fame, and the gray creatures are either CGI or dolls put in there. The UFO&#39;s a probably secret military technology, people in the 50&#39;s were sighting triangular shaped black planes, and in the 70&#39;s the stealth planes came out so it was just military testings ahead of time. This shows that military tech is probably 20-30 years more advanced than advertized, but no aliens there. There is more but you should do your own research. As for the myriad of &quot;alien&quot; videos on Youtube, those are just some jerks playing with video animation software.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>2) Chemtrails</h1>

<p>I think they are real. Plane fuel didn&#39;t changed since the 70&#39;s yet the number of white linear long clouds are now above every major city. Contrails dissapear almost instantly, chemtrails persist for many hours. Interestingly chemtrails only happen in North America and Europe, not in China or Russia, despite the same climate, so it&#39;s obvious that something is not okay there, and it&#39;s done by the US-EU elite. Even Wikipedia admits there could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection_(climate_engineering">Stratoshoperic Aerosol Injection going on</a>), from balloons, well from planes it would be more efficient. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>3) Moon Landing</h1>

<p>An obvious hoax, I have given some hints here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8e3f1u/a_funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_the_moon/dxu064s/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8e3f1u/a_funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_the_moon/dxu064s/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>4) Space Travel / ISS / Satellites</h1>

<p>While at it I think space travel is also a hoax. I don&#39;t just think that men never were to the Moon, I also think men never even went to space, nor did launch anything there that stayed there. I think satellites don&#39;t exist, you don&#39;t need them, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave">Skywave</a> phenomena is just like if you had satellites, but without them. Simply put, everything launched up there just comes back and falls into the ocean. I don&#39;t think we have the technology to launch up anything there. Most spaceships look like jokes. </p>

<p>Of course the ISS is also a hoax, all of their live footages is just so obvious CGI that loops after a few hours since probably the animation crew is on low budget, and their permed hairs and showing harnesses when they float is just so obvious. It&#39;s probably recorded in an underwater pool (remember some footages show bubbles in space), and in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced-gravity_aircraft">reduced gravity aircraft</a> which can only have small gravity for a limited time, that is why they only show the &quot;astronauts&quot; for a short time and then switch the picture, you won&#39;t see a video where there is a continuous 30 minute footage of these astronauts floating.</p>

<p>Also if you wonder about the &quot;telescopes&quot;, all of them are on Earth Observatories. The Hubble Telescope doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s basically just a camera on a plane called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_Observatory_for_Infrared_Astronomy">SOFIA</a>.</p>

<p>Simply put there is no man made space travel, all of it is a lie.</p>

<p>Not to mention a lot of Nazi scientists were behind the &quot;space program&quot;. It&#39;s probably just a Nazi lie.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>5) Shape of the Earth</h1>

<p>I am not a Flat Earther before anyone would accuse me of so. I do believe in the ball earth, though I am skeptical about the Newtonian model. I don&#39;t think the calculations are entirely correct, or accurate. Something is probably missing and it&#39;s the reason why we can&#39;t go to space. Though the ball shape of the earth can be easily demonstrated with basic tools, anyone can test it, so it&#39;s not up for debate.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth movement on the other hand is a psyop, made to discredit skeptics, especally space travel skeptics and moon landing skeptics and put them in 1 crazy category to make them look like crazy people.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>6) General Physics</h1>

<p>Well I haven&#39;t looked into all aspects but I am pretty sure the Newtonian model is not entirely correct. Nor the Cavendish Experiment which is an obvious joke. I am also not sure about General Relativity. I think Einstein did bring up a lot of interesting models and innovations, but I don&#39;t think his model is entirely accurate, or at least wrongly interpreted. Quantum Physics is probably more correct and verifiable, though that has opened up new doors. The truth is probably somewhere in between, but tilted towards the Quantum phenomena.</p>

<p>I am also skeptical of the Big Bang, it is kind of like the theist answer, when you cant explain something you just insert an infinite redundancy there. The Big Bang theory naturally implies a Multiverse, so it doesn&#39;t explain anything it just steers away the explanation into something else. This is pretty illogical.</p>

<p>On the Tesla vs Edison feud I have to side with Edison. I know there are many Tesla fanboys now, but really I think alternating current is very inefficient, it may be better for longer distances but Edison&#39;s direct current approach would have had a more decentralized approach since you&#39;d have needed shorter length cables and more nodes in the grid. I am Libertarian so I prefer the decentralized approach, also Edison wasn&#39;t as bad, a lot of Marxist are now smearing him, and worship Tesla like Jesus or something. Also  I think the &quot;secret hidden technologies &quot; of Tesla are just a myth, I don&#39;t think they ever existed. </p>

<p>If there is any &quot;free energy&quot; then why are there no blueprints for that? Do you think the Government in the 1800&#39;s could have destroyed all evidence? Not a chance, it is more likely that it never existed.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>7) Climate Change</h1>

<p>I think it&#39;s a hoax and a scam. There is no evidence for it whatsoever, a lot of scientists were caught fabricating evidence. They haven&#39;t been able to find a consistent model in the past 50 years to explain things so it&#39;s pretty likely that their model has a lot of plotholes in it. The scientists are all in an echo chamber where they fire scientists who deny it, most of them in government payrolls and in privately funded NGO&#39;s.</p>

<p>On the sinister side of it, you see even the oil companies financing it. Now why would the oil business fund these climate change NGO&#39;s?</p>

<p>It&#39;s because of these carbon taxes, which would be like a 1.5 trillion $ revenue, that would be sent to them. The funny thing is that the oil industry is not against it, which means that the only victims here would be the average citizen who would have to pay an extra 2-5% tax  on products as if we are not taxed enough already?</p>

<p>The banks are in on it too, the carbon credit market opens up new ways for them to create new financial derivatives.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a big scam, and you are the only victim of it.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>8) Elite Nazi Cabal in the US</h1>

<p>I think there is an active Nazi Cabal in the US, the &quot;Shadow Government&quot; which was made up of Nazis and their descendants. The US and even the UK has funded Hitler, mostly the US. People like Henry Ford and many others for example were part of this cabal, and were neck deep in Nazi affairs.</p>

<p>Now this Nazi Cabal was basically one of the most powerful elite factions in the 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s doing eugenics, experiments on blacks and all kinds of things. The oil industry, some banks and many business magnates were in on it. </p>

<p>They directly funded the German Nazi party and supplied Hitler up until 1940 with materials and machine parts and fuel. They have even attempted a fascist coup during WW2, which was exposed by Smedley Butler:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After the war they have invited over most of their Nazi friends to the US as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_clip">Paperclip</a> and helped smuggle others to Argentina and other places. Rumors say Hitler and Mengele both lived in South America until their death.</p>

<p>They even helped reinstall many convicted Nazi warcriminals back into high european offices and bureaucracies. A lot of West Germany was run by &quot;ex-nazis&quot; for instance up until 1984.</p>

<p>The EU faction is well documented here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eu-facts.org/en/roots/index.html">http://www.eu-facts.org/en/roots/index.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eu-facts.org/en/whoiswho/foundingfathers.html">http://www.eu-facts.org/en/whoiswho/foundingfathers.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And the US wing is also well documented elsewhere, I am not going to go into details but we all know who they were don&#39;t we.</p>

<p>Now if your parents were hard core Nazis, you bet they will indoctrinate their kids to carry on their legacy stealthy. Make no mistake about it, this cabal is still actve.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>9) JFK Assasination</h1>

<p>Well the JFK Assasination was perpetrated by this Nazi Cabal. JFK put his brother to investigate and expose these Nazis, as their actions go back way into the 20&#39;s so it was a lot of evidence to go through. Both JFK and Bobby Kennedy was assasinated, what does this tell you about it?</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>10) Syphilis &amp; Gas Experiments in US</h1>

<p>There were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">Syphilis experiments carried out on innocents and gas was released in many cities as tests against bio weapons</a>. They have gassed many US citizens with bacteria, just like they gassed a lot of innocent people at Auschwitz. These were Nazi scientists continuing their dirty work.</p>

<p>They even used Gas Chambers in US prisons up until recently. I mean the Nazi Cabal had it&#39;s fingerprints all over the place.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>11) 9/11</h1>

<p>I think it was an operation carried out by this Nazi Cabal, it had all of their fingerprints on it. The towers were probably controlled demolition, athought the NIST report makes a pretty good case for the official story, so I am not sure. But the motive behind it is very clear. It was an exactly similar event like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire">Reichstag Fire</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree">Reichstag Fire Decree</a> which was also done by the Nazis. The Patriot Act is extremely similar in both intent and results as the Fire Decree, it solidified the power of the Nazis.</p>

<p>I think a Nazi coup took place on 9/11, probably the &quot;Shadow Government&quot; behind the scenes tried to gain back their glory from the 20&#39;s after they had been more or less becoming suppressed so it was just like a JFK event, trying to gain back their power and they probably succeeded.</p>

<p>Now what was the result of it? Well increased police brutality, militarization of police, war, and decreased civil liberties. Doesn&#39;t it sound familiar.</p>

<p>And now you have Neo Nazis marching on the streets both in Europe and in the US, openly and shamelessly.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>12) Big Pharma</h1>

<p>There is no question about it, in Europe at least, most Pharma businesses are or are descendants of the Nazi businesses. I mean these people were operating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowitz_concentration_camp">Auschwitz III</a> for Christ sake, they forced poor Holocaust victims to create their own poison: they manufactures Zyklon-B with the camp prisoners, it is just a horrible past.</p>

<p>Most of the &quot;pills&quot; you take today were researched through human experimentations at Auschwitz, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_ter_Meer">many convicted Nazi war criminals</a> were then hired back after the war. It&#39;s just disgusting.</p>

<p>Vaccines were basically created at Auschwitz as a method to poison off the inmates.</p>

<p>Chemo-Therapy was basically the codeword they used when they injected Holocaust victims with all kinds of experimental drugs, that is literally from where the term came from, they even used the word &quot;chemo therapy&quot; in the SS documents.</p>

<p>Fluoride was used as a nerve poison to make inmates docile and obedient and lower their cognitive capacity, studies prove it lowers the IQ by 10 points in children. </p>

<p>Now they put Fluoride in drinking water, toothpaste and other stuff, it&#39;s obvious the Nazis are behind it.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>13) Big Agro</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.infowars.com/the-history-of-health-tyranny-codex-alimentarius-part-1/">Codex Alimentarius</a>, was created by Nazis. Most pesticides were also Nazi products, and those coming from the US eugenics factions. </p>

<p>Pesciticides, chemicals in food, are all dosed in a way described by these Nazis, to make people get as much cancer as possible, it&#39;s a total Nazi plan.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>14) The Financial System</h1>

<p>This is the biggest conspiracy so I left it for the last. It is not even a question that big banks control the world, the question is who is behind the banks.</p>

<p>Now this sub has been very much infested by anti-semites recently, probably this Nazi Cabal sending out paid shills to derail the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community.</p>

<p>However I have done a lot of research in it and found zero evidence for the &quot;Jews control all the banks&quot; claims. You know a masterful deception from the start, because there is never any tangible evidence behind it, but there is always overwhelming evidence against it, yet the perception of people is fooled to think that correlation is causation, well here it never is.</p>

<p>First of all most of these anti-semitic myths came from the Protocols of Zion, which is an obvious Black Propaganda book, probably written by Prussian Secret Police, I am not going to detail this, research it yourself.</p>

<p>Before that Anti-Semitism was mostly religious, like the Jewish Deicide, or completely delusional like claims that Jews caused the Black Plague. So before the Protocols, there was no &quot;Grand Jewish Conspiracy&quot;, it was just local anti-semites hating on Jews because they didn&#39;t assimilate and didn&#39;t convert on Christianity.</p>

<p>Nobody before the 1900&#39;s claimed that Jews run finance, but history was rewritten since that, especially by Goebbels.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h3>What about the Jewish medieval lending?</h3>

<p>Every anti-semite makes a big deal out of it, saying that the Church banned Catholic lending, and only Jews were allowed, therefore Jews became rich and controlled the world after this.</p>

<p>This is plainly false. In the Medieval times, Venice and the Venician Florins were the defacto reserve currency (before British Empire, France and Spain), and this banking model was the precursor to the current debt based monetary system. All major bankers and elites were Catholics.</p>

<p>There were a few banks that basically controlled all the finances in the entire Christian world, and they were all run by the Pope.</p>

<p>Jews were allowed to lend, but they were very poor ghettoized communities, so they certainly didn&#39;t got rich out of it, mostly giving loans to help out some poor people. Many pogroms and expulsions happened accompanied by total asset forfeiture so Jews didn&#39;t even had time to become rich, since they were always looted.</p>

<p>Most of the early conquests were probably funded by these banks, including the Columbus expedition. Basically the entire Spanish and Dutch expansion was funded by this. Allededly even the British expansion was funded by this but I am not sure.</p>

<p>So until the 1800&#39;s Jews didn&#39;t even had a stable rights to property let alone become rich bankers, so this claim is totally false.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h3>What about the enlightenment age?</h3>

<p>The enlightenment age was dominated by protestant industrialists. By this time the Catholic banking influence decreased, but still no Jewish influence at all. The anti-semitism in the 1800&#39;s in the US was similar to that in Europe.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h3>What about the 20th century?</h3>

<p>Jews by the early 20th century gathered enough money to become small artisants and craft workers, small business operators. By this time the law usually treated everyone equally. And as you see in the Weimar Republic for instance most Jews were: watchmakers, teachers, small shop owners, etc...</p>

<p>A few Jews became more succesful but not really members of the true Elite, mostly upper middle class actors and businessmen.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h3>What about the late 20th century?</h3>

<p>Well after the Holocaust the Jewish wealth was basically wiped out in Europe, the Nazi Gold which contained most of the Jewish wealth is still missing. Barely any Jews left in Europe, let alone rich Jews. </p>

<p>Most Jews went to Israel, where most of them live middle-class lifestyles but there are many poor Jews in Israel too, it&#39;s pretty hard to imagine any kind of conspiracy, when there are many poor people there too.</p>

<p>Some Jews became successful in the US, but this is probably 1970&#39;s onwards.</p>

<p>But to claim that they run the financial system is pretty absurd when you put it in context. Even if there are some Jewish bank clerks and stockbrokers that is basically nothing compared to the &quot;old wealth&quot; the &quot;old nobility&quot; that had their money for thousands of years before the Jews were even in Europe.</p>

<p>None of the real banking elite is Jewish, John Keynes the modern architect of the financial system was an anti-semite. Most Elite bankers in the 20th century funded Hitler, both the US and British side.</p>

<p>There are many Japanese, Korean and Chinese Bankers, are they all Jewish?</p>

<p>The BIS which is the supreme planetary central bank was always run by Catholics.</p>

<p>Simply put the Jews barely have any influence in finance, and are just put there to scapegoat people into antisemitism. The Jews were always innocent, there is no evidence that they have been involved in any conspiracy whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it could be a meteorite from somewhere more distant or who knows. I don&#39;t know, but also when they have these space launches you can clearly see that the rocket after a height it just tilts downwards, like it does an arc and then probably falls into the Ocean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The photo was taken at low exposure in order to be able to see it easier. Otherwise the brightness of the Moon would completely engulf the ISS. It&#39;s a completely normal photography technique. </p>

<p>Here are the specs of what was used to take the image/video.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Telescope: Skywatcher 1000/200
Camera: Canon 6D
Exposure:  1/3200  ISO 1600  25 fps</p>

<p>It&#39;s extremely easy to take pictures like these. Literally just get a telescope, use one of the many ISS transit calculators and wait for the right time. Super easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent thread, well done Op!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll reply to the points I would like to add to :</p>

<p>1) Absolutely correct about the tech being advanced military. Remember the UFO sightings in the mid 90&#39;s where people said they saw delta wing aircraft pulling manoeuvres that a human being couldn&#39;t replicate? Yeah, it was a drone. Likewise there were reports of a mothership &#39;splitting&#39; into pieces and coming back again. Yeah, that was a drove.</p>

<p>4) I have to disagree, I believe we have satellites and men/women in space. Did we get to the moon? Maybe, but they never returned if they did. </p>

<p>6) Einstein, like many great thinkers before him, showed us a path. From that path came many other paths which we walk down. It&#39;s easy to look back and laugh at how great scientists of the past were way off with their work. They weren&#39;t it&#39;s just that their work opened up possibilities.</p>

<p>Also, I do like Tesla, but this isn&#39;t coming from a fanboy POV. Edison was a complete fraud. His most famous invention, the &#39;lightbulb&#39; was a fraud. The lightbulb had already been invented, all Edison did was use a bunch of people to try different mixtures so that the bulb would last forever. A hundred years later they replaced the mixture with something that wouldn&#39;t last forever, so we would keep buying lightbulbs. </p>

<p>Ac vs DC : DC would never work and would be incredibly dangerous over long distances. We do use High voltage DC but it is in (from my experience) fairly rare situations. This is for many reasons. AC offers a flexibility that DC can&#39;t offer, is safer and relatively easier to use than DC. Most appliances wouldn&#39;t work without AC. Motors and generators require AC to work (somebody with an electrical degree can step in here and correct me if i&#39;m wrong. I was shown that motors need 3 phases to work efficiently and I don&#39;t think you can 3-phase DC)</p>

<p>All the rest I agree on. Very well thought out and presented. </p>

<p>One question though; if the Nazi&#39;s are still going today, where did the Nazi&#39;s come from? We know their present and recent history, but what about pre 1940&#39;s?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Yes.</p>

<p>4) Well all &quot;satallites&quot; can just be achieved by the Skywave propagation, but without any satellites up there. Most internet cable is underground, they take the pain to lay cables in the Atlantic to connect the US with the EU. All internet and telephony is done via cables.</p>

<p>Before that we used short distance radio towers, every major town had a big radio tower.</p>

<p>All of the &quot;satellite&quot; communication can just be explained by radio towers.</p>

<p>Also satellites allegedly use photovoltaic cells, well how the hell do they had that tech in the 70&#39;s or when it even now the most sophisticated cells can barely power a house, let alone a big satellite requiring thousands of kilowatts like a radio tower would. There is no way they get so much energy from the sun.</p>

<p>You should definitely look into this deeper, none of this makes sense.</p>

<p>6) Well Edison might have done some immoral practices but to call him a complete fraud is an exageration, he was a scientist too now just a businessperson.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DC would never work and would be incredibly dangerous over long distances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that is the whole point, you have locally generated power, like every town having their power plant. That would be a decentralized grid system, much more Libertarian, than 1 centrally controlled one where they can just flick a switch and shut down an entire country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AC offers a flexibility that DC can&#39;t offer, is safer and relatively easier to use than DC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. AC power literally can spike out from the wires, you can electrocute yourself just by putting your hand close to the wire, so it needs extreme insulation. Many times wall sockets spark that is due to that.</p>

<p>DC power runs only inside the wire , much safer and more efficient.</p>

<p>Right now every electronic runs on DC power so you have to convert it back and forth a lot of times.</p>

<p>It&#39;s extremely inefficient and a waste of power. DC would be much cleaner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most appliances wouldn&#39;t work without AC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well there you have an internal converter. But the default should be DC.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The counterreformation was the most anti-semitic event before the Nazis. Many Jews were victimized there.</p>

<p>Protestants were always more tolerant to Jews while the Catholic Church was the single biggest source of antisemitism right until 1962:

    <div class="md"><p>I think this Rothschild conspiracy is extremely exagerated, I don&#39;t think they have the fraction of influence they credit them to have. I don&#39;t think they manage any papal treasures, the Vatican Bank Catholics do that and the boys at the BIS which&#39;s HQ looks exactly like the Vatican Bank.</p>

<p>But even if they do, they are just the managers, not the owners. Big difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uhh. Pretty much stopped reading after #2</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrails+in+china">https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrails+in+china</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrails+in+russia">https://www.google.com/search?q=chemtrails+in+russia</a></p>

<p>Then started scanning and saw #4 and then stopped entirely and came to make this comment. If you&#39;re saying stuff like #2 and #4, then there really isn&#39;t much reason to read your other stuff as simple searches prove the two I did look at completely wrong. Which makes me think you haven&#39;t even tried to challenge your opinions and anything that does, you disregard so you don&#39;t believe you are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No Hitler was an idiot, he totally misinterpreted the swastika which is a hindu symbol and the &quot;aryan purity&quot; was representing a spiritual purity, it had nothing to do with races.</p>

<p>Then it mixed that with Norse mythology, like Odin drinking goat semen, and things like that. I mean it&#39;s just brutal savage barbarianism. </p>

<p>This is what Nazism was basically, and we know how it played out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should reexamine UFO/greys. There&#39;s an excellent book called: caverns, cauldrons, and concealed creatures. It shows a shocking parallel between ancient lore from around the world of mystical beings that behave in ways like aliens and abduction accounts of modern times. Missing time, tampered memories, fixation on genetics or bloodlines, hybrid experimentation, etc. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also cave paintings of beings that look like greys and ancient figurines that depict grey like beings. Hopi natives referred to ant people that helped them in the past and a grey alien looks like an enlarged ant head. </p>

<p>Too many similar accounts for it to be sensationalism. </p>
