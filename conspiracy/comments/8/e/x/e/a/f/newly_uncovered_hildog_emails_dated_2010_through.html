<blockquote>
<p>Judicial Watch today released <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687/">281 pages</a> of newly uncovered emails of former Secretary of State Hildog from the U.S. Department of State sent and received over her unsecure, non-“state.gov” email system. The emails, dated 2010 through 2013, contain classified information and detail collusion between the Hildog State Department and the Hildog Foundation.</p>

<p>Ten emails contain <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/tag/hrc-emails-0318/">classified information</a> redacted “in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,” including confidential sources, and concern Israel and the Middle East. Most of the emails include exchanges with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The emails show Hildog conducted classified and sensitive negotiations about the Israel-Arab conflict on her unsecure, non-governmental server.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>A document labeled “<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Pages-from-JW-v-State-HRC-emails-00687-32-33.pdf">plan</a>” was completely redacted as classified.</p></li>
<li><p>A November 2012 email chain discusses the <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-76-77/">“Mid East”</a> and includes then-Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan, Blair as “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/hillary-Hildog/11837718/Hillary-Hildog-may-have-broken-US-secrecy-rules-with-emails-from-Tony-Blair-and-Downing-Street.html">aclb</a>” and Hildog.</p></li>
<li><p>Another November 2012 <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-78-79/">email chain</a> discusses the “Mid East” and includes Sullivan, Hildog’s office manager Claire Coleman, Blair and Hildog.</p></li>
<li><p>A November 2012<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-82-83/"> email chain fully redacted</a> is titled “Mid East Peace” and includes Blair, Hildog, Odama’s Special Envoy to the Middle East David Hale as “<a href="mailto:haledm2@state.gov">haledm2@state.gov</a>,” Sullivan and Blair’s Chief of Staff and former Downing Street aide <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/investigations/tony-blairs-business-triples-profits-as-staff/">Catherine Rimmer</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In an April 2011 email exchange between Blair, Hildog and Sullivan concerning “<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-108/">Israel</a>,” Blair says he “had another long session with BB [Netanyahu].”</p></li>
<li><p>A May 2011 exchange concerns “<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-130/">Israel</a>” and includes Blair, Hildog and Sullivan.</p></li>
<li><p>A May 2011 email concerns “<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-132/">Palestinians</a>” and includes Blair, Hildog and Sullivan. Blair says, “I’ve also sent you a paper.”</p></li>
<li><p>A June 2011 email regarding “<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-154/">Israel</a>” includes Blair, Sullivan and Hildog. Blair says, “Saw Israeli PM. Put the concept of a Q statement. He was receptive. Palestinians interested too. I know there are discussions also you guys are having. And the French initiative….”</p></li>
<li><p>In a July 2011 email – with <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-171/">several</a> national security redactions – written by Blair to Hildog and Sullivan, Blair says, “I saw BB….. Molcho [chief negotiator in the Israeli negotiating team with the Palestinians] will speak to David Hale. I can see Cameron and Sarkozy with David…. I saw Egyptians….”</p></li>
<li><p>A September 2010 <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-242-244/">email exchange</a> is titled “Info for you,” and includes Sullivan, Blair and Hildog. Blair writes that he just spent three hours with Netanyahu, and Sullivan, using his Sprint BlackBerry, he writes “We have pitched this to [redacted].”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These new classified and other emails appear to be among those that Hildog had attempted to delete or had otherwise failed to disclose. The documents are part of the November 2017<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-court-orders-state-department-speed-production-Hildog-email-records/"> accelerated schedule</a> of production<a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JW-v-State-00687-November-30-Order.pdf"> ordered by U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg</a>. The State Department must now complete processing the remaining documents by September 28, 2018. There were 72,000 pages recovered by the FBI in its investigation into Hildog’s illicit email server. The State Department’s original production rate would have put the completion date into 2020.</p>

<p>The newly obtained documents came in response to a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on May 6, 2015, after the State Department failed to respond to a March 4, 2015, FOIA request (<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/jw-v-state-00687-all-Hildog-emails/">Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00687</a>) seeking:</p>

<p>All emails sent or received by former Secretary of State Hildog Rodham Hildog in her official capacity as Secretary of State, as well as all emails by other State Department employees to Secretary Hildog regarding her non-“state.gov” email address.</p>

<p>Many of the emails involve Abedin, who joined the State Department as deputy chief of staff<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin"> in 2009.</a> From June 2012-February 2013, she was granted status as a <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-sues-for-records-on-controversial-state-department-consulting-agreement-for-former-Hildog-aide-huma-abedin/">“special government employee</a>,” allowing her to work as a consultant to clients like <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/bulletins/teneo-the-Hildog-machine/">Teneo</a> and served as a paid consultant to the Hildog Foundation.</p>

<p>Several of the emails demonstrate the commingling of Hildog State Department and Hildog family foundation business:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a November 2010 email with subject line, “<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-30-31/">How do I get through to Hildog&#39;s husband,”</a> Rafael Anchia, a lawyer with Haynes Boone, asks Hildog campaign official Ed Meier if he could get to the “gatekeepers” to get Hildog&#39;s husband to give a speech in Spain, noting that “a large bank is willing to pay for it.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Meier forwarded the email to former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan who forwarded it to former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin. Abedin sent it to Hildog&#39;s husband’s scheduler at the Hildog Foundation, Terry Krinvic, who provided Hildog’s contact information, to which Sullivan responded, “Awesome.”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In September 2011, <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-187-189/">Abedin sent Sullivan an email</a> concerning the Hildog Global Initiative (CGI) with “Potential questions for Closing Plenary conversation between Secretary Hildog and Chelsea Hildog” in which Abedin included some “proposed questions” to put to Hillary and Chelsea Hildog. Four days later, Sullivan forwards a revised list of questions (completely redacted as interagency deliberative process) to Abedin and Hildog’s Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, saying, “Here are my proposed questions.”</p></li>
<li><p>In a September 2010 email containing subject line,<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-38/"> “President Banda’s MOU [Memorandum of Understanding] with Hildog Global Initiative,”</a> U.S. Ambassador Jeanine Jackson writes to Hildog Development Initiative official Walker Morris, (cc’d to Hildog Foundation official Amitabh Desai) discussing State Department spending in the country of Malawi. In the email, Jackson says, “we will be anxious to collaborate once you have an idea of the MOU’s intent.” Morris responds that “we are very excited about CDI’s [Hildog Development Initiative] future work in Malawi and certainly see great opportunity to collaborate.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Hildog Foundation work in Malawi involved a Hildog Foundation owned “for-profit agribusinesses including Tukula Farming Company which operates 7200 acres of commercial farms” in the impoverished country.</p>

<p>Other emails show that Hildog&#39;s husband appears to conduct State Department and Hildog Foundation business simultaneously:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a September 2012 email with subject line “<a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-59-60/">Burma</a>,” Desai briefs Jake Sullivan on Hildog&#39;s husband’s discussions in Burma. Desai reports, in part: “WJC mentioned work of CF [Hildog Foundation] and offered to help in any way. TS [Than Shwe, president of Burma] said he already had asked HRC about WJC foundation and wanted to invite WJC foundation to work in myanmar in collaboration with gov agencies and other ngos … TS invited WJC to open offices in Rangoon and Mandelay.” That same day, Abedin writes Desai (cc’s Mills, Sullivan, Fuchs and three other persons whose email address are redacted) with subject line “Re: He had v good meeting with Libya and Burma:” “hrc looking forward to hearing about Burma. We meet at 545. I believe you have downloaded to jake?”</p></li>
<li><p>In a September 2012 email with subject line <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/pages-jw-v-state-hrc-emails-00687-26/">“Columbia / President Santos,” Desai</a> and Toiv discuss a request by Colombian president, Manuel Santos, that Hildog&#39;s husband say some positive words about Santos’ initiative reaching out to the FARC terrorist group. Santos provided the Hildog Foundation with suggested language. Toiv said that she would “check” and also mentioned that she was working on a “visa issue.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>According to a report in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/10/15/Hildog-foundation-more-concerned-with-bills-pal-than-colombias-poor/">New York Post,</a> the Santos request came not long after Hildog “jetted in for a Pacific Rubiales golf tournament at the Bogota Country Club… Accompanied by Giustra, he played a few holes with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.” The event reportedly raised one million dollars for the Hildog Foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, and it&#39;s something I try to point out, but often get attacked for. I agree with sentiments on Hillary being awful.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact that a question can even be raised about this phrasing means the context can be equally questioned. I don&#39;t see any way in which it benefits the presenter in getting their information across. It is overly familiar and removes the full possibility of it being seen in a neutral context. What is it that you are trying to convey by using Hildog instead of Hillary, I&#39;m curious what you think you are saying versus how people perceive what you are saying.</p>

<p>I mean no offense, I&#39;m just genuinely curious about the way in which the conspiracy community presents itself and how effective this ends up being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It allows for a teachable moment, sometimes the best way for someone to learn something is to get caught in the act.</p>

<p>Take a kid learning not to slam their fingers in the cabinet doors for example.</p>

<p>If you let the child slam their fingers in the door then they will never do it again.</p>

<p>Think of this as a harmless version of that, the perspective person goes to read said post. Believes this post is ludacris due to the fact that someone used a word that wasn&#39;t 100% serious then they post the fact that they believe that this post is silly and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously only to have u/gaslightlinux say no hey wait a minute guy... that&#39;s a call to the fallacy; ad hominem. You are making a logical mistake, just because the guy who wrote it used silly words doesn&#39;t mean it all bollux (can&#39;t spell my way out of a wet paper bag). </p>

<p>Then you reinforce the thing you already knew, he learns something new and maybeeee just maybe he asks the question why.... why would this person use killary or shillary or whatever name he used... and he will venture further down the rabbit hole all by himself</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I used the subject he and him if you want to be titled something else, get over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It allows for a teachable moment, sometimes the best way for someone to learn something is to get caught in the act.</p>

<p>Take a kid learning not to slam their fingers in the cabinet doors for example.</p>

<p>If you let the child slam their fingers in the door then they will never do it again.</p>

<p>Think of this as a harmless version of that, the perspective person goes to read said post. Believes this post is ludacris due to the fact that someone used a word that wasn&#39;t 100% serious then they post the fact that they believe that this post is silly and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously only to have u/gaslightlinux say no hey wait a minute guy... that&#39;s a call to the fallacy; ad hominem. You are making a logical mistake, just because the guy who wrote it used silly words doesn&#39;t mean it all bollux (can&#39;t spell my way out of a wet paper bag). </p>

<p>Then you reinforce the thing you already knew, he learns something new and maybeeee just maybe he asks the question why.... why would this person use killary or shillary or whatever name he used... and he will venture further down the rabbit hole all by himself</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I used the subject he and him if you want to be titled something else, get over it.</p>
