<p>However, this sounds like an agenda likely pushed by AI robots that want to take over the world.</p>

<p>Or maybe the government doesn&#39;t want people to drive to keep them weak. Driving a car is a massive advantage they would have if only TPTB could do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way you worded it, mass vehicular manslaughter, threw me off and I couldn&#39;t figure out what you were talking about. The incidents you&#39;re referring to were not manslaughter, which involves unintentionally killing someone, I think vehicular homicide might be the term you&#39;re looking for, but there may be a different term for when there&#39;s multiple random killings as an act of terror; I also think the Charlottesville incident has been blown way out of proportion, he acted the way everyone should if they find their car blocked and attacked by a mob, courts have ruled driving through in that scenario is self defense.  Google Reginald Denny to see what happens when you place others well being above your own. Also the girl that died wasn&#39;t hit and was morbidly obese and died of a heart attack, confirmed by her mother.</p>

<p>As to a conspiracy involving self driving cars: I don&#39;t think so, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s resistance to self driving cars; it just so happens that cars are the most deadly thing most people have access to, plus they don&#39;t need to be reloaded and they protect you to some extent.</p>
