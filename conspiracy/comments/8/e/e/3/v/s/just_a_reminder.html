       It's easy to get caught up in the gnarly plans the powerful have for the world. There is evil in the world, it's the duality of magnetism making itself known through human nature. A weird fundamental concept of thermodynamics. But, remember that the internet started as a tool for war, we developed nuclear bombs before power plants, etc. Don't underestimate the power of good in all of us. Don't get discouraged. This world/intelligence is complex for a reason. And I truly think the end result is good. So don't give up, and if you have a good heart remember to speak up. That's all, thanks for your time.

       Well, grey matter. Everything is magnetism. Good and evil is a silly concept, the equation is as balanced as possible without annihilating. It's just that positivity has some extra energy behind it.

       The truth is that all throughout human history psychopaths have been able to take positions of power from good people because of their willingness to do anything, and hurt anyone, to get that position of power.
       <br/>
       At present a small handful of wealthy psychopaths have hijacked the most powerful government and military on the planet and are using them to carry out their own personal world domination agenda with virtually no real opposition.
       <br/>
       They're two steps away from having so much power that nothing besides a massive meteor impact will ever defeat them.

       So really you're going to be pretty much dead by the time anything happens after your generation polluted our culture, raped our government, and handed down trillions of wealth to your kids and grandkids, and you wanna say good always wins in the end? Seems like the opposite is true, the boomers won. You just think your generation is good.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Natural law (Latin: ius naturale, lex naturalis) is a philosophy asserting that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature, endowed by nature—traditionally by God or a transcendent source—and that these can be understood universally through human reason. As determined by nature, the law of nature is implied to be universal,[1] existing independently of the positive law of a given state, political order, legislature or society at large.

       No, it excludes women and there is no "right to life" and you know not even the founders gave it a second thought when they decided the slaves were 3/5ths of a person so the slave holding states could have good solid numbers in the House of Representatives.

       It's right there: "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." If you are a human being, you have certain unalienable Rights. That's what equal means, this context.

       Thanks for the thoughts they are your beliefs, not "natural laws," that apply to all humans.  As I said befor you have no natural right to stay alive just because you are born.  You are entirely dependent upon others to gain that life.

       You should watch some Mark Passio explain Natural Law and then come in here and argue against it. I'd love to hear your talking points then: since as you said before, you had never heard of it. So why should I take alyour flippantly negative assertions as anything but that. Your ignorance is showing and my patience is low for someone who chooses to ignore.

       We don't need to agree. Without competition there is no progress or purpose. Just saying it's a clever situation of yin and yang, in which we use our intelligence to find consensus and the eventuality is pretty fucking sweet as long as we fight for the obvious stuff.

       Good illustration about finding agreement, I disagree that competition is the driver.  I think it is need, individual, family, community, an outward expansion of needs to be met and goods and services to meet them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure though what kind of competition you mean?  do you mean for social and financial status?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying competition produces the frictions of social and financial status and that is the need, to win a place in a hierarchical system?

      <p>
       How does competition work in an ancient culture like Hinduism, with really strict hierarchies, but a long history of trading and building?

       On a thread about how awful war is and how TPTB makes money on both sides, exponentially increasing their capacity for domination.. I got -42 for saying "don't pay taxes and don't join the military." I seriously doubt people were THAT opposed to what I was saying, considering the thread. It's obvious what scares them, and it's all of us waking up together and actually acting.
