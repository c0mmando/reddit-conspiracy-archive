    <div class="md"><p>I am simply not siding with what is patently evil.  That has nothing to do with there being &#39;no good&#39;...but currently there has been so much evil performed that the vast majority of humanity, if not close to all of them have no idea what it even means to be good anymore...so it makes little difference that there is &#39;good&#39; in the world according to your evaluation.  If you will not side with what is conducive to LIFE then it doesn&#39;t matter if you label something &#39;good&#39; and are content with yourself or self congratulatory.  Is the &#39;homosexual agenda&#39; good?  According to your standards?  Clearly to most people the increased gang rape and degradation of the human form are considered &#39;good&#39; as well as the attempts to drop the &#39;age of consent&#39; completely and allow all ages to be gang raped without any legal &#39;repercussions&#39; for their actions.  You see this as &#39;progress&#39; no matter how many of your victims commit suicide or are physically wrecked by the child rapes (they also turn to drug use to kill themselves later in life).  So maybe the world would be better off if you closed your eyes...or were blinded so that you could not do so much damage within it with your &#39;progressive&#39; values.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would I &#39;need to meet them&#39;?  To verify their evil?  It is written in their beliefs, their culture and their morals.  They are so bad that they own god divorced them permanently and never looked back.  They are wholly and unmitigated EVIL.  </p>

<p>Let me ask you something...when the Bolshevik Jews were &#39;doing their thing&#39; slaughtering 60,000,000 innocent Russian Intelligentsia (A PITIFUL FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE THE JEWS HAVE MURDERED TO &#39;COVER THEIR CRIMES ON THIS PLANET&#39; as their death cult &#39;god&#39; instructs them to do) for SPORT like they did during the Bolshevik revolution, do you think that they bothered to &#39;meet them all&#39; to check and make sure they &#39;were nice people&#39;...all 60,000,000 were met and verified for &#39;good behavior&#39; or &#39;nice personality&#39; before they were slaughtered?  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a fucking fool.  The Jews, ALL OF THEM, deserve to be treated EXACTLY as they have treated others...and then some.  In the day that we count up the DEAD of Earth at their hands......no one will believe the number...no one will be able to count them, because they are as the sands of the sea...uncountable and unnumbered.</p>

I can&#39;t wait until the day when the seat of consciousness spreads to the entire globe (outside of you &#39;aliens&#39; on planet earth [ICU]who have no share in the consciousness of Earth) and there is NO ONE who will shelter you...all peoples will see you as the degenerate contaminated murderous filth and Inherited Criminal Mafia that you REALLY are...I await the day that you will PAY BACK what you have stolen from the Earth...that and MORE will be taken from you and given to the victims of your malfeasance in REPARATIONS for your absolute WICKEDNESS...and your MURDERS...that day can&#39;t come soon enough.

<p>You can become a regular positive soul again. It requires more than just saying sorry but its possible. Because the real god doesnt punish his creations for eternity only until theyve made themselves better. But it requires being genuine and requores some time before youre actually healing. </p>

<p>The real god loves all his creations and wants all his creations to love. The key to advancement as a soecies is less hate more love </p>
