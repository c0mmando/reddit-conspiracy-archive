<p>Ask any sniper and you be told this: A moving target downhill from the shooter, moving away at an opening angle is not something you hit with three well-aimed shots using a bolt action in that time frame.</p>

<p>I neither know, nor do I care, who else was there or why he was popped. I simply object to the story on it&#39;s complete lack of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t heard of that before. I was simply speaking from experience. It&#39;s bloody hard to nail a target at distance, especially downhill and moving away at an angle. Three times? It ain&#39;t happening with a bolt action. Maybe with an M-1D or M-21. Semi-auto brings it to another level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the second half of the question is ridiculous. If a person believes a conspiracy theory, then you can be assured that their reason for doing so is because they think there is sufficient evidence of it being true. Here is what I believe is true:</p>

<ul>
<li>JFK was assassinated by Bush Sr. and the CIA</li>
<li>9/11 (and the majority of &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks) was carried out by a shadown CoG government in cooperation with the Mossad and Bush Jr.</li>
<li>International bankers are bankrupting nations and bailing them out by demanding perpetual ownership of the country&#39;s resources</li>
<li>There is a global capitalist plot for the elite to achieve omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence in their rule over humankind as well as total private ownership of all property on planet Earth.</li>
<li>The moon landing was faked.</li>
</ul>

<p>...I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right - sort of... My reason for the second half of the question was to provoke some of that evidence - and examine whether it is the evidence alone, or a faith in the evidence that maintains the belief in the theory...

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t consider that a conspiracy theory. ETs exist. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Literally, there&#39;s no chance they don&#39;t exist. Have they visited planet Earth? That&#39;s an entirely different question. I saw a UFO. And I&#39;m not talking about some mysterious light far off in the sky. This thing was 200 feet above my head. And quiet as can be. Flew off faster than any known aircraft can fly. I don&#39;t need anyone to believe me. I don&#39;t care if they do. I know what I saw. Don&#39;t ever believe anything because you want to believe it. But, similarly, don&#39;t ever disbelieve something because you want to disbelieve it. More than anything else, the people that do both of those things bug the shit out of me. They don&#39;t have any thirst for the truth, whatever it may be. Do things for the right reasons, man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, no, it didn&#39;t. No doubt you picked that up from your messiah, Alex Jones, but it&#39;s completely untrue. If you had done any real research at all you would know that the collapse of the building required some eighteen seconds. What people of your rather limited intellect think of as the collapse of the building is simply the collapse of the North wall of the building. If you look at the photographs of the debris pile, the North wall is laying on top of the pile like a shroud. That could not have happened if the entire building collapsed at once.</p>

<p>As for controlled demolition, I can&#39;t help what you think you see but the fact remains that no evidence of explosives of any type have ever been found in the debris of the WTC. And no matter what third rate researchers and shrill tragedy whores would have you believe, there was no evidence of burning agents, either.</p>

<p>Moon landing . . . possible fake, but then, if the whole program were a fake you wouldn&#39;t fake a <em>failure</em> with Apollo 13. I think that as time passes and the computers they used back then seem more and more &quot;primitive,&quot; the number of people believing it was faked will rise, not fall. After awhile, the idea of &quot;going to the moon in 1969&quot; will seem as ridiculous as going there in 1850.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Widespread media manipulation through selective reporting and editorial influence ensuring the public is kept ignorant, entertained and distracted. This enables the tide of public opinion to be either turned towards support of certain initiatives, or for the national attention to be focusd on trivialities and diverted away from certain events, trends and patterns that could reveal truths that powerful groups do not wish revealed.</p>

<p>Edit: This is also why powerful groups and people such as the Rockefellers are so against the Internet, because it represents a loss of control. Initiatives such as domain filters, Internet-2.0, crackdowns on anonymous file sharing, etc are part of the attempt to regain control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None.  Unless I literally see something I have to rely on what others say happened, and I tend to believe the stories that make the most sense.</p>

<p>For example, with JFK, the gov&#39;t version of events has Oswald using a bolt action rifle and firing off 3 very difficult shots through a tree with next to no time to aim for the 2nd and 3rd shot.  So, in my opinion, this version of the events that day is pretty tough to swallow, so I&#39;m willing to listen more reasonable explanations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We the &#39;people&#39; are ruled by our own ignorance. 
We willingly give (register), apply &amp; submit any &amp; all freedom/titles to &#39;enjoy&#39; the commercial benefits of a fictional society we call citizen<strong>ship</strong>.  We live in a matrix dictated by rules of the sea, while 99% of the population don&#39;t even know it.</p>

<p>To answer why?  Because the &#39;law of free will&#39; has a vast karmic effect that the elite are quite aware of - so we cannot be forced to do things unless we do so of our own free will...we were warned, just didn&#39;t read the fine print.  &quot;Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Government is a corporation listed on Dun &amp; Bradstreet with directors &amp; a president</p></li>
<li><p>Your parents gave you to the government when they registered your birth (they have controlling interest, giving child services their power to take children away from parents).  Birth certificate is also evidence you are a bond holder for this corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>When you decided it was time to work because you needed money, you applied (begged) and submitted an application for a SIN/SSN card which made you an employee of this corporation. </p></li>
<li><p>Because you are an employee, commercial law can now apply (Maritime law, UCC, whatever you want to call it).</p></li>
<li><p>You register your car (Government owns the title) to get a license to drive (commercially) giving police their power to ticket you even though you have an unalienable right to travel.</p></li>

So reading about CTs and discussing them is a part of that.  I used to beleive them all (9/11, NWO, Illuminati etc), because it made me feel smart, like i had some kind of inside information, and knew things other were too dumb to see (sheep).  You won&#39;t see any current ct believers say that, but you will see most former share that.  Like I said, I enjoy the psychology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well previous to 9/11 I was pretty big into conspiracy theories. (I would visit Rense.com like everyday).  At that time, I wasn&#39;t drinking milk for instance.  So in the months after it happened and all the initial theories started to come out, (trans afgan pipeline, hailburton, pretext for war, controlled demolition Listen to Immortal Technique:Cause of death for my midset at the time).  So I followed it for a year or so, (in 2001 I was in 2nd year university), then I got really busy with school, girls and partying, so I didn&#39;t follow the 9/11 stuff too much anymore.  Then I heard about loose change 2nd edition, and watched that.  After that my interest was rekindled.  I stated posting on fourms about 9/11 and was quickly shown to sites like screw loose change and JREF.</p>

<p>After watching loose change and being completely sold, then seeing screw loose change, and saw witnessing every argument made in that movie proven to be wrong/false/out of context etc; it was a pretty big shock.  That was the beginning of the end of my CT ways.</p>

<p>Now its not an issue as many put it &quot;what the govt says happend&quot;, but what the evidence and common sense prove happened.</p>
