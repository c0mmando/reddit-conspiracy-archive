       Even a lot of this sub's users are still unintentionally(?) promulgating the standard narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the DNC and Hillary did was disgraceful, and downright dangerous. After someone leaked to wikileaks the internal workings of the DNC and the REAL collusion going on between it and the Hillary campaign, they opted to misdirect public attention by playing the victim, saying they were "hacked" and blaming Russia, still a major nuclear power, and needlessly damaging our relations with them as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the whole "hacking" story was complete bullshit. So they and their friends in the media changed tacked and called it "collusion".
      </p>
      <p>
       It is imperative that this sub's users, who before the current trend of regurgitating talking points from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       Actually we have proof that Flynn, Papadopoulos and Don Jr all violated US Sanctions and Elections laws and later lied about it to cover it up and the POTUS went on tv and admitted to Obstruction of Justice to cover their tracks. What more could you possibly want? Direct witness testimony? Well good news! Flynn, Papadopoulos and Rick Gates have all accepted plea deals in return for their testimony.

       All of the evidence is in the indictment. What evidence in the indictment do you disagree with? Even Trump has stopped denying that Russia hacked our elections since the indictment dropped, and the administration admitted it was the Russians.

       This perfectly shows how ours news is propaganda. It doesn't matter what's true, but only what keeps you against the other side. They have billion dollar think tanks coming up with the best narrative to keep their voters even if they only keep them by keeping their attention on their dislike of the other party.

       Papadopoulos knew 2 months before Wikileaks dropped any emails that Russia had obtained emails that would damage the Hillary campagin. Was he a psychic then? Theres absolutely no evidence that Seth or anyone else leaked those emails. You're basing that off a wink and a nod from one guy who was actively working to get Trump elected and claims to never reveal their sources.

       The part I've always going so interesting with Papadopoulos is whether the emails that were discussed were the DNC's.  As I recall, that meeting happened in April, but the emails weren't removed till July 5th.  They may have been talking about Podesta's emails, but the time line has always been off.

       I've seen this argument and it makes no sense to me. If Russia had Hollarys deleted emails or any other kind of emails, why didnt we ever get to see them? Why did we only see DNC and Podesta emails? There is no way in hell Russia would have Hillarys private emails and never release them. That just makes no sense at all to me.

       The DNC hacking started in April. The timeline links up perfectly.

       You're thinking of when the emails actually dropped to the public, not when they were stolen. Yeah that happened in July. But Russia took them in April.

       The argument that VIPS makes about the download speed has been debated, but no one has questioned the date and time of that extraction which was the evening of July 5.  Not only that, to assume you know which emails were discussed a month prior is also grasping at straws imo.

       No, that's Russia's usual m.o. to acquire compromising information and use it to manipulate world leaders covertly. Releasing it is the opposite of what they usually do.

       Everyone knew about those missing emails at that point (after they were 'accidentally' wiped with Bleachbit software to avoid forensic recovery - while under fucking subpoena).

       I once spun a conspiracy theory for someone who was argueing with me about this exact topic.  I essentially told them: "I bet the Russian knew about the 600k emails on Anthony Weiner's computer and hired that 13 year girl old to entrap him... Causing the police to find the emails and forcing Comey's hand to re-open the investigation a week before the election."  Was kind of hoping to see it pop up in r/politics... As far as I know, it never did.  O well.

       I looked into this more today.  Apparently Forensicator claimed the download speeds were consistent with copying to a USB and that the speeds would be extremely difficult to achieve using a remote connection and a VPN (which would be typical for a hack).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it seems I was sold a bill of goods originally.  The claims that went viral initially misinterpreted Forensicator and sensationalized the download speed angle of the study.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really pisses me off that things like this will go viral and then corrections sort of just get shuffled along and go by largely unnoticed.

       Papadop should have lawyered up and not said a word.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's borderline entrapment because of the fact that he was made to feel like any contact with russians was illegal and lied because of the witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth talking about.  This could happen to anybody.  The FBI could come visit you today and make you feel like it's somehow illegal to drink your favorite drink and then before you know it they've scared you into claiming you dont' like to drink coke and then they arrest you because they have proof you just drank a coke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Hillary and friends deleted all those emails after subpoena and lied to the same fbi personeel without being arrested or charged with anything.  And that's an awfully awkward fact when people like you try to play up the papadop thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wasn't Huma arrested?  Pretty sure she denied knowledge of the server or sending/receiving/storing classified information.  Surely she's going to be arrested if they're arresting people affiliated with Trump.  Or is it just republicans who can get arrested for lying to the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the FBI politicized?  Whoops.  They done goofed.

        But the FBI, according to court documents, never spoke with Papadopoulos until January 15, 2017 – well after the election and just days before Trump's inauguration. By then, the FBI had co-authored a joint report with the Department of Homeland Security blaming malicious Russian actors for a series of cyber hacks related to the election.

       <p>
        This words “political dirt on Hillary Clinton” are almost certainly copied from the Australian High Commissioner’s report to his government, which was subsequently passed on to the FBI, and which forms the basis of the story in the New York Times.
       </p>
       <p>
        What these words show is that Papadopoulos was boasting in the London bar that the Russians had “political dirt about Hillary Clinton”, not that they had the DNC or Podesta emails.
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “the Russians had emails of Clinton” make it clear that the emails supposedly discussed by Professor Mifsud and Papadopoulos in the London hotel in April 2016 were not the DNC and Podesta emails but Hillary Clinton’s own 33,000 emails deleted from her private email server.  Had Papadopoulos referred to the DNC and Podesta emails in his interview with the FBI the indictment would surely have said so.

       Maybe try reading the post again? Russia hacked the DNC? Any proof? Your response is truly pathetic.

       Lol. So your argument is just saying I'm wrong. The Guccifer 2.0 shit was a hoax. He didnt really hack anything. He took public documents and fucked with them and claimed he hacked the Clinton foundation. And it happened months after Papadopoulos told the diplomat that Russia had stolen emails. This is all in his criminal indictment. Why the fuck would he make that up? He got in trouble for lying to the FBI about this and you think he made up a new lie that's even more damning than his original lie? Get over it dude. Russia hacked the DNC. It's not the end of the world. But they definitely were responsible for it. And they spilled the beans months before Wikileaks dropped those emails.

       I did. You cant insult your way out of this one. The guccifer stuff came months after Papadopulous knew russia had stolen emails in may. Both Guccifers claims and the Wikileaks releases were in June and July. Sorry bud, but Papa knew about all this months before anything came out. How on earth did an Australian warn the FBI that Russia had hacked the DNC 2 months before anything came out? Is he a psychic?

       What did you want me to respond to? The blog you posted. The only point in that long blog post was that writer thinks Papa was talking about Hillarys 33,000 deleted email. That's the writers personal opinion and they dont back it up with anything. We have never seen any of Hillarys personal emails from that server, so this is one giant guess from the blogger. Cool dude.

       The original indictment. Instead of using conjecture as to what Papadopoulos knew and didn’t know try citing what the facts are. You apparently make assumptions about him because you have no case without it? "Pap knew! Pap knew!" only serves to make your already weak case weaker.

        Nunes noted that no intelligence was shared with the U.S. from any of the members of the “Five Eyes” agreement – that being Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is relevant because the FBI says that the Trump investigation was kicked off after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the FBI that Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos drunkenly admitted in a London pub that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reported last December that “Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.”
       </p>
       <p>

         This was clearly not true according to the EC, which states that no intelligence passed through Five Eyes official channels.

       I couldn't give less of shit if Trump or anyone else goes down for collusion. This  is about whether or not Russia hacked the DNC and Podesta. And Papa knew they had stolen emails months before Wikileaks dropped them. This is pretty straight forward.

       Hillary shot herself in the foot and bashed her base after winning the primary. Also she had a shit record. But no, let's whine about the people who exposed her for what she was because Russia.

       Providing curated leaks to advance an agenda is rarely in the public’s best interest.  It’s for personal gain.   Usually it is done to hide your own corruption and/or crime.  The theory is that Russia had dirt on both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and chose to use the dirt on Trump to advance their agenda and use the dirt on Clinton to get Trump elected.  That’s not transparency.  It’s a lie of omission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example: whenever there is a controversial shooting of an unarmed person, the police department will “leak” an arrest record or a mug shot to the media of the slain person (even if it’s unrelated) to distract from the officer’s shooting.  It’s a leak meant to divert public attention to a potentially greater crime.

       Your first paragraph is entirely unproven heresay at this point, and even if there was some sort of agenda, that doesn't make exposing rampant corruption and
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       subversion of democracy a bad thing. This is just projection of not only how they were the ones who rigged the election, it was actually also meant to
       <a href="https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/russia-scandal-uranium-one-clinton-foundation/">
        cover up Hillary's unpopular Russian dealings that get so desperately downplayed.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't run a shitty candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't rig an election, despite all the vague language about Russian ties to Trump or stupid accusations about a pee pee tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't ruin the working class with NAFTA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't force Hillary Clinton to sell out to the banking cartel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia didn't treat the progressive base like total shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was all Hillary and it piled up on her when she got exposed at the worst possible time. The fact that so many people are caught up in this joke of a wild goose chase is mind blowing. It's literally meant to distract people from working class issues.

       I mean, I don't know how you can trust an administration where there's a 50% turnover rate among his top advisers and 4 of the Presidents close contacts have plead guilty to lying to the US government, our government, about their contacts with, who guessed it!, Russians. May not be collusion, but how someone can have faith in that administration and the people inside it is beyond me.

       There will never be a concrete sentencing of anyone for "collusion." So yes, I have to move the goalposts. You'd have to be very careless to leave traces of anything connecting the Russian government to a US presidential campaign. Sounds reassuring, but the fact that people within Trumps administration are actively trying to hide their relations to Russians and multiple people have been indicted and are now cooperating with the investigation should signal that there's a lot missing from the whole picture. Why do we have to create conspiracy theories of conspiracies. Regardless if people think the left is pushing the investigation to the absolute limits, this "collusion" investigation does have some credibility and has brought to light some of the illegal things people within Trumps campaign have been doing. And to those who say that it's stupid, over the top, or useless, I ask them to look at the Benghazi investigations. We shouldn't pick our fights based on our political opinions.

       So maybe I really am just a dumb racist fuck or something, but if I look at situations (a) and (b) like so:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a) Party colludes with media, rigs primaries to place elite-chosen candidate, most people are blind to this because of collusion with media and academic sectors.  Same party is also responsible for certain domestic atrocities in the past like the Waco massacre and (more distantly) slavery.  Same party is also seeking to severely restrict civilian firearms ownership, seen by many to be the last bastion against totalitarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Corrupt outsider rigs election by pirating information from social media and colluding with multiple foreign governments to influence domestic discourse and opinion.  Said outsider is a blatant womanizer with probable alt-right sympathies.  Has run for years in the wildly corrupt NY/NJ casino and hotel real estate market, has many disgusting associates from previous work in life.  Likely financially irresponsible, or at least a playboy with other people's money.  Utterly antagonistic to both major political parties as well as the media, can't do anything without a magnifying glass on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm not seeing things right, but we're talking two totally different scales of corruption.  I know which one I'd pick, even if you were completely correct about all the colluding with a foreign power.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Question: Let us assume you are correct about collusion.  What exactly about this collusion is cause for concern?  What are you afraid of?

       Is this a true statement? I think voters' (rightful) disillusionment with the DNC/Hillary contributed to her defeat.

       Uhh... You realize that Democratic party is not the same one as today? This is a very passe talking point. There was a major re-alignment in the 1960s-1970s where southern democrats joined the Nixon/Reagan coalitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda seems like you just brought in some random anti Dem stuff. Waco, slavery (LOL) and gun control...Not sure how all of this is relates to the election. Therefore, I am questioning your bias in this conversation.

       That our democratic process was subverted (same concern as the DNC bs). That our President is able to be blackmailed by a foreign power. That the president, some of his campaign staff and administration staff are working to disrupt and divide civil society in the United States on behalf of Russia (directly or indirectly). Russia is not out here fighting for US interests, they are fighting for Russian interests. They want sanctions lifted, they want to move their dark money wherever they please. I worry that this collusion is the result of years of money laundering on behalf of Russian oligarchs. I could go on..really..

       I've seen most of the material already.  It discusses only hypotheticals.  Where it becomes specific (i.e. Syria) I frankly don't agree, as I think it is in America's best interests to simply not be involved and if that means Russia operates Syria as a proxy state, sure, go for it.

       Specifics.  What is the danger if Trump is compromised by Putin?

       Why would it be okay for the President to be compromised by anyone..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia intends to keep America divided, therefore if Trump is compromised, he will not take the necessary steps to unite us, or to prevent/fight off divisive forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree in the case of Syria, we need to gtfo. But I don't want the US to GTFO because its good for Putin, I want it because its good for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If his first thought in responding to any situation is "How is Russia going to see this?" and not "Will this help Americans?" then we have a problem. I am not saying these are the idiots' actual thoughts..
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia wants power. Putin adheres to the realist IR perspective in which power is zero sum. If the US has power, he doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has also been following Dugin's Geopolitical playbook as well.

       I confess I was not expecting this.  Most people I've talked to about this issue have a hardline approach regarding Syria: leaving is tantamount to sedition and is direct evidence of Trump's beholdence to Putin.

      <p>
       If Trump works against America in a way that benefits Russia, that would be a problem (depending on the scope of the issue).  But I also think there is a great deal of oversight applied to Trump, perhaps more than any other president in history, so the risk is somewhat mitigated.

      <p>
       Russia may adhere to this, but I don't, and I don't think it is a reasonable approach.  It is perfectly possible for multiple parties to enhance power without decrementing the power of others.  This is the case in the smallest of partnerships (such as marriage) or the greatest (such as international relations).

       I am personally of the opinion that Fox and CNN are far, far greater threats to American unity than anything Russia has ever come up with.  But then again, I am maybe a little too open minded, I actually read RT sometimes and Al Jazeera and BBC and figure what the lines of propaganda are.

       I honestly haven't read it.  There is only so much fascist nationalism I can stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it seems to me that there is a concerning amount of parallel between what Dugin prescribed for America and what we actually see.  If you wanted to suggest that the entire American media apparatus is someone in pay of (or corrupted by) Russian fascists, I might be inclined to consider your argument somewhat seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, some of Dugin's prescription I am sympathetic to.  For example, I support (generally) the adoption of a more isolationist stance.  We have a lot of problems in our own country and we need to focus our resources internally towards solving those problems before we can be world policeman.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how much of Dugin's writing is simply objective analysis (i.e. Club of Rome / Limits to Growth) versus actual prescription for action.  Either way, it honestly doesn't bother me much.  Should it bother me more?

       <li>
        Prescribes that Finland be absorbed by Russia.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Russia has been performing military drills close to the Finnish border as well as hacking gov't websites.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Prescribes Georgia should be dismantled.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Obviously, we remember Russian invading Georgia years ago.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Prescribes creating Geopolitical Shocks within Turkey.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Failed coup? arming Kurds? Just speculation here.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Prescribes that GB be cut off from Europe.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Brexit? Cambridge Analytica (whom worked for Brexit camp) has ties to Russian professor.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Prescribes creating racial divisions in the United States.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Like planning fake BLM or anti BLM events..etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food for thought anyway. A lot of the prescriptions seem to be playing out...

       I'm only discussing the last two points because those are the only ones that concern us in America.  I'll grant you that many of Dugin's other statements are paralleled closely in reality, but the field of geopolitics (similarly to the field of Austrian economics) is rather like that.  Once you have a good model for how the world works, you can describe (to an extent) the most likely patterns in the near future.

      <p>
       This is a bit of a stretch.  "Ties"?  What kind of ties?  Were they influential ties?  What about the professor?  The fact is, Cambridge Analytica hired a lot of very bright people and has a lot of ties all over the world, not to mention being funded by their various clients (again, all over the world).  Cambridge Analytica is sinister, but no more or less than any other efficient capitalist organization selling political influence for money.

       But you're totally missing the elephant in the room,
       <em>
        which is the fact that BLM exists as a radical, destabilizing organization in the first place!
       </em>
       So unless you want to suggest that BLM itself is a Russian op, I feel like Russia's influence is marginal at best compared to the (explicit) destabilizing efforts of purely domestic political organizations.

       There's tons of outrage.  It's probably part of the reason Hillary lost in the general (lack of support from Obama voters).  But internal DNC politicking isn't illegal.

      <p>
       Trump's presidency has been such a clusterfuck that it has unified the party against him instead of allowing it hash out the 2016 primary.  If the DNC leaks happened and Clinton still won, you'd see a much more divided and malicious party.

       Of course youre not going to see it. Trump and Clinton are owned by the same masters. That way you get to vote and feel like you larticipated but youre inly voting for who they let you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation is being led by the guy that was running the fbi during 911. Nothing is going to come of it against trump the advisors that have been swept up will be all that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       It likely was more blackmail than collusion as trump is loaded with dirty laundered Russian money. But its nothing his owners didnt already know, as they make up his actual debt, which is what his wealth mostly is. Goldman sachs owns his toilet. And you think hes going to do anything to drain their powet.

       Exactly ~ except it wasn't Russia doing the hacking, it was the DNC and those connected to the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Well, to steal the election for Hillary. Trump was a wild card to them. They didn't like a wild card they couldn't predict ~ Hillary was a much easier choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily for Hillary and company, Trump is a complete idiot, who is easily manipulated and fooled. Why do you think the Elite placed so many Neo-Cons in his office?

       We have literal proof Russians attempted to (and partially succeed in) hacking various parts of the US government. If there's bipartisan agreement and physical evidence to proved Russians have hacked US systems you must believe in wayyy to complex of deep state shit.

       So you're telling me that government officials and journalists made up an entire story of a Russian hack at the State department back in 2014 just so 4 years later they could use it as a anther way to lie to people about Russian hacks/influence. Totally believable.

       So a 2014 hacking now means Hillary and the DNC was hacked by Russia too? That doesn't just set them up to serve as a useful boogey man? Do you believe Skripal was poisioned by the Russians too?

       Yes! Because not only do we have experience that they've tried it before(2014) but we have evidence that they hacked the DNC in 2016 again. You're implying from your previous comment that there never was a hack. If there wasn't a hack then how did all of the emails get released?

       I'm not going to comment on the Skripal poisoning because I have no interest in the topic and I don't believe it relates to this thread.

That's how the NYT and Sony hacks were investigated. You can research and confirm that for yourself. In this case, the CrowdStrike and FBI conclusions were independently confirmed by two additional, credible cyber security companies,

       False. It is common practice for an independent company to perform the digital forensics for the FBI, and the FBI to  confirm it with their own analysis of the same imaged data. That's how the NYT and Sony hacks were investigated. You can research and confirm that for yourself. In this case, the CrowdStrike and FBI conclusions were independently confirmed by two additional, credible cyber security companies,

       Correct.  It should be pointed out that the FBI and other agencies use third party companies like Crowdstrike for their analysis pretty often.  That obviously doesn't downplay the credibility gap either, but I tend to see a lot of people jump to the conclusion that this was some sort of anomaly in how the FBI and others handle things like this.

       During his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey stated plainly that examining the affected servers directly would have provided the "best evidence" and that the FBI had requested access to them "several times on different levels," but were denied.

       If the DNC gave the FBI server images, then Comey kept it a secret.

       There were two "hacks" in roughly the same time period. The media and DNC did everything they could to at first conflate the two, then downplay both based on the optics of one of them.

       Well, i'm living in the reality where nobody has proven that russians hacked anything or that anybody colluded with anybody. 
  Also in this same reality, people have written books in which they plainly state that John Podesta and Robbie Mook were burning the midnight oil contacting everybody they knew in media to help them push their hillary excuse with russian hacking as the corner stone.

       It does have to be about the DNC because that's who is going to be running against Trump in a couple of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far there has been absolutely NO apology or cleanup for the cheating they used to bar Bernie from the race.  You can investigate Trump and prove collusion all day long, and at the end of the day if the DNC hasn't cleaned up their act, we will have Trump for two terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       So unless you want a 2-term Trump presidency, yes, you need to fucking talk about the DNC and they need to clean up their fucking act.

       Well the first thing didn't happen, and the second thing did not effect the election at all.. (she won by 3million votes, superdelegates didn't come into play).

        yes indeed the DNC colluded with the media to deny fair coverage to Bernie Sanders.

       The DNC cheated by a variety of means, including collusion with the media, to deny Bernie any possibility of a fair chance at the primary.  This constitutes barring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Bernie did not pursue as far as Ron Paul did with the GOP in 2012, and therefore did not get explicitly barred at the convention as Ron Paul was.  However, the facts remain.

       What answer to these questions do you have that you believe shows that Bernie was barred from the nomination? There is obviously a narrative in your head in which these things = Bernie getting screwed, so why don't you spell it out? What was the other shit they pulled?

       There is nothing you said at all that is factually accurate. Listen, it's okay to not know something. If you can't prove it one way or the other just admit both are possibilities. Anything else reeks of bias.  How could you possibly begin to know what impact superdelegates have throughout the course of a primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound foolish throwing number of voters up against superdelegates, pointing out how one number is larger than the other, and then yelling "see! No way they came into play!".  I mean come on...
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is acting like it's a fact because it appears to most rational people that they it was rigged, and I don't mean that as in they went and changed vote counts to change the winner, but that every aspect of the race was heavily stacked for Clinton specifically.  If someone in the DNC didn't tow the line, they had to answer to the Clinton campaign, which oversaw DNC staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe you've got some actually convincing arguments to make about it and I promise I'll be open minded. CMV

       Okay here's one: Amy Dacey (DNC CEO) reached an agreement with Robbie Mook (Clinton Campaign) where Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.
      </p>
      <p>
       One candidate controlled the entire political party.

       Also - we all realize the 3 million number is bullshit, so you can stop parading that out there.

       Right.. this is when Hillary for America saved the DNC from bankruptcy. All the other elements you mentioned is the control every nominee gets of the national party.... but let's go ahead and take all of this in the worst possible light.. in what way does this lead to Bernie being treated unfairly in the primary?

       Oh I dontkbow, maybe a former DNC chair recounting anything remotely similar?

       There must be a reason you said it.  Did you read it somewhere? Were the ESS nutjobs talking about it? Did you parents explain it that way?

       What in the world gave you the impression that an agreement like that had ever been made with a party and one of the candidates?

       You are a delegate in a caucus..... you think Washington sent 26,000 delegates to the DNC? But again I'm still not sure what point you're trying to make? Do you thinkHillary didn't win the popular vote?

       I think this is a brigade from TMoR or some such festering shithole.  Yes, it is an odd thing.  But if it doesn't change, I suspect rather strongly we already know how the next election will turn out.

       Hillary and team lost the election.  Since Day 1 there has been this massive resistance.  Remember that Hillary was expected to win and some of the brightest data scientist had her winning by a land slide.  Then she lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of allowing people to grasp the upset or question how the media/DNC completely missed the boat or how the emails reveal rigging the DNC in Hillary's favor - the left, media and hollywood go 100&amp;#37; at Trump with the Russian Collusion.  Why? Credible evidence? Maybe or because it provides a huge distraction or both.  You can see approval ratings for Trump are good.  DNC hasn't adjusted their talking points or revised to resonate better with middle class.  There goal is to blindside everyone to eliminate all the little unknown details from the election.   The reason why things are heating up now - mid terms.   It isn't more information or indictments/impeaching of Trump.  Its to put a dark cloud over the opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question everyone should be asking - If Trump/Russia collusion is confirmed and charged - do you really think people (independents) will trust the DNC?  Hardly.

       Or maybe, just maybe...Trump and co. have a number of shady business dealings with Russian oligarchs and other nefarious characters (look at how people like Roger Stone and Paul Manafort do business), but never actually engaged in any formal "collusion" or agreed to any "election hacking."
      </p>
      <p>
       The US MSM, desperate to promote a narrative that will shore up corrupt/deeply unpopular institutions (the MSM itself, the CIA/FBI/NSA, the Democratic &amp; Republican establishments, Wall Street, etc.) then purposely conflate the two, making it seem like any evidence of Trump and co.'s shady-ass financial dealings are evidence of "collusion"/"election hacking."
      </p>
      <p>
       And people are so blinded by (justifiable) hatred of Trump, they don't bother to parse the difference between the two, or realize that--by parroting the official line--they are shoring up the worst and most destructive institutions in America.

       I'm not gonna disagree with you. At this point, there's enough evidence to confidently say there was
       <em>
        some sort
       </em>
       of shady interactions between Trump and the Russians. Whether it was purely economic business, or election hacking, is beyond my ability to prove. Time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just pointing out how people in the sub completely disregard the possibility of collusion as "MSM lies and manipulation" when there's a perfectly plausible scenario for it - almost like they're trying to defend him.... I never, and I repeat,
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       saw this gentle treatment being applied to figures such as Hillary, who are automatically assumed to be guilty of numerous crimes, in the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, even if there was no official collusion, shady business with the Russians is still definitely something to be worried about, and something that could sway Trump's opinion and treatment of Russia, as we've seen happen numerous times now (remember the tariffs...?). It's still probably illegal and criminal, and it's a conspiracy theory that nobody on the sub seems to want to listen to.

       There's a simple explanation: political capital.

      <p>
       Defending against Russia allegations costs the Trump administration a lot of political capital. They tried to kill it early to preserve political capital by hiding some of their (legitimate) meetings but it backfired.

       you are conflating the DNC hack with the total failure of Trump to be honest about his dealings with Russia and his investments

      <p>
       2 separate issues entirely... nicely conflated to create a single  narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump definitely has a case to answer, but that is of his own making.... it is NOT about Russian interference... though Trump may be giving them leverage a foreign nation should NEVER have over a sitting president... simply cause he was not up front about his business dealings

       Who were the big influencers in the 2016 election? Big money.  Big fat multinational corporate money.  According to Open Secrets campaign contributions for both the Republican and Democratic candidates totaled $1,203,271,815.  The Russians didn't rig the Democratic primaries.  The Russians didn't prop up a weak Presidential candidate.  The Russians didn't net $400K from two closed-door speeches to Goldman Sachs.  But in all fairness, they did give $145 million to the Clinton Foundation in advance of the Uranium One deal to close on 20% of US Uranium reserves.

       Wikileaks is almost laughing at the DNC...and I find it somewhat odd that there's not a single mention of Bernie on here in the comments too.  I wasn't a big Bernie supporter but most of the regular users on here were pretty nonplussed by the way he was treated throughout the whole thing.

       They're trying to cripple the administration from making its reforms. Essentially, the Obama legacy is ruined because obviously Americans didn't support it, which is why they elected Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can already see this. Washington is frozen with this scandal, and they're having a hard time passing any laws. Its a political quagmire, but I'm pretty sure most Americans can see right through the smoke.

       If there is an investigation, and the investigators see evidence of another crime that has been committed, they aren't just going to say "Oh hey, look, a crime, too bad this isn't what we are supposed to be investigating, better let it go"...
      </p>
      <p>
       No. They have to investigate it. This is why the Cohen investigation was transferred to SDNY... Mueller found evidence. The evidence wasn't related to the original investigation, but you can't just ignore it, so another group took it over.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, evidence. No judge is going to grant a search warrant on a lawyer to the President without sufficient evidence of a crime and reason to think there is more evidence that could be destroyed if they simply ask/subpoena it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we know what the evidence is? No. Likely, though, it has to do with either Trump's real estate dealings, which Cohen was heavily involved in, or it's Cohen's own businesses.

       This should have been in OPs statement. Instead he simply stated the talking points of one side and insulted anyone else not having his stance. No critical thinking, no other narratives allowed. He didn't make a case and lead to an all out brawl comment section. OP is a bad actor.

       I have seen no evidence of either side to be honest. Russia is as bad as the American government and I have no doubt they have interfered in American elections before and will continue in the future, just like Israel, China, USA and so on.

       I don't think Russia loves Trump, but do think Russia wants to divide the western world in their own interests. Just like America wants to divide the middle East in their own interests.

       I'm talking on the world stage. Yeah I wouldn't want to be a Russian reporter who wrote a negative story about the leadership. But on the world stage, Russia has a tiny gdp, less than half the population of the US, a weak economy and a very dated military. All they really have are nukes and oil.

       GLP has been working overtime to extend their influence here since 2012. T_D is balls deep in your mom and this sub and they don't plan on leaving until they ring in the plot from "Idiocracy". There is no world in which Trump could be a mistake. He is their God. Pat Robertson even said that Trump is sitting in Jesus' place because Jesus got deported. You see...God came to Pat Robertson in a dream...God didn't have Jesus meet the 7 mountains of influence before being born in a manger to a poor middle-eastern family with brown skin so he had to allow Trump to gain dominion over the realms of Earth so that he could indoctrinate everyone into the Christian faith and remove God's greatest mistake - free will.

       and how weird that OP focuses on one party having shady primaries that are unfair, but doesn't mention the GOP doing the exact same shit to Ron Paul in the last election, when they literally changed rules mid race to ensure he stopped winning delegates. Then this election they nearly reversed that rule to hurt Trump, but considered it too late and didn't' go through with it.

       You don't think it's at all possible that people here don't really give one good god damn fuck about our shitty president and are instead suspicious that the people who own him and the media are trying to manufacture hostility towards Russia so that we can continue our bloody rape of the middle east?  Pointing the finger at anyone who objects to endless war and calling them "t-d folk" isn't very progressive.

       Fusion GPS was working for the presidential campaign of HRC.  Trump Jr was working for the presidential campaign of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see the timeline matching up.  WikiLeaks received the emails months before Trump Jr meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is testimony of the people who met with Trump Jr.  It's all documented.

       It is pretty obvious that you think Donald Trump is guilty. This explains, in your mind, his doing things that 'look guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us pretend that Donald Trump is actually innocent. If you were President, and your whole term as POTUS has this giant cloud of an investigation into a crime that you're actually innocent of, wouldn't you want to shut down the investigation? Now realize that you control the branch of governemt that is currently doing the investigation. Would it not be tempting to try and end it before anything potentially embarrassing is leaked by people inside the FBI that don't like you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just a random guy and I was able to come up with a realistic motive that explains Trump's behavior, no matter how guilty it may look to you.

No it wouldn't look tempting at all, in fact id be more worried about being perceived as obstructing justice.  Any capable moron would know that shutting down Muellers investigation doesnt magically make the FBI suddenly stop investigating.  Even if Mueller was fired the investigation by the FBI would still continue.

       No. He said live on TV with Holt that he wants the investigation done properly, wants someone competent, Comey is the wring man for the job, and that he'll even lengthen the investigation by firing Comey.

       Kid, I honestly don't think you have registered how stupid your statement is.  You don't get to fire people investigating you.  The fact that you think this is ok that a non partisan organization that is meant to carry out indepedent investigations was fired because he was investigating actual crimes in trumps campaign is nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are now making up truths when there is an actual interview about this?  He literally asks Comey if hes under investigation, and proceeds to fire him when he meets with Comey immediately after he states he will not stop investigating Flynn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump then proceeds to tell Russian's that he fired his own FBI director and that it eased the russian investigation.

       Actually, you do get to fire whoever you like, and Trump did. Cry about it all you like, but the fact is he did it and gave valid reasons for doing so.

        USA Today - Trump suggests the FBI director reports directly to the president. Here's how it really works
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the position of the FBI director reports to the attorney general. Also, the agency's intelligence activities are overseen by the Director of National Intelligence, according to the FBI.
       </p>
       <p>
        While it's true that the attorney general is part of Trump's Cabinet, the president's remarks that the FBI director answers directly to him ignores a longstanding precedent of distance between the executive branch and an independent FBI.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "As a matter of constitutional hierarchy, this is of course true. But in investigative matters, the FBI director does not, or should not, serve the president by reporting to him,"
        </strong>
        wrote Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of Lawfare blog and a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         FBI directors serve a lengthy 10-year term designed to guard FBI directors' political independence
        </strong>
        — and presidents typically do not want to give even the appearance of influencing the nonpolitical law enforcement agency's investigations.

       The president can fire the director of the FBI, but only for cause. The executive branch isn't supposed to be directing the justice department on who they can, can't and should be investigating.

      <p>
       No, because ending the investigation could be obstruction of justice. Since I am innocent I would just let it play out. Also, Trump has already had so many things come out about him I really doubt anything can embarrass him at this point.

       <p>
        ABC News' George Stephanopoulos asked if Comey's assumption that Clinton would win the presidency in 2016 was a factor in his decision to send a letter to Congress in October claiming additional emails had been discovered related to the email investigation, days before the election. Comey said it, "must have been."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "It must have been," Comey told Stephanopoulos. "I don't remember consciously thinking about that, but it must have been. Because I was operating in a world where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump. And so I'm sure that it was a factor. Like I said, I don't remember spelling it out, but it had to have been, that she's going to be elected president and if I hide this from the American people, she'll be illegitimate the moment she's elected, the moment this comes out."

       OP said the FBI is / was against Trump, I provided that announcement as a reference to refute the idea that the FBI is / was anti-Trump. I don't see how thinking the announcement won't impact the outcome means the FBI is anti-Trump.

       No. If I was under investigation for a crime I didn't commit I'd be speaking with investigators, doing on air interviews, and doing everything in my power to prove my innocence, not try to shut down the investigation and start firing respectable employees within the FBI.

       Anyone see the outrage over the American idol voting? Because the top ten didn’t have a woman of color and a tranny America is a racist shithole...

       Maybe just maybe the conservatives just got a bunch of Russian hackers to vote.

       They were pushing 'Russian Bots' hard in the UK as propaganda against anti-Syria bombing. From "election hacking" to Syria, it's all part of the anti-Russian war propaganda in my opinion. Literally calling provably real people Bots and inferring everyone who questions the narrative is victims of an avalanche of Russian Bot propaganda.

       I mean the original press release from the DHS says both they know of hacking, and they suspect other interference.

       Part of me thinks the hacking is not being talked about as much because it pales in comparison to what actually happened. Our president and his staff actively colluding with a foreign government to get elected is a much bigger story than that foreign government hacking.

       I'm pretty sure the DNC were blaming the Russians well before ANY intelligence agency commented.
      </p>
      <p>
       from an organisation stupid enough to use password as their password... and all the other idiotic stories we heard... I struggle to believe they were EVER ina position to cite the source of the leak/hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is for that reason alone... from teh outset this has appeared to me as a distraction from the DNC problems that arose from the leaks.
the timeline clearly shows the Russia dialogue started around the day following the DNC chair allegations went public
      </p>
      <p>
       they had the motive, they did not have IT ability to blame the Russians
      </p>
      <p>
       so lets call it a 50/50 probability..... then teh IT contractors WELL overpaid and blackmailing a marine to return hard drives... the Feds NEVER actually getting the drives to inspect....  all the subsequent WTF moments have just served to re-enforce that this is a distraction
      </p>
      <p>
       since the birth of the internet.... nefarious activities have happened out of Russia. Nothing has changed, other than an apparent ability to directly link all of those to Putin himself
      </p>
      <p>
       and so far as voting machines... one must ASSUME everyone is trying to rig it, putting processes in place to guarantee a protected, legitimate and transparent voting process.   This should start with the so-called proprietry code... which should be fully public and audited imo.  Based on this alone.... America should clean it's own house before blaming external factors
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be far happier if a total overhaul or audit of the voting system was initiated as a result, rather than simply blaming another country and doing the sanction thing, cause if it is not the Russians it will be the Chinese, or it will be or... or... or...

       I did. You cant insult your way out of this one. The guccifer stuff came months after Papadopulous knew russia had stolen emails in may. Both Guccifers claims and the Wikileaks releases were in June and July. Sorry bud, but Papa knew about all this months before anything came out. How on earth did an Australian warn the FBI that Russia had hacked the DNC 2 months before anything came out? Is he a psychic?

       There is no collusion charge, but there are hacking and campaign finance crimes that are meant by the general idea of "colluding with Russia".

       Favoring one candidate over another, and conspiring to give more air time to one candidate, should move the public to distrust the DNC to hold fair primaries, not lead to criminal charges.

       The original indictment. Instead of using conjecture as to what Papadopoulos knew and didn’t know try citing what the facts are. You apparently make assumptions about him because you have no case without it? "Pap knew! Pap knew!" only serves to make your already weak case weaker.

        Nunes noted that no intelligence was shared with the U.S. from any of the members of the “Five Eyes” agreement – that being Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is relevant because the FBI says that the Trump investigation was kicked off after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the FBI that Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos drunkenly admitted in a London pub that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reported last December that “Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians’ role.”
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         This was clearly not true according to the EC, which states that no intelligence passed through Five Eyes official channels.

       </p>
       <p>
        ...Nunes then told Fox’s Maria Bartiromo that the House Intel Committee is now honing in on the State Department due to signs of
        <strong>
         “major irregularities” in how the alleged Papadopoulos comments reached U.S. intelligence agencies.

       Right.. this is when Hillary for America saved the DNC from bankruptcy. All the other elements you mentioned is the control every nominee gets of the national party.... but let's go ahead and take all of this in the worst possible light.. in what way does this lead to Bernie being treated unfairly in the primary?
