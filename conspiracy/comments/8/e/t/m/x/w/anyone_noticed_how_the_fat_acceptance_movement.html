       The aspect missing from this is something psychotherapists and people in recovery programs understand: self shame is what binds the unhealthy habit to the person in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you recover from overeating or alcoholism or drug addiction, once you get past the initial habit you have to fix the emotions surrounding the mindset which are self loathing and shame for your brokenness.  To do that you have to start accepting yourself as NOT broken and not bad and have to remove the shame aspect to be able to love the self and accept who you are and that you can change yourself.  If the shame stays in place, the behavior can never be modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fat acceptance is a distorted thing in that at its roots it is a way to sidestep the self loathing and "Heal the shame that binds" the behavior to the self.  Maybe some people go too far and remain unhealthy in some of this but overall, fat acceptance is not acceptance of being fat but the beginning of an acceptance of the self as good and healthy.  Then the next steps can be taken with less rebounding behavior.

       I call bullshit, being fat should never be acceptable or made to feel "rosey" unless you have a doctor diagnose you with a thyroid issue or something similar. If you are fat and you don't have a medical issue you should feel like shit. Eat less calories, count your calories and quit being fat. It's really simple unless you are undisciplined lazy fatass.

       There are things about myself that I hate but I constantly work on those to improve myself. Mostly its about accomplishing things outside of the normal responsibilities of work/family. Self loathing, sure I could get on board with that assessment, I can be very hard on myself sometimes.

       Be careful because that self loathing squishes out in funny little ways and gets on the people we love.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been working in recovery for over two decades and am at the point now where I see self loathing and the hidden aspects of shame and guilt as the thing that turns humans into monsters (not you).  It's what i believe will be our next big evolutionary step, removing that self loathing and turning it into what it is suppose to be: self-concern.

       I'm a self proclaimed expert on this!  I'm 48 now but when I hit my 30s, my self loathing manifested as full blown mental health issues via social anxiety, agoraphobia, panic attacks, isolation and a number of PTSD like symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was super lucky to find a pretty new-ish therapist that was versed in exactly what was going on which is basically I was a 13 year old by running around in a 33 year old's body.  Emotionally I was a child in an adult world.  Children can't cope with that shit and especially children that went through the childhood I had (alcoholic family).  That child had learned some really bad habits (anxiety, isolation, stuck up in their head, plays the victim etc) and those habits were still being used by 33 old me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The therapy taught me how to undo the bad habits and remake who I was. If you need more info on any of this, I have a sub that deals with it.

       I'm gonna do you one better.  Here the shtick:

      <p>
       The sub is
       <a href="/r/AdultChildren">
        /r/AdultChildren
       </a>
       - don't let the name worry you, this is a common thing that actually, I rarely see anyone not have some aspects of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub is full of people experiencing the same thing so you can see what applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But first thing is read this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/4rgden/the_good_parent_messages/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/4rgden/the_good_parent_messages/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a 9 nine page PDF there that is super hard to read but it goes into the very real science about what is happening to you physiologically, mentally and how to figure out where the triggering is coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have ancient habits that have been there since early childhood.  In the families we grew up in, a lot of the advancement from those early habits never happens because  the parents aren't there (both working, divorce, alcoholics, lack of extended family, move to the suburbs etc) and the child in this latch key existence, never replaces those early habits with new ones because no one is home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adult Children is about learning to be an adult in both mind, body, spirit, personality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I am here if you have any questions.  I have sent several dozen people in real life, my friends, on this journey and all of them are happier for it.  Way happier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy now after so much self loathing and it glorious!

       You completely missed his point.  A part of the healing process for people stuck in awful habits is metal.  They learn to disassociate from the identity of being broken,  lazy,  fat,  or other negative traits. They accept themselves and their faults and then they can focus on improving themselves and removing their faults.
      </p>

       You can have a healthy mind and feel like shit because you are aware you made a shitty choice.  But when you are unhealthy mentally,  you may believe that you are shit,  because you make unhealthy decisions, which makes you shitty. There's no belief of positive change being possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side,  I will agree that there is a dangerous element inside of the fact acceptance that gives people the risk of not understanding the importance of accepting their faults and the risks that come with them. But a risk of misunderstanding the ideal goals can be said for many movements.

       I don;t think it's societies burden to make these people feel better. It's simple, eat less, work out more. Barring massive chemical depression (go to a doc and get meds) there's no excuse for not taking care of yourself.

       Then you're part of the downfall. They are a part of society. They also influence society. Their burdens are society's burdens as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like we teach children who we assume know nothing, we should teach our peers who we know lack certain knowledge or trains of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible for people to not view things the same as you, and it's possible for them to follow an irrational train of thought that will only hurt them. It's possible for them to not see that, just like it's possible for you to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you purposely ignore this possibility that others need help seeing, and just assume they are purposely making poor choices in a healthy, wise frame of thought, you're simply leaving society to crumble where's it weakest, or you're pushing the responsibility to uplift society onto those who actually wish for it to be better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think it's selfish of you call the struggles of others a burden, just because they have not gained the mental fortitude, reasoning, skills, experience, expertise, and other such traits that you may have. Outside forces help people understand what's important by breaking their world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uplifting your peers is not a burden, and it's sad that you would call it that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, after typing all this, I realize you STILL missed the point that you are painting a photo of what every person SHOULD be, what skills they SHOULD have, and what reasoning they SHOULD understand, when these things may or may not be instilled in them, or they may not be in a position to grasp these concepts, which is why we help them.

       "How can an adult not know that basic caloric intake is the main responsible factor for them being fat?"

       I'm not defending the ideology that being fat is okay. I will defend the ideology that it is okay to be okay with being fat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for your question, you're basically asking how it's possible for someone to never be exposed to something, which is what it takes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are on the conspiracy board. One of the many consistent beliefs brought up on this board is that disinformation is abundant throughout society. Keep the middle/working class citizens uniformed and without power is a goal. Bacon was sold as a healthy food. Sugar was disassociated from the health issues caused by an abundant intake. It is illegal to grow a garden of food for your own intake. It is illegal to filter rain water and drink it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a society where these are facts, the idea that an adult is unaware of ONE thing does not seem to be a stretch of any proportions.

       How can you justify it being ok to be fat? My justification for it not being ok to be fat is that it is scientifically proven to be unhealthy and also be a huge drain on resources for the rest of humanity. It is a completely preventable burden on society that is solely on the shoulders of the lazy fat ass that won't count their calories. It's not like a single mistake that can't be reversed, these fat people can start making the change today. Just start counting calories.

       I'm not sure I recall saying I justify being fat. I hold certain values that push me to prevent myself from being fat. I am not okay with being fat.

      <p>
       That being said, this is because of MY values, that I can only enforce on MYSELF. I can explain to others the potential cons of obesity and unhealthy life choices. It's on them to make those informed decisions.

       AS WELL, I understand that people who may have once understood something, or may have been exposed to something, may fall into an emotional or mental slump that requires an outside force to help them get out of. It'd be irrational to assume everyone can take care of themselves without any help at all times.

       At this point in our conversation,  I feel I should tell you that you come off as more of a fanatic that had not truly come to understand the multiple facets of life and society yet.  You're spouting a lot of statements that come from fat - hate culture, which focuses on very negative traits and doesn't encourage understanding of outside views.

       I believe you are deflecting by trying to call me a fanatic or accuse me of being a part of some hate culture. I think in fact you dont understand the facets of society. How about this, you list off all the positive effects being fat and having large population portions of fat people. After you do that if needed I'll list off all the negative aspects and we shall see who comes out on top. This isn't about viewpoints or peoples feelings this is about raw data and evidence. After our little exercise it will become completely apparent that having large obese population swathes is almost wholly negative. You're argumentation position is almost like arguing that theft is good. It's just a negative bad habit plain and simple. Reality wins, not trying to look like some holier than thou type.

       Its apparent that you habe no idea what our personal conversation was about. You continue to believe that I am of the viewpoint that being fat is healthy,  or that there are benefits to being fat. I never stated that being fat has benefits.  I never stated that I'm Okay with being fat. I will never state that it is okay for a large population to have a majority of its citizens be obese.
      </p>
      <p>
       I explained to you the positive goals of fat acceptance and stated that there is a dangerous element in it that prevents self improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stated that while you or I may not want to be fat, its not our call to force other people to not be fat.  If they are okay with that fault,  so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also told you that it was selfish to assume everyone is like you and can, as such, make the same logical reasoning and choices,  because you're ignoring life and emotions and mental health and other traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU stated fat people have a major negative impact on me,  you which you provide no proof.  You stated you want to tax fat people because you consider them a burden on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       AT that point,  I asked you how you would categorize this tax and employ it systematically, which I did want an answer for.
      </p>
      <p>
       And because you somehow managed to show me that you don't care about helping people,  and that you hate fat and its impact on you,  and that you'd rather punish fat people despite the negative impacts of their poor lifestyles instead of promoting ways to help them improve,  I took the time to tell you the impression you left upon me.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no. I will not pull up information on how fat is healthy. I will ask you why you have not mentioned adding nutritional education to public schools to help prevent fat, and why you believe a child who grew up with uninformed parents should be taxed for their nutritional neglect of the child at the age of 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am more than willing to continue this conversation, but I'm wondering if you will realize my point, or if I will continue to be the bad guy who says "it's okay to be fat" with nothing esse added to the statement.

       You opinion on obesity and fat throws expectations at people without proper consideration to their upbringing,  knowledge,  not metal health. Yippy sound draconian begets you never once brought up a positive solution to the problem we discussed,  never showed empathy,  couldn't understand how people could not be exposed to certain facts in their lives,  and suggested punishing obese people before suggesting helping them,  because they are a burden.

       I'll be frank.  You're just a fat hater. You aren't here to help society.  Yippy are here to hate fat.  You blame the lack of progress on the individual,  and don't acknowledge that outside forces wish for the individual to fail. You refuse to pick up the responsibility to help individuals who suffer from their predators and their poor environments and you assume that reach of these individuals has the knowledge,  wisdom,  strength,  and reasoning to make the same decisions as you,  which shows a lack of empathy and a lack of understanding for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mention the positive goals,  and you ask me to show you positive results,  which I have not discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say I have a fat acceptance stance but I made no claim to be part of that movement,  nor have I mentioned what my solution to the obesity epidemic would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are allowed to choose their faults. People are allowed to know the downsides of being fat and choose to stay their weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learning to accept that you are not trash,  which means you can improve,  is an important step in improvement.  This is a goal of fat acceptance,  which has many messages,  some of which I disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You continue to show a lack of understanding and empathy towards the lives of others. You are unable to grasp that people are exposed to different things and come to different conclusions,  or miss out on important information,  which leads them down different paths.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fat man can open an orphanage or faulty that helps children in need and offer lessons for skills they need in the future.  This man does not die of a heart attack or go to the doctor more than others. He suffers from bad knees but his private insurance and his personal money pay for his needs so he's self sufficient.  This man is trash to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a unique set of priorities,  but you fail to acknowledge that they are yours,  and others do not have to agree,  or value them the same.

       How can you not?  Obesity is a risk factor for sooo many things.  As someone who used to be fat back in my teens I'd really recommend getting in shape, 9/10 would do again.

       Just stop eating as much, take control of your life. I've never been fat ever because I exercise, research health, and limit my caloric intake. Just do that and quit being a vortex of food consumption, you are a drain on the resources and social fabric of humanity.

       Of course you will react like that because it takes a decent person to limit their own self pleasure to help better society as whole. Sure, continue to be fat, die early for all I care but it sucks that you will be a huge leech on an already broken and shitty medical system. You are a bad person and aren't a responsible member of society, you should literally be taxed more for your lazy, selfish and irresponsible behavior.

       Calling them lazy pieces of shit is unfair. Undisciplined is maybe accurate. But our entire food industry is trying so hard to make them what they are...not saying they have no part, but I don't think they had a fair shot in the first place.

       I say lazy because it takes work to lose fat and keep it off. To me they are both lazy and undisciplined. I call them pieces of shit because they are a major drain on resources and humanity. It's not like people born with handicaps, we must protect and integrate them into society because they can't help a physical deformity but these fat asses are just lazy and slop shit food into their gluttonous fat jiggly cheeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in the same system as them and I have never been fat. The food industry tailors their meals to the demands of these fat fucks. Ever wonder what would happen if fat fucks stopped gulping down soda and eating junk food? The companies would stop making them because people wouldn't buy them.

       Same here, and they gross me the fuck out too. Shoot, I moved out of country for a year and when I came back it kinda freaked me out, all the fat people...like almost everyone i saw in the airport. And this was the Las Vegas airport, so I was seeing a cross section of the whole country sorta. I dunno, it really made an impression.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the real culpability lies with the corporations and agendas that profit from people in that condition. I think we could cut the fatties a little slack for that reason. We take care of oursleves, work out, it is natural to us. I dunno what I am trying to say here. Being fat is gross. The industry that preys on fat people is grosser.

       I have been kinda cooped up for a bit recently, and nearly the same thing happened again. Even outside walking, which I have a ton of respect for someone in that condition trying to do something different. But there are like these herds of tacky dressed hairless buffalo roaming my home town, and jfc, I just wish people took health sorta serious. It aint hard. And endorphins probably negate the need for a lot of the antidepressants half the country is on.

       I eat bacon too and I want you to eat it too. The issue is how much bacon per day and that the responsible thing to do is figure out how many calories go into each piece and ration it out appropriately. There are times after a huge workout that I will devour an entire package of bacon but I manage my calories still. The only issue I have with obesity is that it affects all of society in a very negative way. It stresses out an already shitty medical system. I don't hate fat people but have a very harsh view of their responsibility to society, they are leeching from society and with no real justification. It is something that is completely preventable barring severe gland disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have major problems with HIV/AIDS research and the amount of funding that goes into it. It is almost completely preventable vs something like dementia but AIDS gets all this stupid social based funding when dementia is something that is not easily preventable and causes a huge amount of suffering. All we need to do to prevent HIV is get tested before fucking someone and wear a damn condom. We dont need billions going into HIV research so i'm fucking livid that dementia is a poorly funded area of research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obesity is something easily preventable, manage your calories, exercise, don't be a lazy fuck. Simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I eat junk food and I watch my weight and belly, if the belly starts accumulating fat its time to break out the celery and start watching what I eat more carefully. It's your responsibility to do this. Just do it and you can still eat bacon.

       Nor should there be classes for it to begin with. These are life lessons that should of been taught by the parents and there's information out there as well.

       Why is it unfair for a company to advertise their products? They're not holding a gun to our heads to go out and buy it. That's a conscious decision on our part. Just like it's a conscious decision for a person to change their eating habits.

       Am I in the wrong sub though? So government controlled schools should have classes on avoiding the massive industry that the government is working with to poison the populace for the medical industry. That's the best option over having responsibility for one's own decisions? More reliance on the government.

       Same here, and they gross me the fuck out too. Shoot, I moved out of country for a year and when I came back it kinda freaked me out, all the fat people...like almost everyone i saw in the airport. And this was the Las Vegas airport, so I was seeing a cross section of the whole country sorta. I dunno, it really made an impression.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the real culpability lies with the corporations and agendas that profit from people in that condition. I think we could cut the fatties a little slack for that reason. We take care of oursleves, work out, it is natural to us. I dunno what I am trying to say here. Being fat is gross. The industry that preys on fat people is grosser.

       There is a 9 nine page PDF there that is super hard to read but it goes into the very real science about what is happening to you physiologically, mentally and how to figure out where the triggering is coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have ancient habits that have been there since early childhood.  In the families we grew up in, a lot of the advancement from those early habits never happens because  the parents aren't there (both working, divorce, alcoholics, lack of extended family, move to the suburbs etc) and the child in this latch key existence, never replaces those early habits with new ones because no one is home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adult Children is about learning to be an adult in both mind, body, spirit, personality.

       Lastly, I am here if you have any questions.  I have sent several dozen people in real life, my friends, on this journey and all of them are happier for it.  Way happier.

       Of course you will react like that because it takes a decent person to limit their own self pleasure to help better society as whole. Sure, continue to be fat, die early for all I care but it sucks that you will be a huge leech on an already broken and shitty medical system. You are a bad person and aren't a responsible member of society, you should literally be taxed more for your lazy, selfish and irresponsible behavior.

       Ok, I can relate to a lot of what you said but I still question:
      </p>
      <p>
       "How can an adult not know that basic caloric intake is the main responsible factor for them being fat?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I 100% am against all of this fat acceptance shit, it's disgusting. We should NOT EVER make it seem ok to be fat outside of real medical conditions. How can you defend an ideology that makes it ok to be fat?

       Its apparent that you habe no idea what our personal conversation was about. You continue to believe that I am of the viewpoint that being fat is healthy,  or that there are benefits to being fat. I never stated that being fat has benefits.  I never stated that I'm Okay with being fat. I will never state that it is okay for a large population to have a majority of its citizens be obese.
      </p>
      <p>
       I explained to you the positive goals of fat acceptance and stated that there is a dangerous element in it that prevents self improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stated that while you or I may not want to be fat, its not our call to force other people to not be fat.  If they are okay with that fault,  so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also told you that it was selfish to assume everyone is like you and can, as such, make the same logical reasoning and choices,  because you're ignoring life and emotions and mental health and other traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU stated fat people have a major negative impact on me,  you which you provide no proof.  You stated you want to tax fat people because you consider them a burden on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       AT that point,  I asked you how you would categorize this tax and employ it systematically, which I did want an answer for.

       And because you somehow managed to show me that you don't care about helping people,  and that you hate fat and its impact on you,  and that you'd rather punish fat people despite the negative impacts of their poor lifestyles instead of promoting ways to help them improve,  I took the time to tell you the impression you left upon me.

       So no. I will not pull up information on how fat is healthy. I will ask you why you have not mentioned adding nutritional education to public schools to help prevent fat, and why you believe a child who grew up with uninformed parents should be taxed for their nutritional neglect of the child at the age of 18.

       I am more than willing to continue this conversation, but I'm wondering if you will realize my point, or if I will continue to be the bad guy who says "it's okay to be fat" with nothing esse added to the statement.
