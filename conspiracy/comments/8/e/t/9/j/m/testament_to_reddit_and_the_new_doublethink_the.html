    <div class="md"><p>Sure. In the same way that its popular to hate any president. The American president is basically the official scape goat of globalists and the deep state. The government does awful things, the pres gets blamed. They get their agendas through and use culture and the media to blame the president so we think we are getting change when we replace him. Then the cycle starts all over.</p>

<p>Before 11/9 we discussed everything and afterwards this &quot;if you&#39;re not we with us you&#39;re against us mentality&quot; took over.

<p>As a liberal mother with a voice. One they disagreed with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2006/10/17/peace-mom-cindy-sheehan-exposed0.html">Lets see how she was talked about Hannity&#39;s show</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>HANNITY: You do two things in the book. Number one, you describe how Cindy Sheehan had met President Bush a year before she became critical and was very complimentary of him. The media seems to have not done their job.</p>

<p>And the second thing you uncover in this book is that she worked very closely with the Kerry people. This was ‚Äî she, in essence, was used by them. Explain that.</p>

<p>MORGAN: We have documents from the FEC that tracked the money, and that&#39;s generally how you get to a good investigative stories. And we&#39;ve spent a lot of time in putting this all together.</p>

<p>It was John Kerry&#39;s political campaign, John Kerry personally, along with Michael Moore, went to Cindy Sheehan just days and a couple of weeks after the death of her son and asked her to make a commercial for him.</p>

<p>MORGAN: The media was a willing and complicit factor in this whole story. Cindy Sheehan was not just an ordinary, suburban, Vacaville, California, mom who suddenly planted herself, and woke up one morning, and said, &quot;I&#39;ve got to do something about the war in Iraq,&quot; and went to Crawford to ask the president, &quot;What noble cause did my son die for?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What happened was, she was financially assisted ‚Äî hundreds and thousands of dollars were spent to help her to create a media message, which she, in fact, began to unspooling every night on the 6:00 news.</p>

<p>They were implying that the only reason why she was saying those things and attacking Bush and his administration is because she was paid to do so. Basically calling her a shill. </p>

<p>I think that Colmes had a pretty good response to him and his book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ALAN COLMES, CO-HOST: You know what, let me just say something. I find that going after Cindy Sheehan the way you are is despicable. This is a woman who lost her son. Everybody grieves differently.</p>

<p>In your book, for example, you talk about Cindy Sheehan having an affair with Lew Rockwell. You say she&#39;s addicted to online porn, which has nothing to do with anything, as far as I&#39;m concerned. You tie her to David Duke and the KKK and Hugo Chavez. And I really think it&#39;s disgusting.</p>

<p>I really think it&#39;s disgusting what you&#39;re doing, in terms of talking about her being online in chat rooms, doing porn stuff. What does it have to do with anything?</p>

<p><strong>I think it&#39;s a smear job to talk about her online, having affairs, doing online porn, as if that has anything to do with anything.</strong> This is a woman ‚Äî everybody goes through a grieving process differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was supposed to be the liberal counterpart to Hannity. Do you not remember the show?</p>

<p>The point was that as soon as the grieving widow started attacking Bush, there were conservatives out there who were trying to attack her with smear jobs, and Hannity would have people like him on to give them credibility and to attack her.</p>

<p>It proves my original point, that anyone that attacked her was considered a traitor and was counter attacked in conservative media or by conservatives. </p>

<p>Hannity would defend Bush and his presidency, but now would happily criticize him and the Iraq war. </p>

<p>If it was as a bad as people like to make it out to be during the Bush era then colmes wouldn‚Äôt have a voice. And he did. And the left media had a huge presence as well. </p>

<p>And if you remember Colmes on Hannity, he was used a liberal punching bag for Hannity and his guests to beat up on. He was used as a strawman to project liberals on, and to give a false narrative that Fox news is or was &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;. </p>

<p>My point wasn&#39;t that no one ever criticized Bush. My point was that anyone that attacked Bush or the Iraq war was attacked as a traitor or smeared by conservatives and conservative media. </p>

<p>Now, those same conservatives would happily attack Bush. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember coming home from college and turning on my TV only to see &quot;BREAKING NEWS&quot; twin towers hit by terrorists. I was scared and very emotional and wanted revenge against the terrorists. Three years later, I completed my civil engineering. It was not until 2004, I started watching the videos of falling towers and kept thinking, this can&#39;t be possible! I looked up probably 20 videos of buildings being demolished all over the world and it struct me like anything. I was so shocked, even bigger than the actual strike itself. From then onwards, my research began into false flags.</p>

<p>On topic, I cannot believe a world in which bush family can&#39;t be war criminals. Millions of death to their name. The only thing I can ask for is justice in this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you won&#39;t find much info on that just by going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush">Wikipedia</a>. Here is part of the story &quot;Union Banking Corporation </p>

<p>Bush was a founding member and one of seven directors (including W. Averell Harriman) of the Union Banking Corporation (holding a single share out of 4,000 as a director), an investment bank that operated as a clearing house for many assets and enterprises held by German steel magnate Fritz Thyssen. In July 1942, the bank was suspected of holding gold on behalf of Nazi leaders. A subsequent government investigation disproved those allegations but confirmed the Thyssens&#39; control, and in October 1942 the United States seized the bank under the Trading with the Enemy Act and held the assets for the duration of World War II. Journalist Duncan Campbell pointed out documents showing that Prescott Bush was a director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen.</p>

<p>Prescott Bush worked closely with Thyssen who was a prominent Nazi financier and did continue to manage his accounts during the Nazi occupation. Some historians dispute his allegiance to the Nazi party. Historian Herbert Parmet agrees with the assessment that Bush was not a Nazi sympathizer.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the part you got right.</p>

<p>The intent isn&#39;t to whitewash.  The intent is to give the MSM a fake credibility.  If they put out these faux pieces praising an ex-GOP President and showing respect - it creates a plausibly deniability that they are advocates for the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>They treat GOP candidates and GOP Presidents like shit when they are running/in office - engaged in a full out, orchestrated campaign to destroy them.  Then when they&#39;re finally out they can turn on the &quot;oh we respected him&quot; crap.</p>

<p>Just look in how differently GWB, Obama, and Trump were covered in the media.</p>

<p>For example, few people, other than native Americans, feel outrage at, say, mention of the Trail of Tears or Andrew Jackson, the President that allowed it to happen. The useful time for outrage was while atrocities occur, and shortly after, during the war crimes phase. If there is no war crimes phase, they got away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>G.W. Bush looks kinda good by comparison to Trump so far...and that‚Äôs really saying something considering how bad G.W. Bush really was. </p>

<p>Hanging chads in Florida and miscounting errors in Ohio polling machines are cake compared to Putin potentially blackmailing a sitting president with an underage prostitute piss tape. </p>

<p>Afghanistan and Iraq were absolute disasters. But they‚Äôll be a mere skirmish if we start WW3 in Syria. There are the same sectarian tensions, but there‚Äôs also an Arab geopolitical context and a broader global geopolitical issue layered on top of it.</p>

<p>Bush‚Äôs tax cuts, later extended by Obama, were a catastrophe for the deficit and blew up the debt. This new set of tax cuts are going to do the same. But the difference is that Bush leaned on supply side economics when the economy was in recession. Trump is doing it in an economic boom when we should be hiking taxes and investing in infrastructure instead.</p>

His willingness to compromise to get things done is underrated and often forgotten with all the insane partisanship that was going on around him. Anyways, it‚Äôs irrelevant to point, which is that the supply-side cuts were installed and active during an economic recession, and now that we‚Äôre in recovery (clarification: the <em>top</em> is in recovery and gaining even if the middle and lower classes lag behind) cutting taxes, especially at the top, is not as appropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM will always glorify ex-presidents, even if they were previously deemed the enemy.</p>

<p>The Bush family was defeated for the last time during the GOP primaries and but were no longer a threat to MSM before then because they did not speak out against Obama when he was prez.</p>

<p>MSM is Progressive, so as long as you are no longer working against them, they will give their devils their due when are old or dead. They also have short memories and some of these reporters were not even around during Bush I or Bush II&#39;s reigns.</p>

<p>Yes, the lesson is NEVER believe MSM when they label someone as a &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;villain&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s been weird to see lately. I attribute it more to a mix of nostalgia, like &quot;oh, remember the early 90s? wasn&#39;t that such a simpler time&quot; and the fact that, compared to Trump, the Bushes, even W, actually seem &quot;presidential.&quot; And people like that. And rightly so. Say what you will about their policies (I protested hard against W, not a fan in the least), but at least they weren&#39;t the absolute shit show that we have today. So, that may be in part why people are being more sympathetic on Reddit to the Bushes. </p>

Reddit has a lot of young users who are in there early to mid 20s who would have been barely teenagers when Bush left office.

    <div class="md"><p>U/axolotl_peyotl you know more than most ppl. This whole left vs. Right is just one big scam and these people are homies when the cameras are off.</p>

<p>I just saw a group of photos which showed the Obamas and Bush family looking like they were long lost friends.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, there are those who really do despise one another, however, this project sometimes referred to as US government is nothing more than a Truman show with daily news planned days in advance.
I really use to believe in my country and its way of life.</p>

<p>Things like the US being one of the only countries without health care...</p>

<p>Lobbyists which push their deadly products upon the masses with no recourse....
Newly signed bills which allows our government to assassinate its citizens....</p>

<p>I can go on and on.
Its really sad watching my children go through college not knowing how long it will take to pay back loans of $56,780 and $42,041 while trying to live an independent life..</p>

<p>It hurts me to know they will struggle through their lives with massive debt over their head before they ever enter the workforce.
Sorry...went off topic...however I feel better now.
Thank you for all your time and effort as a Mod. I appreciate all you have done for the sub.
Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes way deeper than man.  The animal kingdom as a whole evolved via a system of hierarchies within species.  Ever since testosterone began to influence sexual dimorphism, the most powerful bred the most.  Hundreds of millions of years later,  and we see this behavior taken to the extreme,  with almost every social mammal having a violent series of hierarchy determining power within a group,  influencing who gets food and sex first. </p>

<p>We as humans don&#39;t get to decide to not be mammals any longer. We are doing our best with reason,  but our underlying mechanics cause strong men to rise to the top. </p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s an old saying in Tennessee ‚Äî I know it&#39;s in Texas, probably in Tennessee ‚Äî that says, fool me once, shame on ‚Äî shame on you. Fool me ‚Äî you can&#39;t get fooled again&quot;.</p>

<p>George W. Bush</p>

<p>You don&#39;t find that laughable?</p>

<p>George Bush Junior is a retard they maneuvered into office so that his entire cabinet could run the country for 8 years while he watched. </p>
