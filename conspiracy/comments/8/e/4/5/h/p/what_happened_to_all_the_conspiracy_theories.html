       During the 90s and early 00s Alex Jones and similar were raving about Global Warming and how it's a total hoax. I don't see this anymore. Did they admit they're wrong or has it just died down due to some other reason?

       I think I can speak for virtually all people who hold beliefs similar to Alex Jones (patriots, conservatives, etc), and emphatically say "No".  We have not changed our position.  We still believe that "global warming" is 100% a hoax/fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are talking about it less of late because there has not been as much "news" lately by the Left/Establishment promoting the agenda.  Of course, they are still trying to push to have the United States join the Paris accord and whatnot.  But talk of that has died down after Trump rejected it.

       "What if we switch to renewables and make the world a better place for nothing?! It's all a big hoax, may as well keep buying oil!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You're so convinced that the conspiracy is "Solar/renewable energy  investors want money and will lie to get it!" when I think it' just as likely (more likely, in my opinion) to be "Oil investors have money and will lie to keep it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I only replied because you take your own judgement of climate change to be universal fact, which is laughable. I think it's real, but even if it's not I believe renewable energy is best. So even if I'm wrong, I still hold my main belief. What if you're wrong?

       Trouble is it's not actually about the climate and mankind's alleged effect on it. Things like the Paris Accord do jack squat to help the climate. It's all a cover for a massive  Marxist wealth redistribution scheme on a global scale, and an effort to make the average Joes in Western countries feel "ok" with the fact that they will likely have a lower standard of living than their parents.

       Now the strategy is to deny any link between industry and global warming, question the cost of solutions and state that we need to focus on more immediate threats. I saw a PragerU or whatever the group is called make one saying if the solutions are expensive stick to dirty energy. I'll try to find it in a minute

        Karl Popper famously said, “A theory that explains everything explains nothing.” So what do you make of the theory that catastrophic manmade CO2-driven “climate change” can account for harsher winters and lighter winters, more snow and less snow, droughts and floods, more hurricanes and less hurricanes, more rain and less rain, more malaria and less malaria, saltier seas and less salty seas, Antarctica ice melting and Antarctic ice gaining and dozens of other contradictions? Popper gave a name to “theories” like this: pseudoscience.

       Utter bullshit.

       Climate is a chaotic system. In chaotic systems there are islands of stability in which finely balanced variables result in relatively stable and predictable outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of those variables change, however, the system goes out of equilibrium and descends back into chaos, with the effects becoming much more random and unstable.

       That's what is happening with climate - a relatively stable system is becoming more and more chaotic because we are changing one of the variables.

       So you’re going to ignore all 27 links provided, the fact that “global warming” stalled 18 years ago requiring the change to the more ambiguous term “climate change”, the climate predictions have been wrong over and over, often by a large degree, climategate where their own e-mails were leaked showing that they were hiding data, tampering with the climate models, attacking critics, accepting money from fossil fuel and big oil, and more and more scientists are calling fraud on the IPCC....

       getting warmer, and "climate change" is not a new name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global Warming is the cause, Climate Change is the effect, and that is exactly what scientists have been saying from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       What changed is initially the deniers focused on "global warming" because they denied it was happening. When the proof that it was happening became incontrovertible, they switched from denying the cause to denying the effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they admit global warming is happening, but deny climate change as a result of it.

       I love this bit of nonsense that global warming believers spout. With the recent bitterly cold spring we had this year we hear from them "Just because it's cold here blah blah blah".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then in another sentence they are explaining that science has determined the Earth's past global temperature from taking ice samples in the Arctic. Just because you can read the temperatures in one area doesn't mean it's the same everywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want their science to have it's cake and eat it too. Cold weather in one area doesn't disprove their theory, temperature readings from the Arctic proves their theory.

       Tree rings eh. There are millions of years of tree rings? Last I heard, trees fall down and rot away. Some become fossilized but you can't pinpoint when the tree was alive.

      <p>
       Corals, same thing. Localized information.

       Lake sediment, kind of vague. May only apply to that area.

       So you are proving my point. Several data points can't determine the Earth's past temperature to within one degree Celsius as they claim.

       When you say they "can't", is that your professional opinion as someone who studies the climate? Meaning you understand the methods used in the attempt, and can explain why they are lacking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you just saying it "can't" because it doesn't make sense to you? Because if so that would be the more honest way to say it, rather than pass your thoughts off as carrying any weight.

       I would like to chime in here. I think the OP is saying that just because they record a warm temperature in one place doesn't mean they can extrapolate the whole temperature of the Earth.

       But then the argument is that we can never have enough samples to approximate the average, which is just wrong. There is an (unknown, perhaps impossibly large) amount of data that could allow us to reliably extrapolate an average global temperature. Whether or not we have collected that amount of data, that is up for debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about whether or not we can collect data that supports / refutes climate change. It's about how much data we have collected that supports or refutes it, and the relative amount of each. We can always find data to support whatever we want, what is important is collect as much as you can for your idea and compare it to the evidence against your idea. OP dismisses each piece of evidence individually without acknowledging: A) the number of observations in each data source and B) the agreement between data sources. If someone has millions of observations across multiple different sources, that's a good basis to approximate/ predict.  ("Millions of observations..." is purely hypothetical and not supposed to represent the amount of evidence for or against climate change)
