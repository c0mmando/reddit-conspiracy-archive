    <div class="md"><p>This is why I don&#39;t use the Manhattan project to prove the point. There is a much better argument to be made. </p>

<p>When people say &quot;the conspiracy is too large...surely someone would speak up by now,&quot; they are forgetting about compartmentalization and attempting to discredit everyone who speaks up. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a study that looked at how many years a conspiracy can be kept secret, depending on the number of people involved. He used real conspiracies that have been exposed and used that to create a formula to determine the lifetime of conspiracies before they are exposed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grimes then looked at the maximum number of people needed to keep a secret for a actual conspiracy. According to Grimes’ calculations, the number of conspirators reduces the longer a conspiracy survives. For a hoax to persist five years, no more than 2,521 people can be active participants: that is, be aware that the conspiracy exists. To last 25 years, that number drops to 502. And to last a century: 125 people tops. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that, due to compartmentalization, almost everyone involved in a conspiracy is not allowed to know the full scope of that conspiracy, so the actual number of people who <em>could</em> leak damning information is quite low in many cases. This is why it took decades before <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6z4ewn/conspiracy_facts_a_brief_history_of_human/">MKULTRA and similar human experiments in the United States were exposed.</a></p>

<p><strong>There are a lot of people who speak out about large conspiracies today</strong>, so they do &quot;leak.&quot; However, those witnesses are either ignored or put through the media gauntlet and an attempt is made to reduce their credibility. For all intents and purposes, the conspiracy is still &quot;secret&quot; for the majority of the public unless the conspirators directly admit to it or somebody proves the conspiracy with documents. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LUHa_-OlA">Susan Lindauer, 9/11 whistleblower, already spoke out about the government knowing about 9/11 before it happened.</a> Also see the documentary <em>A Good American,</em> which features William Binney, the NSA analyst who created Thinthread, who talks a lot about 9/11 and how the government covered up gross negligence. </p>

<p>Former CIA whistleblower Kevin Shipp exposes the shadow government: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbrOg092GA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbrOg092GA</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control">William Binney&#39;s testimony about the NSA.</a> </p>

<p>Former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/04/telephone-calls-recorded-fbi-boston">FBI agent&#39;s claims about all phone calls in the US being recorded.</a></p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kewhJ_ORZos">Chip Tatum, former CIA operative, who exposes CIA cocaine trafficking and assassinations.</a></p>

<p>There are also Big Pharma whistleblowers, etc. The list goes on and on. </p>

<p>So when people say &quot;the conspiracy is too large, surely someone would leak,&quot; people are leaking and speaking out about a lot of conspiracies, so the argument doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<p>Finally, here is a huge list of proven conspiracies, all with different amounts of participants and different lengths of time before they were exposed. This is not the entire list as that would be way too long, but it contains a lot of the more interesting ones that I have gathered from many users on this sub and others: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/69sjlr/mrw_i_go_into_the_comments_of_a_cat_gif_and_they/dh9j9mi/">https://np.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/69sjlr/mrw_i_go_into_the_comments_of_a_cat_gif_and_they/dh9j9mi/</a></p>

The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 39 dead, but the American Red Cross estimated 300, a number supported by historians since then.</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Experiments_involving_other_radioactive_materials">Immediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were &quot;vitamin drinks&quot; that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments, from cancers and leukemia</a></p></li>

Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers.</a></p></li>

<li>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated [0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.](<a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-b">http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-b</a></li>

<p>What allows conspiracies to exist on a massive scale is not the possibility of them occurring without leaks. That is practically impossible once more than a handful of people are in the loop on something.  They can exist on such a scale really only through Compartmentalization and Misinformation, which mitigate the risk leaks pose to a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I agree with you that there is really no need to be calling people names or insulting anyone. No one is going to be able to sensor everything we say. Slang changes as time passes, and language is funny because words that are innocent to us today can be turned in to slang insults in the future, and vise versa.</p>

<p>Take police for example, I believe at one point they were called &quot;coppers&quot; as an insult, and if I Remeber correctly people went to lengths to have copper on their person so they could deny they were referring to police. Then people started calling them cops because they were being punished for calling them Coppers</p>

<p>So when you think hard about it anything can be insulting especially when people are looking to be insulted. Calling someone a bundle of sticks is something I probably would Have called my friends in highschool because honestly it&#39;s not related to being gay or homophobic the joke is in being sly and using English language to say something without saying anything . </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not saying your wrong and I Understand your point of view but everyone should try and remember they are just words and they only hurt if you let them</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m a little fired up so I&#39;m going to puff on a menthol fag:) </p>

<p>so much information was leaked that it gave away the technology to opposing factions during wartime! (who, by the way, have much more to gain and much more to offer than joe schmo conpiracy theorist).</p>

<p>oh wait, i was wrong.  The Japanese were completely blindsided by the atomic bomb.  And top axis physicists were completely unaware (and incredibly surprised) the U.S. had developed this technology.  my bad making silly clueless statements</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The better example for me about how it is possible to keep something as &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; even though many people would know about it: in Spain thousands of babies were taken from their mother and it was told to mother that the baby had died. Yet it took decades before this was admitted. Think about it: many of those mothers would have done anything to get their babies back and still it was possible to keep them away from finding the truth / exposing it to the public in large.</p>

Thus even thought specific claim about &#39;no leaks&#39; is strictly speaking not true, it is still a useful example of how large-scale conspiracies can be kept as an &quot;open secret&quot; even in the face of leaks. In that sense, the Manhattan project is a lot like 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes you can find multiple whistleblowers on a topic as well. Just google the conspiracy + whistleblower. There are many Big Pharma whistleblowers and many others. There at least 4 that I&#39;m aware of on the NSA outside of Snowden. Most of them came out before Snowden did his thing, yet everything being monitored was a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; back then. There are Deep State whistleblowers, etc, etc. </p>

<p>Then you go on Reddit and someone mentions the conspiracy theory, then another user says &quot;but it can&#39;t be true because nobody leaked it yet.&quot; No, you just didn&#39;t google it yet to find out if any whistleblowers exist for that topic :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I don&#39;t use the Manhattan project to prove the point. There is a much better argument to be made. </p>

<p>When people say &quot;the conspiracy is too large...surely someone would speak up by now,&quot; they are forgetting about compartmentalization and attempting to discredit everyone who speaks up. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a study that looked at how many years a conspiracy can be kept secret, depending on the number of people involved. He used real conspiracies that have been exposed and used that to create a formula to determine the lifetime of conspiracies before they are exposed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grimes then looked at the maximum number of people needed to keep a secret for a actual conspiracy. According to Grimes’ calculations, the number of conspirators reduces the longer a conspiracy survives. For a hoax to persist five years, no more than 2,521 people can be active participants: that is, be aware that the conspiracy exists. To last 25 years, that number drops to 502. And to last a century: 125 people tops. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that, due to compartmentalization, almost everyone involved in a conspiracy is not allowed to know the full scope of that conspiracy, so the actual number of people who <em>could</em> leak damning information is quite low in many cases. This is why it took decades before <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6z4ewn/conspiracy_facts_a_brief_history_of_human/">MKULTRA and similar human experiments in the United States were exposed.</a></p>

<p>There are a lot of people who speak out about large conspiracies, so they do &quot;leak.&quot; However, those witnesses are either ignored or put through the media gauntlet and an attempt is made to reduce their credibility. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LUHa_-OlA">Susan Lindauer, 9/11 whistleblower, already spoke out about the government knowing about 9/11 before it happened.</a> Also see the documentary <em>A Good American,</em> which features William Binney, the NSA analyst who created Thinthread, who talks a lot about 9/11 and how the government covered up gross negligence. </p>

<p>Former CIA whistleblower Kevin Shipp exposes the shadow government: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbrOg092GA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbrOg092GA</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/11/the-ultimate-goal-of-the-nsa-is-total-population-control">William Binney&#39;s testimony about the NSA.</a> </p>

<p>Former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/04/telephone-calls-recorded-fbi-boston">FBI agent&#39;s claims about all phone calls in the US being recorded.</a></p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kewhJ_ORZos">Chip Tatum, former CIA operative, who exposes CIA cocaine trafficking and assassinations.</a></p>

<p>There are also Big Pharma whistleblowers, etc. The list goes on and on. </p>

<p>So when people say &quot;the conspiracy is too large, surely someone would leak,&quot; people are leaking and speaking out about a lot of conspiracies, so the argument doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<p>Finally, here is a huge list of proven conspiracies, all with different amounts of participants and different lengths of time before they were exposed. This is not the entire list as that would be way too long, but it contains a lot of the more interesting ones that I have gathered from many users on this sub and others: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/69sjlr/mrw_i_go_into_the_comments_of_a_cat_gif_and_they/dh9j9mi/">https://np.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/69sjlr/mrw_i_go_into_the_comments_of_a_cat_gif_and_they/dh9j9mi/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point. There are plenty of leaks and whistleblowers present in today&#39;s society regarding all sorts of conspiracies, but because the well has been polluted by a sea of misinformation and disinformation (on purpose very likely), the leaks are far less valuable than they were in ages past, as their credibility is very difficult to determine. </p>

<p>That is the thing nowadays. Pretty much all conspiracies we can say have been leaked in some way and whistleblowers exist everywhere. But due to the mass amount of misinformation mixes with good information, it&#39;s harder than ever to determine what&#39;s genuinely true and what isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if everyone that worked on MP knew what they were working on . </p>

<p>I would imagine not everyone knew exactly what was being worked on , maybe had a vague idea but didn’t know all the details , 130,000   active employees at its peak , is an insane amount of people to work on a single project , many sectors would be required to manage a project involving so many people , some jobs  would probably not be required to know what was being worked on . </p>

<p>I would also be inclined to think the people that would be possible leakers would be high rank military type people that knew the ins and outs of the operation , not some blue collar shlub running a dozer. </p>

<p>Side fact: the MP cost 2 billion , over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. </p>

<p>Logic and 10% tells me that not all 130,000 people did work on the actual production of the weapons </p>

<p>130k employees is everything from carpenters to scientist, that really minimizes the amount of people you would have to actually silence for a grand conspiracy. 
Wouldn’t you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, we can’t possibly know the fail rates of hiding a large conspiracy. If they are successful at keeping quite then it stays a secret.</p>

<p>Personally, I do believe people are pretty damn good at keeping quite about things deemed important to national security or general safety. Also, compartmentalization is often used to keep everyone involved at least somewhat in the dark. People could be fearful of their lives and the lives of their families as well. In addition to this, if a person was to come out and say something on a small scale (to friends or a stranger in a private setting) there would be no easy way for a person to fact check what they are told and what is told could end up dismissed, or at best, be considered a rumor. </p>

<p>Even social media platforms are now cracking down on everything. The only way to speak uncensored would be for everyone to send out leaflets to everyone&#39;s postboxes, but how inconvenient that can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another take, is that you don’t have to inform everyone involved in a conspiracy of said conspiracy, in order for it to work successfully. For instance, if company A (50000 workers) was working on a product idea that another company was working on simultaneously and company B produces the result first, it is very possible for company A to send a handful of skilled team members that are willing to work for money, unethically, to steal the results from company B, tie those results to the scratch work from their 50000 workers and tell their own company that they successfully created that product. They would tell their own workers that a handful of people were able to do it with the work of many. </p>

<p>It’s a misconception that in order for a conspiracy of mass proportion to happen it takes thousands of people to be in the know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another reason why people think conspiracies would leak is because they are not aware of techniques of keeping things secret, such as &quot;compartmentalization&quot; and only giving out information on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis.</p>

<p>Another technique is to individually taint then information you giving to an individual. If that information leaks out then you can identify the source because the leaked information will have a specific taint.</p>

<p>The CIA certainly knows a ton of Putin&#39;s dirty secrets.</p>

<p>But Putin controls his media and the CIA controls ours, and its the voting rube that needs to be kept in the dark. No matter how many times Binney tells America what the NSA really does, the mockingbird media repeats the &#39;only metadata&#39; line and the public buys it.</p>

<p>Sure Manhattan was leaked. But the government controlled the media then as it controls the mainstream media now. Stalin knew, but the voting public didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Take Putin for example. Do you really think he gives a damn about America? His goals have been consistent for his entire rulership. He wants to own the black sea and suck the middle east dry to ship to Europe. And if he can, take Istanbul and make it Constantinople again to please the conservatives. That&#39;s all there is to the man. Oil and trophies. He doesn&#39;t care about America or what America is doing. He just wants his black sea oil empire.</p>

<p>You said Stalin knew about Manhattan to refute the OP. I pointed out this doesn&#39;t refute the OP, because the average voting boob didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Just like the average voting boob thinks the Russians used novochok on an ex spy in the UK, that James Earl Ray shot MLK, or that Pearl Harbor was a surprise attack.</p>

<p>The average voting person did know, because atom bombs were in the contemporary sci fi of the time. HG wells invented the term &quot;atom bomb&quot; in WW1 with his &quot;The World Set Free&quot;. They were not aware the US was actively pursuing the line of research.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of any of these except Pearl Harbor, which is rather grey area. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8932197/Pearl-Harbour-memo-shows-US-warned-of-Japanese-attack.html">Japan gave a warning</a>.

Facebook doesn&#39;t even tell you anything, it just matches your views to articles you want to see from other people. NPR is hardly sectarian, and Fox and CNN are the same thing on opposite spectrums. If you get a universal consensus of all these, there&#39;s a high chance that&#39;s true, as they are not the same factions.</p>

<p>You have this problem of wanting to be the out group. Doesn&#39;t matter what it is. If it&#39;s popular, you&#39;ll do the opposite. That&#39;s not going to get you closer to truth.

<p>People will much more likely keep a secret if they think it is for a noble cause, for the greater good.</p>

<p>This is exactly how they kept JFK&#39;s murder a secret, they told people who knew, but didn&#39;t know the real reason, that it was the <em>Kremlin</em>, and if it leaked there would be nuclear war and the world would end.</p>

<p>People didn&#39;t keep that secret because they thought they were protecting an evil deep stats cabal. They did it because they thought they were protecting humanity.</p>

<p>The leakers we know about were the ones who actually knew the real reason (one of many was that JFK opposed war in to Viet Nam) and didn&#39;t feel good about it.</p>

How would we know something is going on without a few leaks here and there. Ex: Edward Snowden. NSA still spys because they labeled him as a traitor and pretty much exiled him. Before Snowden nobody really knew what was going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how I think of conspiracies? Do we have evil pieces of shit in this world? We do. What are the chances they&#39;re really smart and can get into high positions? Does anybody really believe an evil piece of shit will turn decent by chance? No. Evil pieces of shit do evil things, sometimes in your face and sometimes behind closed doors.</p>

<p>No need in calling me cynical. It&#39;s called being realistic. I lost a lot of stars in my eyes when it concerned former beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s not forget FDR did a fantastic job hiding his crippling illness to most people. He took great care in doing so too. It was known by a percentage of people, sure, but they didn&#39;t speak of it and the vast majority weren&#39;t aware. 
99% of the people aren&#39;t aware of what people in power do. We just don&#39;t. We see the consequences, we see parts of the greater picture, but we don&#39;t know and won&#39;t know when something those people scheme takes place. Only afterwards, after seeing the evidence and after whatever was planned has run its course. To trust power is foolish. Just as foolish is to jump to conclusions without enough evidence. And to complete this triad; equal to the aforementioned foolishness would be to ignore when the official story makes no sense in any part and in any way. 
Only fear of change stops people from questioning authority. Only fear of truth would scourn at those who would try to bring the first glimpses of that truth into the light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said Putin cares about America? Did I miss something?</p>

<p>You said Stalin knew about Manhattan to refute the OP. I pointed out this doesn&#39;t refute the OP, because the average voting boob didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Just like the average voting boob thinks the Russians used novochok on an ex spy in the UK, that James Earl Ray shot MLK, or that Pearl Harbor was a surprise attack.</p>

<p>They just call anyone who questions the government narrative a conspiracy theorist, which term was itself, as you must know, invented by the CIA after the JFK murder to ostracize anyone who was thinking for themselves.</p>

<p>I never put any words in your mouth. At all, but you&#39;re pretending to be a telepath, in addition to architect and psychiatrist.</p>

<p>You know you&#39;re wrong because you&#39;re conflating points (Manhattan project &lt;&gt; awareness that A bombs were possible) and you&#39;re being insulting. If you don&#39;t know you&#39;re wrong then you&#39;re just dumb.</p>

How exactly was it designed poorly.?</p>
