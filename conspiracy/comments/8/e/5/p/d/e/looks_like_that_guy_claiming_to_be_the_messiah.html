    <div class="md"><p>yep, suddenly Time Warners name change to Spectrum is making a lot more sense. Also maybe about a year ago, Time warner required all their broadband customers to give back their old modems in exchange for new ones. Ever since I got the new one I swear I hear that weird hum sound <a href="/u/willgofurther">/u/willgofurther</a> mentioned in his post. Sounds like when they try to show someone coming out of a coma on TV shows or movies, its like a quiet scream. Hard to describe.  Also the sudden and obvious monopolization of teleco/broadband companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in Dallas and same exact thing happened to our area. Out of the blue, modem flashing like crazy, no internet. Call charter communications, they tell me I have to return my old modem and install the new one. Went to their local office, there was about a hundred other people standing in a long line with their modems in their hands. Got the new one, installed it, and exactly like you said, a loud hum. I notice it when I sleep. Called tech support, turns out its being emitted from the WIFI portion of the modem. Me and tech support guy try every possible solution to turn off the WIFI part. Cannot be done. I&#39;m also starting to think its something nefarious. Ties in with all this news coming out about people complaining about being targeted with energy weapons and these are not crazy people. Google directed energy weapons, go to any of the blogs and read the 100s of comments of people complaining about being targeted. Almost all complain about the same types of symptoms. Then targeted individuals hold their first nationwide meeting in Boston. Over 1000 people showed up, talking about the same things happening to them. Wired (establishment rag) sent an undercover journalist to observe and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mind-games-the-tortured-lives-of-targeted-individuals/">write an article fully dismissing these people and basically labeling them crazy.</a> Something is happening and people are beginning to realize that their government has gone full rogue mode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frequency warfare. One way the ‘NWO’ plans to start depopulation. The main difference between 5g and 4g is 5g will be running on the new IoT which will make bandwidth around 1000x faster or 100 gigabytes a second. So if your by one of these new telecom towers I’d be like living in a microwave. Also on this forum there’s been a lot of post about the military messing with us through magnetic waves and what not so it relates to that in a way. </p>

<p>What separates 5g from 4g and how can it be “dangerous”? That’s the vibe I was getting reading about it but then again, that’s why I’m asking the experts!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you are right. But i have often wondered...why the TORTURE? Oh yeah, loosh. And why dont they just sterilize us all? I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve thought of that too.

If you are pregnant/expecting it&#39;s a wonderful experience and everything always works out if you have love and patience. We only had one. But werent gonna have any!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Satanist do not use Black Magick. They do as they see fit in their power to do it. If they do not have the power, then so be it. If they do, then they decide. No different than looking at eating animals. You want them at their best until you are ready to eat. You do not seek their liberation, only their progress within a sphere of containment so that when you choose based on your selfish cravings, you can kill and eat. Most of us let others do our dirty work, but we still eat. In this case, we are the cattle to their farm. This is big business.</p>
