       Perhaps. But there are are too many unanswered questions. Take the buildings themselves. The two tallest towers (buildings 1 and 2) were hit by jet planes. The government fairy tale is that these planes caused the towers to fall in a "pancake style" after the internal steel beams melted. Problem: Jet fuel doesn't burn hot enough to do this, not even close. The planes messed up three or four floors but did not weaken the building structure at all. Building 7, which fell at about 5:30 pm later that day, wasn't hit at all. It too, fell at free fall speed just like building 1 and 2. Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane. All three buildings fell via "Controlled Demolition". That is, they were pulled down intentionally. The planes were just for public spectacle. The source of this information is many professional architects who have studied this. So, who should we believe: bullshit politicians or professional architects? That is merely one of several points of contention is the "Official Story". So, can such a big secret be contained by so many and still be a lie? Yes...especially
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it is so big of a lie.

       isn't that the "jet fuel can't melt steel beams" meme?
      </p>
      <p>
       wasn't it simply because one floor was weakened, and the shock of the collapsing head caused everything to crumble?
      </p>
      <p>
       you take the mass of the head, consisting of about 15 floors or so, multiply it by the gravitational field strength, then by the height the head fell, maybe about 10-20 meters.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's enough energy to collapse the lower floors, and cause a chain reaction. like those karate chops of multiple boards.

       You clearly do not understand building design, and more exactly, The World Trade Center building design. In order for your theory to happen the internal steel structure must be compromised, weakened. Second, you are presuming that the weight of each flood directly bears down on the floor below. If this were true then the building wouldn't have stood up at all in the first place. Go and study advance building design before you call me a "doofus". Oh, and by the way, learn how to spell. It is spelled "dufus".

       And is that so hard to believe? Heat makes steel weak. Weight of the building above the crash added pressure. Case closed.

       Look in the mirror. The steel from the twin towers wasn't weakened by the planes jet fuel. Not hot enough - not even close to hot enough. And what of building 7? No plane. It dell in the same way as the other two towers did. Explain that. No building - before or since - has
       <em>
        ever

       fell by fire. Just the two World Trade Center towers. Curious, eh? Explain that.

      <p>
       And no. Jet fuel doesnt burn at a high enough temperature to effect steel. I make jewelry as a side business and gold and silver doesnt weaken until its almost at melting temperature. No matter how long you keep flame on it it wont lose its integrity until just before its melting point. Thats how all metal works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furniture and other stuff burns at an even lower temperature.

       Steel beams lose large part of their structural strength before melting point. They didn't melt, and didn't have to in order to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jet fuel isn't enough to melt, but is enough to weaken them for collapse. The bulging caused by the weakened and bending beams is seen in the photos and videos.

       That kind of half and half answer cannot be true.  It cannot be a conspiracy with the house of Saud included but not the US Gov't.

       Just because there are many people involved, does not mean they all know its  a conspiracy..
      </p>
      <p>
       Realistically, there are only a handful of elites that orchestrate and fund the whole operation. The rest of the people involved have no idea they're a part of something way bigger than them. The terrorists hijacking the plane don't know what they're actually doing, they just know their boss told them to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there have been firsthand accounts of people that heard explosions in the basements of the towers.

       How did we find out about "Operation Northwoods"? How long did it take us to find out about it? How many people knew about the proposed operation and said nothing?

       There's a common denominator here if you pay attention...military personnel...under threat of god knows what,  if they divulge what they know. Or they go along with the plan because they know they have a piece in the game and they know how to use that piece to get where they want to go.

       And political figures that may know secrets they didn't divulge?

       Look at President Ford...his part in the Kennedy assassination...Reagan too was involved a bit in events concerning the assassination. He didn't allow a key witness to testify in that.

       Army veteran here.   I enlisted in November of 2001.   Lemme answer your questions for you based on personal experience.

       Quite a few, actually.   The more complex the op, the more people necessary to be involved.

      <p>
       It's drilled into every member of the armed forces the difference between a lawful and unlawful order.   Despite what you may be led to believe, the military isn't just a bunch of mindless drones with no sense of right and wrong and without the ability to judge a situation for what it is.
      </p>

       Do me a favor.   Look up United Flight 585 that crashed in 1991.   That happened about 10 miles from my house, and my dad and I went to the scene.   The pilot nosed into a park to avoid crashing into a neighborhood, and aside from a crater and small bits of debris, there was very little left of the aircraft.   There were certainly no large pieces left.  Turns out when you nose a large piece of aluminum into the ground at high speeds, shit breaks up quite nicely.

       I guarantee the sailors on board knew very little about what was going on.

      <p>
       You greatly underestimate the hard-headedness of military personnel.   It wouldn't matter if the president himself ordered them in person, all but a tiny few would willingly do something that would harm civilians, especially if there were no enemy combatants involved.   And those tiny few are the ones who dont follow orders and get chaptered out of the military very early on in their careers.

      <p>
       What does that even mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, the military isnt part of some deep rooted secret group that performs clandestine attacks.   It's safe to say the average servicemember's moral compass is more calibrated than the typical civilian's.

       Complex operation..what was so complex about it? They already had a huge military drill going on that day. That made everything complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mindless drones: no where do I insinuate that. Once the buildings were hit...everyone was doing exactly what they fully believed was their duty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reacting in a predictable manner: Total fucking panic and outrage. First responders doing their jobs. The chaos and confusion. The media coverage..Everything that typically happens in events like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Debris: worked in the aerospace industry (machining, R&amp;D, Lockheed stress tests, high reuse tests) I'm not an expert on plane crashes or debris fields...but where's the luggage and the bodies and the plane seats? Forget about the aluminum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gulf of Tonkin: why would the sailors on board a vessel being used as a false flag "target" have any knowledge whatsoever about what's going to happen?
      </p>

       USS Liberty:

       Sorry you're sick. Don't watch this right now if you don't want to feel sicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as military personnel and what you said. I totally disagree. My father watched firsthand as military personnel in Thailand locked villagers in a wooden barn and set it on fire. My father said there were at least 80 people in that barn. He was scared to death that the guy who ordered it was going to kill him for the rest of his life. He didn't tell me about it until he knew he was dying. (weeks left) Even then he was afraid the guy was going to show up somehow. It finally explained alot about my father that I could never understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...while your personal experience in the military may not give any evidence to what "some" are capable of...it in no way  proves that there are not people in the military capable of psychopathic behavior.

       Just like the military guy who kept interrupting Cheney with the "they're twenty miles out", does the order still stand?" He knew they should have shot the Pentagon plane out of the air but his orders were to allow it to keep flying (into the Pentagon)  Where was his sense of right and wrong?

       I gave it an up vote because even though the point could've been stated better, you reasoned that the US military personnel by and large wouldn't take a knowing role in a conspiracy which harms America or its civilians.  That's pretty relevant to the whistle blower discussion.

       First of all, nothing is impossible. Improbable would be the correct term. That said, all you have to say is: "What about the Manhattan Project?". If they say, well: "We know about that now". Then say, how many years ago was that, in comparison to 9/11? Truth (even if half truth(s)), always come out in time, for many differing reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...or, you could bring up compartmentalization and the tract record of people speaking out, being offed (one example would be JFK - a US president).

       Just my two cents.

       True, even when the Manhattan Project was forced to go public, there was a full-press push with the narrative and angles the officials wanted emphasized. It took decades for investigative journalists to piece together some of the details surrounding that project.

       Imo that’s just like the “magic bullet” in the JFK assassination. So many people that are interested in the technicalities of the physics of what occurred that they forget about the bigger picture - why did it occur? Not that the former isn’t important, but it’s actually the secondary component of the conspiracy.

       I think there were a few people who planned it, gave orders and then there was a trusted private (maybe govt) demo team that placed explosives needed to bring them down.

       I think that if the only people that knew were a handful of elites, some alphabet agents, and the hijackers themselves, it's totally doable. There were a number of whistleblowers; which ones were true info and which ones were disinfo can be hard to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The motive is clearly established, and historical precedent shows that very similar things have been done in the past. It's not is far a stretch as denounces make it out to be. Personally, I don't know 100% which one(s) of the many conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 are the most accurate, but at the very least it was known about and
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       to happen. Entirely plausible.

       It's been exposed.  Everything you need is out there to draw a reasoned conclusion, one contrary to the Federal commission reports.  It's stunning to the extent that ridicule and repetition can drag men around by the nose, despite the evidence of mathematics,  physics, and their own eyes.

       9/11 was exposed. They couldn't hide the evidence. You want a leaker to come forward to tell you it was an inside Job? All the evidence is in the open. You have to take a look for yourself. No one can convince you. You gotta decide for yourself. No one can decide your mind for you whether you can believe it or not.

       Anyone on the inside won't say anything ,they support the agenda. A lot of people on the outside ,for example the pilot who was writing the book (his name escapes me) and the guy at the Pentagon who photographed the lamp columns, end up dead. Leaving a lot of others who might know something terrified of speaking out for fear of being ridiculed or killed

        A big lie (German: große Lüge) is a propaganda technique. The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, about the use of a lie so "colossal" that no one would believe that someone "could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously."

       The state's moronic conspiracy theory has completely collapsed, exactly or almost every single bit of it has been exposed, and only a moron or desperate propaganda worshipper would - or could - claim otherwise.

       I kept hearing this excuse time and time again. At one point it became really annoying to me. In my opinion, thats such a huge cop out. It dismisses ALL evidence without a thought. Mouthpieces abusing this tactic, actually made me doubt them instead, because it felt like steering the narative. It's really troubling to me, that so many people actually believe thats a valid argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       ON another note ;
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like this is the exact same thing when people say about conspiracy theorists, they like to gravitate towards conspiracy theory because that makes them more comfortable knowing a select few elite are in charge of running the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i mean is, by saying it wouldn't be possible to keep such a conspiracy hidden, is them saying it because that makes them feel more comfortable living in this world.

       That's my point! When someone does speak up, their credibility is questioned.  April Gallop was in the building and walked out of the hole the "plane" made. She claims there was no evidence of a plane and that she smelled cordite, used in explosives (former soldier). Susan Laundeur, first person arrested under the Patriot Act was t in a mental hospital for claiming her warned the WH of impending attacks. She wrote a book, Extreme Prejudice. Barry Jennings was in 7 and was videoed coming out saying, bombs going off all over. There were dozens more, all as credible as the official story.

       Of course, they're all lying fame whores. Not one could possibly be trying to tell us what they know. Susan Laudeur was arrested under the Patriot Act, institutionalized in a mental home and was about to be drugged into oblivion until a lawyer she didn't know sued the government to get her released.  Her book was about that experience.     Are you saying she did all that for fame?  Sibel Edmonds was ostracized. She overheard congressmen telling Paki intel which front companies operating in Pakistan were CIA fronts.... but she also heard 9-11 comments AFTER 9-11. Think she only wanted fame?  But you proved my point... anyone speaking out is flamed.

       I remember reading about these several “falling dominoes” where, on the morning of 9/11 a number of military and government officials failed to perform the duties that were REQUIRED of them during an event such as 9/11. Rumsfeld helping to clean up debris, ignoring his ACTUAL responsibilities, for example. Also, the guy who was in charge of deciding to scramble fighter jets decided to randomly drive somewhere and was out of cell signal range at exactly the wrong time. etc... I forget what it was, but something like: the chances of all of these people simultaneously failing to do their job properly was small, but then combine that with how the majority of these people had not been fired or demoted, but instead had been given promotions...you can almost start to see
