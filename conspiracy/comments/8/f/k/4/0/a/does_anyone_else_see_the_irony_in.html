       Moving the goal post like changing the OP from irony to “double standard and hypocrisy?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you are confused thinking irony means double standards or hypocrisy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Irony would be BBC calling RT a private company because no one would expect that because it’s not true.

       Sorry you resort to name calling because you feel attacked from your own failures in logic.

      <p>
       You replied to a comment about irony saying it was actually double standard (which it’s not), thus moving the goal post (irony) away from the comment you were replying to, to your own incorrect goalpost (double standards).

       Hypocrisy isn’t the same word as irony. BBC doesn’t deny being funded by UK taxpayers, thus it’s not hypocrisy. It’s not hypocrisy for Pig A to call Pig B a pig. Pig A never denied being a pig in the first place

       I am asking whether the BBC calls itself a "state owned news service"?  If you cant see the obvious hypocrisy in calling out RT for being "state owned" while ignoring their own state ownership, then I suppose theres no point in bothering with this conversation any longer.

       Does the BBC call itself a "state owned news service"?  Yes or no?

       Its hypocritical for a pig to chastise a second pig without acknowledging that its just as much of a pig as pig #2.

       It is ironic,  because the BBC calling RT "state funded" is like me calling amy schumer "fat". We are both fat,  I am in no position to judge her on her fatness,  and it is deliberately contrary to what one might expect when one fat person calls out another fat person for being fat.

       So I answered the other part below. As for streaming services. Right now only if your streaming a live broadcast. Back in the early 1990s the law was different. Satellite TV just came out back then &amp; everybody dumped their terrestrial tv areal &amp; in doing so didn’t have to pay a TV License. They changed the law very quickly to make you pay even if you didn’t have the equipment to watch BBC. The same will happen with streaming services like Netflix etc. Very soon.

       It appears to work on postal (license) address rather than email. From their website:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A valid TV Licence is required to watch or download any BBC programmes on BBC iPlayer - as well as watching or recording live TV on any channel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Doing so without a TV Licence is a criminal offence and you could be prosecuted and fined up to £1000 (or £2000 in Guernsey).

       Yes, legally you need a licence to watch iplayer. It's their content, not supported by adverts. If you like it maybe pay for it!

       It doesn't matter that you don't even own a TV or a PC - every household has to pay the fee (which is really a tax - they just don't want to call it that). If you don't pay - they drag you to court and you end up in jail or end up having to pay the GEZ fee + a fine from the court.

       It's not a private company. The "ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice" (formerly known as the Gebühreneinzugszentrale or GEZ) is basically the German version of the BBC.

       Yes because nowadays you could stream even on your smart phone. It's the same in Germany, everyone has to pay the GEZ fee that finances the ARD and ZDF (Basically the German version of the BBC)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a joke about the GEZ fee in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       A man walks into the GEZ office and asks why he has to pay the GEZ fee - even tough he doesn't even own a TV and he doesn't use his PC for streaming because he has no internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GEZ employee tells the man that even though he doesn't have a TV he could still use the PC to stream ARD or ZDF on his PC. So you have the equipment to use our service and that means you have to pay us.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well I'll be damned" replies the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm going to apply for child support then." (In Germany the government pays you child support)

       Child benefit is paid by the bundes government. You get about 200€ per child every month plus tax benefits. It's part of the welfare package in Germany. Germany uses 30% of its GdP for welfare benefits.

       Interesting. I like that a lot better than our system in America where I have to pay 22% of my income to my cheating while I'm deployed whore ex wife. Everything ive done to better myself since my divorce she gets to benefit off of. If she spent it all on my son I wouldnt really care but everytime she hears I get a raise she goes to court to get more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way germany does it seems better then id be able to donthings like just buy clothes pay for sports and stuff and spoil him from afar and she wouldnt be able to game the system.

       Oh no, don't get me wrong. We have that in Germany too. We have Kindergeld (child benefit = 200€ per month per child. And it doesn't matter if you are single or not) and we have Unterhalt (Alimony. A certain percentage of your income) which you get on top of the Kindergeld if you have a child but are divorced for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that its not as crazy as in the US where your wife can basically take away everything you own. It depends on what your child needs (For example if it has a medical condition that needs extra care) and how much you earn. If you are a factory worker who works minimum wage you cannot be expected to pay any alimony - but your wife still gets the Kindergeld from the government.

       So its more fair overall then. Its neat. I wish we would look at other coubtries and see what works and try to apply it to our country.

       For instamce I have a friend that made $9 an hour. His girlfriend he knocked up is unemplyed and receives housing assistance. The state garnishes his wages for 75% of that. Then he has to pay child support. All in all she gets more of his tiny barely above minimum wage pay than he does and he cant even afford anything more than rent and a cheap phone. Literally nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our system is just unfair really in a lot of cases. I'm not saying everyone gets child support from the government but we could at least use it when both the man and woman are low income

       I don't know if child support is the right translation. Maybe child benefits? The government gives you about 200€ per month per child. And that's just money that everyone gets regardless of how much money you have. And then there are certain things you can get if you don't earn enough yourself - like furniture for your child, clothes etc.

       Similar in New Zealand. 'working for families' is the initiative and basically there's tax incentives to have babies and if you are unemployed you get more for every baby you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can imagine, this has led to a class of people in poverty that just have shit loads of kids and so do their kids. It's quite a bit too if you don't wanna give your kids anything particularly nice. More than minimum wage if you have 2+ kids.

       Same here in Germany. Since they pay you more the more children you have (Up to 225€ per child if you have 3 or more children) - some people basically live a good life by just having many children and collecting welfare checks. It's the same in Norway and Denmark too (And the UK?). That's why those countries are preferred by a certain kind of refugees. (Economic refugees)

       In reality it is a monthly supplemental cheque to help cover the extra baby expenses, a program which many developped countries offer.

       Ok so in the case of buying a new TV they don’t need to get in. They know you bought a new TV because by law the company that sold you one has to notify the licensing authority. Also you have to fill out a form too when buying a TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes I get that if you have an old 2nd hand TV you can try &amp; not pay it. But eventually you will have too.

       No, you buy a new TV, and if they ask, you give them a different address.  If they ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you give them the right address, all that will happen is you get a letter asking if you're watching live TV. You might not be, so won't need a license. They cannot 'convict' you for buying a TV.  Only
       <em>
        watching
       </em>
       live TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ignore the letter, they will send another one, and another one, and it'll get quite boring, and eventually you'll realise you don't have to have a licence if you're not watching live TV
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing will happen. If they do, by some infinitely small chance ever happen to knock on your door,  you tell them you don't watch TV and they go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine having the technology to watch a subscription only TV channel, without paying the subscription. You'd only get them on your case if you were actually watching it. Having a torrent client on your PC is not the same as torrenting the latest movies.  20th century fox only come after you when you download and watch the film. This is no different, it's just a silly meme that Americans like to jump on when they hear the word license.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically pay TV,  invented before the days of encryption and cable channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never had a licence.  I don't watch TV nor stream live TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       I torrent everything.

       Years ago they ran adverts on TV to scare ppl into paying, showing how they  park vans outside in the street with TV licence enforcers inside scanning houses and checking if you're watching TV.

       I did. I cannot find anything to suggest you need to fill out a form when buying a TV in the UK. Can you link me because my tele is on the way out and I need a new one. Thank you very often.

       Come back once you've bought one and confirm if it still happens.

      <p>
       I googled and found this post saying they changed it a few years ago and don't require it, but the commenters say they're still being asked to fill out their details when buying, so I'm interested to find out.

       That is literally some bullshit. If you don’t have a TV you don’t have to pay for it. I’ve lived in 3 different houses in the UK, each time they sent letters telling us to pay for a license or we could get in trouble UNLESS we watch actual TV shows made by the BBC. So it’s not a forced thing because each time we just went online and ticked ‘this address doesn’t need a license’ and that was the last we ever heard of it.

       That’s a nice euphemism for saying “they threaten you with physical violence”.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you think about it, you realize that when the thugs hired to actually molest you (thugs dressed-up in costumes like it’s fucking Halloween are the worst) knock at your door - if you take out your own gun to exercise your natural right of self-defense against the unprovoked initiation of violence - then someone dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, not paying your “TV license” in the UK carries the death penalty de facto.

       That can not be the difference. That can be attributed to bias. During 8 years of Obama's regime cnn,nbc,msnbc,abc,npr almost never ever criticized any of his policies or him. Would that mean they were state mouthpieces.

       Bbc has a long history of ignoring britains social dilemma and challenges it faces as a society and not forget its various corruption and sexist attitude. Bbc

       LOL,  surely you can do better than a 2016 article that is citing the views of one UK politican who thinks the war was unjustified 13 years after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway,  next time you link an article you should spend 5 minutes reading or at least browsing.  This particular article actually contains no original BBC opinions,  and aside from quoting this Chilcot fellow there is barely anything that could be deemed remotely critical of the UK government contained within this article,  so try again (and maybe read the article before you link it next time).

       I will find your article after you find an example of the BBC criticizing the UK govt.  Like I said before, the article you linked is not critical and is not original to the BBC (maybe try reading before you post next time).  The article you linked is an overview of a report authored by an anti-war MP, a report that was 13 years after the war had taken place.

       No. Your talking to a UK Subject here. The Queen is head of State. The PM goes to her every week to report. To go to war or sign treaties for example but there are many more. The Government need the Royal Prerogative to do so. That’s permission. Also the Queen can fire the Government at any time &amp; call fresh elections.
      </p>

       Hell she fire the Australian Government in the late 70s or early 80s. That’s not a figure head.

       Her executive orders are limited by conditional rules, and everything else is rubber-stamping, which exactly fits someone who is "more of a figurehead than Putin". Which is exactly what RallytoRestorSanity said.

      <p>
       The Gov General is the Queen’s Representative in Canada, Australia&amp; NZ
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution describes the parliament of the commonwealth as consisting of the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Section 5 states that "the Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of the Parliament ... prorogue the Parliament [and] dissolve the House of Representatives." These provisions make it clear that the Queen's role in the parliament is in name only and the actual responsibility belongs to the Governor-General. Such decisions are usually taken on the advice of the prime minister, although that is not stated in the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governor-General has a ceremonial role in swearing in and accepting the resignations of Members of Parliament. They appoint a deputy, to whom members make an oath of allegiance before they take their seats. On the day parliament opens, the Governor-General makes a speech, entirely written by the government, explaining the government's proposed legislative program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important power is found in section 58: "When a proposed law passed by both Houses of Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare ... that he assents in the Queen's name." The Royal Assent brings such laws into effect, as legislation, from the date of signing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 58 to 60 allow the Governor-General to withhold assent, suggest changes, refer to the Queen or proclaim that the Queen has annulled the legislation. A number of Governors-General have reserved Royal Assent for particular legislation for the Queen. Such assent has usually been given during a scheduled visit to Australia by the Queen. On other occasions Royal Assent has been given elsewhere. Examples of this have been the Flags Act (1953), the Royal Styles and Titles Acts (1953 and 1973), and the Australia Act (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Role in executive government    Edit
At the start of Chapter 2 on executive government, the constitution says "The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative". The Governor-General presides over a Federal Executive Council. By convention, the prime minister is appointed to this council and advises as to which parliamentarians shall become ministers and parliamentary secretaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the constitution, the words "Governor-General-in-council" mean the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Council. Powers exercised in council, which are not reserve powers, include:
      </p>
      <p>
       establishing government departments
appointing federal judges, and
appointing ambassadors and high commissioners.
All such actions are taken on the advice of ministers.
      </p>
      <p>
       32]
      </p>
      <p>
       Reserve powers  Edit
In the United Kingdom, the reserve powers of the monarch (which are typically referred to as the "royal prerogative")[33] are not explicitly stated in constitutional enactments, and are the province of convention and common law.[34] In Australia, however, the powers are explicitly given to the Governor-General in the constitution; it is their use that is the subject of convention.[35]
      </p>
      <p>
       The reserve powers are:
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to dissolve (or refuse to dissolve) the House of Representatives. (Section 5 of the constitution)

       What’s the irony? Is it irony if, for example, a private space company like SpaceX calls Blue Origins a private space company?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it irony when RT calls BBC a state owned news service or when an CPB program states BBC is funded by UK taxpayers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it irony when Putin adds the state owned media (RT) on the list of core organizations of strategic importance of Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or when Putin states “We wanted to bring an absolutely independent news channel to the news arena. Certainly the channel is funded by the government, so
       <strong>
        it cannot help but reflect the Russian government's official position on the events in our country and in the rest of the world
       </strong>
       one way or another” (emphasis mine).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what you are deliberately glossing over is the control the Kremlin exerts over RT with no public oversight vs the control Buckingham Palace has on BBC and the public’s oversight of that organization.

       You want irony. In the UK, this bastion of freedom, 30-40 people a year are given prison sentences because they don't have a tv licence (and have refused to pay the fines for not having one). Nobody in Russia is in jail because they haven't subscribed to RT.

       I'd like a source on that, but even so, what happens in the US if you don't pay fines a court gave you? In the UK, you don't want to watch TV, you dont have to pay. If you want to, then you pay.  Simples.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens in the USA if you watch content illegally, like downloading movies? Millions of dollars in fines or damages to the companies making the stuff. Nice.
      </p>

       Also, as RT is state funded,  what happens if you don't pay tax in Russia?

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but watching public broadcasts on television in the US is not going to land you in court. Just the UK.

       Your point about "not paying taxes" is ridiculous, because no other country forces you to pay a television tax, and that's the point.

       have laws to back up its claims to your money though, just like copyright law. Which if broken in the US will get a court to fine you millions of $$

       Any state funded media, like RT, mentioned in the post you were replying to, is funded by tax money. If you don't pay tax, you're in trouble.

       Which should, in theory, give them more independence than RT. RT which is presumably still funded by the Russian tax payers...

       Look, I'm no fan of the BBC as it happens. They are far 
too close to the government. But all this 'get yer loicence m80' is basically spreading FUD. you don't need a licence to have a TV in the UK, only watch live TV. Spreading this meme is only doing the BBC a favour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't watch live TV. I don't.  It's shit. I also don't have and have never had a licence.

       Its a two way street. Its rather obvious that Russian state have Russian interests first. Western MSM tells that they deeply care about unbiased journalism and then posts 3rd grade clickbait sensationalized articles about every single political topic.

       Ah.  The Jimmy Savile thing.  Build a trojan horse!  Lump all the worst forms of depravity onto the shoulders of a dead man, accuse him of everything from fucking babies to raping corpses.  Everyone else who gets fingered will never be as bad as the monster, Jimmy Savile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch the documemtary!  There were two women who said they began relatiinships with him when they were in their teens (14 to 15) and were blown off by him when they were in their mid 20s.  So, we are talking about relatiinships that lasted at least 10 years each.  Then the girl in the care home, who was around 13 or 14.  Savile asked if she would like a ride in his Rolls Royce.  Once in there he started to make sexual suggestions, she told the driver to stop the car, which he did, she got out (Savile didnt try to stop her) and walked back home.  Savile just drove off.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the real, evidenced cases.  Whilst what he did was immoral, the girls were not 7, they had all reached puberty.  It was also shown that rape wasnt really his gig, he wanted the girls to want sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then after this, to really light a fire under the Savile case, the BBC reported that his estate will be held whilst claims are made against it, by his victims.  Im sorry, but when free money, guaranteed anonymity and a promise to believe any and all claims as truthful are on offer, you will get liars coming forward.  It was all to take the light away from the real filth that was taking place in westminster.  Oh and the ruse was an overwhelming success!

       Don't trust GodlikeProductions. It's run by Russian trolls. Also, BBC and RT are both state owned news services. Don't be a fool by running from one bad source to another. That's like being caught between a hammer and an anvil. Abandon Trump and Hillary. Then you'll be free.

      <p>
       There are a couple of key points that need to be highlighted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, RT and BBC are not the same to the extent that the BBC has greater public oversight and greater leeway in being critical of government policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the more important point is that even if you believe that RT is a tool of the Russian state and that everything it says serves Russian interests, that
       <strong>
        does not mean it is untrue
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       To suggest otherwise is an informal fallacy known as
       <em>
        Poisoning the Well
       </em>
       . Information can be propaganda and still be true, if that truth is in the sources interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stories from RT need to be considered purely on the truth or reliability of the individual story, not the inherent bias of the source. Such bias should be a factor of consideration in determining reliability but it
       <strong>
        cannot
       </strong>
       be the only factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, my criteria for evaluating Rt as a source is whether it contains viewpoints or verifiable factual information that other, perhaps more superficially reliable, sources do not. The answer is very clearly that it often airs voices and opinions that Western sources (such as the BBC and CNN) do not and very frequently these provide reliable insight on issues of major international importance (and, of course, many that are far less reliable).  However, the very fact that we are forced to rely upon RT to deliver these alternate perspectives calls into question the journalistic neutrality of many Western media outlets. For anyone with a  basic understanding of journalistic principles or critical analysis the above points should not be in any way contentious.

       The BBC actually has years of actual journalism behind it. Yes it is Ironic, but the UK does not KILL journalist that oppose it's current leadership.

       Massive difference, RT is state media, the state governs what is said. BBC (Like npr or PBS) is government funded but are free to do what they want within limit. They can shit talk the government or crown, RT cannot

       No. Your talking to a UK Subject here. The Queen is head of State. The PM goes to her every week to report. To go to war or sign treaties for example but there are many more. The Government need the Royal Prerogative to do so. That’s permission. Also the Queen can fire the Government at any time &amp; call fresh elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell she fire the Australian Government in the late 70s or early 80s. That’s not a figure head.
