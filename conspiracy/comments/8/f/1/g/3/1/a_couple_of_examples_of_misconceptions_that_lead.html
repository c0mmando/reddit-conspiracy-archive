        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the spirit of intellectual honesty, i am going to make my own Moon thread. I honestly welcome any actual evidence that proves that the Moon landings were a hoax. I am also going to debunk something that i find very irritating, which is this that &quot;rockets dont work in a vacuum&quot;.</p>

<p>If you look on YT there is an alarming number of people making the demonstrably false claim. This seems like its either a psyop in itself, trying to make legit space conspiracies(like weapons on space, X37B style stuff) seem far fetched. It also seems to come from the same sorts of channels that spew flat Earth BS. </p>

<p>Knowing what i do about fluid mechanics, specifically as it relates to turbomachinery and rockets, i find the idea that rockets dont work in vacuum laughable because to actually believe it, it requires a profound misunderstanding of how rockets, fluids and vacuum works.</p>

<p>The other thing i kept hearing is that &quot;the rockets go horizontal, and over the horizon, somehow indicating that they are landing.</p>

<p>Hello people who say that. Do you know what orbiting something means? It means going around it, not straight up from it. Of course its going to go horizontal for orbital insertion!</p>

<p>Its these kind of basic misunderstandings that lead to profoundly incorrect conclusions. </p>

<p>These two videos show things behaving in ways you cant fake on Earth, leading me to the conclusion that the Moon landings were likely very real. Anyone who can offer reasonable explanations as to why debris or dust behaving the way it does in these videos, id love to hear them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok i figured out how i can explain it so its totally impossible to misunderstand. A shit and shower is great for thinking. Anyway.</p>

<p>First, you have to understand the difference between <em>mass</em> and <em>weight</em>. </p>

<p>Mass is how much matter there is in an object. It doesnt change depending on gravity. A person or vehicle in space, in zero g has the same mass as they do on Earth or the Moon or Jupiter or floating in deep space. </p>

<p>Ok for now just think of weight as the effect of gravity pulling an object to whatever is producing the gravity. Say the Earth for this example.</p>

<p>Ok on Earth, you are standing next to an elephant. I tell you to push him as hard as you can. What happens? The elephant barely budges. Now i tell the elephant to push you. You go flying right? Why? The elephant has more <em>mass</em>. On Earth the elephant also weighs a lot more <em>because he has more mass</em> being acted on by gravity.</p>

<p>Ok now you and the elephant are in space(hes got a suit too) and since theres no gravity you both <em>weigh</em> nothing. </p>

<p>I tell you to push the elephant. What happens? You go flying in one direction pretty quick, but the elephant also goes slowly floating <em>in the opposite direction</em> to you.</p>

<p>Why didnt he fly off at the same velocity? Because he still has more mass, but since theres no gravity or friction holding him to the ground, like there was on Earth, you <em>both</em> go flying off, but at different velocities.</p>

<p>Ok reset the experiment. I tell the elephant to push you. What happens? The <em>exact same thing as when you pushed him</em>. You go flying off fast, and he goes slowly floating the opposite way. </p>

<p>In space, it doesnt matter who pushes who. The more massive one moves less because hes more massive. Right?</p>

<p>If you agree with that thought experiment&#39;s result, lets move onto rockets.</p>

<p>As i explained before, a liquid rocket engine basically takes dense liquid fuel and oxidizer, pumps them from sealed tanks into a combustion chamber, where they are burned. This heats the gas to thousands of degrees and pressurizes the gas many times higher pressure than it was in the tanks.</p>

<p>This gas goes from the combustion chamber where it is contained and is allowed to expand, which it wants to do very much since its basically a continuous controlled explosion.</p>

<p>As it expands inside the nozzle &quot;bell&quot;, it pushes outward in <em>all directions</em>. It cant escape from the bell, but like you pushing on the elephant, the high pressure gas(which has mass remember!) imparts a force on the nozzle. </p>

<p>Instead of expanding gas, imagine a person inside the nozzle bell pushing on its inner surface and flying away into space, but the rocket barely moves in the opposite direction. Now imagine thousands of times that force on the inside of the bell, constantly. Instead of the person flying off into space, the expanding gas does.</p>

<p>Because the nozzle is being pushed on by this matter with mass(the expanding gas within it) it is <em>moved in the opposite direction</em>. Since the expanding gas pushes incredibly hard, and since there is a massive continuous flow, the rocket doesnt just barely move. It moves extremely fast.</p>

<p>The elephant is the rocket, and you are the expanding gas. Only, unlike in the thought experiment where you pushed the elephant once, the gas is doing it for as long as the engine is turned on. </p>

<p>Constant pushes from all that gas expanding, pushing against the nozzle wall. Because remember, the nozzle is <em>constantly being filled with a supply of high pressure gas</em>, which then expands even more behind the rocket. </p>

<p>Thats why the flame plume is narrow on the ground at liftoff, but baloons out once it gets higher up and the air is thinner.</p>

<p>Heres where we can actually address backpressure from the atmosphere. As the expanding gas leaves the containment of the bell, it will keep expanding until it reaches equilibrium. Thats 14.7 PSI at sea level or 0 PSI in space. </p>

<p>The thing is, the force of the expanding gas <em>in the nozzle bell</em> already pushed the rocket away, so it doesnt matter if there is backpressure in terms of a reaction. The action and reaction happened in the <em>gas filled</em> nozzle bell.</p>

<p>The nozzle is <em>constantly</em> full of gas, as is the space behind it, which does expand into the vacuum of space, but only after it has pushed the bell of the nozzle away from it. </p>

<p>The reason backpressure is relevant is actually this: the mass flow rate(amount of hot gas) from the combustion chamber has to be high enough to go sonic and choke <em>before</em> entering the nozzle bell, otherwise it wont expand properly in the bell and go supersonic, and therefore it wont push the nozzle bell enough. Too much fuel and oxidizer and your engine goes boom. Its gotta be precise.</p>

<p>Thats why backpressure <em>actually</em> has to be taken into account, so you can put precisely the right amount of fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber to get choked flow and proper expansion, and therefore proper thrust(pushing) against the nozzle attached to your spacecraft.</p>

<p>To further elaborate on the nozzle question: yes and no. No, not all rockets have a conventionally bell shaped de Laval nozzle, but this is getting into esoteric tech way out in the weeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just disproved your theory. The person moved because they had something to push against, the Elephant. </p>

<p>If you are in space and have a bowling ball that you throw away from yourself, you are pushing away from it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you cant see why that test should be dismissed then you <em>still</em> dont understand how rockets actually work or what youre even looking at in the video!</p>

<p>You understand that, first off a straw is not a CD nozzle right? There is no expansion section. There is no choked flow subsonic to supersonic expansion like there is in a real rocket. So its not moving itself in the same way really.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you took the <em>mass flow</em> of the air &quot;rocket&quot; there and compared it to what is being sucked in, youll see that the vacuum has much more mass flow than the baloon(obviously).</p>

<p>He also literally puts a vacuum cleaner intake <em>only by the fucking straw</em>...</p>

<p>See the flaw in that idiot&#39;s so called experiment yet??? The vacuum of space is <em>all around the rocket</em>. It is not a literal point source of suction like a vacuum cleaner positioned by the rocket exhaust and nowhere else 😂😂😂. He invalidated his own test by using a horribly flawed procedure.</p>

<p>Anyway, expansion ratio actually does come into play with rockets. Less backpressure requires a larger expansion section(bell) on the nozzle. You may notice the different geometries of engines for sea level to space use when compared to engines that always operate in vacuum like upper stages.</p>

<p>And really, that video conclusively proves that whoever made it doesnt understand how vacuum works, how rockets <em>actually</em> generate thrust, or probably his ass from a hole in the ground😂</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The expanding gas in the nozzle pushes on the nozzle. That is what generates thrust.</p>

<p>Do you understand that <em>the atmosphere cant touch the rocket to make it move in any way?</em> The rocket engine nozzle is <em>completely filled with fluid at all times when its on</em>. That expanding gas pushes <em>the nozzle in the opposite direction</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre fuckin with me right? The high pressure gas <em>in the nozzle bell is what the rocket always, let me say that again ALWAYS</em> &quot;pushes against&quot;.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter if the rocket is at sea level or in hard vacuum... </p>

<p>If youre not trolling to be cute, the idea that the rocket is pushing against the ground or atmosphere is literally the misconception i tried to correct.</p>

<p>The gas the rocket expells into the nkzzle is basically a controlled explosion that <em>pushes on the inner surface of the nozzle, which is how a nozzle works</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really appreciate what you are trying to do here. We do have groups that take advantage of people&#39;s lack of knowledge, and general (valid) suspicion that things are not what they appear to create these massive red herrings to divide our attention from more critical pursuits. The idea of the Shining as an explanation of Kubrick&#39;s involvement in faking the moon landings was a masterstroke. We know Kubrick put all kinds of real messages in his films. But this one has had m as ny of us chasing our tail for years. I have a counter theory that Kubrick was really working for the CIA as disinfo and propaganda...but that is a story for another day.</p>

<p>Moon landing hoax theory, and flat earth (oh gawd) really poisoned our communities, and take advantage of our friends that lack any real rigorous education. It divides our communities, and distracts us from any real work that might do us some good. </p>

<p>It makes me sick. And these red herrings have metastasized, there is no getting rid of them now, and there are more and more posts about them all the time. People spend hours analyzing this garbage. And the absurdity is obvious to you and me. When these kinds of theories started it was just hilarious to people like us, that a couple people believed it made it even funnier.</p>

<p>But i&#39;m not laughing now. I have no idea how to undo the damage, but I really appreciate your effort here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, but I can and will. The moon landing hoax theory was an experiment in disinfo, which eventually led these evil people to try flat earth on us.

<p>You have been had. The volume of material talking about the moon hoax doesn&#39;t make it more valid. It is just depressing. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always said that I&#39;m about 50/50 between we&#39;ve never been there, or we&#39;ve never stopped going back (just not publicly). So it wouldn&#39;t surprise me either way, I&#39;m just curious as to where your convictions come from on this one.</p>

I have my own deep background in the sciences. I saw the moon hoax take off in the early 90s, just like flst earth has been for the last couple years. All I have is observation and supposition.

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to be the new go to argument for why space is fake or something around here. Yt has plenty of silly &quot;rockets dont work in vacuum&quot; and &quot;spacecraft dont go to space, they land&quot; type videos. I hadnt heard of flat Earth until like 2012 or something, but now that shit is all over.</p>

<p>I view the official Moon story with skepticism, but mostly because of the weird behavior of the astronauts, conflicting shit they said, etc. Doesnt lead me to the conclusion that we didnt go, but more likely that we have more advanced shit up there than most people are aware of.</p>

<p>Exactly this. That&#39;s about where I&#39;m at. Though have you ever tried to look up satilite images of all the landing moduales and buggies we left there? They are the most shitty quality laughable blurry dots that make you go &quot;hmmmmmmmmmmmmm&quot;. You&#39;re telling me we STILL can&#39;t get even a low-res image of them? Come on now. Didn&#39;t China say they didn&#39;t find any with their rover?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, i wont put &quot;maybe the Moon landings are faked&quot; in the category as flat Earth.</p>

<p>But i will put &quot;rockets dont work in vacuum&quot; in the same category. Its based on a fundamental misunderstang of what one is looking at.</p>
