        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The most ancient of all the Greek city-states that we have any history from is that of the city of Argos and it’s surrounding state called Argolis. The founder and first king of Argos was called Inachus and the first narrative myth involved his daughter Io. This myth was often referred to as the story of Hermes “Argiophontes”. Now, Io was identified with Isis among the Egyptians and the Syrian city of Antioch, formerly called Iopolis, had claimed to be her burial place. Hermes was identified with the Egyptian Thoth and the Babylonian Nebo.</p>

<p>Therefore you must realize that this earliest of civilizations known to the ancient Greeks did not originate in Greece itself, but obviously came as a colony from elsewhere, settling in Argolis with a developed mythology. The Argolian royal family had come up out of the land of Egypt.The Argolian colonists from Egypt.</p>

<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>

<p>God bestowed upon Moses a copper serpent that was to be attached to a stick and used for curative purposes. The mythical Greek character Hermes also carried a serpent stick called the “Caduceus” that was divinely bestowed upon him, and which became the worldwide symbol of the medical profession. . But, of course, it is also true that Moses had another “serpent stick” that he carried on his missions to bring God’s messages to the Pharaoh.</p>

<p>We are told by Jewish sources such as the writer Eupolemus, who wrote about 150 BC, that the alphabet was invented by Moses while, according to Greek sources, the same alphabet was invented by Hermes. The Egyptian Hermes -- whom they called “Thoth” -- is credited with inventing hieroglyphic writing while the Babylonian Hermes, whom they called “Nebo,” is credited with inventing cuneiform writing. Nebo, a word that means the “Prophet,” was a common nickname for Moses, and when Moses died he was buried upon Mount Pisgah which is also called, no doubt in memory of Moses, Mount Nebo.</p>

<p>Needless to say Moses was a prolific writer of sacred texts. In this regard Hermes was apparently no slouch either. So-called Hermetic books dealing with the religion of Egypt were mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Porphyry, and Jamblichus. Since Clement even says that the books of Hermes were carried by the Egyptians in religious processions, one surely wonders if they were kept in an ark like the law of Moses during the religious processions of the Israelites. However well known these Hermetic writings were in ancient times, it wasn’t until the middle of the 15th century that some of these previously lost Hermetic texts had supposedly been found in the libraries of the Byzantine Empire. Suspect though they are, these books are accredited to the semi-mythical figure named Hermes Trismegistus (thrice greatest) whom the Gnostics insist, while not being Moses himself, was a contemporary of his. an ever present characteristic of any image of Hermes is his petasos, a cap which featured a wide circular brim. The fact that this petasos looks, even to the casual observer, remarkably like the halo of a Christian saint may be a clue to it‘s origin. For the corona of Moses, which is Scripturally attested to at Exodus 34:30 (&quot;and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him&quot;), probably was represented pictorially as a circle around his head and, therefore, more than likely served as the origin of the petasos of Hermes.</p>

<p>Hermes also had another form of headgear that was intended to hide him, known as the cap of darkness or the helmet of invisibility. We know this because, according to Hyginus from his Astronomica (2.12), he once loaned it to Perseus: “Perseus ... received from Hermes, ... petasos, and, in addition, a helmet which kept its wearer from being seen ... the helmet of Hades (the Unseen One)...” Moses also had a headdress that he wore for the purpose of hiding his face. His corona was frightening to people so he used a veil to conceal it, as explained in the book of Exodus at 34:33: &quot;And until Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermes is often depicted as wearing winged sandals, but the Greeks would certainly know enough not to take this literally. The Greeks would understand that traveling upon wings was merely symbolic and meant nothing more than going swiftly. Moses was sent to deliver the Israelites upon eagles wings as at Exodus 19:4: &quot;You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&#39; wings, and brought you unto myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Casting of Lots Among the Greeks Hermes was considered to be the inventor of casting lots as a method of divination, but Moses also instructed the Hebrews, at a very early date, in the use of lots to divine the will of God. The iconoclastic Moses taught that no images should be made and, accordingly, there is some evidence that Hermes too was at first an iconoclast.</p>

<p>The name of Hermes originated in the Greek word “herma” meaning a “stone heap” -- probably from the custom of erecting a “herm” consisting of an upright stone surrounded at its base by a heap of smaller stones. These unpretentious monuments were often used as landmarks for travelers or to mark territorial boundaries. A mythical origin for these stone heaps may also be understood for, to quote from the Etymologicum Magnum, “when Hermes killed Argos, he was brought to trial by the gods. They acquitted him, and in doing so each threw his voting-pebble at his feet. Thus a heap of stones grew up around him.”</p>

<p>The point here being that the more recent images of Hermes result from apostasies of his earliest teachings, and that the original icon of Hermes, namely, the modest stone heap, was indeed one that would have been acceptable to even Israel himself. Notice Genesis 31:45-46: &quot;And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap.&quot;</p>

<p>Moses taught that one out of every seven days was to be revered as holy and called the Sabbath, while Hermes also took one day out of the seven, calling it Wednesday after his name.</p>

<p>In fact, this was noticed thousands of years ago -- at least as early as the second (some think that he could possibly have lived in the third) century BC -- by the Egyptian priest Artapanus who some think may have been Jewish. Eusebius (ix. 27) quoted from a lost book that was written by Artapanus and called Concerning the Jews that said of Moses “he was beloved by the Egyptians, who called him Hermes, (dia tên tôn‘ierôn gramattôn‘ermêneian).” The Greeks themselves seem to corroborate Artapanus by admitting that the Ibis headed Egyptian god Thoth was just another version of their god Hermes. The Greeks even tell a story of how Hermes had come up out of the land of Egypt where he once had lived disguised as an Ibis. Similar to the Hebrew Scriptures the followers of Moses, in the story told by Artapanus, were plagued by poisonous serpents.</p>

<p>However, the Moses of Artapanus (instead of the copper serpent) employed the Ibis to attack the snakes. This was the reason, Artapanus says, for which Moses/Hermes revered the Ibis so. If Hermes was Moses, as Artapanus states, and Moses was a younger contemporary of Inachus the father of Io, as cited by the ancient chronologists, then it is very conceivable that the Hermes in the story of Io’s wanderings is a mythic Greek version of Moses in the Hebrew story about the wandering Jews.</p>

<p>The earthly wife of god was in bondage, so god sent his serpent stick carrying messenger -- on eagle’s wings -- to lead her out of her captivity. The messenger of god smote the head of her captor and delivered the Earthly wife of god. Did he lead her directly home? No, this is when she went on her famous wanderings, known to the Greeks as the wanderings of Io. There was a mystifying cloud cover, a gadfly plague, and a miraculous water crossing. She gave birth to the &quot;Egyptian&quot; calf god, &quot;Epaphus&quot; (Apis). But, most telling of all, she approached the special mountain where the creator of mankind was bound, and talked to him. Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence. After all this she finally returned to her homeland, Phoronea.</p>

<p>“Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence.” This point, overlooked by many, is exceptionally strong evidence for equating the Greek and Hebrew traditions. A quote from Prometheus Bound (a play by Aeschylus, who wrote as early as 500 BC) runs thus: “PROMETHEUS: She (a future wife of Zeus) will bear to him a child, And he shall be in might more excellent Than his progenitor. IO: And he will find No way to fend off this strong stroke of fate? PROMETHEUS: None save my own self when these bonds are loosed. IO: And who shall loose them if Zeus wills not? PROMETHEUS: Of your own seed. IO: How says you? Shall a child of mine release thee? PROMETHEUS: Son of yours, but son the thirteenth generation shall beget. IO: A prophecy oracularly dark.” Is it not amazing how exactly -- down to the smallest details of theology -- that the Greek and Hebrew traditions match on this point? With the advent of this “savior” Prometheus would no longer be “bound” to the mountain.</p>

<p>How many stories do you know of where the creator of mankind will be released from his binding contract through the fulfillment of a prophecy predicting the future arrival of the son of god and the seed of a woman? (The story of Atlas is also remarkably similar but, as I hope the reader will come to realize, the two stories were intricately related.) The entire genealogy of the Greek savior -- all thirteen generations -- are known to this day as if it were the thirteen generations from Abraham to David! Can any other &quot;myths&quot; claim to pay such attention to the details of lineage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just trying to attain light/ knowledge from darkness/ignorance. </p>

<p>like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hereticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it ... So Masonry jealously conceals its secrets, and intentionally leads conceited interpreters away.&quot;</p>

<p>This site has a good description of the 5th tablet of the emerald tablets of thot, which you should give a read too along with the apocryphal. They may give you more insight to the light and knowledge you&#39;re looking for. The link I posted to is about the guy in the mountin but in the emerald tablets he&#39;s called dweller of the unal.</p>

<p>The thing is that Satan is not always the same, most of times he is put as the enemy of God, but he also put as working for him, he is put as lord of all evil but also the one who punishes evil, do we have any clue why ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh that the blind can see. I have heard it all before. Do not be deceived by the father of lies. He seeks to devour you and no good can be found in him. I will ask for your eyes and ears to be opened before it’s to late. Seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened for you. Much love </p>

    <div class="md"><p>great post...I would like to add that judeo-christianity has been found to be largely plagiarized from Sumerian, Greek, and Egyptian sources. Almost every single story matches a far older story from other groups. The history of the Jews does not reach back into antiquity as do the others. The older civilizations pre-date judeo-christianity by thousands of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not that Judeo folklore is meaningless to study. It&#39;s a great collection of oral stories that have been preserved where as other civilizations have lost theirs </p>
