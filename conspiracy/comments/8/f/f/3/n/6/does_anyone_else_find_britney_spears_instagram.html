        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don’t really have a specific conspiracy theory about this and it may be unimportant to a lot of you but I can’t find anything on the internet about it or any conspiracies so I thought I’d come here and get an opinion. 
I just get a weird bad feeling looking at her stuff like it seems like she’s being mind controlled or something, her behavior is just really peculiar. Like one video (<a href="https://instagram.com/p/BVq5jboFIAQ/">https://instagram.com/p/BVq5jboFIAQ/</a>)  she addresses everyone by say “hey guy” and ends it by saying “bye guy.” Singular instead of plural and it’s just really strange because like saying hey guys is an extremely casual thing to say, you don’t have to put much thought into it but messing it up twice in one video is almost eerie because saying the singular version of it almost is unnatural. 
Her other videos are of her just walking, trying on outfits, and laughing very forcibly. Everything’s just slightly off her behavior seems like a movie where she’s being controlled or someone’s pretending to be her or it’s someone trying to be human! I love crazy conspiracy theories but I haven’t even read anything about this it’s just this feeling I get. I know there are some theories about young celebrities that are basically controlled by a chip- a thread of it on Twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/givenchyass/status/866761563759419392?s=21">https://twitter.com/givenchyass/status/866761563759419392?s=21</a>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna give you a thumbs up. I think this is her way of &quot;promoting&quot; without really promoting. It&#39;s late and I hope this makes sense. I can see younger Britney going and doing interviews and she&#39;s relaxed. It&#39;s just not that way anymore. If you&#39;re dealing with a younger person that&#39;s not familiar with how Britney used to be before her breakdown and they saw interviews of current Britney, my gut feeling is the majority of people would say she&#39;s awkward, she&#39;s so awkward that she&#39;s making me uncomfortable!, robotney, she&#39;s stupid because she has such a limited vocabulary*, etc. </p>

<p>*I&#39;m not one to make fun of the way somebody talks. I&#39;ve excused the way Britney talks because it&#39;s harmless. You can go to youtube and probably pull up the clip I&#39;m mentioning by typing in &quot;Britney cool&quot;. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with her saying &#39;cool&#39; a lot. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s some uneducated hick or whatever. I just realize if she talked like Einstein that people would ask &quot;What in the hell is she saying? Why are you talking like that?&quot;</p>

<p>A lot of this shit is probably like torture for her to have to do interviews or even take &quot;meet and greet&quot; pictures. And there&#39;s some doozies out there that makes it look like a hostage situation more than anything else. So this is a private way of getting some press/attention by doing her little home fashion shows, showing off her exercise routines, singing snippets of songs, showing off her painting or photography skills, etc. The one shooting this stuff is probably one of her kids and she&#39;s probably the most relaxed around them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Britney has always been awkward and robotic lmao, her videos obviously reflect that. As for that &quot;hey guy&quot; &quot;bye guy&quot; video she is actually talking to a person called Guy who she tagged in the post if you read the description: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/guypines/">https://www.instagram.com/guypines/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree there. She&#39;s changed. I&#39;ve been a fan since the &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; days and she&#39;s changed. And it goes beyond the &quot;Well, she grew up. You don&#39;t see an adult still trying to act like they&#39;re 18, do you?&quot; That&#39;s not what I mean. And nobody think I&#39;m making fun of Britney when I say this next part. With the shit she went through, I can see how she&#39;d majorly change and even be more cautious about what she does and says because she knows she&#39;s being watched*.</p>

<p>*This is a gut feeling I have. I have no source to back it up. Just looking at it from the now perspective compared to the past when it concerned her breakdown and how quickly she was forced back to work. We&#39;re talking about Britney Spears here. We&#39;re not talking about an ordinary Jane that&#39;s gonna have to worry about money if she&#39;s not working. Can you imagine recovering from what she went through while going through the pressures of promoting an album (Circus) and doing a fucking tour? It&#39;s crazy. And it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if her kids were used as a pawn. &quot;You can&#39;t stay in the house 24/7, Britney. You need to do this, you need to do that, you need to go on tour. They&#39;ll take the kids away if you don&#39;t, Britney.&quot; Britney Spears is a cash cow to a lot of people riding on the gravy train. </p>

<p>There&#39;s rumors she was having issues again during the Femme Fatale album era. And tbh that wouldn&#39;t surprise me. Don&#39;t give a person time to heal and recover, what can you expect to happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shes trying to stay relevant man, these days a spunky upbeat girl on Instagram gets some fame, when that girl is Britney Spears shes gotta keep up. Shes hardly the icon she once was and her Instagram is proof shes trying her best to remain a name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be a VERY hot debate if any Britney fans swing by here. I acknowledge your point about she&#39;s hardly the icon she was. That might be a bitter pill for a lot of &#39;stans&#39; to swallow. I&#39;m not a stan and I&#39;ll be the first to say that she&#39;s barely hanging on. Times changes and musical tastes change. I&#39;ll give her props for being as relevant for as long as she was relevant. She could&#39;ve easily been a one hit wonder or faded after the &quot;Oops....I Did it Again&quot; era. So she did hang in there for a long time. And she&#39;s not the only one from that pop bubble that&#39;s faded. Then you have people like Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson that might get laughed at on a Britney forum. I can&#39;t and won&#39;t do that. Both women took their careers into new avenues. Jessica&#39;s probably more known as a designer these days than a singer or actress. Mandy&#39;s better known as an actress than from her past singing career.</p>

<p>A LOT of Britney fans were unhappy with the last two album eras we&#39;ve gotten. A lot of fans feel like the times Britney did do official promo that it was more for her Vegas &quot;Piece of Me&quot; shows than for the actual albums that came out. Album &quot;Britney Jean&quot; has another controversy. A lot of fans are claiming that Britney&#39;s voice is barely on the album and another singer Myah Marie is doing the singing*.</p>

<p>*I have no opinion either way of that controversy. I just don&#39;t see how it could be done without a huge blow up occurring. That would be a bigger fiasco than Milli Vanilli. </p>

<p>Either way, there&#39;s two singles and two videos for the &quot;Britney Jean&quot; era. &quot;Work Bitch&quot; and &quot;Perfume&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Glory&quot; closely follows the path that the &quot;Britney Jean&quot; album went through. You also had another controversy involving the lead single &quot;Make Me&quot;. There was supposed to be another video and it got scrapped. Go to Britney forums and you&#39;ll probably still see people melting down over that scrapped video. I personally don&#39;t care. I thought &quot;Make Me&quot; was a weak single to begin with and it definitely shouldn&#39;t have been the lead single. And the second single was &quot;Slumber Party&quot;. It&#39;s a catchy song, nice video. Just think it was a case of the general population isn&#39;t even aware that it exists. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not upset about the few singles we&#39;ve gotten from both albums. I pretty much figured that the main attention was going to be on the POM shows and these albums were &#39;throw aways&#39; for people that don&#39;t give a shit about the POM shows.</p>

<p>Britney still has her perfume line going and that provides more meltdowns for certain fans. I love her perfume and I&#39;m happy they&#39;re still being released. But other fans practically go rabid with news comes out of another perfume, especially if it&#39;s another perfume for the &quot;Fantasy&quot; line.</p>

<p>The rest of what you&#39;re saying lines up with another post of mine so I&#39;ll leave that alone. Just wanted to post that I agreed with that other part and point out a lot of the missteps that have been happening in terms of her career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to sound nitpicky on that last part. That seems like a logical thing for a lot of people to say if they had troubled childhoods. I&#39;m somebody that NEVER wants kids. I see things that my parents have done throughout the years and they are pretty huge whoppers that I wouldn&#39;t want to repeat IF I had wanted to get married and have kids. And it&#39;s not stupid shit like &quot;I wanted to eat candy bars for breakfast and my parents wouldn&#39;t let me! I&#39;d let my kids eat candy bars if they wanted to!&quot; I&#39;m talking serious shit like arguing and bitching at each other in front of your child, shit talking the other parent TO the child(ren), etc. It&#39;s not a healthy situation to be in. It&#39;s completely dysfunctional. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also somebody that thinks history repeats itself. Not saying somebody that had a healthy background can&#39;t grow up and end up in a dysfunctional mess. Overall I think that IS what happens. Grow up in a dysfunctional situation and you can be fully prepared for your own dysfunctional messes as an adult. </p>

<p>You do know that Britney Spears has been diagnosed as having mental issues, right? They gave power over her money to her father and at least temporarily took custody of her children away from her. She has established issues with mental stability.</p>

<p>The part where they do a part lobotomy on Alex after he has already been mk’d so like a mk’d robot.  That’s what it looks like to me.

    <div class="md"><p>this may or may not be related, and it might just be me as I don&#39;t pay much attention to &quot;celebrities&quot;, but the last photo I saw of Brittney, I was like, &quot;wow, that doesn&#39;t look like her&quot; and I tried to figure out what was different.

    <div class="md"><p>Britney&#39;s changed so much. And again, this isn&#39;t me having the ignorant attitude of expecting somebody in their 30s to still look like she&#39;s a teenager. She looks like a completely different person. You know that shoot she recently did for Kenzo? Yes, they did go completely overboard with photoshop. But I honestly said on a Britney forum that if you had given me these pictures for me to look at, I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you it was Britney. A lot of people were making Jessica Simpson cracks. No, she doesn&#39;t even look like Jessica Simpson to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an ugly person. I&#39;ll say it straight off the bat. I know how important looks are in this world. I can understand how terrifying it must be to be a pretty person in this world and if you have insecurities that magnify themselves. Nobody knows what Britney&#39;s thinking when she looks in the mirror. She might think she&#39;s as butt ass ugly as I am. She might be happy with the way she looks, she just feels she needs a bit of help here and there, etc. </p>

<p>Maybe my fears are exaggerated, I just fear she&#39;s going to go down the Michael Jackson route when it concerns the work she&#39;s doing to her face. One of the worst things in this world is to be ugly, whether your grew up ugly or things went to hell in a handbasket because you had too much work done by the wrong people. It pained me looking at Heather Locklear during her last mug shot. It&#39;s all in perspective. Somebody else said she looked like a &#39;mean drunk&#39; in that mug shot. All I saw was an extremely damaged person. Somebody that was hoping all of this was a nightmare. I&#39;ll wake up and be beautiful, still have a successful career, I won&#39;t be having my mugshot taken, I won&#39;t have addiction problems. The look in her eyes is somebody that realizes painfully that it&#39;s not a nightmare, it&#39;s her real life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think she&#39;s just really anxious. I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s talked about it somewhere. You can see it with how she moves, and talks. She performs very conservatively despite the proactive songs. Her heart &amp; mind are somewhere far away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with the &quot;meltdown&quot; thing either. That event could lead people to believe that there&#39;s a conspiracy but honestly she seems to be the master of it. It&#39;s a well crafted ruse, and she directs, and acts perfectly.</p>
