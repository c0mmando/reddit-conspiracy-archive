       I’ve heard this many times this past year that he was going to purchase NBC and just wanted to get some clarity on the subject. Does anyone have any links or information pertaining to him trying to buy NBC? I can’t seem to find anything anywhere that helps that claim but i feel that it is very true. Seems really fishy that if indeed he was going to purchase NBC, why all the sudden these 50+ allegations come out of nowhere and the man is immediately silenced... one of the most influential black father figures of our time was about to buy one of the most powerful media outlets in the world and white America had to put a stop to it...

       I never denied any of the allegations. I just wanted some more information from my peers on this thread to enlighten me with any links pertaining to him trying to buy NBC in the past... if he was trying to buy it, all I said was the timing seemed somewhat fishy

       Id find the theory plausible if he hadn't admitted to getting the pills to gice to women for sex.That's the reason why he was found guilty on all accounts.

       If you could get some possible links or evidence on disagreements or bad deals between Cosby and some high ranking officials then you'd have a stronger case.  Maybe a bad tv deal, contract dispute, stuff like that. Anything like that would make your stance stronger.

       I recall this rumor making the rounds 25-30 years ago when the Cosby Show was popular.  The show made NBC an incredible amount of money, so I suppose that was where the rumor started.  Apparently Cosby did consider purchasing NBC at some time in 1993.

       might give you context for Cosby trying to buy NBC, back when it was owned by GE.  From the article, he didn't intend to be the only one putting up money for it.

       It's another example of the Man trying to keep another brother down. Look at the paths of Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor, Prince, Marley, King, Malcom, Jimmy, OJ, Tiger, Harvey Weinstein, Ceelo, Tupac, Kanye, Vic, Ali. The list goes on. Well? Are there subversive racists behind the scene? I can only think of Harry Belafonte as being an example of one who escaped these falls from grace.

       "The white man" ?
Did the white man force Bill to RAPE dozens of women over the last 30 years? Apparently you know nothing about the case because he has been accused for years. It didn't happen that one day all these women suddenly accused him. White america didn't force bill to do anything. You sound racist as hell.

       Yeah I’m white so no... you can believe what you want I’m just asking questions for clarification. I never said he wasn’t guilty. But white people have been known to slander black people throughout history... and also tarnish their image while doing so
