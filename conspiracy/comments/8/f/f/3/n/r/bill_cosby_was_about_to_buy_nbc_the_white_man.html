        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve heard this many times this past year that he was going to purchase NBC and just wanted to get some clarity on the subject. Does anyone have any links or information pertaining to him trying to buy NBC? I can’t seem to find anything anywhere that helps that claim but i feel that it is very true. Seems really fishy that if indeed he was going to purchase NBC, why all the sudden these 50+ allegations come out of nowhere and the man is immediately silenced... one of the most influential black father figures of our time was about to buy one of the most powerful media outlets in the world and white America had to put a stop to it... </p>

<p>Id find the theory plausible if he hadn&#39;t admitted to getting the pills to gice to women for sex.That&#39;s the reason why he was found guilty on all accounts.</p>

<p>Your theory though is well thought though. Sorry for the comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recall this rumor making the rounds 25-30 years ago when the Cosby Show was popular.  The show made NBC an incredible amount of money, so I suppose that was where the rumor started.  Apparently Cosby did consider purchasing NBC at some time in 1993.  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/1993/08/bill-cosby-nbc">This Vanity Fair article from 1993 addresses that very subject</a> as does <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/29/business/the-media-business-bill-cosby-trying-to-buy-nbc-from-ge.html">this NYTimes article from 1992</a>.  </p>

Did the white man force Bill to RAPE dozens of women over the last 30 years? Apparently you know nothing about the case because he has been accused for years.
