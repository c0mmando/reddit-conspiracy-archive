       for me alone knowing.. sure needle in a haystack.   if I know 100 people and they each know 100 people the odds reduce exponentially.   If we take that out to 3 or 4 degrees of separation, we have the entire city covered.

       I know what six degrees of separation is. You’re not answering the question. Why do you think the info would just be presented to you unprompted? You could very well be connected to one or more of the victims within six degrees. You just haven’t actively done anything to determine that. It’s not just magic and you instantly know how you’re connected.

       the original claim is that 25 people were victims of an attack.   I am looking for primary evidence to support that original extraordinary claim.  that's the one with onus.

       the assumption is that there would be some communication within a few days of notification of the next of kin.   but nobody can name anyone with even a peripheral connection to ANY of the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       as time goes on, this discrepancy only becomes more stark.  who were these victims?  who was the purported attacker?  where is he from?  how was he supposedly radicalized?

       So because you dont immediately know anyone, your whole premise is that now suddenly nobody does. And because nobody personally told you through word of mouth, that means its all made up. But you can't actually prove that becuase you haven't actually traced every connection you have to the 6 degrees you keep talking about.

       You don't even say anywhere the number or types of people you know. Of course that would also leave the question of you asking every person you know randomly whether they know a victim...  The entire thread breaks down into, I know people who would know people I am certain of it trust me. Therefore it didn't happen...

       your assumption that I'd have to ask somebody for information of the highest significance to reach me is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       such information would reach me as a result of natural interaction.  it wouldn't take more than a couple of days.  you can run models yourself and see it doesn't take many people or degrees of separation.  or maybe not, since evidently you don't math.

       they have been discussing these recent major media events in Canada. The general consensus seems to be that nobody died, nobody goy hurt.

       When I was new to 'conspiracy' theories, this seemed too far out for me to entertain.

       I mean, there is a long history of false flag attacks I have no doubt about if that counts?  Tonkin, perhaps the USS Maine, the USS Liberty and Lavon affair are some that come to mind involving the U.S. And of course while there are many other alleged ones that I don't believe specifically without more evidence, but I have am certain there must be additional ones that have occurred historically and which there just isn't much public evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're talking about modern mass shootings then no, there aren't any I find to have reasonable evidence of being fake at the moment. The general case aside, this OPs reasoning is incredibly weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       An anonymous internet user saying everyone should believe the Canadian Government made a false flag van attack framing an incel because: the person would 100% know about it from his friends? Even though he doesn't even make up a number or location of his friends? And, based on his answer to me, he appears to be conceding he didn't even ask people about it but that it's safe to assume every person he knows would have volunteered the information to him assuming they had any?
      </p>
      <p>
       That reasoning could be applied to almost any story in the world. I might as well claim some random country in Africa doesn't exist because I don't know anyone from it.

       This sub is probably the only place I frequent that has conversation/arguments from people who believe many modern mass shootings (or I guess van attacks) to be false flag attacks. I've also seen a segment or two of Alex Jones though I mostly watch him as a joke occasionally as he seems pretty clearly to me to be someone just trying to make money saying anything at any time while shilling his own products regardless of the topic.
