       All I know is the Twin Towers came down in what looks like a controlled demolition. There is no way they would have come down like that from just the planes hitting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't forget about WTC 7 (Building 7) came down hours later in a controlled demolition too. It wasn't hit by a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is behind all this and orchestrated it? I don't know.

       I brought up WTC 7 to my dad and he had no clue what it was. He was so adamant that only the twin towers fell down that day. So many ppl don’t know the true details it’s crazy.

       How old is your Dad? Is he American? Just asking because I'm 49 and American. I remember WTC 7 coming down later in the day. Although I will admit that I was so distraught over the Twin Towers coming down earlier that I didn't give it much thought. But I remember it happening.

       Okay. Maybe he was so distraught that day (we all were) that he doesn't remember it coming down. They really didn't focus much on WTC 7, to be honest.
      </p>

       Did you pull up any coverage and show him? What did he say? Has it opened his eyes any?

       I should show him next time we have a conversation about it. I remember bringing it up to him about how i didn’t believe the official story when i was younger and he was like “don’t ever say stuff like that in my house again” he’s lightened up over the years and it’s way easier to talk to him about different subjects, so i should show him!

       Yes, show him WTC 7 and coverage for it.

       And don't be too hard on him. I was like him too. I believed the official story for a long time too. But once I looked up videos of controlled demolitions, I changed my mind.

       I am 39 and I remember building 7 falling. Everyone was so shocked all day that one more thing barely registered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only did the WTC fall that day, we had 4 planes supposedly hijacked, the Pentagon was hit by supposed plane, then a plane evaporites in a field in PA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was one disaster after another, what was another building after all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing is we all watched this shit happen on tv. There wasn’t a lot of online viewing back then we sat in front of tvs in shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could have had aliens land that day and it would have barely registered

       Yes, you are right. We sat in front of our TVs all day in shock. Like I said, I remember building 7 falling too. But like you said, so much was happening that we were in shock. It was hard to take it all in.
      </p>
      <p>
       My two children were toddlers at the time, so I was busy with them too. So I honestly didn't give Building 7 much thought until a few years ago.

       After 9/11 several things happened...
1)  Many people who could directly financially benefit from the collapse of the Two Towers did through insurance payoffs.
2)  A war occurred in Iraq dramatically expanding the west's influence in the region and the west's control of oil.
3)  The police state in the US dramatically expanded with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the expansion of FEMA.  From these events the National Incident Management System and Fusion Centers throughout the US located close to major metropolitan areas were developed.
4) This allowed the west some time to develop alternative energies to wean itself away from oil and respond to future emergencies caused by the coming energy crisis and climate change that will flood highly populated coastlines.

       This is just a theory I have developed.  It might have holes but it's the best I could come up with.

       I believe the buildings were scuttled for asbestos abatement. After it was determined that demolishing them officially was a non-starter because of the inability to keep trillions of asbestos filiments from being inhaled by 10 million people, they demolished them unofficially. The filiments were still inhaled, but hey, what are you going to do when there are crazy mutherfuckers with box cutters in the world who hate us for freedoms (which include the freedom to be shot unarmed in the back by cops, as per SCOTUS)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how they brought them down, the thermite explanation is good, but the pocket nukes, which I used to think was just plain silly, is growing on me, esp. given all the radiation cancers in south Manhattan (cancers only seen in people like the survivors of Hiroshima).
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw someone here a few months ago refutting the asbestos claim by saying that the buildings were at full occupancy. Given the asbestos abatement problem that had been documented by the Port Authority since the 1990s in the Towers, no one should have been allowed in them. Mesothelioma literally only takes one filiment, and 1000s are released when asbestos ceiling tiles begin to crumble, as was happening throughout the buildings.

       They say 9/11 was an inside job so we can go to war with Iraq for oil yet we made a beeline straight to Baghdad and raided thier museums of thier artifacts. Our history of mankind has been hijacked and they don't want us to know the truth. He who controls the past controls the future, he who controls the present controls the past.

       This guy helped me solidify some of my beliefs on 9/11 but he absolutely nailed it as far as WTC7 because he didn't know that WTC7 had gone down. His name is Danny Jowenko and he
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a demolition expert. Many in the community believe he was
       <em>
        assassinated
       </em>
       by car crash for trying to research what he knew about 9/11.
