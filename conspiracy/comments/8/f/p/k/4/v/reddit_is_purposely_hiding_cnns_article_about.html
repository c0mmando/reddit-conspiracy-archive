<p>I mean this nonsense has been going of for my entire life (I&#39;m in my 40&#39;s) and I&#39;ve never seen a President so adamant about resolving this as Trump has been. And now it looks like some steps have been taken to resolve this. </p>

<p>It could be one giant coincidence, but he took that trip last year and met will all the leaders that share a boarder with NK. Then the Olympic thing, then the announcement of the meeting with Kim, now this? </p>

<p>I am not a fan of Trump, and I will be the first one to shit on him when he fucks up. But this is different, I really think he had a hand in this. And I think credit should go where credit is deserved. </p>

The guy can&#39;t keep a marriage together he can&#39;t negotiate holding hands with his own WIFE do you really honestly think hes capable of doing this amidst all the other stuff hes got on his plate.

<p>Have you met the Kim dynasty?  Dick measuring contests are what they do best.  Maybe he finally spoke their language and Kim Un finally said, &quot;<em>This guy is crazier than I am, I better stop while I&#39;m ahead.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>After all, don&#39;t forget he learned how to rule from his Dad, and his Dad&#39;s entire MO would be to cause a world stage fuss, rattle sabers, and then back down at the last moment to get food or aide money, etc.  This may have been Un&#39;s attempt at doing exactly what Dad did.  Shoot off some missiles, piss everyone off, then back down at the last minute and get things given to you for stopping.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be real, he likes staying in power.  So he&#39;s not going to get himself into a war in which he&#39;ll be removed -- not if he can help it.  </p>

<p>I can also see NK trying to get closer to SK because of the divide with the US (though I don&#39;t think this is why they stopped), but I doubt SK will ever fully leave the US&#39;s tit.  The milk is just too sweet, and with China backing NK, SK needs the US <em>and they know it.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually such a great question.  Not even joking.  Let&#39;s talk about this.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s ask - why would leaders be congratulating Trump?  Are they honestly just saying &quot;good job&quot; or could they have ulterior motives?  Do they gain anything from this?  I think they do.  Regardless of whether or not it&#39;s the truth, Trump is taking credit for these positive changes in NK, and he&#39;s going to continue doing so.  Everyone knows that.  So, I believe world leaders are taking advantage of Trump&#39;s ego/vanity by showering him with undeserved praise simply to gain favor with him.  </p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s a ton of world leaders who are talking about this change in relationship between North and South Korea <em>without mentioning Trump at all</em>.  Why?  Why aren&#39;t these people coming out and saying &quot;Trump doesn&#39;t deserve this much credit for the changes in NK&quot;?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s obvious.  There&#39;s no need to point out how little his contribution impacted diplomacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Not every world leaders is trying to curry favor with Trump.  Trump loyalists either excuse or praise his behavior no matter what the facts of the situation.  Leaders who aren&#39;t compelled to kiss his ass have no reason to praise Trump for something he didn&#39;t do.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticizing Trump doesn&#39;t work.  He&#39;s basically immune to it because he doesn&#39;t deal with facts the way normal humans do.</p></li>
<li><p>Criticizing Trump over something so obvious and insignificant isn&#39;t worth the headache.  It&#39;s better for them to keep quiet than risk Trump having a meltdown over Twitter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>tl;dr world leaders are either Trump loyalists who&#39;re willing to pretend this is all part of Trump&#39;s master plan, or they&#39;re ignoring Trump&#39;s contribution because it&#39;s truly insignificant.  The only person who can say for sure is Kim Jong-un so we&#39;ll have to wait and see what he says.</p>

<p>Consumers of information from NPR contend that NPR does its job well. A study conducted in 2003 by the polling firm Knowledge Networks and the University of Maryland&#39;s Program on International Policy Attitudes (University of Maryland at College Park) showed that those who get their news and information from public broadcasting (NPR and PBS - Public Broadcasting Service) are better informed than those whose information comes from other media outlets. In one study, NPR and PBS audiences had a more accurate understanding of the events in Iraq versus all audiences for cable and broadcast TV networks and the print media.</p>

<p>Literal tabloid The NY Post is well known for its objective journalism. His criticism is summed up as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of this justifies the attacks from President Trump, which are terribly inappropriate coming from the head of government. At the same time, the media should acknowledge its own failings in reflecting only their part of America. You can’t cover America from the Acela corridor, and the media need to get out and be part of the conversations that take place in churches and community centers and town halls.</p>

So long as you agree with their ideas then they accept you.  But this tolerance ends when you disagree with them.  It doesn&#39;t matter how well-intentioned your reasoning is, it doesn&#39;t matter why you think what you do, if you disagree with them you&#39;re a number of -isms (racism, sexism, etc.) they have on the tip of their tongue to personally attack you with.</p>

<p>Their goal is that if they can defame you and demean you as a person, then no one will listen to your ideas.  After all, who&#39;d ever seriously listen to what a <em>racist</em> had to say, right?  That&#39;s their elemetary logic, but since a good chunk of the world is elementary at best, that&#39;s why they have traction.</p>

<p>They appeal to the victimhood narrative -- any group that isn&#39;t statistically &quot;the majority&quot; they go after and they push these ideas of being the victim, not being enough, being attacked for being different, etc.  The Left is pushing an agenda called &quot;Identity Politics&quot; - basically they&#39;re trying to split this country along racial lines, gender lines, religious lines, etc., as a way to divide and control.</p>

<p>But in order to create an &quot;Us vs Them&quot; paradigm, they need an &quot;Us&quot; - and that is where white people, or white men, or white christian people, etc come in.  Have you noticed how the Left and liberals are FAR more tolerant of things that seem racist against white people, or white people stereotypes, but if you were to flip &quot;white&quot; with &quot;black&quot; all of them would call you racist?  Yea, this is what the Left has been reduced to &quot;tolerating&quot; in order to feed the festering hatred they&#39;re drumming up from all this victim mentality.</p>

<p>The Left has become a hate mongering, race-peddling, sex-peddling joke, in which the only diversity it tolerates is the superficial kind -- not the ideological one.  And you need only look at pre-Stalinist Russia to see how well that works out.</p>

<p>Keep your powder dry.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t promote that mentality.  I called it out, and I don&#39;t think calling it out is the same as endorsing it.  I don&#39;t endorse it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a liberal and yes, that&#39;s true. Bad ideas don&#39;t need to be tolerated. Especially when they are rooted in ignorance. Ideas are up for criticism of any kind. The only time you should lend tolerance to an idea is when it&#39;s applicable or when it&#39;s new. Then it&#39;s your duty to consider it. And only after you consider can you begin to criticize it.</p>

<p>For example;</p>

<p>Xenophobes say Muslims need to be banned to stop terrorism in the US</p>

<p>A ) Most terrorism in the US is caused by non-muslim US citizens and therefore isn&#39;t applicable to this problem</p>

<p>B ) Blaming some societal problem on some group of people and then banning them from said society is an old idea that has already proven over and over to have disastrous inhumane consequences. It&#39;s not new. </p>

<p>and therefore there is no reason why we should be tolerant of this idea.  </p>

<p>Here is another one;</p>

<p>If religious zealots say that women should cover their bodies for religious reasons.</p>

<p>A ) There is no problem this solves and therefore lacks applicability.</p>

<p>B ) This idea is old and has already proven to have pretty serious negative consequences for women in every culture that practices it.</p>

<p>and therefore there is no reason why we should be tolerant of this idea.</p>

<p>And yes I realize that there are liberals who don&#39;t practice this concept truthfully all the time but that is a flaw in the nature of people and not the nature of liberalism. </p>

<p>There is a large gap between this and the rest of your post so I&#39;m not gonna address the rest of it because I don&#39;t feel like going back and forth about it all day. I just wanted to clarify this first point. If you want to read further about tolerance and how it should be practiced then <a href="https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376">read here</a>.</p>

<p>Sure I agree.  The problem isn&#39;t with liberalism on paper but how many liberals operate in practice.  The problem isn&#39;t with the ideology of equality and freedom but how those who claim to champion it practice it, and worse, how they claim to be fighting for tolerance while being among the most intolerant.</p>

<p>That said, I fully agree that there are some concepts that deserve universal intolerance -- such as genocide, or slavery, or pedophilia, or acceptance of abuse, or banning Muslims, etc.  100% agree.  That sort of thought doesn&#39;t really belong in an even semi-civilized world, and I think most everyone would agree with that.</p>

<p>But in practice the line never just stops with those concepts.  Conservatives can&#39;t voice their disagreement with any number of liberal policies and receive tolerance for those disagreements, and this is what I&#39;m talking about.  As soon as they expose themselves as disagreeing with liberal politics, they&#39;re now seen as the enemy and they&#39;re treated to a whole host of personal attacks.  Most liberals can&#39;t even reasonably sit down with conservatives and hear them out without getting overly emotional and resorting to personal attacks.  Many conservatives are just as bad, so this isn&#39;t a liberal-only issue, though it is the liberal side of the house that claims to be the most tolerant.</p>

<p>In theory, a tolerant liberal should be able to hear someone argue why welfare is bad, they can disagree, and then shake hands and say, &quot;Well, I sure don&#39;t agree with you, but you have every right to think that.&quot;  That doesn&#39;t happen.  Instead the first thing that would be kicked back would be something about how the person is likely just a closet racist or hates poor people.  Disagreement isn&#39;t tolerated, and receives name-calling as a response because most liberals can&#39;t debate the concepts, they just feel a certain way and that&#39;s all they know.</p>

<p>And about the rest of what I said, it&#39;s really not up for debate.  Groups are hyper-segmenting and forming up based upon US vs THEM dynamics.  These fragmenting groups are being driven by the groups leadership for a number of reasons, but mainly its for control purposes.  It&#39;s no different than any cult.  Each group is being preached to that they&#39;re the victim, that they&#39;re special, unique, that they get it and no one else does, that only the group understands them, that everyone else is out to get them, and there are very real consequences for disobeying the group or disappointing the group, mostly a loss of social connections and human relationships, which is a key driving force in many cults.</p>

<p>So we can discuss about how mainstream liberals aren&#39;t practicing the tolerance they preach, but as much as the sky is blue, modern society is hyper-segmenting.</p>

<p>To quote you, &quot;That&#39;s patently ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you really think that liberals are <em>the only</em> people being tolerant of people who have different opinions or ideas and that they invented the concept?  Come on dude.  If you can&#39;t even start the discussion being intellectually honest, then I can&#39;t help you.</p>

<p>Also, I said they are <em>among</em> the most intolerant.  I know plenty of liberals who are very tolerant, very loving, very open minded.  And then I&#39;ve met a few and seen plenty who are among the most intolerant and hateful, right up there with neo-nazis.</p>

<p>You seem to have a problem with me broad-brushing many liberals as intolerant, but then you turn around and broad-brush them as patron saints.  Either you have a problem with broad accusations or you don&#39;t, which is it?  If you only have a problem with accusations when they&#39;re not in your favor, but don&#39;t when they are, then that&#39;s just hypocritical of you.</p>

<p>So maybe it&#39;s a good thing you didn&#39;t read any further.  I doubt you could handle it if you can&#39;t even handle</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is not an accurate representation of the demographics of the united states. Reddit&#39;s users are worldwide even though the majority are probably american. Even then the american demographics are younger and more affluent in general and they tend more towards liberalism. Its not a big conspiracy, or any kind of suppression, its just statistics. </p>

<p>That said because of that trend the major subreddits are generally modded by liberals, and that certainly gives their modding style a liberal bend to a greater or lesser degree. People&#39;s personal biases always leak into their choices even if they are trying to be objective, and many are not.</p>

<p>I keep seeing this and it’s still dumb. Political affiliations are determined from a young age (typically). It has nothing to do with “young people are more liberal, but they come to their senses with age <em>smug face</em>”. It’s that right now, Republicans are pants on head nuts, so young people are identifying with Democrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lotta censorship. In the past few years reddit has moved to a much more commercialized state, taking money for ads and the like. So for them it&#39;s a business, and because of that they need to ensure the content of reddit aligns with what their sponsors want to see.  Not to mention any personal bias from the owners. Looking at u/spez for his notorious edits and shadowbans</p>

<p>how little representation there is of right wing ideology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i mean i just don&#39;t buy this line of thinking. there are many, many right-wing leaning subs out there (i&#39;d argue this sub is more right reactionary than left leaning). t_d routinely has front page posts.</p>

<p>so, i think to say that there is little representation is misleading and disingenuous.</p>

<p>That is because you aren&#39;t listening. You came here to stir up shit and when I responded with my opinion you were ready to jump down my throat with what you wanted to say all along. </p>

<p>I simply stated my opinion. I could be wrong and I even alluded to that with &quot;My guess is&quot;. And that is the difference between people like me and trumpers. I use my experience, education, and hope to view the world but I know my view is not infallible or the only possibility. It is just what I feel to be the most likely outcome regarding the situation and the little information we know so far. I&#39;m willing to change my beliefs when facts are presented, are you?</p>

<p>But unlike others, I&#39;m not gonna say obama&#39;s policies are the reason for NK and the stock market going up. Pompeo went and meant with Kim, I&#39;m thinking he had something to do with it. So far that&#39;s my opinion, if something else comes up that makes more sense I&#39;ll change my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure he did. What was he supposed to do? From a political standpoint what choice do leaders from both N.K and S.K. have. Say publicly that Trump, the POTUS  did not really have anything to do with this? Wouldn&#39;t be too smart if you were looking to get aid. The U.S, has had lots of troops stationed in S.K since the armistice. Would it be a good political move to piss off Trump at this time and maybe have him pull U.S forces out?</p>

<p>No, this is just politics. I am giving Trump his due. So far he hasn&#39;t screwed it up. If he just shakes a lot of hands and shows that fake smile of his, he will get credit he feels is his due. If he is smart, he stay out of the way and let it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, nothing happened for how many past presidents? How did NK get its hands on nukes?</p>

<p>Once this is all settled, I hope will see who helped and who didn&#39;t. I just don&#39;t want to hear it&#39;s obamas sanctions. It&#39;s not, other strings have been pulled, not saying by Trump, but someone did something.</p>

<p>Trump was chirping on Kim on twitter lol, I wouldn&#39;t say that helped. But didn&#39;t Pompeo meet with him on Easter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/mike-pompeo-met-with-kim-jong-un-over-easter-weekend-wapo-1213418563707?playlist=associated">https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/mike-pompeo-met-with-kim-jong-un-over-easter-weekend-wapo-1213418563707?playlist=associated</a></p>

<p>To me, someone did something for things to change.  And right now his admin is in charge. Will see what happens, but the same people saying Obamas sanctions did this are the same saying the economy is finally booming because of Obama.... I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>Now, am I fan of Pompeo? Not really, so this could just all be show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about Obama sanctions? N.K. has been a pariah since the armistice. China has been N.K only patron. N.K. has continued to flaunt attitude regardless of &quot;who&#39;s administration is was&quot;. Thats not what has been happening the last twenty years. N.K. has been bleeding their country dry supporting their million man army and trying to build nukes and missiles to try and force a better world bargaining position just like every other nuclear country.</p>

<p>Are you ignoring the fact that very recently their nuclear program ate itself? The only nukes they might have are the only ones they will ever have. It would take them years and billions of dollars they can&#39;t get to rebuild. Additionally, China&#39;s economy and the U.S. are intertwined. Have you noticed the past ten years or so that China&#39;s support of N.K. has been waning. </p>

<p>They have to push for a deal now. China support is getting harder to come by, and now they do not have the nuke program they were betting on. Trump has zero to do with it, he just happens to be the one in power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that something was sanctions.  Which China started doing in 2016.  They agreed to US negotiated sanctions in 2016 to back UN sanctions, then voted with UN to increased sanctions in 2017, and increased them again in early 2018.  Trump can get credit for continuing US sanctions with increases in step with UN, but there are only two (known, we are unsure what’s happening at the nuclear test site) unprecedented things in this whole negotiation.  China started sanctioning NK two ears ago, and the people of SK voting Moon to power on the platform of finding peace with NK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My own theory is that someone - maybe Xi, maybe the South Korean president - got word to Kim that if he wanted to rejoin the world again that Trump, being such an unorthodox president, was going to be his only chance.</p>

<p>Whether you love Trump or hate him, I think everyone can agree he does <em>not</em> have the standard relationship with the deep state / intelligence community that all other presidents have had.  Just the opposite - they&#39;re confrontational.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t tell Trump &quot;Don&#39;t talk to North Korea - just believe everything we tell you and trust that we know best.&quot; because he doesn&#39;t trust them to be straight with him.  <em>And he shouldn&#39;t.</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Kim is dumb.  He sees the chance <em>not</em> to be the next target but to instead become a sort of hero to his people and he&#39;s very wisely jumping on it. </p>

<p>so, like, north korea was going to launch into an utterly suicidal war of aggression against...who?</p>

<p>how?</p>

<p>here&#39;s a more recent news piece from a certifiably non-right-wing news organization:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/26/world/korea-summit-kang-kyung-wha-amanpour-intl/index.html">south korea credits trump for opening door to talks with north</a></p>

<p>quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>South Korea&#39;s foreign minister has said she believes President Donald Trump is largely responsible for bringing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of Friday&#39;s historic summit between the leaders of North and South Korea, Kang Kyung-wha told CNN that the US President had played a significant role in bringing the two sides together.</p>

<p>&quot;Clearly, credit goes to President Trump,&quot; Kang told CNN&#39;s Christiane Amanpour in Seoul. &quot;He&#39;s been determined to come to grips with this from day one.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty vague. It literally says &quot;credit goes to president trump&quot; for all either of us know, because you also weren&#39;t involved in the peace talks, that could be &quot;he was incredible and no one else could have done this&quot; or &quot;he has a big army and that was good to bargain with&quot; it could have even just been a formality.

I think the efforts by SK and the apparent NK stance is fantastic and may end tensions and problems that absolutely might give the President a huge bump/win.  I think he is absolutely an idiot for running victory laps this early and it might just explode in his face.        </p>

<p>My real problem though is I have seen nothing that he did.  What exactly was the policy of maximum pressure?  What did he actually did that deserves credit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in NYC and our school was pretty blatantly pushing all of us to be democrats from pretty much elementary school. Continuing through college, professors blatantly express their personal political views in lopsided discussions which are hardly tolerant.

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m sure its the same in the south. Nonetheless, the default subs are littered with liberal viewpoints. Up until 2016 it was at least genuine. Now it&#39;s tainted with shilling and became more suffocating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, nothing happened for how many past presidents? How did NK get its hands on nukes?</p>

<p>Once this is all settled, I hope will see who helped and who didn&#39;t. I just don&#39;t want to hear it&#39;s obamas sanctions. It&#39;s not, other strings have been pulled, not saying by Trump, but someone did something.</p>

<p>Trump was chirping on Kim on twitter lol, I wouldn&#39;t say that helped. But didn&#39;t Pompeo meet with him on Easter?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/mike-pompeo-met-with-kim-jong-un-over-easter-weekend-wapo-1213418563707?playlist=associated">https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/mike-pompeo-met-with-kim-jong-un-over-easter-weekend-wapo-1213418563707?playlist=associated</a></p>

<p>To me, someone did something for things to change.  And right now his admin is in charge. Will see what happens, but the same people saying Obamas sanctions did this are the same saying the economy is finally booming because of Obama.... I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>Now, am I fan of Pompeo? Not really, so this could just all be show.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And yes I realize that there are liberals who don&#39;t practice this concept truthfully all the time but that is a flaw in the nature of people and not the nature of liberalism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure I agree.  The problem isn&#39;t with liberalism on paper but how many liberals operate in practice.  The problem isn&#39;t with the ideology of equality and freedom but how those who claim to champion it practice it, and worse, how they claim to be fighting for tolerance while being among the most intolerant.</p>

<p>That said, I fully agree that there are some concepts that deserve universal intolerance -- such as genocide, or slavery, or pedophilia, or acceptance of abuse, or banning Muslims, etc.  100% agree.  That sort of thought doesn&#39;t really belong in an even semi-civilized world, and I think most everyone would agree with that.</p>

<p>But in practice the line never just stops with those concepts.  Conservatives can&#39;t voice their disagreement with any number of liberal policies and receive tolerance for those disagreements, and this is what I&#39;m talking about.  As soon as they expose themselves as disagreeing with liberal politics, they&#39;re now seen as the enemy and they&#39;re treated to a whole host of personal attacks.  Most liberals can&#39;t even reasonably sit down with conservatives and hear them out without getting overly emotional and resorting to personal attacks.  Many conservatives are just as bad, so this isn&#39;t a liberal-only issue, though it is the liberal side of the house that claims to be the most tolerant.</p>

<p>In theory, a tolerant liberal should be able to hear someone argue why welfare is bad, they can disagree, and then shake hands and say, &quot;Well, I sure don&#39;t agree with you, but you have every right to think that.&quot;  That doesn&#39;t happen.  Instead the first thing that would be kicked back would be something about how the person is likely just a closet racist or hates poor people.  Disagreement isn&#39;t tolerated, and receives name-calling as a response because most liberals can&#39;t debate the concepts, they just feel a certain way and that&#39;s all they know.</p>

<p>And about the rest of what I said, it&#39;s really not up for debate.  Groups are hyper-segmenting and forming up based upon US vs THEM dynamics.  These fragmenting groups are being driven by the groups leadership for a number of reasons, but mainly its for control purposes.  It&#39;s no different than any cult.  Each group is being preached to that they&#39;re the victim, that they&#39;re special, unique, that they get it and no one else does, that only the group understands them, that everyone else is out to get them, and there are very real consequences for disobeying the group or disappointing the group, mostly a loss of social connections and human relationships, which is a key driving force in many cults.</p>

<p>So we can discuss about how mainstream liberals aren&#39;t practicing the tolerance they preach, but as much as the sky is blue, modern society is hyper-segmenting.</p>
