       That we can’t critique this sub on here? It’s restricted under rule #10. How can a conspiracy sub claim to be open if we can’t even critique the sub itself? Does that seem totalitarian to anyone else?

       I agree 100% it's a bullshit rule, the type a totalitarian dictatorship would implement.  I just got my comments on taking a vegetative state child off life support and lettting it die by starvation vs. euthanizing the child so it doesn't  suffer deleted by mod
       <a href="/u/RecoveringGrace">
        /u/RecoveringGrace

       .  I am in favor of euthanizing the child rather than death by starvation and apparently I'm "advocating an illegal act"
      </p>
      <p>
       I should be able to be critical of that type of dipshit decision and the moderator in general.  It shows extremely poor judgement and is  not in keeping with the spirit of this subreddit.

       The irony is fucking rich actually. I don't typically post or comment even though I check the feeds multiple times a day. You can no longer debate a topic or agree to disagree like the civilized intelligent human beings so many people pretend to be. So I keep most of my thoughts to myself and just scroll the feeds looking for those little informative truth nuggets a person can stumble upon here :)

       The rule is enforced the same way though.  I've been ridiculed and mocked on here and when I defend myself, my comment gets deleted, but the person attacking me, that's fine.  Though I suppose the difference is I don't report people for rules violations, and the person I responded to almost certainly did.

       I believe 90% of the internet has become exactly this. No one can agree to disagree any more. You're no longer allowed to have differences of opinions. I think this is in part a result of the bubbles that social media places people into.

       It took 10 years for r/conspiracy to grow to it's current size. It's just not practical to start a new sub. Look at the size of all other conspiracy related subs. People like this sub because it has a huge reach and potential to actually get the word out about atrocities committed against humanity. Good luck spreading the word anywhere else.

       This post is a great example of your point. It is critiquing the rules of the sub, and yet, it is not removed. It even has some negative comments that look brigaded to me, and yet, it is allowed to persist and thrive.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I can't speak from experience. Cause i've never got a post deleted or got banned on my throwaways.
And as much as i agree to the above mentioned difference, its not a ver clear line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agression and violence are nowadays terms that is not strictly defined anymore. Some people might define violent in a very different way then others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people might classify certain critiques and opinions as a violent statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example: "This person shouldn't be allowed to work in that company anymore"
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this an attack on the person and calling for his resignation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said, I'm not saying this sub is doing this wrong. As i dont have specific of any banned posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying that just citing the rules and definitions you just made , doesnt intrinsically mean that everything is just.

       Indeed, in my time here in the past few years I've seen so much meta discussion and posts critiquing this subs, it even get ridiculous at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts and threads like "This sub is filled with political bullshit conspiracies, lets talk about something more fringe", "This sub has gone seriously downhill recently", "This sub or the mods suck in X way", "This sub is compromised"..... many of which are not even good critiques but simply dumb meta circle-jerks without any real constructive criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking the sub and its users is a completely different ballgame and I'd say it should continue to be removed. Especially posts like "This sub is cancer", "Everyone on this sub is retarded", "You people are stupid"....what kind of productive discussion can be made from such posts or even threads?

       There aren't.  The one that pretends to be one of us I have personally caught posting pay links in this sub.  Several years ago there was shake up on the mod team and ever since then each one of the new mods has been a complete and total fake account jackass.  I wouldn't be surprised if our mod team was controlled by TMoR vets at this point.

       That is not what rule 10 means. In my time spent on here in the past years, I've seen plenty of posts critiquing the sub in numerous ways. There is so much meta discussion on this sub sometimes it can be ridiculous honestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule 10 explicitly states that the sub and the users thereof cannot be
       <em>
        attacked
       </em>
       , which is very different than putting forth constructive criticism.

       On one hand, this sub questions everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atm it works fine, a lot better than some more heavy handed subs actually. I read rule 10 as attacking, which is a bit different from critique. As i have seen posts hit front page bringing to light some bullshit of shills and bots over running posts so some critique is allowed, just not attacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your critique is harsh and becomes an attack its rule 10, you can still question this sub, at least thats what current wording of 10 leads me to believe.

       This place is a lost cause by design. They want to keep critical thinkers isolated from the masses so they aren't stumbled upon. They want to keep second amendment supporters isolated off YouTube so they aren't stumbled upon. They want to carefully shape the perception of what is normal and put as many walls in place as possible to keep purple from peering over them.

       Yeah man we all agree. There have been quite a few questionable mod additions/general shakeups that have happened since the election. Personally, I think that there are a few good guys in the mod team, and they're trying their best to work within a system that is more and more heavy-handed and dictatorial under the premise that "it's our site/sub so we can run it how we want to", ignoring the obvious fact that the sub is entirely the product of us, the users. But, that being said, no moderation is a bad thing because, of course, the JIDF/ShareBlue/MMFA/Military shills are things (randos: Don't attack me because I didn't mention "Russian bots". I live by objective reality and not what I'm told to think so I only list what I know to be true) and were we to forget that, they would spam and vote manipulate us more than they are already capable of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I advocate for people to learn more about meshnets and long-range routers/repeaters for just this reason. The internet - now that is has become a hive for the chattel masses in the wake of smartphones - is dead because people with money finally realized that they can use it to get what they want out of a society. We need to decentralize by creating our own uncensorable meshnets, because for one, yeah, the censorship and blatant dishonesty of sites like Reddit, or, really, the internet as a whole, sucks, and for two, it would remove the "normies" by the simple virtue of being more complicated than "push this button and now you're online".

       You are obviously critiquing this sub in this post. Since it is thoughtful, it will not be removed. Rule ten is almost never enforced, and when it is, I generally agree with the moderators.
      </p>

       The rule is, you cannot "attack" this sub. Criticism is common, and sometimes welcome.
