       I'm 100% sure no peace won't come out of this. NK leaders have been pulling this shit regularly to regain popularity since forever. They talk about wanting peace, then lay down some crazy conditions for it to happen, and ofc, peace "offer" gets rejected. Then thanks to the total control of media they have, they can twist this as much as they want to show how others are evil and how
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       are the good guys protecting the population against the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting SK president to move into NK for pictures were a huge hint at this happening, this is definitely going to be twisted as "we even invited them on our land, but they rejected our hospitality".

       I just got home from work an I have seen something about it 3 or 4 times already. I just checked, it is at the top of r.news right now. As important as it is, this should be no surprise the talking heads of the msm are focusing on Cobsy. It is what they do.

       NK talks are clearly the bigger story here, but I DO think Cosby deserves attention and to not be whitewashed over. Shitty for his victims, but man am I glad to see a prominent member of a protected class go down.

       That's because it has been tightly controlled for so long. They need to learn to open up and loosen the hell up and stop following agendas narratives and propogranda so much.. Like god damn just report on whats actually happening instead of trying to force an agenda or something or force something else to happen. It's almost inversion, like they want us to flip upside down.

       <li>
        <p>
         US military presence is absolutely required to guarantee safety of SK and "maintain stability"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So now we've got this top level meeting between NK and SK. This is taking place without any visible input from the US and seems to have been initiated by the North Koreans. Overall tone seems to be that Kim wants to take things down a notch and end the technical state of war between North and South.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that the Deep State and their MSM mouthpieces have been caught off guard by this development. It doesn't fit in with the current narrative and they haven't yet decided what the new one should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of just reporting the truth, they're staying quiet until they've had enough time to come up with a new narrative.

       Good god thank you for helping me understand that. Awful awful energy that is... Trying to control stuff in that way with such a wide audience.. How irresponsible of media to sell out like that and become controlled in the voice of fear

       Probably not. If the public is hearing about it it’s probably been in the works for some time.  I don’t mean to suggest anything nefarious (though I wouldn’t be surprised), just that there are very few surprises — certainly not with as close an ally as SK is..

       I watched it live as well on JTBC. The summit began at around 8 PM EST (9 AM Korea time). The announcement of the peace deal wasn't made until 5 AM EST (Friday). They set up some podiums outside after the day of talks and then Moon and Kim came out to address the media and make the announcement. Then they proceeded to the banquet.

       It all has to fit a certain agenda for it to be aired. If not,  no airtime.
      </p>
      <p>
       That agenda? Make everyone fearful and angry; divide the country. Mass shootings, daily homicides, Trump doing this, Democrats doing that, chemical attacks, Russia, Kim's nukes, and more. The more were divided, the more complacent we become concerning major issues like healthcare and education because we're too worried about stupid trivial shit.

       I'm in Korea but only have the Korean ability of a young child. I tried to watch an English stream on my Apple TV from any of the main news apps but only saw the same Cosby garbage/brief stories on what President Moon is serving Kim (Japan is pissed because the mango mousse depicted Dokdo, a disputed island territory). So, I just watched it live on KBS. It started at 10am over here, which would only be 9pm EST, so I was surprised it wasn't being broadcast. There were several youtube streams but I was too busy to seek those out. It was really interesting though. Kim walked Moon across the border, into the Northern territory, holding hands. Kim looked extremely out of breath just walking though. Like about to die out of breath.

       When you posted there was no news from the meeting yet (as it was still happening). Video footage of them crossing the border and meeting was already online. What did you want the news to talk about? Did you just want that meeting on loop for hours?

       What is your point? I think it's weird they didn't show live coverage of a north korean leader taking the first steps into south Korea since the war. It could have been live but they pushed it off till today. Our country lost many men fighting that war and millions of Koreans in both the North and South died as a result of Kim's grandfather. I wanted them to at least show it. The news can talk about Alfie for weeks, I watched William and Kate bring home their baby live on CNN. I'm just saying it's weird they couldn't have a 'breaking news ' clip of it.

       I think I get what happened here. OP didn't take time zones into account and thought the meeting happened this morning when it was happening when he posted this. The reason it was covered more to him was because it just started and OP thought it was over.

       You shouldn't look to cable news for news. It sucks and has for decades. It's basically just TMZ. Every major news outlet was covering it online including NYT, Fox, WaPo, WSJ, and even CNN.

       The cable news networks make programming decisions almost entirely on the basis of RATINGS. If they didn't cover something, it's because they could make more money covering something else. If there was a tornado in Nebraska they'd cover it if it got better ratings.

       CNN doesn't work off ratings, they work off propagandizing the world on "terror" and death stories.  Thus the Nazi death cult color scheme, thus being placed in every major airport for four decades.

       The Japan-South Korea alliance mostly exists because it was forced to exist in an environment where the USSR and Communist Chinese were right next door. South Korea and Japan still get into arguments about comfort women and territorial disputes over tiny islands, but they at least have occasional talks about it. North Korea is even more anti-Japan and has kidnapped Japanese citizens in the past and they launched missile tests over Japanese territory. North Korea and Japan don't talk about it. In fact, I don't think Japan even officially recognizes North Korea's existence. So Abe (prime minster of Japan) sees both Koreas getting along wonders what it means for the Japan-South Korea alliance, because despite their differences, South Korea is probably still Japan's best friend in the region.

       They won't broadcast anything that could in any way be construed as a victory for the Trump administration.

      <p>
       Obama's administration was offered North Korean nuclear disarmament several times. North Korea asked for them to stop skirting the border with US strategic bombers. That was their only request.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama turned the offer down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't posturing on the NK border. NK and SK are now resolving their issues. Big surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like the USA was directly preventing the consolidation of North and South Korea isn't it?

       And if Obama

       </em>
       allowed the two countries to work it out, he would have demanded he be there for the photo op.

       Ok maybe I should put the Korean time on the top of the post. You guys are confused. Look at the time of the event in Korea. Friday, 9:30 AM it’s prime time Thursday night here. Anyway, just something I noticed. If it came in live for everyone else on their major cable channels, great!
