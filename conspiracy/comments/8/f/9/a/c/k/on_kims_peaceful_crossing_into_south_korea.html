       People are surprised about Kim’s change of heart but when you really think about it, it’s not so surprising. First off he was educated in a western country his whole childhood. I can’t imagine he could withstand years of top class education in Switzerland without being subjected to some sort of western values. I feel the reason that the country has been so aggressive with their nuclear program up until now was because factions and military leaders most likely strongly pushed back against opening up the country for the sake of their financial gains and fear of inter nation punishment for their human rights abuses, and probably threatened Kim with a coup if he were to do what he’s doing now. And having nukes is the only way to not get invaded for democracy like Iraq.  So the question is what changed inside North Korea that finally allowed Kim to do what I think he wanted to this whole time. Did he negotiate with the military leaders, finally has the upper hand, or maybe he was just sick and tired of being the bad guy and didn’t care about the risks. Discuss

       Chinese scientists are reporting they believe that the mountain that NK has been doing their nuclear bomb testing has collapsed. If that is the only area they can do testing than their program has been halted.
      </p>
      <p>
       That could explain why now NK is looking to start negotiating.

       Well don't think they would store what missiles they have in the same place they do testing. They have missiles.

       But what I'm saying is if they can't do testing and progress their program than making peace would be in their best interest.

       That's exactly what it is. They lost their trump card (I'm so punny) when that mountain collapsed. Now they start the negotiations that will take 5 years...just enough time to start the program back up. Then they'll pull away.

       I think its a means to an end. We just dont know his end game yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont trust this ploy he has begun. But i would be hesitant to. Criticize trump/others for giving kim a shot - but i am sure everyone is walking on egg shells to see what the next move will be.

       There is no doubt Kim wanted to open up the country more BUT he can't be seen as weak or anything from his generals, his already opened up the country a bit, tourists can go to and from NK AND China has several shops in NK, its all baby steps!
      </p>
      <p>
       Kims first class education leads me to believe however he has a couple plans that might not be fully known yet.. Clearly (to me) him stopping testing on nukes says 1 of 2 things (or maybe a bit of both)
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        He is 100% confident in what they have and have no further need to test anymore
       </li>
       <li>
        He is using this "DE-nuclarisation" (I can't spell to save my life sorry!) of the area as a way to finally force USA OUT, USA has had 30k troops at Kims boarder since the end of the Korean war, having all those troops leave gives Kim a lot more breathing room!

       Maybe it's a ploy to allow US troops or missile stations to amass in N Korea, along the border with China and Russia. They couldn't sell the invasion angle, so suddenly they're best friends. Riiiiight.

       Kim is playing three dimensional chess. North Korea needs oil and food badly they currently can't get it.

       They are putting up solar panels slowly but surely however they aren't efficient and the program isn't quick enough

       Trump is looking for a bad guy to cement his legacy. First it was the Mexicans but that was unfeasible. He said he'd never do what crooked hilary would do an intervene in Syria yet here Trump is. Prior to Syria he was trying to call Kim out but Kim has played him like a violin
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been the aggressor on social media and Kim has held out the olive branch making trump look like the war monger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim will strike a deal that sees sanctions lifted the south build some factories in the industrial zone by the DMZ and he will probably get a few million dollars to boot. Trump will be pissed because A) he's done nothing to facilitate this and B) he's got no boogeyman to go after

       Trump is always looking for someone or something to blame. He's a classic con man ignore what the right hand is doing focus on the left
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Mexicans fault the American dream was failing he was gonna build a wall on day one he was gonna create jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six months in he realises it's harder than he thinks he needs a diversion. He goes on about Kim being "rocket man" and a danger to the US. Turns out on today's events he clearly isn't. Stories about North Korea over the past few decades were the original fake news. Not saying bad shit didn't go down there it happens everywhere but a lot of stuff was either a lie or downright exaggeration
      </p>
      <p>
       Classic example about a year ago he supposedly had a purge and a senior member of his government was fed to rabid dogs alive infront of a crowd. Only for him to turn up six months later alive and well
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump knew he wasn't getting anywhere blaming North Korea now he's blaming the Chinese for ruining the American economy. He's playing a dangerous game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Kim asks the south Koreans to shut all the US bases in their territory. Could well happen. America would lose a foothold in the region and Japan would be at the mercy of China

       China want rid of them from the continent. North Korea need fuel and food and they are likely to gain more from the south with these talks than the south gains from them
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple case of "we were building nukes because you've Americans on your soil. No Americans no nukes.." A south Korean president could bring an end to decades of the Korean war cementing himself in history is probably going to be tempted by that offer.
      </p>
      <p>
       No nuclear program would mean no NATO sanctions and China and Russia would be free to give the North Koreans as much food and fuel as they need without NATO scrutiny. They win by the Americans being at further arm's length making it harder for the US to strike Russia and China

       I think the reason is the sanctions that the UN implemented in September, then made worse in December just before Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read them, they are crippling. I believe the timing matches up and why the narrative shifted so sharply over the past few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is similar to Iran - except NK doesn't really have the resources that we're interested in, or isreal bitching about how they "sponsor terroism".
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand why Kim has nukes, NK had 10% of it's population wiped out by us in the Korean War. Nukes are a deterrent against hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember last time a leader gave up his nukes (Gaddafi)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think UN should have power to cripple a nations economy, it's pretty much moving towards truly establishing an NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to remember that NK is a sovereign nation and that we have no right to tell them what to do. Truth is, they never attacked anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot justify war or economic war just because we disagree with how their country is being run.

       What I'd like to see is diplomacy in this matter than our clown president tweeting madness.

       No one tried to negotiate with NK, they just voted to slap sanctions on them.

       Maybe to him the war was over long ago but he needed the nuke so USA wouldn't invade. He can't completely open borders because the government would be thrown in jail for war crimes. Unless Kim was really spending all this time making the camps disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a big reason for this is because Trump is president and not Hillary as Kim doesn't want his country thinking South Korea and America had female leaders.

       I think from a business stand point, uniting NK with SK is an excellent business opportunity and the US has more to gain in doing business with them as one nation than by perpetuating sanctions agianst NK and fear mongering them as an enemy and nuclear threat. Trump needs a unified Korea on his side to up his game against the cabal. There's more brighter future for them in renewable energy industries and other green technologies that there is in making nukes.
