       There's a show on this French streaming app called blackpills and it talks about how companies data mining all of our personal information then feeding it into algorithms could somehow predict what it is we will do in the future. It's scary to think that may not be too far off.

       The Clinton campaigned used an AI to run tens of thousands of simulations. Their AI, no doubt fed with faulty data to begin with (biased and/or downright rigged polls), had her chances of winning at near 100%. So much for AI taking over the world. Humans will always have that wild card factor that computers will never be able to predict.

       I agree in general. We are susceptible to AI only to the extent that the issues under consideration are "machine-like", as is classical logic. AI will be the master of the logical playing field. But human intelligence is quite capable of developing "different logic" to deal with the need to survive.

       Minority Report happening now, as a law was recently passed allowing force DNA sampling of everyone arrested for anything, even if they are never convicted the DNA profile can be maintained permanently in a central POLICE STATE database to help frame/prosecute you in the future for something else.. or for something else you 'will' do in the future indeed.

       Only as predictable as you allow yourself to be. It's certainly easier to come to some conclusions concerning to what extent your actions can be predicted in advance by data mining and having more specific details about you, but not
       <em>
        categorically more
       </em>
       information than could be gleaned by simply watching you, following you around, taking note of your personal habits, lifestyle, who your friends are and the kind of interactions you have with others, etc.

       By and large it's an effort to identify whether or not you're a good prospect to buy some commercial product that can be directly pitched at you rather than hoping you simply stumble upon it in some more general context. But just because you're a good candidate to buy it doesn't mean that you that will. Moreover, knowing that they've identified you by spying on your electronic footprints might make you rule them out altogether no matter how much you might have liked their product.

       Yeah, going by the targeted ads I receive, they are not very good.  Also, being “add and ocd” regarding hobbies and purchases is a pretty ironclad defense against this...  “Hah!  You are marketing me Kalamazoo widgets!?  I haven’t been interested in those since last Tuesday!”

       the simulation right now? There has been a ton of popular scifi shows with episodes around that theme recently, like Doctor Who or The X-Files.

It turned out The Veritas provided a simple test to prove the readers that they were in a simulation and that their existence in it helped an evil alien race gather intel on our behavior and to see how we react to things and test how an attack on Earth would pan out, so staying alive was actively harming their real-world counterparts and Earth itself.

       CERN also got a copy of The Veritas and they all killed themselves. So an episode with CERN, Simulation Theory, Vatican and Pope Benedict IX, evil demonic aliens

       from the human race to take over them etc. Hits way too many marks for stuff talked about here to be just a harmless scifi-episode. Feels like predictive programming. Doctor Who usually doesn't do shit like this. Plus they presented The Vatican/Pope and CERN in a very positive light. Plus it's filled with Social "Justice" Bullshit (aka black lipstick lesbians and The Doctor insulting white people every episode).

       There is any number of people working on this. I can't remember the name of the company/project but the first time I heard of it was around 2005 or 6 and they were crawling the web for keywords. You can bet Google does at least that much today.
