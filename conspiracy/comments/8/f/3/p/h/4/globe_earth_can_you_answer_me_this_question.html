        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I&#39;ve always had this question bugging me. Mind you, I&#39;m in no way a believer of Flat Earth although I do think we are lied about a LOT of things concerning both the Earth, space and the universe. </p>

<p>So, as humans, we each perceive this physical reality/life/Earth as if we&#39;re the center of the universe, correct? One can saw WE are the center, since it&#39;s what you or me or any other human being sees and perceives in their respective lives is what matters in that said life, correct? </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m going to talk about Antarctica. In the Globe Earth, Antarctica is at the bottom. So, I&#39;m going to need you to think of the Earth as a ball. Better yet, take a ball with your hands. Antarctica should be at the bottom of it, right? So, say NASA develops a rocket lunch in Antarctica. The rocket is lunched from Antarctica to outer space. The astronaut that is in the space craft lunching into space, from his perspective, is going upwards. But think of the Globe on a wider scale, or from the ball that you are holding. If you see it from a bigger, general picture, that space craft is going downwards, correct? So, Earth should be on TOP of them? In theory? Actually, in reality? How is this possible? From his perspective, say he&#39;s reached the outer atmosphere. Shouldn&#39;t he be watching Earth as if it&#39;s above him? And not as if it below him? </p>

<p>So, there really is no center? As WE the center? </p>

<p>I hope y&#39;all understood what i&#39;m trying to say. </p>

<p>Man if you were high this would blow the fuck out of your mind. </p>

<p>The answer of course being a very disappointing: <em>&quot;No, &#39;up&#39; simply means &#39;away&#39; from the Earth, in this example&#39;</em></p>

<p>If you look at the Moon from Earth, which side is &#39;up&#39;? Think about it for a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Up, away. You get the point. If you take a ball and you place a lighter at the top of it and start going up(as if it&#39;s a space craft lunching to space), it&#39;s going up(and furthering away from Earth). If you take the lighter and place it at the bottom of the ball and do the same thing, it&#39;s also furthering away from the Earth but from the opposite direction. </p>

<p>So, how can Earth be a Globe but there is no directional points? No top/bottom? Regardless of where you are, YOU are the center. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s very confusing to me. So, you can&#39;t go &#39;below&#39; the Earth, you can only go &#39;away&#39; from it? How is that possible? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to space, zero G and all that - There is no such thing as up and down. You have directions, but up and down in this context are Earthly terms that relate to gravity. </p>

<p>Both of your lighters will equally perceive themselves as going &#39;up&#39; and away from the Earth, in opposite directions. Because they&#39;re both leaving Earths gravity. They will both look &#39;down&#39; and see the Earth &#39;below&#39; them. Because &#39;down&#39; and &#39;below&#39; are the direction of the Earth - Gravity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. So, how are pictures of Antarctica taken from space, possible? Shouldn&#39;t a satellite be lunched from Antarctica in order to be able to take a picture of Antarctica as if it&#39;s above it? Or can satellites be monitored and controlled to go &#39;travel under&#39; the Earth? If a satellite is lunched from America, per say, then as it travels through the atmosphere and into space, it&#39;s going to see America as  the center below it, right? As the Earth is spinning &#39;horizontally&#39;, can a satellite travel and go &#39;below&#39;(in Earthly terms) the Earth were Antarctica is? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/">The fact of the matter is you really don&#39;t know how spaceflight works. Going up is like 10% of it - 90% is going &quot;sideways&quot; i.e. parallel to Earth&#39;s surface.</a></p>

<p>Satellites orbit earth by constantly falling down but so fast sideways that they miss the ground and keep going around. &quot;Sideways.&quot; Getting to space isn&#39;t like watching a balloon or elevator or something gain only altitude and remain relatively stationary with regards to the surface. If you want orbit you need a velocity of about 7.7 km/s, and for now only rockets are able to achieve that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: There&#39;s nothing too special about what you&#39;ve noticed, you just don&#39;t spend that much time standing on your head.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJMYoj4hHqU">Here</a> is a fantastic video from the University of Toronto made in 1960, to explain exactly what you&#39;re asking.</p>

<p>TL;DW: You&#39;re switching between two different frames of reference.  The fact that they don&#39;t agree doesn&#39;t really matter, because one frame of reference doesn&#39;t care what is happening in another.</p>

<p>You&#39;re using multiple definitions of &quot;down&quot; rather than trying to stick with one.  There&#39;s the one we commonly use as &quot;down&quot; which is radially inward toward the earth&#39;s center.  That&#39;s the astronaut&#39;s frame of reference.  Then you have a different frame of reference where you said the southern part of the earth&#39;s axis is what&#39;s actually &quot;down&quot;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing special about either of these definitions, people just made them up.  It can be useful to define a down, so you can use words like &quot;below&quot; and &quot;under&quot; and people will understand what you mean.   But, just like left and right, there&#39;s nothing special about how we defined down.  Just like two people facing each other don&#39;t agree which way is left, people who are upside down from each other won&#39;t agree which way is down.</p>

<p>What&#39;s likely happening is that you&#39;re used to people disagreeing which way is left, like when moving furniture, but you are rarely upside down next to people.  Because you&#39;ve never had a disagreement about which way is down, it&#39;s easy to come to see down as objectively true, rather than the subjective and arbitrary distinction it really is.</p>
