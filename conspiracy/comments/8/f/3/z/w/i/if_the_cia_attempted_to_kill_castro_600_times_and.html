<blockquote>
<p>Over 600 times. Not sure if Castro&#39;s just that good or if the CIA&#39;s just that bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of those explanations seem remotely possible.</p>

<p>Seems more likely that they were collaborating to make it look as if they were enemies, while actually working together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this case I suspect the line of thought was:</p>

<ul>
<li>CIA: this guy&#39;s a partner and/or asset - but the PR campaign we ran in the US is that he&#39;s an enemy because communism</li>
<li>Castro: If my people thought I don&#39;t stand up against the US they wouldn&#39;t like me anymore, even though I&#39;m powerless to do so. </li>

<p>Seems the easiest cover story for both is that the CIA&#39;s out to get him but keeps failing.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Tests carried out by a Swiss scientific experts found traces of polonium in quantities much higher than could occur naturally on Arafat&#39;s personal belongings .... On 6 November 2013, Al Jazeera reported that the Swiss forensic team had found levels of polonium in Arafat&#39;s ribs and pelvis 18 to 36 times the average. According to the Swiss expert team (including notably experts in radio-chemistry, radio-physics and legal medicine), on a probability scale ranging from one to six, death by polonium poisoning is around five.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While much of that article seems very politically incorrect and will be downvote magnet here, his Bay of Pigs / Guantanamo analysis was interesting.</p>

<p>&gt; Each year Cuba spends on total military about 1/10th what we spend on Guantanamo Bay alone. The total military budget of the US is about 10,000 times that of Cuba—and that doesn&#39;t even include Intelligence and black ops, which may double that number. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>&gt; You may wish to re-think the Bay of Pigs story with that in mind. If Cuba was able to repel an invading force in 1961, why isn&#39;t it able to drive this US base off the island? We are told Cuba has wanted the base to close since 1959, but we just ignore them. You may also want to ask yourself what all these soldiers at Guantanamo were doing while the invading force was allegedly being repelled in 1961. We are told the US invaders included only 1,400 paramilitaries. We are told that training of these troops was in Florida, Alabama and Puerto Rico. Really? Why not train them at the US base on the island of Cuba? Why not use the thousands of US soldiers already camped on the island?</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>&gt;It is beyond belief, really. Go read the Bay of Pigs Invasion page at Wikipedia. The US Naval Base on the island is not mentioned once. This is all you need to understand that the entire event was a hoax.</p>

<p>&gt; Here is rough map of the island. Now, say you are the head of the US military and you want to invade Cuba. You have a huge base on the island. Are you going to choose the Bay of Pigs as the location of your invasion, flying in paramilitary from Florida? Not a chance. You are going to attack from the base you already have on the island, and you are going to attack Havana directly. Havana is right on the coast and your base is a naval and air force base. So you come in from the north and land right at Havana, overwhelming it immediately. Why in the world would anyone attack Cuba from the south, having to trek all the way across the island to reach Havana?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually Mongoose failed because they didn&#39;t have access to Castro but succeeded in the JFK situation because they had inside access to all US security measures. Cord Meyer is the linchpin. In charge of overseas operations when Oswald was sent to Russia to out KGB agents and then  oversaw Mongoose when he returned to oversee Mongoose and other operations. His wife was assassinated for having an affair with Kennedy and E Howard Hunt refers to these teams in his confessions. They had heavy connections to the Mafia who they used to help try to assassinate Castro. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is more likely that the Soviet Union and the US were collaborating and Cuba was a player in their game. Similar to what seems may be happening now. I think Russia and the US have very shared interest in creating and atmosphere that requires one or the other in a Muslim dominated area. They can good cop and bad cop Syria all day. Always Deep State shit happening.</p>

<p>Putin went fishing with W. Bush, and while Obama was president, Russia bribed the Clintons with over a hundred million dollars through the Clinton Foundation regarding Uranium One. Furthermore, Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin as President of Russia many years ago. It&#39;s been reported that Yeltsin was a puppet for the US, Putin was his #2, Yeltsin chose Putin to succeed him, and Putin has been in power ever since. </p>

<p>More likely these 10 were either a message &quot;this is a reminder we could get you if we want to&quot;, or part of a PR campaign &quot;see, USSR, he&#39;s not our friend/asset so you can keep telling him secrets&quot;.</p>
