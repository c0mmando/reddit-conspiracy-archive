       What has happened to this sub? The only possibility of truth we had is now being severely divided by the same tactics used as r/politics. The ideological war wages on, seeing more political posts attacking both sides daily. I understand “with politics comes conspiracy” but most of these posts have been far-reaching to say the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all sit on a throne of “truth,” yet we can’t acknowledge our own species as individuals. We group each other and label based on differing thought processes. How is that truth? The TRUTH is, neither side is better than the other. Politics is a game of who can win the most voters spinning the most ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       What IS important, is the people unifying and keeping the checks and balance system from being abused. How is it even possible to discuss potential conspiracies when we can’t even see our counterpart as a free thinker? This will probably be downvoted based on the influence in the sub recently, but I’m speaking for truths and the people.

       There is no anger, it's a broad statement for anyone doing that. Even then I can express myself in whatever way I like and being offended or hurt by "bad" words is just people being too sensitive. There will always be people who say things you don't like and that's ok.

       You said that what people know about the culture of the Hillary camp is told to them fro her political opponents.

       I provided info about the Hillary camp from a source that was not a Hillary opponent.

       So, I poked a hole in your comment, and you ignored it and downvoted me. Now your insisting it was relevant when it was actually entirely related to

       Why are you even into Hillary or anything Hillary related? She's irrelevant polically and also being investigated from multiple directions .

       Why would anyone not ignore anything Hillary related? I'm honestly confused, why would people not talk bad about a politician in a conspiracy sub? Isn't that normal?  At the very least make it about relevant politicians

Liberals what’s wrong with y’all ?
So a judge ruled a bar doesn’t have to serve a guest with a maga hat but it’s ok to serve lgbt to Christian people ?

       At any political rally there are (usually women) who look fairly painted and do nothing but sell or hand out stuff (water/stickers/buttons that kind of shit.)  Tell them you're excited and want to be involved.
       <br/>
       i was recruited by a couple of girls who helped me after I got my drunken ass kicked outside a taco bell in phoenix new years 2007.
They invited me to an event in tempe a week later and when I got there they tried to get me to work (setup) for free.
       <br/>
       I did - because girls.
       <br/>
       There wasn't enough space for all the people that were coming and a it looked like a big line to the beer-garden section fenced off.
Another guy and I went down the road and grabbed the city's construction barricade fencing and hauled back to increase the size of the beer garden.
Now we get emails a couple of times a week.

       This sub has transitioned through many phases, especially in the last two years. You have to change the way you navigate this sub, as it changes. It's all part of the conspiracy now

       Yes, and one of the most hilarious events on television was the Turd Blossom's refusal to believe that Romney lost.  They had all the voter suppression in place and even then were receiving aid from the Russians on social media and were certain 2012 was in their bag.

       I think you misunderstood the reasoning behind the ruling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next you might tell me Hillary picked the judge and ordered the ruling.

       Why are you even into Hillary or anything Hillary related? She's irrelevant polically and also being investigated from multiple directions .
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would anyone not ignore anything Hillary related? I'm honestly confused, why would people not talk bad about a politician in a conspiracy sub? Isn't that normal?  At the very least make it about relevant politicians
