       Probably has to do with people on Earth being able to see it since pre-Babylon and put it into a bunch of astrology and mythology. Neptune has mythology behind it too, Saturn is just a bigger planet. Big = powerful in old times, hence Jupiter being "king of the planets" and all that

       Saturn (Roman) in myths is Kronos (Greek) God of time. If you are
       <em>
        saturnine
       </em>
       , it means you feel gloomy or depressed. The planets are frequently assigned to emotions or traits- Lunatics for LUNA-tics. Or Venereal. Or Jovial (Jupiter). Or martial (Mars, god of war) etc etc....
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn is shown somehow on a T-shirt or poster or sign in almost every movie or tv show I have seen in the past 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn is supposedly a satellite, people have claimed, which beams the program to the moon which then somehow projects it to earth?

       Also occultists call Saturn “the dark sun” as they believe it was a red dwarf sun in antedeluvian times. The mysterious hexagon at its pole reinforces this idea of Saturn somehow being the (symbolic) “source” of dark / left-path energy.

       It would be best to read the occultists’ own litterature; or listen to Mark Passio’s lectures on Youtube, he’s great at explaining these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, and afaik, the hermetic principle of duality postulates there are opposing sides to everything (although nothing is truly opposed in a higher realm). So some occultists see the actual sun as representing the “white” light (i.e. truth, beauty, love, etc.) while the dark sun (Saturn) represents the opposing force.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not surprising the very name “Satan” and “Saturn” have the same etymology.

       .....having a strong electromagnetic connection with the Sun, as this proves the core is active and electromagnetically connected to the sun, as it should not be as hot as it is form just distance alone, it would require another means to be receiving that type of energy to heat up the way it is.

       "
"We had speculated that the south pole hot spot was connected to the southern, sunlit conditions," said Glenn Orton, a senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and co-investigator on Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer. "Since the north pole has been deprived of sunlight since the arrival of winter in 1995, we didn't expect to find a similar feature there.""
      </p>
      <p>
       "The infrared data show that the shadowed north pole vortex shares much the same structure and temperature as the one at the sunny south pole. The cores of both show a depletion of phospine gas, an imbalance probably caused by air moving downward into the lowest part of Saturn's atmosphere, the troposphere. Both polar vortices appear to be long-lasting and intrinsic parts of Saturn and are not related to the amount of sunlight received by one pole or the other. "
      </p>
      <p>
       Because its related to the amount of electricity/ionized energy it receives.
      </p>
      <p>
       "
"The hot spots are the result of air moving polewards, being compressed and heated up as it descends over the poles into the depths of Saturn," said Leigh Fletcher, a planetary scientist from the University of Oxford, England, and the lead author of the Science paper. "The driving forces behind the motion, and indeed the global motion of Saturn's atmosphere, still need to be understood." "

       There is a theory that the Earth was originally a moon of Saturn. That Saturn was a brown dwarf star, the Earth resided in its "plasma sheath". Saturn was captured by the Sun and the Earth was flung into orbiting the Sun.

       Its has the strongest connection to our sun, used to be Jupiter, it usurped Jupiter, his father Chronos, who is the father of Zeus (Jupiter).

       These gas giants create rocky moons, somehow someone was able to figure out that these gas giants are creating moons, seem to have a "dominant" one, go ahead and look into the Saturn + Jupiter remote viewing sessions. Jupiter starting eating its children/something caused the planets to fling back into the gas giant, instead of being pushed off and orbiting within its heated plasma atmosphere/ionosphere.

       Guess I’m a little late coming to the party for this, but traditionally Saturn — in astrological and mythological tales passed down from the ancients — is the Greater Malefic, the Lord of Time, Age, Death, Decay, and essentially most bad things. He rules old people, farming/farmers, the deep earth, worms, bugs, and everything creepy and crawly. He enjoys sowing misery among humans, corrupts that which he touches. He is, in short, The Big Bad (conversely, The Little Bad is Mars, the Lesser Malefic — still extremely potent, but on a smaller scale compared to Saturn). He also symbolizes the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don’t mention this often, but astrological/occult stuff is one of my huge interests. I don’t mention it because a lot of people thing astrology is bullshit. While you’re free to think what you want, I’ve read and see too much to think otherwise. It’s pretty legit, but it takes a long time to make sense of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Saturn’s position as The Big Bad in the sky, holds a lot of historic lore as the Greater Malefic. Back in the day, the seven planets (and not the outers) were given temperaments, attitudes, rulerships, and basically seen as supreme celestial spirits beyond mortal comprehension (there were only seven — up to Saturn — because they could not see past him without assistance...this is significant because back then most things were paid attention to based on
       <em>
        empirical observational evidence
       </em>
       — stuff that could be observed as a human, that could be seen without help from other stuff, like high-tech telescopes and/or other forms of detection).
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, Saturn was basically considered the gatekeeper for our mortal affairs. He rules magic, which is co-ruled along with Mercury, and jealously covets his secrets beyond which most can’t grasp. Anything beyond the scope of Saturn’s sphere is stuff we typically don’t get to know in this life. Beyond him is the stuff of the fixed stars — the heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Saturn’s temperament as the Big Bad is excessively cold and dry: he hinders life, which, naturally, is considered not a good thing for us — living things. Since he holds the sphere farthest from the Sun, the source of all life and the ruler of the heavens (from the point of view of our home, the Earth), he is cold, and can be considered a main enemy against all living things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       care about this kind of thing or are genuinely curious, one main reason for this is because of the twelve houses of the zodiac (which you all should know based on the bullshit you read in the paper), the signs he rules, Capricorn and Aquarius, are
       <em>
        directly opposing
       </em>
       the signs of the two Luminaries — Leo and Cancer, the homes/signs of the Sun and the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the beginning, God said
       <em>
        let there be light
       </em>
       , and light was unleashed, and gave vision to existence. The ancients believed that the transfer of light to one body to another was the transfer of energy to all living things, and the source of energy. This is how planets were seen as giving their essences to living things, and how they made sense of the Gods’ granting their blessings on individuals. That’s just a little philosophical bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, Saturn is pretty nasty if he is not positioned properly. He rules most misery. He is interesting, too, because of the original seven planets, he’s the only one with a ring. The ancients saw this as extremely important, and represented much of what he rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the reason why people might be interested in him is because he co-rules magic and a lot of hidden stuff (mainly because he can be seen as reclusive, secretive, and silent). I suspect that, because he is the highest and most supreme of the seven (read this as being farthest from the Sun and the longest revolution through this signs), his stuff rules far longer, and far more significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, this field of astrology (which is called
       <em>
        traditional astrology
       </em>
       because this was how astrology originally was, and has been around for thousands and thousands of years) is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       complicated and
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       in-depth. How the ancients figured this crap out is impressive to me, and I deeply respect the true practitioners of this science. If you want to check it out, be mindful that the actual method of doing this stuff involves geometry, basic understanding of physics, and lots and lots of math (but this is
       <em>
        mostly
       </em>
       for the field of Mundane, which can be used to predict weather, commodity prices, and even the emergence of new religions and political factions. Robert Zoller, a truly profound man, used Mundane to predict the 9/11 attack. If you don’t believe me, check it out, but I know a lot of you guys are smart and open minded).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some stuff from a novice practitioner. You don’t have to accept this stuff, but it exists regardless of people’s approval, and that is why I appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me. Like I said I know it is a bit late to respond, but I like reading about this stuff, and it truly helps me make sense of the world around me.
