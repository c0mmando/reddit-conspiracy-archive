       There's been a taxpayer funded effort to demonize Vladimir Putin and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end result will be nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anyone vote for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       The justifications for bashing Russia are so flimsy. We're talking fake gas attacks, false flag plane attacks (mh17) etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems the American Government is actually an occupation force controlled by the Israeli Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do this through bribery and blackmail of US representatives and officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's suicidal not to wake up to this ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has an American built nuclear deep underground base.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll snug as a bug while the Goyim are toasted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear America do you enjoy being Israel's dumb Golem?

       You act like we have been at war with North Korea. No. Honestly nothing has happened with them. Nobody has launched a Nuke ever so what do these new peace agreements actually mean? It’s not like anything actually changed that much on the grand scale of things. How do we know tensions won’t flare up again in a few years or even a few months? Will this finally mean we can stop bankrupting the country on military spending or is it just a ploy to say. See look how well these threats worked with North Korea. The only way to achieve peace is to beef up our nuclear arsenal even more and hope all these nations continue to put their tails between their legs like North Korea supposedly did.

       Idk man it's also just as likely that all the stuff about Trump ending the deep state is to give us conspiracy theorists a shred of hope so we wait to see if trump will change anything rather than take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anybody claiming that it's definitely one way or the other is not someone worth listening to. Theres a chance Trump is sincere and is trying to rid Washington of corruption. But theres also a chance that it was all bs and he's still a deep state puppet. Knowing Donald, there isn't really much reason to believe a word he says, so I'm kinda leaning towards the fact that he's deep state. But at the same time like you said all this stuff is going on and maybe Trump is partially the cause of it. And this is a part of their whole plan, to get people like us to not know what to believe. Then they can make up any story they want, and it'll still fit in with one of your conspiracy narratives, and then you play directly into their hands.

       For some reason reminded me of the sherlock episode with a plane full of dead people that was going to be used for some event and  sherlock brought up the Coventry air raid false flag Churchill used to ignite a war effort, forget the episode but really surprised me to hear reality brought up on a mainstream show.  Just sayin every single time we fight eachother a trickster kicks it off.   Now though we're feeling the biggest damage in the Slowly-boiled bio-war so the media's televised war is just bankers and energy/weapons shareholder noise when they want someone's property.

       You’re damn close, but it’s bigger than just Israel. The US has been occupied by the people who control Israel since 1913, more than 30 years before Israel’s founding. Reducing it to just Israel lets lots of people off the hook. Who controls Israel? That’s the question.

       It is a cabal between the organized Jewish community, (think of an ultra white collar mafia), the Vatican, and the Crown, (the corporation, not the outward British royal family). This trifecta is behind basically everything that went wrong from 1800 onwards.

       It's just Capitalism at work. Capitalism facilitates concentration of wealth in hands of few people, which in turn allows them to use their money to buy influence. War is profitable for the wealthy class, that's why America is in constant state of war.

       During Cuban missile crisis, both leaders understood the consequences of all-out nuclear war. Trump, on the other hand, doesn't have a clue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's even more scary, is that in Washington they are talking about "winnable" nuclear confrontation with Russia. I would suggest to read recently changed nuclear doctrine of US.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is ran by bunch of psychopaths who are not capable of understanding the consequences of their actions. Russia being so rich in resources, is the ultimate prize.
