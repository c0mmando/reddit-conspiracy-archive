<p>However, there are still some unhinged individuals who I guess would prefer to see a World War instead of Trump being involved in anything good.</p>

<p>FTR, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter (I shouldn&#39;t have to say this but oh well) but I find it fascinating that some people can be so filled with hate that they&#39;d rather see the world plunged in global conflict than have anything positive happen during Trump&#39;s presidency.</p>

<p>Here are some actual quotes from that <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> thread from what I assume are real people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FUCK TRUMP. And FUCK ANYONE giving that racist orange cheeto faced bastard any ounce of credit here. I fucking hate how that fuckstain idiot is going to claim credit here.</p>

<p>Get ready for Russian bots and American morons to claim the orange retard is the reason the Koreas have been in peace talks.</p>

<p>Fuck Trump. He doesn&#39;t deserve any fucking credit for this. He didn&#39;t fucking do anything. This had nothing to do with that orange bastard. Anyone giving credit to Trump here is a fucking moron.</p>

<p>Trump will take credit for this like the ignoramus narcissist freak that he is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In defense of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> users, these users are being called out, but I thought <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might find this sentiment as fascinating as I do.</p>

<p>As much as I hate to give credence to anything like X-derangement-syndrome, which is yet another rhetorical tool designed to divide us through propagation of the red vs. blue/left vs. right false dichotomy, the OP has a point, and it&#39;s a good one.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a stupid way to view it. Yes that&#39;s how the populace looks at things (&quot;Trump got unemployment to an time low*&quot;   * if you ignore the fact it was going down steadily since 2014)  but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t be better.</p>

<p>If we weren&#39;t at least involved somewhat in what&#39;s going on again we would be super incopetent, and yes we are still influential , but China has a shit ton more influence over NK than we ever could, short of going into all out war with NK. </p>

<p>Is it bad that he was thanked? no, but let&#39;s pump the brakes here a little</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean how much is any leader really involved in the culmination of events? It&#39;s the workers that make it happen, but the leadership generally gets the credit. That&#39;s just the way things work. But it works the other way too, the workers are the ones who let things fail and the leadership takes ultimate responsibility.</p>

<p>Yes, China has more influence over NK, but China also does not have a conscience, and absolutely wouldn&#39;t give 2 shits about what evil shit NK does so long as Kim keeps his dick pointing south and doesn&#39;t generate refugees. At the same time though, China has a direct economic interest because of the border, so ultimately they care what the rest of the world thinks about NK, because they would rather be free to trade than have to abide by sanctions placed elsewhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I see (grudgingly) saying &quot;Good job, Trump.&quot; is really indicative of needing to put the brakes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get it. It&#39;s also worth keeping in mind that we should wait and see if this sticks. Ending the war is one thing, but the real goal here should be North Korea being less of an unmitigated hellhole for it&#39;s citizens than it currently is.</p>

But it was probably more along the lines of the fact that the bad side of the American government was forcing North Korea to do what they wanted by black mailing and extorting them, now that trump is putting the smack down on all of them Korea is free to do what they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC, the South Korean president says he credits Trump with putting the meeting into motion.</p>

<p>Like OP, the Hate Side of the Force is strong with this one. I personally don&#39;t mind him, in fact, he seems to be getting shit done, but since got into office over someone else&#39;s candidate AND has a questionable <em>personal</em> life it&#39;s okay to insult the man 24/7? Politics and people who get caught up in politics suck.</p>

<p>People that voted for Trump knew damn well he was no saint. They didn&#39;t care that he slept with porn stars and have been married a few times. They wanted a change. They wanted someone to go against the status quo of DC pleasantries and get some shit done. That is what he is doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was confused too. Even some of my brightest friends are drinking thr haterade.</p>

<p>And then I realized it&#39;s something more spiritual. The whole cultural process behind this man and what he is doing... the process is exposing the shadow in a lot of people. The shadow of things in the subconscious mind that are unworked. The monster of unconquered ego and the raw power of fear. He invokes it all, and the vast majority of it is due to the cognitive diasonance caused by the really negative souls here on Gaia causing relatively uncorrupted souls to be disturbed into fear due to the subversive brainwashing tactica being used, and the strength of vibration of these nasty souls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is what is most alarming. It&#39;s the people I know IRL that I consider to be decent people, they have lost their minds. Like irrational hatred, seething. I think the entertainment industry has played a huge role in this, fueling it  every hour of the day. Every show, every newscaster, all of them just adding fuel to the pyre. </p>

<p>But it also ties back to the unwavering hypnotic love they gave to Obama. It was the exact same with him, just on the other side of the coin. That bugged me out as well. Like he was the messiah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because there are comments over reacting to Trump not having much to do with this development, doesn&#39;t mean Trump was heavily involved with this development. </p>

<p>The same day this was made official, Trump was shouting into his cellphone at Fox &amp; Friends. It really seems unlikely that he was very personally involved in this. When F&amp;F asked him about NK/SK, he could hardly give any information and pivoted back to shouting about the media. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty safe to call into question Trump&#39;s involvement. </p>

<p>And we&#39;ll see what happens when the US and NK sit down in May. </p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s still fair to call into question what Trump actually did, and look at it realistically.

    <div class="md"><p>We should question it. Did they say it so Trump will cloud the public opinion on what is going on in NK. Every post on Reddit is going to be people arguing about Trump and still making the to sides fight each other.</p>

<p>I feel like they want to keep what NK does to their citizens under the rug to make peace easier.</p>

<p>Trump gets a little credit as everyone involved should but I think SK president gets the most credit as they spent years preparing for this moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get it. It&#39;s also worth keeping in mind that we should wait and see if this sticks. Ending the war is one thing, but the real goal here should be North Korea being less of an unmitigated hellhole for it&#39;s citizens than it currently is.</p>
