    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!  Much more proof is needed than NYT, some Post, Star, etc wrote the same articles copy pasted from each other.  Its all mostly lazy and corrupt journalists doing the Deep State&#39;s bidding.  In particular I lived in Ukraine during Maidan, coup and war and once you&#39;ve been deep into that you just can&#39;t go back.  Also my friend brings many tourists into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria">Transnistria</a> and they were writing epic bullshit about the place until just very recently when the articles started becoming something approaching reality.   Lazy ass journalists would copy paste each other from a thousand miles away talking about the place like it was virtually North Korea.  Many years ago one BBC journalist went to a border away from a check point and put on his best fear face while whispering into the camera about the consequences for being there.  Laughable as fuck!  He could have just breezed right in there with an immediate 24 hour pass obtained at the border.  So then of course the natural next phase of questioning is that maybe North Korea isn&#39;t as completely batshit insane like they say.  I&#39;m fairly positive that its controlled and stifled as hell but its probably very far from how it is portrayed with Kim eating people&#39;s eyeballs for dinner (or whatever heinous stuff that they are saying).  Hey last time I checked the CIA actually has these horrible torture practices and known and currently unknown black sites, even going so far as to tastelessly reopen old gulags for these purposes.</p>
