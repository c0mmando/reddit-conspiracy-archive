       My theory is not really fleshed out yet, but maybe it holds some merit. He had to liquidate many high ranking officials after his father died because they might have otherwise intervened into his plans. Notice how everything that has been happening started because he suggested it. Why did he decide to go for it now? It is also not 100% serious but maybe there are some half truths hidden in this.

       A bargaining chip or for security or both. Western Countries down invade if you have Nukes. I believe he wants to repeat what China did. His family was evil, maybe he is too. But I believe he wants to transition to a market economy which would be better for NK people &amp; the world.

       I think North Korea has known for a while that their current way of doing things is unsustainable. Kim Jong Un seems more reasonable than his father, not that I'm all that well versed in what he's been up to or what it's like in NK under his rule.

       NK was a CIA operation until Trump put a stop to it.   The CIA was using NK to traffic drugs, people, children, organs, and probably amlot more.

       There were probably other intelligence agencies involved, such as MI6 and Mossad.

       Yeah. Dont believe that bullshit without inconclusive proof.  Do you really think the Germans killed jews with masturbation machines, rollercoasters, electrified floors, or turned people into lampshades, or turned them into soap?

       Exactly!  Much more proof is needed than NYT, some Post, Star, etc wrote the same articles copy pasted from each other.  Its all mostly lazy and corrupt journalists doing the Deep State's bidding.  In particular I lived in Ukraine during Maidan, coup and war and once you've been deep into that you just can't go back.  Also my friend brings many tourists into
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria">
        Transnistria
       </a>
       and they were writing epic bullshit about the place until just very recently when the articles started becoming something approaching reality.   Lazy ass journalists would copy paste each other from a thousand miles away talking about the place like it was virtually North Korea.  Many years ago one BBC journalist went to a border away from a check point and put on his best fear face while whispering into the camera about the consequences for being there.  Laughable as fuck!  He could have just breezed right in there with an immediate 24 hour pass obtained at the border.  So then of course the natural next phase of questioning is that maybe North Korea isn't as completely batshit insane like they say.  I'm fairly positive that its controlled and stifled as hell but its probably very far from how it is portrayed with Kim eating people's eyeballs for dinner (or whatever heinous stuff that they are saying).  Hey last time I checked the CIA actually has these horrible torture practices and known and currently unknown black sites, even going so far as to tastelessly reopen old gulags for these purposes.

       it was pornographic gay fiction (novels movies) from the 70s, but it got believed as true nazi war crimes by the MSM.

       Not only do I believe it.  I believe there were elements in the Obama administration actively hindering it otherwise would have happened sooner...if Trump hadnt been elected, it may have never happened.  Iran is next.

       I think it's either planned, or Un is actually a psycho and was assassinated by his own people then replaced with a lookalike. Its the only way to reconcile the huge change, but this guy looks identical so I don't think this is really a viable conspiracy.

       Nah, I posted an article in this sub. It looks like they’ve destroyed their nuke testing site and now that mountain could be radioactive wish is not good for the surrounding areas. I think he was forced into stopping his testing because of this and has no real plans of keeping peace if he can find a new place for testing. But I’ve been skeptical of this since the beginning, just seems way too good to be true.

       They might just be done testing. Once you get it right there really is no more reason to continue blowing up stuff.

       This is nothing but continuing what his dad and grandpa did. Play nice for a year or two getting concessions then going back to their old ways.

       My bet is a massive mishap causing major social and economic damage to his country is forcing him to reconsider their aggression. He's desperate for help. And, or likely that technology is so pervasive enough in North Korea that the general public is becoming fully dissillusioned and hes making himself look like the Great Integrator so that his population doesnt dat him alive with that disillusion hits critical mass
