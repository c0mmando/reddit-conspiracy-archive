       I’ve been watching a guy on YouTube that seems to eat only raw animal products. He says everything else is basically poison. On the other hand we have vegans telling us that meat gives us cancer etc. Then there’s different types of food pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really reached a point now where I distrust a majority of what websites tell me. So that’s why I’m asking you guys.

       What is your opinion on this subject?
What foods are safe to eat?

       The safest way to eat? Natural products (freshly-killed meats/protein, freshly-ripened fruits/veggies, fats such as bone marrow/animal fats/oils)...this is what our ancestors ate and they rarely
       <strong>
        ever
       </strong>
       had the problems we did. Look at most of us, unfit and most likely under-or-overweight in some way, poorly fed in inadequate nutrition. This is caused by the pesticides, genetic engineering, and hormones that have been intermixed and injected within our foods (at least for the developed/developing world) and a large emphasis on grains. Grains are also naturally harmful to the human gut for reasons I won't detail here; search for more info on that subject if you want the further details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vegans are right about meat giving us cancer but
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       because of the hormones that they inject within it. Otherwise, meat is pretty beneficial in some ways. Purely-carnivorous dieters will also say similar things about fruits and vegetables; however, as primates we need a more omnivorous diet which includes vegetables and fruits. Anti-carb people will also have a similar distaste for carbs; grains are not good yes, but healthier carb-rich options such as potatoes, rice, taro are highly energy-dense and can pack quite a bit of short-term nutrition in one serving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is somewhere in the middle, and people have chosen to eat slightly differently under different habitats.

       Humans have evolved and persisted because of the fact that they can eat almost anything. Very little things in moderation are actually poison to the human body. There's a reason people eat like shit and still live to be 50,60,70. The body is amazingly persistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the ideal diet? In my opinion, mainly vegetables/leafy greens and meat. Smaller amounts of fruit, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices, dairy such as eggs or cheese. Only water to drink, and unsweetened coffee/tea in moderation.

       I agree with everything you've said, minus the dairy part. Humans really should not be ingesting dairy products. Cows milk is for baby cows, and no one else, really. We lack the proper enzymes to break certain things down within the milk. This is also why human babies ween off their mother's milk. We lose the enzymes to make it beneficial and properly break it down.

       Basically how much they drank milk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asia, Africa, American (As in Mayan/Native american/etc) descent will have ancestors who basically never drank milk and thus never adapted the enzymes to process it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas if you have Swedish, German, Norse, French, etc descent, you are much less likely to be lactose intolerant.

       This is what I was thinking. My roommate in college was Japanese and couldn't do milk or much alcohol. So the OP point is partially true at best. Some of us can handle dairy it seems.

       I mainly meant dairy for cheese and eggs, but I do agree. I follow the diet I listed above pretty strictly, and I don't drink any milk. I do think cheese has some nutritional value, and eggs are fantastic sources of many nutrients and good fats.

       False? We used to lack them and over the last several hundred years developed the enzymes.

       But humans are fully able to process milk products and have been able to for hundreds of years. Depends on your ancestry really, the more european it is the better you can process dairy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people and asians, for example, have a much harder time since their lineage didn't drink nearly as much milk as, say, people of Swedish or Norse descent.

       The body IS resilient but "moderation" is an easy term to fudge. A lot of people insist they eat healthy with KFC 3 times a week and 4 diet cokes a day. Ice cream in the evening. No exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       That builds up toxicity which damages cells, eventually leading to all sorts of symptom clusters that western medicine terms "diseases" - including "cancer". And once you get sucked into the pharmaceutical sales funnel... whew.

       I mean, sure eating unhealthy causes problems.

       But you realize cancer was still a problem thousands of years ago, right? Despite the fact that no one ever ate processed foods or the like.

       Cancer isn't what links to food. Smoking, drugs, alcohol, are what are linked to cancer.

       Sorry, this is fantastically incorrect.

       A diet of modern processed "food" will lead to cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's  a lot of "food" at US grocery stores that should never fucking be ingested.  Where do you get the idea that smoking, drinking, and drugs cause cancer but the nutritionally worthless processed "food" filled with additives,  preservatives,  pesticides,  herbicids and sugar eaten everyday doesn't have any effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clean Food heals and Processed Food kills. This is the "secret" that Western Medicine doesn't people to understand.  Big Pharma gets millions of new patients every year just because people dont know how to eat.

       Ultimately, the key to not getting cancer is keeping  your immune system strong. People that eat shit food daily are hindering their immune systems. A hindered immune system cannot kill cancer cells  the way healthy bodies do every day.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1980, Sir Richard Doll and his colleague Richard Peto at Oxford University submitted a landmark review of factors known at the time to affect cancer risk. Doll and Peto pointed out that epidemiological evidence regarding diet and cancer was largely indirect and noted the absence of reliable evidence regarding specific components of diet.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a lengthy review of various aspects of diet, including over-nutrition, they guesstimated that 35 percent of cancer could be attributed to diet, but their uncertainty was emphasized by an accompanying wide possible range of 10 percent to 70 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the attributions for tobacco, Doll and Peto made their estimates by cancer site, indicating that perhaps 90 percent of stomach and colorectal cancers, 50 percent of endometrium, gallbladder, pancreas, and breast cancers, 20 percent of lung, upper aerodigestive, bladder, and cervix cancers, and 10 percent of other cancers may be diet related.

       The most gains for the least effort: eliminate empty carbs (that means any kind of refined sugar, most bread and all baked treats, and most stuff that comes in a box and goes "crunch"). This single diet change will give the best results - the rest is a matter of tweaking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people get healthy on meat, others get healthy on plants. Kind of weird, but there it is. Try them and decide. I like both a mix of salad veggies and really good animal protein like fish and eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My recommendation is to intentionally introduce seeds and nuts (quinoa, chia, walnuts, hemp seeds, etc.) to your diet. Not only are they good nutrition, they can also help the carb craving when you stop eating grains and sugar. Fill in your sweet craving with fruit and honey.

       First off - name one successful "vegan" civilization - you cannot, because veganism is not what we are evolved to survive on. So you can throw that one out off the bat.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for what is nutritious food, well, unless you go to the source and pick it from the jungle or forest yourself, it will be contaminated in SOME ways... you just have to look for products that are LESS contaminated or MORE nutrious - organic fruit and veggies, a bit of meat - nuts, lots of fish (avoid pacific fish, obviously and high mercury fish - go for salmon, sardines... a few others).
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate the producer of the food/brand!!! Avoid too much human-created shit like alcohol, bread, pasta, processed meat/cheese (most "american" cheese is literally just rearranged hydrogenated palm oil, not even cheese. Just death.)

       If you're watching Sv3ridge or whatever the fuck his name is, he is radical disinfo. You gotta understand that the entire medical system relies on you eating poorly, so keep your guard up and do your own research.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have two basic choices for healthy eating:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fruit-based -- fresh, raw, organic fruit and vegetables. Graze all you want. (I also add eggs to this, as I feel chickens are a symbiotic species to primitive humans.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Include animal protein, but also add fasting to counter-balance. We're not meant to eat meat 2-3 meals every day. Call it an embarrassment of riches -- it's not until recently that most people could afford this. We're not carnivores nor even omnivores; we're frugivores, like all primates.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Then hedge a bit depending on your more recent ancestry. My parents are Scandinavian and German heritage so I add a bit of fish and a lot of potatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut out dairy, meat, and grains as much as possible. And no synthetic crap, no soda -- if you can't look at it and tell what's in it, don't eat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I eat clean, I have no offensive body odor. I haven't worn deodorant for years. (And trust me, I used to stink bad when I ate meat!) If I slip and eat meat or some awful fast food, my pits stink the next day -- so it's a good indicator of my toxicity level, if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can recommend books or youtube channels if you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes we're being poisoned. The US is a cancer farm.

       Hot damn.  I was just pondering on that "b.o." issue, and was noticing the same thing.  I'm not vegan enough to be stink free, but when I'm eating a bunch of crap, my pits get...  worse.  And when I get closer to the fruit-heavy diet I'm working toward, it clears up on it's own.  I thought it was just me teetering on the brink of turning into a dirty smelly hippy, but I guess it wasn't so crazy after all.  (Or was it?! :)

       Yep, you can go 100% stink free with no deodorant whatsoever -- and one can only imagine what that does for your pheromones. Same deal for morning breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coffee is my vice -- gives me a bit of stink, but a quick wipe with a damp cloth knocks it out for the day. (And since I sleep on my right side, my right pit stinks far more than my left!) Cheap white vinegar is the next step up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's something important to learn here: Your sweat is a MAJOR way your body expels toxins. Think of your skin as a third kidney. This is one reason why exercise is so important -- your body needs to sweat to expel toxins adequately. (And you need to move your body to move lymph. And increased body heat kills pathogens.) Then you need to shower, or that toxicity will be reabsorbed through your skin, though body hair (esp. pubic and head hair for peak sweat areas) helps prevent this.

       Interesting, makes sense! It's all about expelling toxicity, whatever substances are damaging your body. My brother has helped his arthritis by switching to a more fruit-based diet. Similar deal, just on the intake side.

       Take a look at the paleo diet, and try to process your food as little as possible. Learn to cook well, so that you can take raw ingredients with little effort and prepare a delicious meal.

       Organic is often fraud; but if it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       organic, it likely increases your chances of getting parasites. It may be that it is normal or possibly even beneficial to have a certain parasitic load; there are natural ways to cleanse the body and keep things in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn to grow your own fruits and vegetables; consider aquaponics. I've set up a small passive solar grow shelter in my yard, where I grow bullhead catfish, cherry tomatoes, and cucumbers. Fish poo an awful lot, so i set up the system to automatically collect the poo, and I use that to fertilize vertical planters in my yard; I built them out of 50 gallon plastic olive barrels. I can grow 40 plants in the same space a dirt farmer can only grow 5 or 6 plants. I'm growing tomatoes, strawberries, rhubarb, raspberries, chocolate mint, chili peppers, peas, and chamomile tea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Study the glucose index. Diabetes is an epidemic; it causes you to lose the ability to detect pain in your feet, so people get a cut and don't notice. It gets infected, and because of the diabetes, the circulation isn't so good, so then you get gangrene, and they have to cut off your feet. So, you want food that's low on the glycemic index. Examples are: sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, pumpernickle or rye bread instead of white, wild rice instead of white, things like squash, cauliflower or broccoli instead of pasta, and so on. I believe that the Western diet has too much red meat; but many sources of fish are high in mercury, which is one reason I grow my own sushi =)
      </p>
      <p>
       Avoid juice or pop or sugary drinks at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you go grocery shopping the layout of most supermarkets is such that basically, you want to stick to the outside of the supermarket, in the meat and produce areas. When you go down the aisles, you get into the packaged stuff, and you want to avoid packaged stuff as much as possible because it's processed, and that usually means extra sugar and salt.

       Another method to consider is Aeroponics! Rather than submerging the plants in water and incorporating fish into the mix, you can submerge them in air and use a pumo to spray the roots with nutrient solution.

       I'm working on a low pressure setup with a Stanley tote box that can fit 35 2 inch diameter net cups in a 2 sqft area. This setup will be great for small to medium plants, especially herbs.

       I'm interested in this! but I only have so much time, resources, and physical space to experiment with. On a sort of related note, you can pack many more fish in the  same space if you pump massive amounts of air through the water, but my fear has always been that I'll push the limits too far, get a power outage, and in short order have a rather large supply of dead fish which are rapidly becoming extremely smelly. The thought of dealing with such a problem is so alarming, that I prefer to simply keep a lower load; I'm thinking I need to install a second circulation pump that runs off solar, or make the entire system as it is run off solar power. the pumps are only 40 watts, and I really only need two: one to continuously circulate the water, and one on a timer that comes on every few hours and floods the growbeds, so it really wouldn't take much: I need to make the time.

       Hydroponics, Aquaponics, and Aeroponics are all fantastic solutions! I think it boils down to your specific situation on which one you want to go with. I don't have access to a pond or anything like that, nor the land to build one so an indoor aeroponics solution is the route I'm choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your outage scenario, maybe an Uninteruptible Power Supply or UPS could help prevent outage failures. They're used with network servers to ensure they don't immediately shut down during an outage. You could maybe get a cheap 100W panel, hook it up to a UPS for backup and never worry about outages!

       I'm thinking along the same lines. I bought an old cargo van that I'm customizing into a stealth camper; I want to put in solar and batteries so I can run an exhaust fan and lights, and charge stuff from a "house" battery instead of the vehicle battery. So I'm thinking to build that first, and then use similar or the same components to do the greenhouse, with the idea that I can have two fairly small solar grids with swappable parts for troubleshooting etc, and in the winter when I need more power in the greenhouse grid I can just swap in the battery from the van, since I won't be camping in the winter.

       None. Hypothetically there is an "ideal" diet which kills you the slowest. You will die of cancer and toxins no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life evolved to live long enough to reproduce. Full stop. Everything after that is either a bonus, or because it was beneficial to your offspring (aka back to "just good enough to reproduce"). There's a shitload of naturally occurring carcinogens, toxins, etc, in pretty much every naturally occurring thing ever. There is nothing that, at some point, too much won't kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nutritious food" is a buzz word. All "nutrition" can be seperated into micronutrient pills and "nutritionless" macronutrients. If a naturally occurring food is more "nutritional" than a cheeseburger and multivitamins, it's because the multivitamin is missing things and the ratio of macronutrients in the cheeseburger isn't ideal.

       I once chatted with a dude on reddit who was saying he hated cooking and hated going to the supermarket, so he got this genius idea to feed exclusively on soylent (these shakes that are supposed to replace a meal). He was saying his GP strongly recommended against it. He ignored the recommendations and has been on a soylent diet for several years and was feeling ok. Absolute nuts. He surely will pay the price sooner rather than later.

       Absolutely correct, if I assume we're talking about vitamins/etc, the literal definition of which being compounds the human body can't synthesize for itself from baser compounds/elements/macronutrients/etc.That being said, people even with natural foods can live on surprisingly narrow diets. Most of human evolution involved suffering one deficiency or another. Generally speaking, we've identified most of the actually essential micronutrients by identifying when someone is suffering, and determining it was a deficiency. On the flip, there are plenty of organic compounds that 'enhance' natural performance of XYZ but aren't necessarily nutrients.

       I'm skeptical of Vitamins from a bottle, The onlyt good things your body can use that come from a vitamin bottle is anti-oxidents, stuff like Grape Seed, Green Tea extract etc.. Also if you live in a climate with little sun Vitamin D is super important, everything else you can get from eating well balanced healthy diet.

       The safest foods for me are the ones I grow in my garden, everything outside of that has been contaminated with some kind of toxin. I think people overthink it too much, it's simple really avoid all processed foods, it's not real food anyway.

       You should look into the cholesterol scam.   Fraudulent studies have led to improper use of drugs to "correct high cholesterol".

       It is a huge moneymaker for big pharma and it is based on fraudulent science.

       My grandparents generation are one of the healthiest and longest living generations ever. They grew their own vegetables and didn't eat fast food. They ate bread. They've been eating roundup resistant crops and there is no evidence of elevated risk of cancer.

       A healthy diet should be about 80% fruits and veggies. Meat is fine, however red meat should be consumed occasionally only. There is scientific evidence the regular consumption of beef meat can cause colo-rectal cancer. I heard an oncologist recommend not eating beef meat more often than once a fortnight. Beef meat is hard on your digestive system. Eat fish (they say small fishes are healthier because less contaminated with pollutants) and chicken, but it is not necessary to eat it often. Nuts and seeds are good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eat organic and locally grown produce as much as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most important of all, ban all foods with added sugar. All this added sugar is poison. Added sugar is in every processed food. Therefore, if you don't pay attention, your sugar intake can add up real fast. No need to mention you should not even consider soda. Soda is just junk. Leave it on the supermarket shelf. All you ever need to drink is water (well, tea and coffee are also fine).
      </p>
      <p>
       Following such a diet is likely to require adjustments to how you buy groceries. I really suggest you go to your local weekend food market. You buy straight from the farm. Plus you're helping a local farmer, instead of some giant corporation that will use every trick in the book to evade tax.

       Sugar is poisoning us, and that includes refined carbohydrates (pasta, bread, cake, cookies). There was an active disinformation by the sugar industry that started in the 60s to vilify fats, which are actually good for us,
       <em>
        including
       </em>
       trans fats.

       Go vegan. Meat is a carcinogen. Unless you are a baby cow, you don't need milk. You don't drink zebra milk, so why do you drink breast milk from a cow? This is a conspiracy theory Reddit but you can't see through this bullshit? Stop eating chicken periods, too. What sort of bullshit is that? 😂

       For sure -- I now understand the purpose of Scandinavian and Russian saunas. In long winters, you're not going to be moving and sweating adequately, so... saunas!
