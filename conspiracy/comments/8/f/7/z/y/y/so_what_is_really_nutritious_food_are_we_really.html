    <div class="md"><p>The safest way to eat? Natural products (freshly-killed meats/protein, freshly-ripened fruits/veggies, fats such as bone marrow/animal fats/oils)...this is what our ancestors ate and they rarely <strong>ever</strong> had the problems we did. Look at most of us, unfit and most likely under-or-overweight in some way, poorly fed in inadequate nutrition. This is caused by the pesticides, genetic engineering, and hormones that have been intermixed and injected within our foods (at least for the developed/developing world) and a large emphasis on grains. Grains are also naturally harmful to the human gut for reasons I won&#39;t detail here; search for more info on that subject if you want the further details. </p>

<p>Vegans are right about meat giving us cancer but <em>only</em> because of the hormones that they inject within it. Otherwise, meat is pretty beneficial in some ways. Purely-carnivorous dieters will also say similar things about fruits and vegetables; however, as primates we need a more omnivorous diet which includes vegetables and fruits. Anti-carb people will also have a similar distaste for carbs; grains are not good yes, but healthier carb-rich options such as potatoes, rice, taro are highly energy-dense and can pack quite a bit of short-term nutrition in one serving.</p>

<p>Truth is somewhere in the middle, and people have chosen to eat slightly differently under different habitats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans have evolved and persisted because of the fact that they can eat almost anything. Very little things in moderation are actually poison to the human body. There&#39;s a reason people eat like shit and still live to be 50,60,70. The body is amazingly persistent.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the ideal diet? In my opinion, mainly vegetables/leafy greens and meat. Smaller amounts of fruit, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices, dairy such as eggs or cheese. Only water to drink, and unsweetened coffee/tea in moderation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you&#39;ve said, minus the dairy part. Humans really should not be ingesting dairy products. Cows milk is for baby cows, and no one else, really. We lack the proper enzymes to break certain things down within the milk. This is also why human babies ween off their mother&#39;s milk. We lose the enzymes to make it beneficial and properly break it down.</p>

<p>Asia, Africa, American (As in Mayan/Native american/etc) descent will have ancestors who basically never drank milk and thus never adapted the enzymes to process it.</p>

<p>False? We used to lack them and over the last several hundred years developed the enzymes.</p>

<p>Though not everyone.</p>

<p>People who <em>do</em> still inherit the occasional lack of Enzymes, since its a recessive adaptation, do exist.</p>

<p>We have a word for them too.</p>

<p>Lactose Intolerant, and its still common depending on where you live in the world.</p>

<p>But humans are fully able to process milk products and have been able to for hundreds of years. Depends on your ancestry really, the more european it is the better you can process dairy.</p>

<p>Black people and asians, for example, have a much harder time since their lineage didn&#39;t drink nearly as much milk as, say, people of Swedish or Norse descent.</p>

<p>There&#39;s  a lot of &quot;food&quot; at US grocery stores that should never fucking be ingested.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In 1980, Sir Richard Doll and his colleague Richard Peto at Oxford University submitted a landmark review of factors known at the time to affect cancer risk. Doll and Peto pointed out that epidemiological evidence regarding diet and cancer was largely indirect and noted the absence of reliable evidence regarding specific components of diet.</p>

<p>After a lengthy review of various aspects of diet, including over-nutrition, they guesstimated that 35 percent of cancer could be attributed to diet, but their uncertainty was emphasized by an accompanying wide possible range of 10 percent to 70 percent.</p>

<p>Like the attributions for tobacco, Doll and Peto made their estimates by cancer site, indicating that perhaps 90 percent of stomach and colorectal cancers, 50 percent of endometrium, gallbladder, pancreas, and breast cancers, 20 percent of lung, upper aerodigestive, bladder, and cervix cancers, and 10 percent of other cancers may be diet related. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most gains for the least effort: eliminate empty carbs (that means any kind of refined sugar, most bread and all baked treats, and most stuff that comes in a box and goes &quot;crunch&quot;). This single diet change will give the best results - the rest is a matter of tweaking it.</p>

<p>Some people get healthy on meat, others get healthy on plants. Kind of weird, but there it is. Try them and decide. I like both a mix of salad veggies and really good animal protein like fish and eggs.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to intentionally introduce seeds and nuts (quinoa, chia, walnuts, hemp seeds, etc.) to your diet. Not only are they good nutrition, they can also help the carb craving when you stop eating grains and sugar. Fill in your sweet craving with fruit and honey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off - name one successful &quot;vegan&quot; civilization - you cannot, because veganism is not what we are evolved to survive on. So you can throw that one out off the bat.</p>

<p>As for what is nutritious food, well, unless you go to the source and pick it from the jungle or forest yourself, it will be contaminated in SOME ways... you just have to look for products that are LESS contaminated or MORE nutrious - organic fruit and veggies, a bit of meat - nuts, lots of fish (avoid pacific fish, obviously and high mercury fish - go for salmon, sardines... a few others).</p>

<p>Investigate the producer of the food/brand!!! Avoid too much human-created shit like alcohol, bread, pasta, processed meat/cheese (most &quot;american&quot; cheese is literally just rearranged hydrogenated palm oil, not even cheese. Just death.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re watching Sv3ridge or whatever the fuck his name is, he is radical disinfo. You gotta understand that the entire medical system relies on you eating poorly, so keep your guard up and do your own research.</p>

<p>You have two basic choices for healthy eating:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fruit-based -- fresh, raw, organic fruit and vegetables. Graze all you want. (I also add eggs to this, as I feel chickens are a symbiotic species to primitive humans.)</p></li>
<li><p>Include animal protein, but also add fasting to counter-balance. We&#39;re not meant to eat meat 2-3 meals every day. Call it an embarrassment of riches -- it&#39;s not until recently that most people could afford this. We&#39;re not carnivores nor even omnivores; we&#39;re frugivores, like all primates.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then hedge a bit depending on your more recent ancestry. My parents are Scandinavian and German heritage so I add a bit of fish and a lot of potatoes.</p>

<p>Cut out dairy, meat, and grains as much as possible. And no synthetic crap, no soda -- if you can&#39;t look at it and tell what&#39;s in it, don&#39;t eat it.</p>

<p>When I eat clean, I have no offensive body odor. I haven&#39;t worn deodorant for years. (And trust me, I used to stink bad when I ate meat!) If I slip and eat meat or some awful fast food, my pits stink the next day -- so it&#39;s a good indicator of my toxicity level, if you will.</p>

<p>I can recommend books or youtube channels if you like.</p>

<p>But yes we&#39;re being poisoned. The US is a cancer farm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you can go 100% stink free with no deodorant whatsoever -- and one can only imagine what that does for your pheromones. Same deal for morning breath.</p>

<p>Coffee is my vice -- gives me a bit of stink, but a quick wipe with a damp cloth knocks it out for the day. (And since I sleep on my right side, my right pit stinks far more than my left!) Cheap white vinegar is the next step up.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s something important to learn here: Your sweat is a MAJOR way your body expels toxins. Think of your skin as a third kidney. This is one reason why exercise is so important -- your body needs to sweat to expel toxins adequately. (And you need to move your body to move lymph. And increased body heat kills pathogens.) Then you need to shower, or that toxicity will be reabsorbed through your skin, though body hair (esp. pubic and head hair for peak sweat areas) helps prevent this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at the paleo diet, and try to process your food as little as possible. Learn to cook well, so that you can take raw ingredients with little effort and prepare a delicious meal.</p>

<p>Organic is often fraud; but if it <em>is</em> organic, it likely increases your chances of getting parasites. It may be that it is normal or possibly even beneficial to have a certain parasitic load; there are natural ways to cleanse the body and keep things in check.</p>

<p>Learn to grow your own fruits and vegetables; consider aquaponics. I&#39;ve set up a small passive solar grow shelter in my yard, where I grow bullhead catfish, cherry tomatoes, and cucumbers. Fish poo an awful lot, so i set up the system to automatically collect the poo, and I use that to fertilize vertical planters in my yard; I built them out of 50 gallon plastic olive barrels. I can grow 40 plants in the same space a dirt farmer can only grow 5 or 6 plants. I&#39;m growing tomatoes, strawberries, rhubarb, raspberries, chocolate mint, chili peppers, peas, and chamomile tea.</p>

<p>Study the glucose index. Diabetes is an epidemic; it causes you to lose the ability to detect pain in your feet, so people get a cut and don&#39;t notice. It gets infected, and because of the diabetes, the circulation isn&#39;t so good, so then you get gangrene, and they have to cut off your feet. So, you want food that&#39;s low on the glycemic index. Examples are: sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, pumpernickle or rye bread instead of white, wild rice instead of white, things like squash, cauliflower or broccoli instead of pasta, and so on. I believe that the Western diet has too much red meat; but many sources of fish are high in mercury, which is one reason I grow my own sushi =)</p>

<p>Avoid juice or pop or sugary drinks at all costs.</p>

<p>When you go grocery shopping the layout of most supermarkets is such that basically, you want to stick to the outside of the supermarket, in the meat and produce areas. When you go down the aisles, you get into the packaged stuff, and you want to avoid packaged stuff as much as possible because it&#39;s processed, and that usually means extra sugar and salt. </p>

<p>be well,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in this! but I only have so much time, resources, and physical space to experiment with. On a sort of related note, you can pack many more fish in the  same space if you pump massive amounts of air through the water, but my fear has always been that I&#39;ll push the limits too far, get a power outage, and in short order have a rather large supply of dead fish which are rapidly becoming extremely smelly. The thought of dealing with such a problem is so alarming, that I prefer to simply keep a lower load; I&#39;m thinking I need to install a second circulation pump that runs off solar, or make the entire system as it is run off solar power. the pumps are only 40 watts, and I really only need two: one to continuously circulate the water, and one on a timer that comes on every few hours and floods the growbeds, so it really wouldn&#39;t take much: I need to make the time.</p>

<p>For your outage scenario, maybe an Uninteruptible Power Supply or UPS could help prevent outage failures. They&#39;re used with network servers to ensure they don&#39;t immediately shut down during an outage. You could maybe get a cheap 100W panel, hook it up to a UPS for backup and never worry about outages!</p>

So I&#39;m thinking to build that first, and then use similar or the same components to do the greenhouse, with the idea that I can have two fairly small solar grids with swappable parts for troubleshooting etc, and in the winter when I need more power in the greenhouse grid I can just swap in the battery from the van, since I won&#39;t be camping in the winter.</p>

<p>None. Hypothetically there is an &quot;ideal&quot; diet which kills you the slowest. You will die of cancer and toxins no matter what.</p>

<p>Life evolved to live long enough to reproduce. Full stop. Everything after that is either a bonus, or because it was beneficial to your offspring (aka back to &quot;just good enough to reproduce&quot;). There&#39;s a shitload of naturally occurring carcinogens, toxins, etc, in pretty much every naturally occurring thing ever. There is nothing that, at some point, too much won&#39;t kill you.</p>

<p>&quot;Nutritious food&quot; is a buzz word. All &quot;nutrition&quot; can be seperated into micronutrient pills and &quot;nutritionless&quot; macronutrients. If a naturally occurring food is more &quot;nutritional&quot; than a cheeseburger and multivitamins, it&#39;s because the multivitamin is missing things and the ratio of macronutrients in the cheeseburger isn&#39;t ideal.</p>

<p>How is it possible for us to make a pill containing nutritional aspects of that which we are unaware?  Science does not yet have a full grasp of nutrition.

    <div class="md"><p>I once chatted with a dude on reddit who was saying he hated cooking and hated going to the supermarket, so he got this genius idea to feed exclusively on soylent (these shakes that are supposed to replace a meal). He was saying his GP strongly recommended against it. He ignored the recommendations and has been on a soylent diet for several years and was feeling ok. Absolute nuts. He surely will pay the price sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Absolute tripe.</p>

<p>How is it possible for us to make a pill containing nutritional aspects of that which we are unaware? Science does not yet have a full grasp of nutrition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely correct, if I assume we&#39;re talking about vitamins/etc, the literal definition of which being compounds the human body can&#39;t synthesize for itself from baser compounds/elements/macronutrients/etc.That being said, people even with natural foods can live on surprisingly narrow diets. Most of human evolution involved suffering one deficiency or another. Generally speaking, we&#39;ve identified most of the actually essential micronutrients by identifying when someone is suffering, and determining it was a deficiency. On the flip, there are plenty of organic compounds that &#39;enhance&#39; natural performance of XYZ but aren&#39;t necessarily nutrients.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, there are energetic qualities to the foods we eat. A pill containing everything spinach supplies will still not contain the life-energy that fresh spinach does. You can&#39;t put qi into supplements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A healthy diet should be about 80% fruits and veggies. Meat is fine, however red meat should be consumed occasionally only. There is scientific evidence the regular consumption of beef meat can cause colo-rectal cancer. I heard an oncologist recommend not eating beef meat more often than once a fortnight. Beef meat is hard on your digestive system. Eat fish (they say small fishes are healthier because less contaminated with pollutants) and chicken, but it is not necessary to eat it often. Nuts and seeds are good.</p>

<p>Eat organic and locally grown produce as much as you can. </p>

<p>Most important of all, ban all foods with added sugar. All this added sugar is poison. Added sugar is in every processed food. Therefore, if you don&#39;t pay attention, your sugar intake can add up real fast. No need to mention you should not even consider soda. Soda is just junk. Leave it on the supermarket shelf. All you ever need to drink is water (well, tea and coffee are also fine).</p>

<p>Following such a diet is likely to require adjustments to how you buy groceries. I really suggest you go to your local weekend food market. You buy straight from the farm. Plus you&#39;re helping a local farmer, instead of some giant corporation that will use every trick in the book to evade tax.</p>
