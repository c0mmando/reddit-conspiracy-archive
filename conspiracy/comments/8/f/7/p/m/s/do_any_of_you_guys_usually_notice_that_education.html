        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am currently a second-year Construction Engineering student planning to graduate in 2020, and throughout my time at university (and from the general school system) I have noticed that many, if not most in this system tend to:</p>

<p>1) Use education as a &quot;ego-virtue&quot; tool. Great examples of this are &quot;I graduated from engineering school with 3.8 GPA, while you only have a high school diploma/education.&quot; or &quot;You didn&#39;t even graduate high school, what could you possibly know?&quot; They basically use it as an excuse to dismiss others who have differing viewpoints (or may even be correct/not indoctrinated by the system) or who have different life experiences. Generally, those who do this usually will view our &quot;education&quot; as the end-all-be-all of life itself, not being able to open their mind to a non-academic mindset. This &quot;ego-virtue&quot; signaling doesn&#39;t just stop at university level...it extends all the way into the career and business life itself &quot;I started with $100,000 right out of school, you&#39;re obviously not working as hard if you&#39;re only getting $65,000. Get another job, a good car, big house, work/slave 100-hours a week, etc...&quot; </p>

<p>2) Normalize the &quot;dumbing-down&quot; effect of the education system. Now, let me go into more detail on this point. Education (historically) was used as a center for reading religious and secular texts about many of the humanities-based subjects; only the rich could afford education as a means of stating their &quot;superiority&quot; over others (i.e. the lower classes). Even the first university in Mali was based off this system. However, for the past 200 years, university started to become used as a system to pump a more efficient working force mostly based on rote-memorization and complete obedience and people, for the past 100 years, normalized this faulty way of educating the populace. They have made it so that the only way for people to even achieve a middle-class lifestyle was to attend university (now that is changing a bit). The more people normalize this, the more reduction in wages will increase, the more debt-compounded tuition will be, and the more negative things will be overall. Make no mistake however, the education system has always been about trying to categorize people into one class or the other (superior vs inferior).</p>

<p>Out of these two points about the cult of education, I want to specify that <strong>normalization is not a good thing in modern society</strong> and <strong>education has always been about feeling superior, yet recently incorporated more dumbing-down effects within it as well</strong>. What are your opinions about this?</p>

<p>EDIT: Wanted to specify a little bit. I am getting my BS in engineering simply to obtain a better financial future and security as I proceed with my actual dreams on the side (MMA fighting/art). I have always had a &quot;pit of the stomach&quot; feeling about educational systems in general, and I never (nor have I <em>ever</em>) judged or will judge someone&#39;s intellect, capabilities (mental/emotional/physical), or lifestyle based on the education system. I firmly believe that everyone has a dream or a hobby of sorts that they prefer to go with, rather than slave away at this system or participate in any sort of way within it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct in your assumption. However, it is not only the inherent patriotism and severe nationalism present in the US system that corrupts education...but the education system built upon itself (complete obedience/mental and emotional turmoil and tiredness). This is <em>worldwide</em>.</p>

<p>Education just sucks the soul out of people, kids or adults, and it is doing so for me a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Education preps you for working yourself into the ground from the age of 20 or so on until you retire or die of injury. I&#39;ve been working full time for 3 years now and the way they and control over us has made me push myself to the limit without even thinking about it all the time. Older co-workers do things differently. Take it easier on themselves. I&#39;ve started to learn from them but they have instilled it into me and I feel &quot;lazy&quot; whenever I even stop to go to the bathroom </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the exact feeling I get; the feeling of being &quot;lazy&quot; because of the &quot;ego-virtue&quot; signaling that exists within the society and education. I love to push myself when it comes to doing what I love to do, I&#39;ll sacrifice and push myself to no end when it comes to that.</p>

<p>However, the idea that if one takes a break for even a mini-immeasurable amount of time that he is lazy...nope. Because, even if it is something he/she doesn&#39;t want to do, he/she is <strong>still</strong> lazy if stopped for even a second. And this idea came from an ego-stroked society and population.</p>

<p>Luckily, people of this generation (and hopefully the next one as well) are seeing through this silver lining and are deciding not to adopt this society and harmful mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good find!</p>

<p>A lot of teachers that I personally know regret teaching for two main reasons:</p>

<p>1) They are one of the most under-paid and judged positions in society. They deserve <strong>way more respect</strong> than our societies are giving them right now, in both the financial and social sense.</p>

<p>2) They can easily see the negative effect that the system is having on the children...taking away their creativity, increasing mental/emotional tiredness and cloudiness, and many many other effects.</p>

<p>Very ironic how society (and many of the brainwashed people within it) sees education in a &quot;great&quot; light, but fails to give the same importance to teachers and how hard they work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U.S. education system also conditions us and our children not to use critical thinking skills. A person should defer to one in a position of expertise, and unless you have post grad degrees you are not in that position. We have become conditioned to believe we don&#39;t have the skills to analyze problems and create solutions, because we didn&#39;t go to school for &quot;that.&quot; Experts tell us what is happening in the world, what to eat, what medicines to take, etc. because they know better. While I do want a highly qualified neurosurgeon in the event of a tumor, there are some things I can figure out by researching and analyzing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. It&#39;s not only the US education system, though. This is a worldwide phenomenon barring Finland (maybe?) or another extreme example (tribal society, etc...). Critical skills aren&#39;t really taught in the educational system at almost any level (friends in their post-docs and grad school definitely agree with me here), and most of them went to these post-Bachelor&#39;s programs for greater employment opportunities ahead of time or to escape office politics (which is another problem in itself).</p>

<p>Some of my grad school friends even told me that they only receive more information on their subject, and unless they do research themselves, most of the information that they are taught even at the graduate level? Most of it is not researched thoroughly enough, which means that diffusion of knowledge even at graduate level is mostly based upon rote-memorization as well like in undergrad.</p>

<p>Funny how, when someone actually does his/her research or works for a certain amount of time, actually <em>understands</em> the meaning behind how/why/what of the process and not just what the process is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very cool post. I have gotten a bad pit in my stomach feeling about obtaining a degree. I have a two year degree but the debt and the low payoff in my field is extremely unappealing to me. I don&#39;t want to be a salve to the debt anymore than I already am. Basically I am at a crossroads right now. </p>

<p>I feel like people definitely use degrees to brag. It makes people feel better about the fact that they bought into such an illusion.</p>

<p>It really does divide people through classes (middle/upper etc) I also feel like it makes most people only look one way, it keeps them from questioning and they accept what they learn as an absolute truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a structural engineer, let me pose this question to you: would the next building you live/work/ spend time in, be designed by someone with adequate knowledge learnt through classes, or someone who is trying to ‘wing’ the design?</p>

<p>The technical knowledge you learn, is a tool. It doesn’t give you or your life meaning or purpose or stature. Just like your MMA or martial arts classes teach you a tool, or skill. 
No one says one of the above is the only true way to sure success or long productive life with reasonably steady income. But ain’t no one in this world gonna give u a penny unless it has meaning to them to part with it. So yeah. Call it a conspiracy of capitalism or whatever, unless you find a way to make money in this world, life will suck. A degree isn’t the only way, but it’s just that society is willing to pay you till you retire, if you find a use for that degree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ty realise what you say is a load of crap right. It’s so stupid I don’t even know where to begin with. Massive structures have fallen over the ages because no one can make a structure that lasts ‘forever’. Firstly determined ammunition can bring it doesn’t. So your point technically is moot. Secondly. We are less than 100 years Into truly tall skyscrapers. While my history will clearly show I have my doubts about how a building can free fall in such strange circumstances there is enough literature to show they were designed in the late 70s for an accidental hit from small aircraft. NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT AT THE DESIGN STAGE THAT SUCH LARGE PLANES WOULD BE USED AS WEAPONS. Really man, what are you even saying. Are you saying because a couple buildings fell, one shouldn’t trust education?

I think it&#39;s brash to label the entire system as a cult because they don&#39;t force you to think a certain way although I will admit that many colleges do make you take way too many unrelated classes.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course.  I was expecting someone to respond exactly like this.  Some teachers <em>don&#39;t</em> complain about how much they get paid.  And?  What&#39;s your response now?</p>

<p>It appears that you might be somewhat misguided by what the &quot;just doing their jobs&quot; statement should really apply to.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s somebody who&#39;s literally <em>killing</em> another being or causing serious harm to another and they use the &quot;just doing my job&quot; excuse?  Okay.  Sure.  Be critical of that person.</p>

<p>However, there are indeed some occasions when the &quot;just doing my job&quot; statement actually <em>is okay to have</em>.</p>

<p>For example, what do you do?  I mean what&#39;s your job? where do you work? what&#39;s your form of employment?  I can almost guarantee you that whatever it might be, there is almost certainly a manner where <em>you yourself</em> can be shown to be little more than a cog in the wheel supporting the machine of your own enslavement.</p>

<p>And what would be your response to that?</p>

<p>Your response would be in all likelihood:  Fuck, man.  WTF?  I&#39;m just doing my job!  I gotta pay rent/mortgage/car payment, etc, etc.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I&#39;m just doing my job, man.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And, by your own standards, you would be just as worthy of criticism as you&#39;re trying to point out here.</p>

<p>However, I would actually defend you.  Why?  Because I realize that you <em>are</em> just doing your job.  You&#39;re not some sort of &quot;evil creature&quot; that&#39;s supporting all of our enslavement just because you have a job as a school teacher or at Taco Bell or wherever you might work.</p>

<p>Therefore, your &quot;i hate that excuse more than anything.&quot; is, again, a pretty misguided application of that statement and of the true sentiment of its intention.  This is a &quot;pick your battles&quot; scenario, and this isn&#39;t really one that&#39;s very intelligent for you to get into really.  Your response is better suited to more applicable examples - not to, say, being a school teacher.</p>

<p>I own an restaurant.</p>

<p>Yeah.  You’ll just feed them stuff you know is bullshit…or perhaps don’t know, but you’ll certainly feed it to them anyway - all the while advertising it to anyone and everyone as “the best [blah blah blah] in town!”.  Sort of like what teachers do, right?  They advertise what they’re teaching as “the correct way to do things.” - all the while unwittingly peddling shit.</p>

<p>Your restaurant’s not a vegan restaurant, is it?  If it’s not (and I’ll bet a <em>lot</em> it isn’t), one can say you’re actually far, <em>far</em> worse than any school teacher can ever hope to be because you’re actually “a murder peddler that’s advertising to others that they should put your diseased food inside their bodies”.  You’re a distributor of the meat industry which is one of the worst perpetrators of death and violence on the planet.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t and actually am not saying that, by the way (I wouldn’t doubt that your restaurant has some pretty tasty items), but one <em>could</em> say that.  My point is that you just proved what I said above - that you yourself are no different - so don’t put yourself above school teachers, or anyone for that matter.</p>

<p>“Oh.  I’m not like <em>them</em>.  I don’t do <em>that</em>.  I’m different because [blah, blah, blah].”</p>

<p>No.  You’re not different.  Most if not all of us aren’t different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not ignorantly misleading children and stupid adults into their own slavery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  You’re just ignorantly poisoning them by being a whore of the meat industry.</p>

<p>Come on, man.</p>

<p>You <em>reeeeallly</em> have to grow up and open your eyes.  You’re doing it <em>way</em> wrong here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shit they teach in school is pointless, teachers are guilty of not questioning anything and consequently forcing their ignorance on a population that it destroying the planet and causing endless wars due to ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An argument can be made for that.  Sure.  An argument can be made as well, however, that those who are responsible for bowing down to the wishes of the meat industry and companies like Monsanto and the shit they put in even vegetation (to say nothing about animal products) is even more debilitating to the human species than what teachers put in kids&#39; minds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally would never send my kid to school past 5th grade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you’ll feed them shitty products from your shitty restaurant.</p>

<p>Good job.  You’re doing it right.</p>

<p>[but not really]</p>

<p>EDIT:  Sorry to be such an asshole, by the way, but it’s difficult and a little frustrating/upsetting sometimes when I deal with people in glass houses who <em>really</em> shouldn’t be throwing stones.  I’m sure you’re not a bad/horrible person.  I’m not.  Almost none of us are.  I understand your point is about not wanting negative/bad stuff to be coming down over you, your family, or any of the citizenry.  I totally feel the same way.  We/you and I are definitely on the same team - so I don’t want to be fighting w/you or anyone like that.  However, I would be remiss to not point out when it looks like someone is not working with a correct or a balanced perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Correct - at the expense of both human and non-human lives.  <em>All</em> of us are chattel - not just the cows in the slaughter house.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, I am not forcing anyone to eat my food.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t have to.  What you do is already plugged into the fabric of society as something people are already going to move toward and do anyway (i.e. go out to eat).  Those who <em>knowingly</em> peddle harmful things onto others are indeed very culpable.  Yes.  However, many of us (almost all of us in one way or the other, I would say) are entirely ignorant of the true extent toward which many of the things we do bring harm not only onto others around us, but onto ourselves as well.</p>

<p>Many the things that many of us (if not, again, all of us in one way or the other) do unwittingly bear the seeds of our very own undoing.</p>

<p>We don’t have to knowingly force anyone to do anything in order to still be culpable (even if only subconsciously) of spreading the maladies this world is filled with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are forced to consume and repeat mind numbing garbage and if you question it you don&#39;t get your work permit. (degree)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a large extent, this cannot be argued with.  This is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Western culture is backwards world to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t disagree with this.  I don’t feel dissimilar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate how we are labeled &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for questioning anything the education system has presented to us as fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cannot agree more, actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion the worst thing you can do to another human is close their mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>^</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is exactly what our system does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>^</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It presents the information as unquestionable fact, when in reality knowledge and understanding about everything change everyday. And i know its not the teachers fault. They don&#39;t even understand themselves that they are close minded indoctrinated individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  This is correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really don&#39;t think teachers are bad people at all. Western culture is a bad system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boom.  <em>Now</em> you’re talking.  Yes.  Indeed, it actually goes deeper than just Western culture, however.  <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">The pdf of this book</a> presents a formidable and deeply-referenced argument showing that it’s not just Western culture, but much of civilization on this entire planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a destructive materialistic culture we are fed to believe is the peak of human ingenuity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cannot agree more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think teachers need to acknowledge that maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can they when A) most are likely so indoctrinated into the system that they have never bothered to even question it, and B) their very livelihoods, their houses, their cars, their entire financial lives are all dependent upon them <em>not</em> acknowledging the valid points you just made - let alone really and truly questioning them?</p>

<p>Teachers are supposed to be the foundation of education on this planet, yet most are little more than  cogs in a wheel they in no way whatsoever control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe then we would see real change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t disagree, but a seismic, civilizational shift would likely have to happen first before teachers change what they’re doing and how they’re doing it.  Again, they’re just taking orders from others above them - just like almost everyone else is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the end, I guess it all comes down to the Jesuits owning the education systems and media using it as mind control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the Jesuits or some other group, I wouldn’t doubt that this is probably not too far from what the truth might actually be.</p>

Anyone who works in a system that does not attach achievement with financial reward is someone who by nature is docile and not driven by ambition. It’s human nature, coorparations know this. Which is why salesman get commissions when they make a sale. It’s not done out of fairness it is done to drive achievement. When they eliminated naps from kindergarten did the complain? Did they refuse to teach to the test as their administrators require them to? They did exactly what they were told to do. Complained about low pay while working 9-10 months per year.  As a former teacher I can personally attest that teachers in general are some of the most mediocre and easily manipulated group I have ever met. Teachers are responsible too for the mess of public education not just admistrators. They have let their students down on a mass scale in exchange for summers off and winter and spring breaks. </p>

<p>You&#39;re falsely equating ambition with materialism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which is good for his employer, not the customer. Commissioned employees are the most annoying fucking people in the world. They&#39;re aggressive, they lie to you, they try to upsell you past your needs, and their helpfulness comes proportionate to how much they expect you to spend. We have an equivalent to that in the education system, a rewards-tied performance metric only tangentially linked to the consumer experience. It&#39;s called teaching to the test and it&#39;s terrible for students. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize if I was not clear. People are motivated by different things and organizations tailor rewards to attract a work force that emulates the traits that are driven or motivated by those rewards. </p>

<p>Some people are motivated by time off, some with a sense of greater good, some with money, some with public recognitions. . Financial reward is only one way to reward achievement. Years ago teachers and students would earn medals and awards. Another form of reward is done using contests where the reward is not valuable but rather public recognition, (it is often done in sales.) 
Very few people have the luxury of working as a hobby. Most middle and lower class have to work to pay rent right? </p>

<p>Bad salesman are very annoying they are probably not successful, good salesman hide their intentions very well. In fact journalism is a form of sales that hides the financial exchange very well. Online marketing shills use “organic” profiles to seem like regular users to promote and sell. Most people have no idea how manipulative and deceiving sales are. </p>

<p>There is a book called mediocrity rises. Most organizations are controlled by mediocre employees who ensure the achievers don’t get into position of influence. This is studied in a field called organizational psychology.  I think public education works hand in hand with academia to recruit and attract weak minded teachers who value time off. They are more nurturing and non confrontational by nature. It’s really sad because it’s purposely done, it’s not lack of money that keeps salaries down, its how you keep them compliant. </p>

<p>Anyways teachers should be well paid and publicly recognized for their achievement and their students achievements. They would advocate for their students more if they were. In order to attract teachers who are motivated by high achievement, results and strong test scores. Instead people who are attracted to teaching value time off, independence, lack of accountability, nurturing emotional types. A person who chooses teaching is rewarded with a shorter work day, flexible schedule and a lot of time off. Who do you think that will attract? 
Teaching is not even considered a “science” like sociology or psychology yet it relies on psychology, biology, neurology to guide its methods in academia. How can an educator determine if the methods used are valid when they are subordinate to the established sciences? It’s all a cluster fuck and a scam. I have worked at elite private schools and at risk schools. The children had the same potential. The at risk school had more funding but the elitist school was accountable to very successful and highly educated  parents. The poor school was a waste of time, it was a joke.  </p>

<p>As a former teacher, I believe teachers  are complicit and need to be held responsible. If they are not part of the solution they are destroying the future of disadvantaged children. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t talking about sales in general, nor the semantics of it. I was talking specifically about commissioned sales, and commissioned salesmen are annoying as fuck. The mark of a good salesman is the ability to sell people shit they don&#39;t need, which is good for them and their employer but not the customer wasting money. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A shorter work day followed by hours of lesson planning, grading, and in many cases extracurriculars. Flexible schedule? All teachers work just about the same hours in the day. A lot of time off...which is reflected in their pay. Lots of teachers have summer jobs.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually this has been studied and it&#39;s been determined that once you adjust for demographics, public schools perform better than private ones.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m being combative but you&#39;re meandering unproductively and making what I consider illogical leaps.</p>

<p>Teachers are followers? Ok, assuming that&#39;s true, what does that mean in effect? Do they not hold authority over their students? Do they not solve problems in the classroom themselves? Do they not individually tailor their lessons? <em>Should</em> they have full autonomy regarding what they teach?</p>

<p>Mediocrity rises. Ok, how is that relevant? Schools aren&#39;t especially hierarchical. The vast majority of teachers are simply teachers their whole career, equal to all their colleagues except a handful of administrators who are rarely in the classroom. Why point out this natural tendency you&#39;re observing if it applies everywhere as opposed to schools in particular?</p>

<p>Lower salaries keep employees compliant? How, if they have less to lose and comparatively very good job security with strong unions? It&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking about people surviving meal to meal. Teachers have plenty of leeway to speak out, and we see them exercise it all the time.</p>

<p>Mediocre pay attracts the less monetarily driven. Ok, so what? We know what happens when teachers are driven by financial pressures, from test scores-incentivized funding. Schools start teaching to the test and looking for ways to get rid of kids who aren&#39;t performing well. The job becomes a numbers game and education itself is made a secondary concern. Do we want our teachers to be totally driven by their pay?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teachers are responsible for advocating for their students. Unfortunately they don’t have the either the will ( due to low pay, over work, or ignorance) to do it. That is my point. Teacher are not victims of the institution. In fact they love to complain but what have they done? Nothing. A person who is motivated by actual results such as sales numbers or test scores is going to have different drivers than person who is drawn to the field for short work days and summers off. Those are two different motivating factors. Teachers want better pay but they don’t want to be held to performance standards. Sorry.
Teachers are not even qualified or educated to evaluate whether a teaching method is effective. So I am not sure your complaint but teachers are part of the problem and have let the students and taxpayers down. They have mouths and even unions and associations to lobby and demand real change. That is my point: teachers are not victims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A careful analysis of the teacher-student relationship at any level, inside or outside the school, reveals its fundamentally narrative character. This relationship involves a narrating Subject (the teacher) and patient, listening objects (the students). The contents, whether values or empirical dimensions of reality, tend in the process of being narrated to become lifeless and petrified. Education is suffering from narration sickness. The teacher talks about reality as if it were motionless, static, compartmentalized, and predictable. Or else he expounds on a topic completely alien to the existential experience of the students. His task is to &quot;fill&quot; the students with the contents of his narration— contents which are detached from reality, disconnected from the totality that engendered them and could give them significance. Words are emptied of their concreteness and become a hollow, alienated, and alienating verbosity.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Education Major here from Alberta, Canada.</p>

<p>This is referred to in our teachings as the &#39;Hidden Curriculum&#39; and is considered 50% of a child&#39;s education. And its probably not a wholly bad thing.</p>

<p>We call it the &#39;hidden curriculum&#39; because we don&#39;t get checked on it. There&#39;s no tests that students learned these skills, no measurements for it, the hidden curriculum are just natural skills children gain by going to school that have nothing to do with school itself, but instead are skills revolving around being a functional member of society.</p>

<p>Consider some of the following things schools require of students growing up, and ask yourself if you think its a bad or good habit for a growing child:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Punctuality. School has a hard set &#39;start&#39; time every weekday, constantly. This creates a structured framework the child will be used to and models the fact your average adult works a job that requires them to show up to work at specific times everyday and be on time about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Dress code, most schools have some form of dress code, just like jobs do. Teaching children to adhere to dress codes means when they encounter more stringent ones later at a real job, it&#39;s a habit they are already used to.</p></li>
<li><p>Assignments: Like a job, you will be given work to do and a deadline to have it in by. Homework as of late has been abused, Teachers are completely missing the hidden curriculum point of Homework. It&#39;s only job is to just teach a child the ability to follow through on long term goals. Homework should only be total 20~30 minutes of work a night or so, but lots of schools weigh students down with hours and hours of homework a night! Not good!</p></li>
<li><p>Teamwork: About 15% of assignments should be &#39;group projects&#39;, requiring students to work together and learn cooperation, teamwork, and delegation. A well trained teacher should have checks and balances in place so that one student doesn&#39;t end up doing all the work.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Skills: Probably the most important part of the hidden curriculum, school is also the time children spend most of their development alongside peers. Children learn how to talk to each other, socialize, make friends, and a good framework should be established here for each child. Healthy children should have a network of friends to act as a support group of sorts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now here&#39;s the thing I will close with mind you.</p>

<p>Most Schools do <em>not</em> actually execute the hidden curriculum well. Instead of fostering everything above in a healthy way, they instead just focus on rote memorization, enable bullying and bickering, don&#39;t bother fostering teamwork, don&#39;t enable children to self actuate, remove children&#39;s agency, and leave them with nothing but self loathing and a deep sense of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>I have strong opinions about this, if you haven&#39;t realized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re dodging the issue and the simple fact that many people would consider the fact that they aren&#39;t unhappy or miserable due to their lot in life is just about as &quot;happy&quot; as they can get or be about it. It&#39;s also all they know about it in many cases.</p>

<p>But genuinely happy in the sense of being fulfilled or finding meaningful and satisfying things to personally do or participate in that actually brings a smile to their faces and makes them feel good about themselves and their lot in life? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t tell me that the education system that does virtually nothing to encourage that couldn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t play a major role in guiding every individual towards that end.</p>

<p>If the education system was more intent on discovering and encouraging what the individual&#39;s own interests were, interests that they would have been only too &quot;happy&quot; to pursue, then their concept of &quot;happiness&quot; might be more meaningful and in line with what it should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get on the same page here. This is the post you demanded proof to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of these &quot;experts&quot; are paid by the government to hide actual, truth-based researched information and to provide, at least for the public, information that supports the common government agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which I responded with three very well known and documented historical examples of conspiracy to manipulate a wide array of corporate, government, scientific, and media tools in order to deceive the public at the detriment of their own health.</p>

<p>The history of the tobacco industry&#39;s crimes are so well known that the basic myth is part of the public lexicon. If you still don&#39;t know what I am talking about, <a href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf">here is a summation of the internal corporate documents that were released due to litigation</a> that touches on <em>decades</em> of systemic deceit.</p>

<p>If your complaint is &quot;We know better now, therefore nothing matters anymore,&quot; in callous disregard of the millions of people who have been killed by this poison, perhaps you need to be reminded that <a href="https://youtu.be/atjZ173CBlY"><strong>these companies are still allowed to exist, and to peddle these deadly drugs.</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thedrswolfson.com/governments-food-companies-big-pharma-media-healthcare-operators-keep-us-fat-sick/">The food pyramid is an example of the government pushing addictive and unhealthy amounts of sugar on the public starting in the 1980&#39;s</a>.</p>

<p>I see now my OP said <em>trans fats</em> instead of <em>saturated fats</em>, which is another example of the sugar industry manipulating the science to sell their dependency-causing and unhealthy product. Trans fats have their own problems, like the fact that they remain unlabeled as long as they are below a certain threshold, which as you ought to be able to surmise, has a cumulative effect.</p>

<p>Once again, the defense &quot;But we know better now,&quot; still doesn&#39;t cut it as today&#39;s &#39;food plate&#39; diagram still promotes a low fat, high sugar, high carbohydrate diet. Additionally, the incredible amounts of added sugar in the massive variety of bagged, boxed, canned, freeze-dried and <em>massively marketed</em> commercially available &#39;food&#39; product is egregious in it&#39;s dishonesty and it&#39;s risk to public health, and if the government weren&#39;t owned by these corporate interests and instead worked for the benefit of the people whom it governs, then it would be a crime.</p>

<p>These are just three well-known and exposed examples that prove the concept in question. They were massive in scale, they went on in secrecy for many decades before finally being &#39;exposed,&#39; their damage to the greater public health has been so damning that these products remain in the lead for top killers of Americans, <em>and they remain in business, free to sell their deadly products to the public, and to continue to bribe politicians through lobbying</em>. There are many more conspiracies just like these, and many of these manipulations will not exposed for many years, and many may never be exposed. This is the nature of conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My engineering degree helps my math solving skills for sure (and maybe a bit about construction structures), but if I wanted to, I could easily improve those skills on my own.</p>

<p>Also agree with you on the second part! My degree definitely helps me with obtaining immediate job placement and networking is much easier...low GPA with a good internship at my hometown came from my degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medical school is tough for sure, I&#39;d rank it harder than engineering school in terms of rigor. Some of my medical friends hate medical school and are only in it for the end goal of a good-paying medical profession; so much emotional turmoil and unusual self-sacrificing in medical school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it this way. People go where the demand (money) is. How many people do you know went to college for nutritional science or something along those lines. Probably none right? Is it a coincidence that the &quot;science&quot; in that field is all from the 60s and on public record as being heavily influenced by Big Sugar and Big Pharma? Our models of the way our bodies interact with specific componds is extremely archaic and ultimately destroying millions lives for the benefit of the few and the reason for this is because no one wants to become a nutrition major and even if they do they are at the whim of &quot;established&quot; science.</p>
