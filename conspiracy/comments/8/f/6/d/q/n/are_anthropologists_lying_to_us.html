        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find it strange that almost everything an Anthropologist says does not make sense.</p>

<p>I will give three examples.</p>

<p>1.Meganthropus also was known as the Java giant, had an enormous jaw.Early estimates put him at about nine feet tall but now that estimate has been thrown to the garbage.No size estimates yet.It was believed to be an Auspithacene or a close relative of Homo Erectus.Meganthropus jaw reconstruction.<a href="https://rephaim23.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/meganthropus-gigantopithecus.jpg">https://rephaim23.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/meganthropus-gigantopithecus.jpg</a></p>

<p>2.The Denisovan tooth was initially thought to belong to a Cave bear, whose teeth were relatively big in comparison.A Denisovan fingertip bone was beyond scale for either neanderthal OR archaic human. It was also from a female. Denisovan molar teeth are 1.5 times the linear dimension of human teeth, and over 3x the volume. The mandible/maxilla would have to be correspondingly large and deep to accommodate the dentition and dental roots. Masseter muscles would also need to upsize, and of course, zygomatic arches as well, to permit passage and function of the masseters. Crania would need to be robust to handle muscle forces acting from the jaw to the skull. Then, with this large head, we must presume a thick muscular neck to permit safe activity. Postcranially, the extremely robust finger bone assumes large and strong hands, which, if attached to undersized arms- humerus, radius, ulna...would run counter to the science of evolution. Unless you assume that the Denisovans were relatively small Australopithecine-like creatures,...but since there was interbreeding with humans, we must assume that Denisovans were completely or nearly human, at least at the Genus level. Hence, the size of the dentition could not be accounted for by archaic &quot;robustness&quot; of only the masticatory apparatus, but likely the upsizing of the entire creature.Denisovan molar to human molar.<a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-t-181947-200-aozctkopafspeepsmnxdvanvxvihfgbv.jpeg">https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-t-181947-200-aozctkopafspeepsmnxdvanvxvihfgbv.jpeg</a></p>

<p>3.Neanderthals are being portrayed as skinny, humanlike and dumb.Where they had a large braincase, the braincase was considerably larger than ours and they had extremely robust bones.They are being shown like this.<a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQG1wwh4fUF2EghMmwaAhgEHftdyarrLRrdqmY4ICMIB1_dCSKEJQ">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQG1wwh4fUF2EghMmwaAhgEHftdyarrLRrdqmY4ICMIB1_dCSKEJQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are just a few examples of thousands of things besides questionable fossils we cannot comprehend into an academically conservative narrative. Im no archeologist nor anthropologist but as a student of history for a good 7 years I&#39;ve read more than enough primary sources (journals and scanned puctures of short documents written by British scholars and archeologists) that are baffling. Comparative religion, especially ancient mythology, also brings into question lots of dtriking similarities and the frequent mentioning of giants.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If youre into entertaining some alternate histories there are hundreds of theories proposed by various online sources and actual people. Some are inconsistent and were proven to be phonies.. but Ive found Alterwelt to be the most interesting. Out of all the whacky theorists out there he gave me the best impression as realistic and consistent. I suggest you give his threads a read. Its interesting to say the least even if its a hoax, as it deviates from the standard alien occupation theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry bro, but that is not the reality of academia at all. There is a set of beliefs and theories that are simply not allowed to be challenged. These &#39;battling journals&#39; must absolutely stay in the parameters of establishing anthropology or else they are dismissed, mocked and lambasted. Jobs and careers are threatened for stepping outside of this established narrative, and to think otherwise is turning a deaf ear to the testimonials of dozens of anthropologists. Disagreement about a small set of variables is meaningless if the premises are sacrosanct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the idea that Neanderthals are dumb is not consistent with modern anthropology. That&#39;s a relic found in the general public, which is slowly breaking down, but most anthropologists would challenge the idea simply based on the fact that they buried their dead and were artists well-before Homo sapiens. </p>

<p>My point for saying this is that things may not always be as they same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for any study or discipline to actually be considered &quot;a science&quot; it can only postulate strictly <em>physical</em> and purely <em>materialistic</em> answers and explanations for anything that falls under those areas of study or within the fields of those disciplines. </p>

<p>That goes all the way back to the adoption of Newton&#39;s model as the only, exclusive, and unchallengeable one, despite how <em>unscientific</em> that was and which is still in place despite all of the major flaws in Newton&#39;s basic assumptions that have rendered it obsolete. </p>

<p>Given the empirical nature of how science was and still is conducted no new model has been forthcoming for the past 100 years since quantum mechanics disproved and superseded that model because they want and won&#39;t accept any model that won&#39;t still preserve all the years of scientific findings since Newton rather than casting doubt on a great deal of it, which many better and more accurate models, all unfortunately do.</p>

<p>We also have the basic notion that those sciences are &quot;self-correcting&quot;, meaning that any of those answers or explanations, in the absence of anything better, will have to do until something better comes along, no matter how loosey-goosey or implausible they might actually be when it comes to creating and holding certain scientific theories together, like evolution, for instance.</p>

<p>If anyone actually remembers when the Neanderthal DNA was first sequenced, the official verdict was that it was an entirely different species altogether that couldn&#39;t possibly be related to human beings in any way. Not even in our tree, but in one of its very own that ended in extinction.</p>

<p>That caused something of a stir because among the other so-called hominids cited in the case for human evolution the Neanderthal was the one that in most other ways appeared to resemble humans so that strongly suggested the same would apply all of the others that all bore even less of a resemblance than that too. To that we can add the DNA sequencing of the chimpanzee only to find that it is a much younger species than our own meaning that if we and it come from some common ancestor or line of ancestors they has to still exist at the same time as we did to produce the chimpanzee <em>after us</em>, which doesn&#39;t actually make a whole lot of sense.</p>

<p>Within less than a year, however, virtually no further mention of the Neanderthal&#39;s complete incompatibility was made while a slow but steady flow of articles started to appear that all subtly backpedalled on that and continued to speculate about human and Neanderthal interbreeding to account for a very small amount of DNA that we happen to have in common. What they don&#39;t say, however, is that we have similarly small amounts of DNA that we also have in common with plants or that such DNA is most likely connected to a limited number of workable designs for simple and basic components among all kinds of life forms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the idea that Neanderthals are dumb is not consistent with modern anthropology. That&#39;s a relic found in the general public, which is slowly breaking down, but most anthropologists would challenge the idea simply based on the fact that they buried their dead and were artists well-before Homo sapiens. </p>

<p>My point for saying this is that things may not always be as they same. </p>
