       Following the death of Stephen Hawking I had begun to discover all the strange coincidences of his death that really intrigued me. Any help on this theory to really solidify it's possibility is greatly appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a long one so prepare yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, obvious and relatively pointless but interesting nonetheless, he died on international pi day. This has no relevance, it's just one of those coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second is more intriguing, however inconclusive alone, which is that Stephen Hawking died on the same day Albert Einstein was born. Not just that, but they also both died at the age of 76. The odds of them sharing a birth/death date is fairly possible for coincidence (1/365), but the fact that it was not only this only shared occasion but rather the combination of this and them having died at the same age sounds like something that may have been sealed by fate, or maybe a temporal law itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       To delve into the more conspiracy-related aspects, I will now discuss in whole my observations and ideas of what this could lead to:
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that Stephen Hawking did not die, but rather found the solution to time travel that allowed him to transport his consciousness through time and space into another mind, which would be Albert Einstein. This observation began with the knowledge of the coincidence of their death and birth respectively. However,  the reinforcement to this that I had just recently remembered was that of one of the last research papers published by Stephen Hawking, where he discusses how humans have the potential to discover and test the idea of parallel dimensions and time travel. Having been published just four days before his death, this may have been his way of leaving us a final goodbye before he tested whatever conclusion he may have come to following the publication of said research.
      </p>
      <p>
       This brings me to the 'rabbit-hole' portion of my theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Hawking was once actually in a universe where he didn't have ALS, and Albert Einstein had never even existed. He was simply a great mind of the modern age who had still discovered how to travel through time, but never heard of the name Albert Einstein in his life. Rather, he had gone back in time to be born as Albert Einstein so he could continue his research eternally without the obstacle of death to defeat him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once he had traveled through time he created a 'second universe', one where he had transferred his consciousness to a baby being born on the same date he had left universe, as that may have just been a constraint of a law of time itself. From this, Hawking lived his life to continue his research as Albert Einstein, the great mind of the 19th-20th century. He further developed his ideas and formed a better understanding of the universe than he previously knew, which gave more information for the Stephen Hawking of his universe to work with, this being reinforced with how Stephen Hawking had typically worked off of and tried to 'continue' Albert Einstein's findings and studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as would be the rule of time travel that we've encountered many times, the same consciousness would not be able to live in the same universe at the same time. It would be breaking a natural law, resulting in the tearing of the fabric of space-time itself, which is where the fatal aneurysm and ALS originate. Their bodies and consciousnesses existing in the same universe at the same time were trying to cope with each other's duality, as if one consciousness was subject to quantum superposition, or the occurrence when the same particle exists in two different places at the same time. The development of these life threatening illnesses could have been a side effect of the stress put on their two existing forms to want to only exist in one location at the same time. Albert Einstein developed an aneurysm only 6 years after Stephen Hawking had been alive, and Hawking (possibly due to being more of a 'correct figure' in his universe) developed ALS only 15 years later. Both of their bodies endured fatal and incurable illnesses from being separated from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each had been coexistent in life until their time wound down, and our third exploration of a possible law of time constituted that the time put in will be the same time given back. Both had died at the age of 76, being the maximum amount of time Stephen Hawking had put in to his original life before leaving it behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hawking may be alive again as Einstein, somewhere in another reality where he can continue his eternity of research until the end of time itself, further granting each new dimension of humanity into a deeper understanding of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far this is the most conclusive evidence I've found.
      </p>

       both Hawking and Einstein were patsies who did more bad than good in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein = atom bomb (tainted nuear energy)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hawking = locked in physics to half truths discounting important things like quantum entanglement and multidimensionality. He also was part of the partial disclosure NWO psy op.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla, on the other hand, is the real deal. He , like Einstein and Hawking, was a channeler too, although he was more transparent and lucid with it than Einstein and Hawking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dates of birth, death, and age are numerologically significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of numerology when dealing with channeling and cosmic/earth energy should not be underestimated.

       Debatable opinion but I do agree with the last statement. However, I didn't wanna just solidify that all the numbers added up yanno. This is just an out there theory that I genuinely could never have enough evidence to prove 110&amp;#37;. At least not in this timeline.

       hawking was a piece of shit blinded by his own ego even after he was wheelchair-bound. I was glad when he died. He was trying to make people scared of aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet that Hawking and Einsteing were both being used as mediums for the same channeled entity or collective.

       I'll remind everyone of Einstein's greatest claim to fame, namely the ubiquitous E=MC squared, which was hardly an act of genius and more like a bit of algebraic sleight of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were paying attention in your first physics classes you would know the basic equation of e=mv squared and in order to make that a more general and universal proposition a-la Einstein all you would need is a constant for one of the variables to make it one.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Einstein did was to maintain that the ultimate and absolute value for "v" or velocity was "C" the speed of light and that nothing could possibly ever exceed that speed. In short it's a purely Newtonian concept based on the idea that energy is still a property of matter, which is completely false. All matter is merely an expression of quantum energies that are perpetually at work and obviously moving far faster than the phenomena of light that their actions manifest from our perspective.

       Einstein didn't create the atom bomb dude... He came up with Relativity which certainly aided in its proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you base it off that, then every major mathematics skill that was used to craft the atom bomb also taints those creators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Person who invented steel technology? Also tainted because steel was used in the atom bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Person who invented trigonometry shortcuts? Tainted because they used trig to make the atom bomb too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oppenheimer made the atom bomb, and I don't think there is a human being out there who has ever been filled with more regret and sadness from their own creation than Oppenheimer.

       Im pretty sure that Einstein created the monster that led to the atom bomb

      <p>
       "Einstein's answer was always that his only act had been to write to President Roosevelt suggesting that the United States research atomic weapons before the Germans harnessed this deadly technology"

      <p>
       As a channeler and jew, Einstein harbored a lot of negative resentment towards the Nazi's. This was conducive to manifesting the bomb in the form that it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Nikola Tesla's 'death ray' was developed instead, it would have brought about a much more humane end to the war followed by a major era of peace using its deterrent power. Alas, the dumbass dipshit deep state and shadow government buried the technology.

       Nicola Tesla's 'Death Ray' was on the public documents and schematics. You can literally go look at it right now on many websites that recorded his works we have. Pretty sure the original is in some museum somewhere you can look at in person through a glass case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mythbusters used those schematics and built a scale replica following Tesla's instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla's death ray as a machine is nothing compared to, say, an Ak-47 in terms of killing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also its incredibly easy to build one yourself.

       the schematics are not the real ones.

      <p>
       The deep state took the good shit from Tesla when he died. Then the FBI took what was left.

       Do you really think they would publicly release the real death ray schematics online, haha?

       my recommendation to you:
      </p>
      <p>
       do not cite mythbusters + some fake death ray documents then say this sub has turned to shit.
      </p>

       Upvote, because this is some far out there shit, and I love that kind of stuff. That said, I think both Einstein and Hawking were tools of the Materialistic PTB. Same with all the other famous "minds" of Materialism.

       As another user here said: "Tesla was the real deal". 100% this, which is why they shut him down, and stole all of his work. He flew to close to the flame of truth. They continue to slander him to this day, by saying... he fell in love with a bird and was just an insane man.
