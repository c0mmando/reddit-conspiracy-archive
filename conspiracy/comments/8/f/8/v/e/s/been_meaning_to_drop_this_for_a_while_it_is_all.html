<li>Why would John Podesta not want the handkerchief back?</li>
<li>That kind of handkerchief is novelty. Its the sort of thing you either buy as a souvenir on holiday or that is given to you as a present. The handkerchief had enough sentimental value for him to take it away with him on a trip.</li>
<li>Why did the email describe it as &quot;I think it has a map that seems pizza related&quot;? Why does she &quot;think&quot; it has a map. It would be obvious if it did. Why would it &quot;seem&quot; to be pizza related? Pizza is easily identifiable. Pizza restaurants on the other hand can be called anything. Luigi&#39;s, Mario&#39;s, etc. In which case why not say restaurant related or Italian related? She specified pizza but was still unsure?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, it was a conspiracy. now its an open crime everyone knows about. There are endless similarities between other countries. im not saying america is the only country at all. Here in the UK May let off over 90 pedo MPs after accidentally deleting the files. She didn&#39;t want to traumatise the victims by making them give their statements again, so, just pretend nothing ever happened. It&#39;s the same across europe. tragic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys in the UK need to kick out the Tories man just like people in the U.S. need to kick out Dems/Repubs
or get money out of politics.
England has a local election on 3rd May, I&#39;d recommend voting for Corbyn....
He&#39;s your only hope against the establishment.</p>

<p>And the establishment are shitting on him hard with bullshit anti-semitism accusations, including from that fucker Piers Morgan. Corbyn&#39;s not a zionist = anti-semitic to these scum.
This is very recent smearing, like clockwork close the local elections, and repeated smearing no less, no originality.
I&#39;ve read of a British law that enforces more neutral TV/news reporting
during an election campaign cycle....but I guess it doesn&#39;t apply to local elections. :/</p>

<p>Tories/Blairites......Dems/Repubs.....it&#39;s one big club and we ain&#39;t in it.
I hope Corbyn wins and drains the swamp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to be fair, conservative and labour are both awful options.
I used to really love Corbyn, he seems genuine and real but as time has gone on i&#39;ve started to despise the man. I think it started at Glastonbury when he walked out and said to a cheering crowd of hippies &quot;I have a message for Donald Trump! Look over there at that mural! It says &#39;build bridges not walls!!!&#39;&quot; and the mural was on a wall to keep the poor out of Glastonbury. 
He&#39;s currently demanding resignations because there were inhouse targets of ILLEGAL immigrants, which the enforcers didn&#39;t know of, but you need targets to know what you are doing and how well you are doing it. They have now scrapped any idea of targets and presumably just blindly do their work.
He&#39;s a virtue signalling SJW who will destroy the country and let the muslims do as they wish, just like Khan.
I don&#39;t like him anymore. It&#39;s actually a little heartbreaking because for a month or so I genuinely believed he was the saviour this country needed. Now there is nobody.
I like May less. She let the 90+ MP pedo&#39;s walk free after her own incompetence (or competence) ruined the investigation. 
They are both dire and there is no alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, whatever minor beef you have with Corbyn, May is 100X worse. That bitch also imposed state spying in your country (Investigative Powers Bill / Snoopers charter).
Lol now Tories want people to prove they&#39;re 18+ to watch porn. Motherfuckers are like Republicans, interfering with the household.
These evil bastards are worse than SJWs. </p>

<p>And that Cameron pig fucker:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YBumQHPAeU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YBumQHPAeU</a></p>

<p>UK has had Tory bullshit for almost a decade, and Blairite bullshit before that (Tony Blair, 1997 I think).</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t really care if someone criticizes Trump because
we still don&#39;t know for sure if he&#39;s playing 3D chess (weird things happening in 2018) or is just a shill stringing us along (stuff he&#39;s done to Syria). </p>

<p>I think Corbyn has said no one has the ability to put a number on it.....I sort of believe him because lots of desperate immigrants do dangerous things to get to richer countries....hiding in trucks and shit. :/</p>

<p>I feel bad for immigrants, they&#39;re just trying to find a better life, coming from a country with an even worse rigged economy or war. Any left winger who knows what they&#39;re doing only tolerates mass immigration temporarily until the root cause can be fixed: corporate jobs outsourcing (corps moving jobs to poorer countries, where workers work harder for less money, get fed up and move....then people blame immigrants for stealing jobs) and of course warmongers invading countries.</p>

<p>I dislike SJWs too but I think deep down he isn&#39;t really an SJW like Bernie wasn&#39;t. Bernie was like &quot;women want the whole damn dollar!&quot; arguably sounding SJW OR could be interpreted as him trying to impress the SJW women who were frothing at the mouth for psycho Clinton just because she was a women. You gotta play politics my friend, even if you&#39;re honest like Corbyn!</p>

<p>Everything you&#39;ve heard about Corbyn about &quot;destroying the country&quot; sounds like what they said about Trump (not that I trust Trump, just thought Clinton was riskier). </p>

<p>Khan is a center right Blairite shill, slightly better than a full far right Tory shill but yeah I don&#39;t like him either. He wasn&#39;t one of the people who were on Corbyn&#39;s side 100% like McDonnell.
Corbyn&#39;s center left and bringing back real Labour, the party that created the world famous NHS (which Tories/Blairites have fucked to the ground with privatization/profiteering for their rich friends).</p>

<p>This is why truly woke left wingers only tolerate mass immigration: it&#39;s unnecessary and artificially caused by rigged economies and war, due to globalist corporate jobs outsourcing and transnational corporations destroying countries and stealing their resources, deploying puppet leaders (Africa + middle east have long been screwed over by the elite). EU is also screwing over some Euro countries too.
A woke left winger knows mass immigration increases workers in an area, increasing up worker competition (rather than business competition) which drives down wages because people are desperate for a job they work for shit wages. Corbyn doesn&#39;t want that, but he knows it&#39;s impractical to give immigration promises before attacking the root causes.</p>

<p>Also be aware not all muslims are like the ones on TV/wahhabist teaarorists. I&#39;m sure many Brits/Americans have known muslims that are normal (or assholes but not because of their religion or culture, just chance).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have 100% confidence in Corbyn draining the swamp
but we have to try...Tories have destroyed the UK (and Syria.....)
already. Even if Corbyn doesn&#39;t stop warmonger/globalist corporate crap fueling mass immigration, at least you&#39;ll get decent policies.
Tories have really fucked the country with making the NHS less efficient, rigged housing market/increased homelessness, making it more difficult for disabled people to get benefits (thus indirectly causing some suicides sadly), etc. I despise the Tories with great passion as I do the Dems/Repubs.</p>

<p>My friend, things are so rigged in favor of corporations/banksters/elites:</p>

<p>Center right Blairite Miliband (2015 election)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/f4C6w3o.png">https://i.imgur.com/f4C6w3o.png</a></p>

<p>Center left Corbyn (2017 election, hung parliament despite corporate media shitting on Corbyn before the neutral reporting law kicked in late the election campaign cycle)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ubETkq0.png">https://i.imgur.com/ubETkq0.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/LoMl4kW.png">https://i.imgur.com/LoMl4kW.png</a></p>

<p>Corbyn&#39;s bringing back old proper pro-working class Labour!
I think Corbyn is even better than Bernie</p>

    <div class="md"><p>laws can be reversed, mass immigration can&#39;t. it has to end. I can&#39;t believe there is even a debate about ILLEGAL immigrants being deported right now. What is to debate? They are illegal. End of. Yet who keeps defending them? Corbyn. And you want me to vote for that? No chance. And despite all their posturing the tories do nothing either. Everything is stretching to breaking point. Every city is seeing its crime statistics soaring year after year. Yet no one apparently has the common sense to put two and two together. Not only does multiculturalism not work, but if it did it would be the death of culture. I&#39;ll cast my vote for a smaller party with a clear message. And if a candidate was like trump in the UK, putting his own country first, i&#39;d vote for him. Sorry, mate.</p>

<p>No issue with left or right wing, its literally a case of the heart vs the mind. Listen to your heart, be left wing, listen to your mind, be right wing. Neither are strictly wrong in moderation but things have pulled too far in one direction. So far infact that its nearly a crime to be the opposite. It&#39;s a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever man. Extreme right corporate Tories VS center left Corbyn who is smeared by the media all the time....that&#39;s the choice. Small parties like Green get a tiny vote share (esp. as Corbyn is similar to Green party except Corbyn is secretly an EU skeptic).
Do what you want but Corbyn is the way of the heart and mind. Corbyn isn&#39;t far left, but Tories are far right. Even if Corbyn was centrist like Bernie, I&#39;d take that. But it&#39;s your choice, I&#39;m just giving you my honest analysis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Khan is a center right Blairite (Tory-lite) like Blair, Milliband and Brown. Not the same strain as anti-establishment center left Corbyn/original Labour like Clement Atlee&#39;s government that created the NHS (nationalized single payer universal healthcare).</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather Corbyn tries draining the swamp than Tories winning again and consisting of 100% shills. The least bad Tories are probably worse than the worst Blairites.....something like that. Regardless, change is needed. Arguing Corbyn sucks because of Khan is like saying Bernie sucks because wallstreet superPAC warhawk Clinton sucks....they&#39;re of completely different leanings (Clinton does suck but Bernie&#39;s alright).</p>

<p>Drain the partial swamp in Labour (mix of true pro-working class center left and Blairite center right shills), don&#39;t just re-elect the full swamp in Tory (far right shills through and through).</p>

<p>An even more interesting realization though is that the goal of these sex cults is actually to indoctrinate the new members. By the end of their stay, the victims will no longer believe themselves to be victims and will actually end up “initiating” others into the club themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WRT murder or sexual abuse, there&#39;s <em>always</em> a victim. By definition.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to argue that a body isn&#39;t necessary, that&#39;s true, but a victim still needs to <em>exist</em>. If there is no body, investigators can rely on evidence that a crime took place (e.g. missing person&#39;s blood all over their house, video footage of someone taking a missing person, insurance beneficiaries living the life after their loved one&#39;s unexpected death, etc).</p>

<p>Pizzagate has presented absolutely zero evidence that supports the conclusion that a victim even <em>exists</em>. That&#39;s why pizzagater proponents have to come out with these wacky pepperoni analogies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I was able to dig up a thread that linked to the Arizona Human Trafficking Awareness website. In one of the pages, it lists terms like &quot;cheese pizza&quot; in a chat room screen shot example, as a code word used by pedophiles. There&#39;s actually a decent amount of information in that thread.</p>

<p><a href="https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5zff0m/chat_room_examples_on_azs_sex_trafficking/?st=JGI3JOI3&amp;amp;sh=937edb24">https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5zff0m/chat_room_examples_on_azs_sex_trafficking/?st=JGI3JOI3&amp;amp;sh=937edb24</a></p>

<p>I also found this video from DHS regarding human trafficking awareness, and they display a pizza parlor as one of their examples. Not related to the code word question, but I found it interesting that this link of &quot;pizza&quot; and human trafficking is reflected even in DHS videos. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PNkl4B7rvHY">https://youtu.be/PNkl4B7rvHY</a></p>

<p>With all the evidence OP provided, and all of the evidence I&#39;m sharing in the comments, does any of this <em>really</em> not paint a curious picture for you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You accused me of saying:  &quot;anyone who questions pizzagate should be banned.&quot; That was a lie. You are a liar. In order to poison the well on accusations of lying, you told this lie:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I never lied about what you said. You lied about what I said. Once again, proving you are a liar.</p>

<p>You were asked to provide a quote supporting your accusation. Instead of doing so or even <em>attempting</em> to justify your claim, you are now changing the subject and telling refuted lies like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The code words for pizza comes from some teenager on 4chan.</p>

<p>That is false, as has already been demonstrated to you:</p>

<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/23/man-busted-for-child-porn-after-cheese-pizza-craigslist-post/">https://nypost.com/2017/10/23/man-busted-for-child-porn-after-cheese-pizza-craigslist-post/</a></p>

<p>You ignored this evidence, and continued to return to your false claims that there is no evidence. That is a known disinformation tactic, and you have used several of thse.</p>

<p>So, you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Repeatedly lie</li>
<li>Continue to use disinformation tactics like ignoring evidence presented, changing the subject, and fabricating evidence</li>
<li>Double down on dishonesty and disruption when given an opportunity to be civil and stop trolling</li>
<li>Repeat the same talking points claiming &quot;no evidence&quot; &quot;all lies,&quot; even when presented with evidence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your claim of &quot;no evidence&quot; in response to evidence is incapable of being true. The best argument you could possibly make is that the evidence doesn&#39;t prove the claim. In other words, that&#39;s another lie you&#39;ve been caught in.</p>

<p>when he specifically asked for the FBI comments on &quot;pizza&quot;, not &quot;cheese pizza&quot;.   These are not the same things.  </p>

<p>No, you did not. You are asking the same tired questions that other forum disruptors ask <em>every time pizzagate comes up.</em> When they are answered, you claim they were not answered or change the subject. These are well-known tactics of <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">forum disruptors</a>, which is why you have been removed from the discussion.</p>

<p>I completely support this decision.</p>

<p><a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">Associate opponent charges with old news</a>. A derivative of the straw man — usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with – a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues — so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source.</p>

<p>Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.</p>

<p>Not at all. I was on this sub from the very beginning and that was always talked about. People were posting videos of the &quot;basement.&quot; There were videos of little kids screaming in the Comet basement (not that anyone could prove it was in fact Comet&#39;s basement or the videos weren&#39;t just music videos/weird art projects/fakes). </p>

<p>The &quot;Illuminati&quot; does exist, in the sense that secret societies do exist, which contain powerful members, who have their own plans for this world. Unfortunately, you subject yourself to a plethora of disinformation when you research these subjects, and the Illuminati especially, with the words of Leo Taxil, William Guy Carr, etc. still alive and well. But for our purposes, the &quot;Illuminati&quot; definitely exists. The symbolism you refer to is all intertwined. Most of it can be traced back to Babylon. It&#39;s Kabbalah. It&#39;s left hand path. A symbol itself is originally meaningless, but ascribe it some purpose and it becomes an invaluable form of communication that can be hidden in plain sight. Rituals (performances) become a way to subliminally alter the consciousness of the masses. That&#39;s what magick is. This is Aleister Crowley type shit.</p>

<p>Watch this, for example, and tell me what you see:</p>

<p>Art I don&#39;t like? It&#39;s children being fucking abused! Do you like it?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say many victims exist. Do we have to have recent victims? Because there are books written by some survivors that i&#39;m sure you know exist. The other thing is many victims can be groomed to become just the same as their predators and then not see themselves as victims. Survivors or statements could be wiped by elite or bribed. There are many reasons. </p>

<p>It was shut down because idiots on the sub thought it was okay to invade people&#39;s privacy, which is very much against the site&#39;s rules.</p>

<p>Which of Podesta&#39;s arts show children being abused? If they did, is it sexual, or is it designed to invoke emotions? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are no &quot;survivors&quot; of Pizzagate, because there have never been any victims. You can&#39;t say that there are victims if you can&#39;t prove it, and you can&#39;t prove it by saying &quot;there&#39;s plenty of reasons for there to be no one to speak out.&quot; That&#39;s a cop out answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.&quot; </p>

<p>Yes, because doxxing was rampant and the mods did nothing to stop it (and were complicit).</p>

<p>He does not have any art of the sort. As far as I&#39;m aware, that&#39;s a blatant lie.</p>

<p>There are zero victims of Pizzagate that have ever come forward. Epstein and Weiner have nothing to do with Comet Ping Pong and Podesta. Why would you even bother bringing them up?</p>

<p>i said he hosted it. as a gallery. his own isn&#39;t much better. children tied to chairs in empty swimming pools, girls dead in ponds and fields. Can you not answer the question of if you like his art? It&#39;s one question. I&#39;ve answered plenty. Do you like his art? </p>

<p>Pizzagate is more than a fucking pizza shop. It&#39;s political elites abusing children. They are involved. They were convicted. Don&#39;t narrow it down to one shop. It&#39;s bigger than that. It&#39;s the people, not a building, that i care about when i say pizzagate. And what everyone else means too except the MSM.</p>

<p>As with most of these emails, there isn&#39;t anything conclusive to incriminate
anyone, they&#39;re just weird. This is the starting point that got people to look deeper. This is circumstantial evidence - no one example will convince you, and I suggest you go through everything before coming to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Yes, because doxxing was rampant and the mods did nothing to stop it (and were complicit).</p>

<p>He does not have any art of the sort. As far as I&#39;m aware, that&#39;s a blatant lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are victims who have literally wrote fucking books about it. I said that. OK? Or is there a timeline that it must have happened within the pizzagate timeframe? Some involved are literally behind bars for pedophilia. Epstein and Weiner. Do their victims count?</p>

<p>There are zero victims of Pizzagate that have ever come forward. Epstein and Weiner have nothing to do with Comet Ping Pong and Podesta. Why would you even bother bringing them up?</p>
