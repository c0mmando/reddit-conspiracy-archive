        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Loud_Volume.html">Loud_Volume</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, let me say, that I have not slept the past 2 days and am not even on drugs. I just ate a little kief, instead of burning it. Alright so let&#39;s start.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s been a pretty big cluster fuck so I&#39;ll just keep it simple instead.</p>

<p>Our human species has been purposely trapped in a low state of fear and consciousness. While &quot;satan&quot; in the sense of some &quot;mega demon&quot; does not exist, there are lower frequencies of energy that can effect us, rob us, bring us down, drag us down, and trap us in a state of fear which therefore makes us create our reality around us, from a state of fear.</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

<p>Everywhere around you, you are told, screamed at, pushed, punched, torn up, thrown away, and told you are useless. Why do you allow this to happen to you! Stand up! Stand UP WITH ME! I PUT IN MY TWO WEEKS AT WORK THIS WEEK AND HAVE NOT SLEPT SINCE. I FEEL ALIVE. I FEEL ENERGETIC. I FEEL SO FUCKING LIGHT AND FLUFFY.</p>

<p>I will not stop and the fear will not drag me back into this stupid RAT RACE we have been supporting.</p>

<p>I can support myself.</p>

<p>You know what I am going to do?</p>

<p>I am going to clean the earth, and live by doing that.</p>

<p>If leeches, parasites, negative energy, can drain us of our life force and rape and pillage this planet and our bodies in the name of greed, selfishness, etc and grow and grow and continue to grow until this whole planet is consumed and there is NO FUCKING MONEY LEFT BECAUSE ALL RESOURCES WILL BE GONE JESUS FUCK WAKE THE HELL UP. TECHNOLOGY IS SUPPRESSED. MEDICAL HEALTH AND FREEDOM IS SUPPRESSED. SOCIETAL AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS ARE SUPPRESSED IN THE NAME OF PROFITS, POWER, CONTROL, DIVISION, FUCK WHY DID WE DO THIS TO OURSELVES.</p>

<p>Guess what though?</p>

<p>It&#39;s changing. And it starts with one. Because we are all one. So if you make the conscious choice to stop taking abuse and take your power back, everyone around you will see what you&#39;re doing, see your power, see your confidence, and ultimately SEE YOUR LIGHT LIFE FORCE.</p>

<p>CLAIM YOUR LIFE, CLAIM YOUR POWER, CLAIM OUR PLANET EARTH FOR THE HUMAN BEING THAT DESERVES TO LIVE HERE ON THIS GORGEOUS PLANET!</p>

<p>I fucking hate typing in caps lock BUT PLEASE JUST LISTEN. PLEASE.</p>

<p>DO NOT ABANDON YOUR BROTHERS. YOUR SISTERS. WE ARE ALL ONE, HELP EACH OTHER, DON&#39;T HURT EACH OTHER. GROW. LOVE. EVOLVE. STOP HOARDING. STOP HIDING. STOP RUNNING. SHARE. OPEN. INVITE. WELCOME. IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY LIVE OTHERWISE YOU WILL DESTROY THIS GORGEOUS PLANET FOR THE THIRD TIME.</p>

<p>lemuria and atlantis was enough, and whoever else and whatever societies had to die and collapse and break down. It is time we make this leap as a species once and for all AND OWN IT. And hold each others hands, and not mock that, or attack it. That is weakness. Light is strength. Light is power. Love is love. Love is power. Reclaim that power and stop having a leech such that power out of you.</p>

<p>Reclaim it, grow, heal, AND FIX YOUR DIET. Even our food is controlled, and AVOID CORPORATIONS. AVOID CORPORATE &quot;CHAIN LADDERS&quot; AND &quot;CHAINS OF COMMAND&quot; You are your own command. Stop waiting for someone above you to tell you what to do.</p>

<p>Do it yourself.</p>

<p>AND LIVE</p>

<p>AND LOVE</p>

<p>AND BE</p>

<p>This is how we were meant to be.</p>

<p>Come on guys, COME THE FUCK ON. WE CAN DO THIS</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just made a note of this. Not only that, but it&#39;s out of character with their history. It might be their first break. Look at their postings the past two days versus before that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a change in frequency and coherency. Here they&#39;re out there on a topic, but they&#39;re also replying random stuff to people in other forums that are complete non-sequitors. I am worried they might hurt themselves or others due to their current idea that &quot;death doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;*</p>

<p>*Not that I disagree completely, but that&#39;s a dangerous belief for someone having a psychotic break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to see if there was info in his posts. He has been posting non-stop the past two days, and it&#39;s just been getting worse.</p>

<p>He mentioned previously being suicidal, but I don&#39;t see any notion that he is now.</p>

<p>He mentions a girlfriend returning soon, so maybe she will recognize the change in behavior ... or maybe he might behave badly towards her.</p>

<p>I think many have mentioned he should get help in direct or more smartly manipulative ways (won&#39;t blow their cover.)</p>

<p>If you have time to look through his posts for info or contact info, that could help.</p>

<p>99% of people have &quot;People&quot; as their most used word on reddit, with the next most frequently used word being used 1/2 to 1/4 as frequently as &quot;People&quot;</p>

<p>OP&#39;s most frequently used word is still &quot;People,&quot; but they say &quot;time,&quot; &quot;world,&quot; &quot;earth,&quot; &quot;light,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; each almost as frequently as &quot;people.&quot; I have never seen word usage anything like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Water is really hard on an empty stomach. Do you have a banana? If you cannot eat the banana, mash it up with some water, and drink/eat it that way. Licorice tea is also helpful depending on your constitution. But really, I recommend you eat a banana. Whatever you do try to consume, have just a little tiny bit, and wait at least a few minutes before you have anymore. With liquids, hold them in your mouth untill they are body temperature. You’re dehydrated, you can take in some liquid through your mucous membranes. Take a bath if you can. I have 40 years of being someone who can throw up straight for three days at the perverbal drop of a hat.  Take a bath, eat a banana, get some sleep. I think you’re awesome and right about a lot of stuff. Thanks for being on the planet, try and stay with us long term.</p>

<p>And as far as overstepping my authority, I feel plenty justified in banning someone from a particular thread. The user in question broke rule 4 in multiple comments, and I would have been justified in giving them a sub-wide temp ban; banning from this one thread alone was a less forceful mod action than a full ban, not more forceful.</p>

<p>In less than 30 years, Hispanics will be the majority in the US.

People in 3d world countries have little to no money so they fight over land and water and food.  The US is doing ok because we have agreed as a people to a set of norms to dictacte our conduct.    If you want people to step into the &quot;light&quot; that&#39;s nice but it&#39;s not realistic.  How do you get by everyday?  How do you keep people from taking what you worked to gather or hunt?

    <div class="md"><p>I just read the rest of your comments and while I disagree with with you 99.9999%, you are right about one thing: Hispanics are a problem. How do I know? I am one.</p>

<p>I have been living here for four years and I don&#39;t understand why someone would come to America just to live off the government. When I decided to come to this country, the plan was (and still is) to help push the economy train, not to get a free ride on it. Yet all these motherfuckers come, get all their benefits from the government and do not move a finger to improve themselves, let alone society. They just come and pop babies for a welfare check and cheap housing. There is absolutely no drive to progress other than getting everything for free and it bothers me to no end.</p>

<p>So when I see someone being critical of Hispanics I just shut up because they happen to be 100% right. Things would be so much different if Hispanics just came to progress without bothering anyone else.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I elaborate this little, please feel free to ask for any clarification.</p>

<p>Most cheap plastic bottled &quot;syrup&quot; is a fake chemical additive used to save money for the corporation selling you the poison. See the irony?</p>

<p>You get what you pay for.</p>

<p>You ever wonder why real maple syrup costs 15-25$? Because it&#39;s healthier for you than that fake garbage they&#39;ve been selling us </p>

<p>For me, sugar and fake syrup destroys my body, I can&#39;t do it anymore. I am learning to word things properly so I don&#39;t infringe or appear to be attacking others. Apologies if I came across that way</p>

<p>Just my own body can&#39;t do the fake stuff anymore with high fructose corn syrup let alone sugar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more expensive because it&#39;s harvested from tree sap from specific trees which only grow in certain parts of the world and only produce the proper sap in specific climatic conditions. The sap is boiled to 1/40th it&#39;s original volume, so you need a lot of trees and labour to make it a viable enterprise</p>

<p>Garbage synthetic stuff can be made in a factory. The &quot;chemicals&quot; are mostly just synthetic flavours that attempt to mimic the naturally occurring compounds in maple sap. They do a terrible job at mimicking the natural stuff because they only bothered to synthesize a tiny percentage of the compounds only found in real maple syrup. </p>

<p>People are cheap or poor and if they live in North America they probably have positive cultural memories regarding maple syrup that they naively believe can be recreated through synthetic garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family lived and still live in a rural mountain area where one house is separated from another one for miles and miles and hills. Some times, the people visit the “local” town which is very small too. They don’t buy anything but they do sell why they cultivate and harvest for almost nothing. The children don’t go to school because to them it is a waste of time. They have no access to electricity except in the local town which I’m not sure whether the town has running water or ways to dispose of their waste. People take a shit in the bushes and it is normal to them. They speak a language my parents never taught me but who speak it very well especially when angry. What I’m trying to say is there are places around the world where people live off the grid. When I first visited the town it had maybe 300 people at most or way less. There were other towns on the way leading to the cities and then to the capital. I was amazed to think I could have probably lived there if my parent stayed there. I tried to think I could live there and as vacation it is beautiful. Rivers with plenty fish close by which no one hunts therefore it is plentiful. Animals for hunting to eat only. However, eventually I came back to the United States and while I really think of going back since I’m single. I don’t believe I’ll find a woman who would like to live there. Some women I dated wanted to visit but that all it was to them: a visit. I don’t know much about all of you but i need me a woman to live happy.  It is in my genes and watching my parents work hard and happy together.  </p>

<p>Chemical &quot;drugs&quot; are horrible for the body and slow you down</p>

<p>Real cures are found in the world around us and not made by a machine or whatever else profit sucking motive exists to derive pleasure/value out of your essence of being.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using this definition as a resource, yes. But my own definition of marijuana, and by extension, kief is still a drug. Trust me, I have plenty of experience with it, and it is great as a medicine, don&#39;t get me wrong. But it has it&#39;s downsides too. Chronic use noticably changed me to become a worse person than I am now that I&#39;ve quit. It was all that I thought about. When is the next time I&#39;ll get to smoke? How much money do I need to set aside to buy more? I&#39;d even have dreams regularly where I would do nothing but smoke. That isn&#39;t healthy. </p>

Eating the powder from ground cannabis is not helping your health in any measurable way because any active ingredient is either not being activated (due to not decarboxylating) or in such trace amounts that it wouldn&#39;t even be considered a microdose.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t stay up past 3 days, sleep is very important to your brains ability to function and solve problems correctly, not bashing you in anyway but if you fuck around too much you could have a psychosis and that would land you in a mental ward eating real “drugs” for the rest of ya days. I’m glad you’re waking up as more and more are these days, I suggest lots of research in hyper normalization because you are correct in saying there is an oppressive force keeping us at bay, but what often gets over looked is the fact that there is an equal force pushing us up and helping  those like yourself wake up, you can only see these things when you are yourself ready, as they say “you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eating kief is not going to do anything for you in terms of having psychoactive effects. Although some studies have shown that it does have some anti inflammatory effects. THC-A is not converted to the psychoactive form (THC) until it is decarboxylated. That requires it to be heated past 220 degrees Fahrenheit (hence why weed is smoked or THC is baked into brownies). So if you were going for any psychoactive effects but aren’t comfortable breathing in any smoke, SWIM would recommend looking into how to make THC edibles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never used meth but I had a good friend get sucked into it. He was on it once and I saw his aura</p>

<p>That was the first time I had ever seen an aura and honestly it kind of scared me.</p>

<p>I had to cut him out of my life as he had toxic behaviors and just wanted to keep using me.</p>

<p>Whatever, I&#39;m free. Never used meth. The worst I got to was &quot;blues&quot; which is an opiate of some kind. Fucked me up badly....... So badly. Scared the hell out of me. Good god. Never again will I abuse my body like that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already have help... Where else would I possibly go for help besides within?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t go to a physical hospital for a spiritual problem dude.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been treating spirituality sickness with physical tools of destruction that have no basis in light or love. Just intrusive body procedures that scar and traumatized the soul body mind complex and kind of isolated the connection tether to the divine</p>

<p>You may or may not understand what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>What you do with it is up to you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m free. And for once. I&#39;m going to stay at home. Relax. Fuck cleaning, maybe in a few days maybe but not now. Already showered and have some trusty clean coconut juice (pure, unpasteurized) </p>

<p>Gonna enjoy myself now. If I wanna go outside I can but most of the time I don&#39;t want to because I love my space and the power I have (cough we all have yet many don&#39;t see, but many will see now)</p>

<p>When I&#39;m in my element which is my cocoon.</p>

<p>Which is why that spider lived for over 40 years because he had a safety net and didn&#39;t have to leave it in search of food which expends energy.</p>

<p>This whole system of enslabement was one big dance with the darkness and the light is finally filtering and flickering in</p>

<p>Which is why I was finally allowed and gifted the opportunity to finally see a moving UFO free of control and it had its own movement and it shine so much light everywhere it was gorgeous. I saw all I needed to see and then we left in peace. Most amazing moment of my life. Wish you were there wig me, brother </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried that in the past and then wound up in the psych ward.. With a doctor screaming at me with his arms folded wondering what drugs I was on.</p>

<p>This is why I can&#39;t wonder out into the world when I&#39;m like this because people get afraid and think I&#39;m on something or acting crazy or whatever</p>

<p>Priests and monks would have given me a lot of help but if I wondered out of the house I may have gotten lost on my way to find a priest for spiritual help and I could have been picked up by police and forced into the hospital mental health room... I don&#39;t want that. So I just stayed home and didn&#39;t let the fear take over and then I finally got some much needed rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel ya. I, too, have recently started staying up for days at a time with no drugs and no real reason other than I&#39;m not tired. The first time I did this I broke through my creative block and now my creativity just flows out of me. That&#39;s a huge deal for me me because I hadn&#39;t written anything at all in over 10 years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just that, but I feel more spiritual and connected to everything. I feel like just a better person overall, and even restarted my home business and it&#39;s doing well. I feel the best I&#39;ve felt in a long time, yet all I hear is that I&#39;m an idiot for not getting enough sleep. I smile anyway.</p>

<p>Some people don&#39;t understand that what works for them may not work for everybody. I just happen to be a person that becomes highly functional and more importantly, happier, when I&#39;m awake for days at a time.</p>

<p>I think the takeaway here should be do what makes YOU feel happy. We are all on the same journey but with millions of unique paths. </p>

<p>Maybe I can write for truth now instead of &quot;freedom&quot;</p>

<p>Not really sure why I brought that through I thought freedom was truth.</p>

<p>I think this is called intuitive writing. Is this what you helped to express creativity? Wish I had opened this door sooner because this is life, and love, not force, which is great.</p>

<p>Chronic use for years, no longer, I&#39;m free of constant bong rips and needing to smoke. Step into a higher light and see that not everything has to be used how it has always been used.</p>

<p>New ways are not fearful. Go eat a nug of weed and see how you feel compared to combusting and killing that life force then inhaling death </p>

<p>You think I&#39;m lying because you feel fear in your stomach</p>

The feeling could fade quickly, or over time, or stay with you for a extended period, or permanently change your mind/thinking. The experience did happen. What value/meaning you take from it is up to you.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It&#39;s more like a matrix of time/space and space/time enmeshed. From the perspective of before birth and after death, we are all simultaneous with all of our lives. But it&#39;s not directly controlled as a weapon though, as far as I know. Unless.... well, according to the Books of Enoch, there was a time before there was a moon, before seasons and before the earth&#39;s magnetic axis was tilted. And then we get into the whole western hemisphere following solar calendar, and eastern hemisphere following lunar calendar thing.. AND the fact that one of the first popes in the Roman Catholic church changed the calendar.</p>

<p>Yeah, the Divine Feminine is currently way out of balance here on Gaia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now, humanity needs to be more connected to the Divine Feminine energy. We have been living with patriarchal distortions for far too long. Brainwashed into thinking Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Well helloooooo that ghost is the ghost of the Divine Feminine. Cuz they killed her lol... My point is that the reality of the Trinity of mind/body/spirit is reflected in Divine Masculine, Divine Feminine, and Unity. (or Father, Mother, Son). This has been deliberately hidden.</p>

<p>What can you do? It begins within the self. Your own masculine and feminine energies must be balanced. You may still carry some distortions from the societal pressures around us. Realize that every man has an inner woman and every woman has an inner man. They are called the Anima, and the Animus, respectfully. Then, get yourself in balance by connecting to your opposite energy. There is a tarot card that may be of use here, the &quot;Lovers&quot; card. This process of the spiritual inner-marriage is an entire process unto itself and cannot be rushed. The love and wholeness you will discover within yourself is the love of the soulmate. It is self-sustaining, and then you can be of greater service to others.</p>

<p>After that, the next step would be to empower the women that we are connected to in our lives, to connect to Gaia&#39;s energy body (we all must make this connection eventually. Most of us are literally <strong>not plugged in</strong>), and to channel the Divine Feminine energy into our societal structure in order to achieve healthy transformation. The unhealthy form of this process is feminism.</p>

<p>It is not an easy task. Humanity is greatly out of balance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are taught &#39;reading comprehension&#39; in school, to read the words &amp; sentences and to understand what the words and sentences are saying.  I always did poorly in reading comprehension.  I had trouble, and still do have trouble, understanding the meaning of the words and sentences.  When I read words and sentences I focus on the &#39;meta&#39; (i.e., what&#39;s behind) of it all.  I analyze the words and sentences, trying to get my head around the passion or hate of the writer.  It isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t also try to grasp the intent behind the words and sentences, but that I am also searching in them for other things of value in them.  One won&#39;t find these things in what others write unless one looks for them.  One won&#39;t find what the writer feels and what the writer fully wishes to convey unless one looks behind (beyond) the words and sentences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the actual fuck is going on in this thread? This guy is literally exhibiting every symptom of a manic episode. Like there&#39;s no question that he&#39;s in the midst of one. And people on here are encouraging him? I had to scroll really far down the thread to find the first mention of mania. This guy needs sleep, he needs some food, and he needs to get his mania treated before he does more damage to himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! I will add that in addition to the disappointing harvests of the first and second cycle on Gaia (Lemuria and Atlantis, respectively), we have not experienced satsfying harvests on Maldek and Mars&#39; third density cycles. (Mars experiencing atmospheric dissolution and Maldek experiencing complete planetary destruction)</p>

<p>Almost all of the positive forces in this galaxy are focused on increasing the harvest on Gaia at this time. Who knows what will happen, but my every hope and prayer is that we will see a significant portion of positive graduation, with minimal third density repeats this time around.</p>

<p>A psychotic break doesn&#39;t mean you will be insane for good, but you are not in your right mind right now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just what you are posting, but how different what you are posting is from what you have been posting. I went through your reddit posts, and you can see a clear downward progression over the past two days. You are getting worse, but you can get better.</p>

<p>You can get temporary medication to help you relax and sleep. From there you will have people to talk to. You can learn coping mechanisms.</p>

<p>Please get help and do not hurt yourself or others.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re so worried about losing your kief collection try this</p>

<p>Access your kief collection </p>

<p>Find the tool that allows you to pick up 1 molecule of kief/THC</p>

<p>Ingest that 1 molecule</p>

<p>....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is really hard for me to feel enthusiasm when I see people awake like this. I&#39;m not going to be condescending about it because it is a good thing for them and ultimately humanity and I am grateful if not worried for you, OP.</p>

<p>It reminds me of my first ironically manic episodes of these types of discoveries and how the first thing I needed to do was share it with any person I could and I shared it in a very similar manner, chaotic that is.</p>

<p>It took me many years to realize that sharing this type of knowledge in such a chaotic and animated fashion actually pushes you away from your objective of enlightening others. People just simply don&#39;t converse in that manner regardless of how useful or true your information is. You&#39;ll eventually (hopefully after you get some sleep) be able to do that or you&#39;ll not see the results you are so passionate about.</p>

<p>Time and time again people that awaken have this untouchable confidence that is very susceptible to being crushed, especially when they have no source of income or way to persevere the war on our minds and bodies (do not underestimate the hardships that are coming for you). The discovery of this knowledge has been fashioned in such a way that the more enthusiastic you get about bracing it and sharing it, the more susceptible you are to the negative feelings that will come with the disappointment when you realize that things aren&#39;t getting fixed anytime soon, or that you will have to watch loved ones, friends, and family fall to the system, or struggle on every level to just survive outside of the system or to survive within in when every ounce of you is avidly at war with it.</p>

<p>They know this as much as I and others here do and they are waiting for you to buckle under the pressure and you feel untouchable right now but this is only the beginning for you. Buckle up because this ride is going to be the longest, hardest, roughest war you will ever fight and it doesn&#39;t end until they do and the stronger and more influential you become in shifting the tide, the more you are noticed and the quicker you will be targeted and news flash, you do not want to be targeted. Chances are you and I and many of us will die before any significant victory is acheived against their regime, so get your long-term strategies in order.</p>

<p>Moving on to what it is to be awakened and in the war, if you will.</p>

<p>Think of it like a game of Mafia in which you are amidst a group of people consisting of two different factions: the innocent and the guilty. I&#39;m going to explain much of the game because how relevant it is and important to your survival should you continue to preach as you are. The game is played in two repeating cycles, day and night. During the day every person from both factions are brought together and none of the innocents are aware of who the other innocents are nor are they aware of who the guilty are whereas the guilty know exactly who the other guilty are and therefore who all of the innocents are. Each day the group of people consisting of both factions try to determine the alignment of each other to find the guilty. At the end of the day, they can vote to hang someone. Sometimes they accidentally hang innocent and sometimes they hang guilty. During the night cycle, the guilty get together to discuss who they want to kill. They get a certain amounts of kills per night based on the amount of guilty alive at that time. When the day cycle begins, if the guilty choose to kill someone, then the town consisting of everyone sees that the mafia chose to kill someone and have to try and determine who had motive for killing that person and why. Now the innocents aren&#39;t all weak and powerless, they have what are called power roles among them. Sticking with one version of the game that works for my purpose, there is a cop that on each night can select an individual. After the 2nd night, if this cop is still alive, he will be told if there is a different or same alignment between the first person he selected on night 1 and the second person he selected on night 2. This is obviously very useful information for town so you can imagine that mafia would want to know who the cop is so they can kill them and keep themselves safer. The cop can choose to hold this information until a crucial point of the game when town is  either the most united or most split or come out early to try and get early  hangs on mafia. What is important to understand is that none of the other innocents know if the cop is indeed the cop. He could be mafia and be trying to falsely persuade the innocents into a direction that is actually beneficial to the guilty. You can see how overwhelming this problem has become in our current society, especially when technology now exists that can fake so much. And that is I believe all I need to explain about the game of Mafia to continue my point.</p>

<p>From here on out since you are informed, you are a power role amongst the innocent. You have knowledge that is very helpful in defeating the guilty and saving the innocent and the more time that passes, the more knowledge you will acquire and the heavier the burden will become.</p>

<p>Now the guilty will not kill you for just sharing the information you or I have here because it is not the information itself that is the threat, it is the reach of influence in swaying the masses to our cause. You and I have very little influence right now, most people do and honestly, that isn&#39;t a bad thing. Low influence keeps people alive. The ones with great influence against their agenda never live for long, just look at the history of our species and the great minds which you know to have been on our side. While one person with exceptional influence to the masses is capable of shifting the tides of the war, they are essentially outting to the guilty that they are a power role and will be targeted swiftly and discretely (in most cases). It is far more advantageous for the living power roles of our side to keep their influence at levels that keep them alive and yet push progress forward. In the game of mafia this is done by the power roles trying to pass cues to the other towns that they are a power role whilst appearing weak and powerless to the mafia so they are not killed off, this is impossibly difficult in the game since everything is seen by everyone during the day but much easier in our time if you know how they surveil you and it is quite grand for them right now and we do not have precise knowledge of all their means, some of them we can&#39;t even dream to understand I imagine.</p>

<p>It is ironic that subterfuge could be the potential strategy that shifts the tides but it makes complete sense when you consider the concepts of warfare. When an enemy is far stronger and resourceful than you, you generally cannot win in a direct conflict. It shouldn&#39;t surprise anybody to hear that we can&#39;t win in a direct conflict with our current numbers though I am not suggesting death upon my enemies, that can lead to becoming guilty yourself but I don&#39;t want to delve into that philosophy right now. The point is that you are far more likely to survive and make an impact in this very long war if you retain and improve your power for the cause of the innocents whilst keeping yourself at a level of influence that keeps you from being targeted by them (that impossible task I mentioned in Mafia). Posting as you or I have here is very unlikely to put your life in any kind of danger, we are like ants to their current power and influence on the masses. Alone with high targetable influence we may be prevented from making progress by being silenced, united with low untargetable influence eventually makes an impact when the number of ants increases to a level that can&#39;t be stopped without mass destruction, and believe me they have those counter-measures in place if their regime is coming to and end and they are very spiteful so try not to be overly too hopeful in success, it is very unlikely but don&#39;t give up just because hope can seem lost, I haven&#39;t and I have zero faith in humanity. It has taken over ten years for me to see true progress in the fight and sadly I&#39;m numb to the enthusiasm of your likes and others and most of you won&#39;t last the hardships that you will have to endure, I barely do myself and I might not be long on this Earth because of it, but I have hopes that things will continue to make progress as you and other people continue to awaken and continue the fight for what humanity should be should I or other experienced people lose our means to fight or have it taken away. Wish you the best of luck, don&#39;t get yourself killed and get educated on educating or none of us or our children or their children will see the end of this horrific regime.</p>

<p>Since you are in the mind of loving people, I&#39;ll have you know I love you too so take care of your body before we lose you. Manic will kill you if you are not careful, especially with additives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you just explained many, many, many symbols in my life and I thank you for that.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t realize symbols could hold this power for the collective consciousness</p>

<p>I keep hearing 10 years?</p>

<p>Maybe I can last 10 years or so but there&#39;s no fear in 10 which is nice.... Dying at 80 90 years old after retiring at 60? That doesn&#39;t sound right to me so 10 sounds nice.</p>

<p>I made a choice and I am now in love. Do I keep trusting love and trust it will take me where I need to go and be safe in a cocoon unaway from the &quot;guilty&quot; and preserve my life force? Funny I was typing this to ask you but by typing I have asked for myself.</p>

<p>One last question is who do I know who to bring with me? Not feeling as safe in Washington and Montana will be straight flames and heat here soon, I can feel it coming in fast.</p>

<p>When do I make the move?</p>

<p>When do I drop all notions of &quot;success&quot; and &quot;make a run for the hills&quot; so to speak? Because I feel it growing and there&#39;s a lot of fear and negativity around my body (this apartment complex. Always hear screams that question my sanity)</p>

<p>It&#39;s dark and heavy and it affects me when I walk out the door in the morning. Tears me apart.</p>

<p>So now that I&#39;ve seen both dark and light and obviously choose love, how do I get to my destination to keep my body in safety and prevent accidents to my &quot;person&quot; if you&#39;re aware of what I mean because I think we have a interesting journey ahead of us that will take us all over the place</p>

<p>But maybe I can finally let go and just live and be in the moment. May I do that in safety while incarnated in third dimension please if I really do need to go another 10 years? I want to be surrounded by plenty of white light.</p>

<p>Funnels are great but so is the feeling of love and knowing I&#39;m safe and I can go where I need to without harm to my person or having to carry a stupid gun with &quot;ammo&quot; how pointless and it kept me locked in fear.</p>

<p>I release fear so I appreciate help</p>

<p>Any responses are thoroughly read for enjoyment rather than work for once.</p>

<p>Symbols are powerful</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I&#39;m home, almost </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in a &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; existence. As strangely as that sounds, THAT is my bible. Here&#39;s something I posted on another comment:</p>

<p>I&#39;d also compared this existence to &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;. Minus the incest parts. Those kids were swayed into thinking mommy&#39;s gonna get close to her daddy again so she can get her inheritance. Hide the kids away. The kids bought into the lie. Those kids were never gonna make it out of the attic. The mother was poisoning them by putting arsenic on the cookies/doughnuts. Cory died. The other three managed to escape. We are those flowers in the attic. We just keep getting conned into believing a bunch of bullshit that makes this existence worth coming to. And we only get poisoned right from the start. It&#39;s long gotten to the point where I hate to eat anything these days because everything tastes fake. I had a VERY bad experience with artificial sweetener and have to be on the look out for that. So many poisoned things. And our minds are just as poisoned. Look at the way a lot of people act. So many people LOVE to do cruel things to others. We all hurt when we have to depend on a toxic system to live in and depend on people to do the right and honorable thing and they don&#39;t. You always have to look to see if some asshole&#39;s gonna stab you in the back.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I admit I&#39;m not into new age woo-woo. I&#39;m not gonna love hateful people or people that have hurt me or try to hurt me. I&#39;m a misanthrope today because of the past. I&#39;m somebody that&#39;d be happy living as a hermit tbh. I&#39;m that sick of people. I want out of this existence because I realize there&#39;s just nothing here in &quot;the attic&quot; outside of pain, suffering and poison. I want to be able to leave this place just like the ending to the original &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; movie. Cathy, Chris and Carrie joined hands and left Foxworth Hall.</p>

<p>Yes, I know &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; is a work of fiction. But I just can&#39;t help picturing the parallels between that story and this existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, please read this and do not take offense.</p>

<p>There is a very significant shift in the content and frequency of the comments you have been posting the past two days. You are very clearly having a manic episode of some sort. I&#39;m not sure if you have any pre-existing mental conditions or not or if you are on medication.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t know your situation, but if you have friends, family, a therapist, or someone you can talk to, I would recommend doing so. Especially if you feel like you might harm yourself or others.</p>

<p>I am not saying this to be mean. I am saying it out of general concern. It is not just the content or frequency of your posts (though both are troubling), but it is that this is a <em>marked</em> shift from your posting habits up until now.</p>

<p>For others on here, please take a moment to review OP&#39;s posting history over the past two days compared to before then. Please seriously consider this when responding. I think that OP is in the midst of an acute episode, and we should encourage them to get help for their own safety.</p>

Once you <em>really</em> see the impeccability of the prison built around us and within us, there&#39;s no going back. There&#39;s a reason why Thomas Anderson / Neo vomited when he saw the Matrix.

<p>If you want to know more, and really explore the ways we&#39;ve all been enslaved not just this century but <em>for generations</em>, I recommend looking up The Template. Start with the book Worldbridger by Juliet and Jiva Carter and see what you think.</p>

<p>Good! Purge it all out, brother. Be kind to yourself. Drink water. Go easy. Try not to talk too much, as others around you might not understand what you&#39;re going through – as obviously many people even here don&#39;t. But I do. And I&#39;m proud of you. I&#39;m grateful for you. I know and feel right where you&#39;re at, and believe me you&#39;re not alone.</p>

<p>You probably did help one person out there. At least. :) Just don&#39;t forget the most important person you&#39;ve got to help: you. If your writing and sharing helped you encapsulate and express what&#39;s going on for you, stepping out for perhaps the first (?) time in your life, then you helped the one person you most needed to, the one person you most <em>can</em> help. So don&#39;t overlook the blessings you&#39;re showering on yourself opening up to yourself and the world the way you are.</p>

<p>And remember, go easy. :) </p>

<p>I was getting some negative greetings but I didn&#39;t fully give into the fear and let it take over</p>

<p>It was wanting to take me over but I didn&#39;t let it and finally I got some deep sleep and feel much better after 3 days no sleep.</p>

<p>Thank you so much my brother thank you thank you thank you for giving me the support I require instead of making fun of me and saying I&#39;m crazy </p>

<p>No one is crazy this planet and fear can jus allow &quot;crazy&quot; things to happen and that fear can take people over and make them do scary things because then their judgement and logic is clouded by a dense layer of fear that takes over</p>

<p>Money is fake. We all want safety, food, health, and respect and love.</p>

<p>Money buys me safety. I can then buy a gun, buy a bodyguard or buy a house in a safer area, which usually tends to be a richer area. </p>

<p>Money buys me food. Money also buys me land and materials where I could make my own food.</p>

<p>Money buys me health. If I have money, I can get the best healthcare in the world.</p>

<p>Money can buy me respect. I can pay people lots of money to talk about how great I am in the media and online.</p>

<p>Money can buy me love. I have much greater dating options as a rich man than a poor man.</p>

<p>Free yourself from the anger as this is a matter of perception, which is not universally defined.  Stop shoving your ideals down onto people as if you&#39;re the answer, the truth and all mighty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to see if there was info in his posts. He has been posting non-stop the past two days, and it&#39;s just been getting worse.</p>

<p>He mentioned previously being suicidal, but I don&#39;t see any notion that he is now.</p>

<p>He mentions a girlfriend returning soon, so maybe she will recognize the change in behavior ... or maybe he might behave badly towards her.</p>

<p>I think many have mentioned he should get help in direct or more smartly manipulative ways (won&#39;t blow their cover.)</p>

<p>If you have time to look through his posts for info or contact info, that could help.</p>
