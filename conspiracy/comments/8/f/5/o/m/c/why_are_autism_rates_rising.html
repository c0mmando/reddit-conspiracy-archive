       I had a biology professor who explained it as an inability of the body to process and expel 'toxic' elements.  The rate of people who would be effected by it has not changed over the years but our environment has become more saturated with those substances and the pre-existing condition is being activated more often.

       This. I think if I was a kid now I'd get diagnosed with it. Back when I was a kid you were unlikely to get diagnosed unless you were mute and sitting in a corner rocking or had other severe symptoms.

       My personal opinion is that they rising and over the years there has been a huge increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genetics alone or that we get better diagnosing it can not explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most credible reasons could be some kind of toxic exposure. Perhaps environmental pollution causing mutations altering our DNA. We have so much toxic exposures today from our polluted world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possible other agents that have been mentioned were Glyphosate or vaccinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last two cases we all know that these can be tracked back to Monsanto, Merck and the usual corporate suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could there some kind of intentional of re-engineering of the human race take place, to make us more efficient workers or to be more obedient citizens and what we are seeing are side-effects from these attempts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is this just a ploy to have more people need to buy expensive medical treatments and what we see is just a spectrum of various artificially created illnesses?

       I heard a really interesting theory that perhaps it’s on the rise is the fact that are brains are still evolving and that autism is the trial and error part of the evolution. Autism comes in many different spectrums, some autistics are math or music savants.  Maybe our brains are evolving to be even smarter and more efficient in the future when we are all connected to devices and what not....

       Where I grew up almost everyone has a person with autism in their family, but where I have been living the last 15 years I haven’t met or heard of anyone. I did meet one person with Asperger’s, but I’m not sure if that’s in the same category.

       My friends working in a clinic told me that they all feel it exploded around 90s'.

       Also, autism rate in the US is several hundreds times more than it is in China. Think of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes it can be diagnose rate difference. However, I have NEVER knew any of my friends' / families' kids are autism during my 25+ years of life in China, while I already know at least 3 of them within 7 years of life I have here in the US, a big "emmmmmm....." for me.

       Is it possible its partly a diagnosis issue? Notice how many people have Asperger's now? So things we may have just called quirks or personality flaws are now attributed to the autism spectrum?

       The rates are rising for most psychiatric conditions: depression, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar, autism etc. Personally, I believe the reason for this is a publicity bias. Not a single one of these disorders has a objective biological diagnostic criteria. A psychiatric disorder is simply diagnosed by the opinion of the physicians. Therefore, the observed rates of these disorders are extremely susceptible to the whims of public opinion. These disorders had a tremendous increase press coverage in the last few decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, these disorders are "coincidentally" enormously profitable for the pharmaceutical industry. Academia, especially that which pertains to medicine, is largely driven by financial incentives. Companies pay doctors to research topics which would be beneficial for their bottom line and ignore/contest/coverup research which shows their drugs to be unsafe. Here's an distressing example of this phenomenon happening in regards to bipolar disorder:

       More parents are becoming detached from reality. The sins of the parents are repeated in their sons and daughters, but magnified, and you end up with autism. Show me a kid with autism and I will almost always be able to show you a parent who misses social cues and is way to caught up in the dialogue in his/her own head. The babies catch the weird energy of the parents and end up with autism. Parents with newborns and toddlers - spent lots of time outside and in parks. Good for the mental health of both parent and child.

       Disclaimer: I have a bachelor’s degree in Early Childhood Education with a focus on special needs and child psychology (I don’t work in the field anymore) but hopefully I can provide some insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “markers” were taught to look for have become so broad. A lot of kids diagnosed with autism aren’t “autistic” in the sense that they don’t have social difficulties, learning difficulties, behavior problems, or any other negative effect that you traditionally associate with a child with autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teachers (especially ones that have a focus like I do) are taught to look for certain signs that indicate a child may have a disorder (not just autism, we look for signs of dyslexia, motor skill problems, etc. the earlier you can get a kid diagnosed with an issue, the more intervention can be used to help them succeed in life to the best of their ability). When you begin to notice a series of markers, you’re asked to document the occurances over the course of about a month. Then you give those markers to the school psychologist and principle and everyone sits down with the parents and talk. Assistance is provided and a referral to a medical professional is usually given, or parents can choose to use their own medical personnel if desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases, most cases, it’s a meer suggestion of, something could possibly hinder little Johnny’s ability to stay on track. We cannot give a formal diagnosis. The only time we would require the parents to take action is if the child is exhibiting extremely delayed or violent issues that create an unsafe environment for other students or faculty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the issue I take with this (and for the past 10 - 15 years it has been the same with things like ADHD) is the list of things that we as teachers notice and then are required to start documenting is so broad it can describe ANY child.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: if a child shows an interest in one specific topic (fixated on something) - that is a marker on the list and I am required to begin to observation process for documentation for a possible autistic child.
      </p>
      <p>
       A child reads about their grade level but struggles with math? (Which is very common as those two subjects are opposites) begin the documentation process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, when I was teaching, if I would have gone through the process of documenting every potential issue, my entire class would have been labeled as “possibly autistic”. Normal childhood behavior isn’t accepted anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do it? When you tell a child at a young age they’re “different” or have something “wrong” with them, even if it’s very minor or a misdiagnosis, it affects them and gives them the idea of ‘I’ll never be the same as everyone, I’ll never be as good as everyone else’
      </p>
      <p>
       It also allows their parents to have an “excuse” if the child doesn’t reach their full potential. Basically, in my opinion, it’s a way to keep children from wanting to investigate, reach out and explore and in a lesser sense another way to “dumb down” the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are children with legitimate autism and other diagnosis. But it is NO WHERE NEAR the number that are “diagnosised”

       I'm only 22, I have lived to see the results that you notice as well, however I notice that it's not a case of autism per-say, but more overly an issue with parents and their way of thinking combined with the concepts of DNA imprinting. It is a known fact that the next generation will be smarter than the previous in some reguards, that is due to minor DNA imprinting in children, that and the acceleration of technology breed new ideas, that most parents tend to fight, natural cause of and effect of change in life... what is unnatural however is the willingness of the parents to supreme that, they act as if driven extinction to hold onto dated ideology that ends up changing when the need makes itself overly apparent in society.  It's those same people that try to diagnose and assume what is not there, when the vast library's are at their disposal. At least that's how I view it.
