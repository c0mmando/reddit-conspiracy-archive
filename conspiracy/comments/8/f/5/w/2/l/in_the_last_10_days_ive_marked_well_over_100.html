    <div class="md"><p>I tend to view the userbase of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as anti-establishment right and most of the voting trends seem to reflect that. There&#39;s leftist voices here and there but not as many as you would expect on a site like Reddit that skews largely younger and lefter as a whole. The establishment left is almost all on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> rather than here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, although when a major story breaks (as you said) there tends to be an influx of users seeking to look at what the right&#39;s response is to it since this is one of the larger right-leaning subreddits where you don&#39;t get autobanned for trying to have a conversation (like <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see the userbase of r/conspiracy as anti-establishment right.  I see it more in the center and going left for social policy and going right on economic.  Because our economy sucked for 8 years I see them putting fiscal/economic policies above social issues.  Most voted for Obama and hated George Bush.  These people were participants of r/politics and other sites.  When a team of mods took over r/politics and criticized/downvoted and totally supported 1 side only - this group went to other subs.  When majority of those subs became far left only - they had 2 options.  T_D and r/conspiracy.  Conspiracy has become a battle ground because of this.  That is why we see a lot of effort to get rid of current mods and take over this sub.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen people get banned on r/politics very easily.  Especially if they happen to have any history on the T_D sub.  Many subs will ban anyone who has history with T_D.   I believe participation and voting on r/politics is completely artificial.  It is an MSM machine and by forging fake votes it allows them to get more clicks and trend on other social media sites.  </p>

<p>T_D receives a high volume of people trolling and people infiltrating pretending to be a T_D supporter.  There are daily attempts by those people to post racist things in order to get the sub shut down.  I&#39;ve see groups of people attempting to do this.  I see the same coordinated efforts here to control and silence dissent.  </p>

<p>What social policies do you think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> leans left on? I&#39;d say decriminalization of drugs is one, and a general distaste for war, but those are also common among libertarian types. There is a lot of pushback here on manyy LGBT issues, and I see the phrase &quot;degenerate&quot; used a lot more than you&#39;d think of a socially left group. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve served a number of bans on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (for &quot;personal insults&quot;) so I don&#39;t disagree that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has an, erm, active moderator community. I also believe it&#39;s one of the most astroturfed subs on Reddit-- both from the left and the right. That sort of makes sense, but it also means conversations on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are usually pretty pointless.</p>

<p>T_D is just a mess. I don&#39;t know how anyone can look at the vote totals/comments ratio and think that&#39;s natural. It&#39;s also proven that any disagreement with Trump&#39;s platform will be removed-- see the mass deletion of comments after his Syria strikes. T_D is just a rallying forum for Trump support and I don&#39;t think it has much value.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I think has far less astroturfing than both T_D and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> but due to the nature of the userbase has way more people accusing each other of being shills (like this thread&#39;s OP.)</p>

<p>For 8 years people lived in a shitty economy that was killing the middle class.  All we heard about from MSM was how great the economy was doing and a lot of chatter around social issues. I would say a lot of r/conspiracy users are anti-establishment (left social &amp; right - economical) but have chose to put economic issues above social issues.  </p>

<p>Degenerate is a term used broadly by both sides.  The push back on LGBT is the bullying and putting a small minority in front of economic issues that impact all.  They view it as a distraction to the bigger issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>both from the left and the right. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are saying the right astroturfs r/politics? Please share examples.  I see the left doing it all the time.  99.9% or r/politics is left.  No diversity </p>

<p>There is a lot of people who disagree with Trump administration and his policy decisions on T_D. They do it a manner of debate/discussion.  You will see comments of people against Flynn to those who disagree with Sessions and Trumps decison.  However it is a groupie sub - its title &quot;The_Donald&quot; and its rules are clear so astroturfing is likely.  Politics is not a groupie sub but t operates like one.  If r/politics were open to alternative opinions and didn&#39;t astroturf so heavily for the left - we wouldn&#39;t have The_Donald.  That is the difference between the 2.  </p>

<p>If you go through my post history, I make the comment &quot;why do you keep making new accounts&quot; about a dozen times. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has a problem on newer threads that has been going on for at least a year and a half where brand new accounts will make posts of right-wing talking points in completely unrelated threads. I usually call them out when I see them, thus that &quot;why do you keep making new accounts&quot; thing popping up over and over. I genuinely wanted an answer, but never got one. I think pretty much all of the accounts that I&#39;ve called out have since been deleted, but if you spend any time in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> I&#39;m sure new ones still pop up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what could explain brand new accounts with right-wing talking points popping up over, and over, and over without actually engaging with users other than astroturfing? Like I said, it&#39;s happening from both sides on there. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not a theory that T_D actively deletes dissent. Here&#39;s <a href="http://removeddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8bg62b/russia_vows_to_shoot_down_any_and_all_missiles/">the Removeddit version of The_Donald&#39;s thread immediately following the last Syria strikes.</a> Nearly all of the red posts there were removed by moderators for disagreeing with the strikes. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is definitely not a natural community, but T_D takes it to an insane level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see new accounts posting left wing on r/politics as well. One guy on this sub pointed out the crazy amount of new account that hit the top pushing all left wing/MSM stories.

The karma would get killed and you would most likely get trolled.  </p>

<p>T_D didn&#39;t delete all post regarding dissent of the Syrian strikes.  They deleted the duplicates and those posted by questionable accounts.  T_D clearly states it is groupie sub  Politics claims it is not  - so you cannot measure or compare the 2.  Its apples and oranges.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But when you create a new account, you would interact, presumably. These accounts don&#39;t interact. The beating heart of all this activity is in &quot;rising&quot; and &quot;new,&quot; and the accounts don&#39;t stick around very long anyway. And like I said, they&#39;re coming from the left and the right. It&#39;s been going on long enough and I&#39;ve been observing it long enough that I&#39;m comfortable in my assessment of it.</p>

<p>It is a groupie sub.  If you want dissent go to r/politics and every other sub on Reddit.  T_D does have dissenting opinions but it doesn&#39;t allow massive armies to come into its sub and push a negative on Trump.  Any fan/groupie sub would discourage against it.  </p>

Doolimite&#39;s comments are negative of Trumps decision 132 upvotes.  In the discussion you find people surprised that folks on r/politics are happy with Trump/Syria.  Those on T_D do not always agree with his decisions but the mods are not going to allow a bunch of posts trying to sway opinion.  Its not designed for it and it clearly says it in their rules.   Why is that hard for you to understand?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He (Obama) wasn&#39;t born in the US. He was born in Vancouver, Canada, and when Stanley matriculated to Washington st for university, she adopted/was given him by his birth mother. I mean it&#39;s possible he was born in Kenya then smuggled to Canada, but that adds layers of complexity.</p>

<p>Stanley was a CIA operative working directly under Nicole Kidman&#39;s dad in Hawai&#39;i smuggling kids in from Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and Laos for use in Honolulu, and so maybe Obama was a gift from George Bush or something, the situation is too complex to suss out, but Obama isn&#39;t American, wasn&#39;t born here and his actual place of birth is too occluded to even be known, unless the CIA fesses up and just admits the whole she-bang.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading, over a period of years about muntjaks. I was like, these can&#39;t be real, surely we&#39;d know about them.</p>

<p>All I could find was an article here or there discussing them. No way to verify any of that, then  guess like-minded people decided to go and find them and voila, now we have several known species.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically, the muntjak, what got me into conspiracy type stuff. You go read about the discovery of panda bears and yetis, and the stories behind them are weirder than what sci-fi writers could conceive.</p>

<p>I had a notion that that is what this sub was for, not having to wait years between muntjak sightings, but rather a collated source of facts and speculation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s now a collection of Brock- and Soros-paid shills who very literally turn <em>every thread</em> into &quot;muh Russia and drumpf gon nukes the emtire world, yo, and btw I aren&#39;t paid by collect the records, nope, not me, pinky swear&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s beyond time they are dealt with.</p>
