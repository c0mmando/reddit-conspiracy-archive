    <div class="md"><p>Php 2:9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 
Php 2:10  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 
Php 2:11  And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>Better to do this here while you walk in your flesh on earth and accept his blood atonement for your transgression against his laws.  This is a full pardon as he took the punishment you deserve for sin.</p>

<p>Repent and believe the gospel now to be saved or face his judgment and do it after your period of grace has expired and you must pay the price of sin yourself in an eternal lake of fire.</p>

<p>This is the gospel that saves:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they really hide that notion.  As you mentioned it seems like there is some popular support for a candidate that holds belief in a religion, so in many instances I think they hide the fact that they don&#39;t believe in a god.  </p>

<p>But when looking at the media such as tv shows and movies, and the mainstream viewpoint of science, it&#39;s clear that atheist beliefs are definitely pushed very often.  If anything, it seems like &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t want people to believe in god.  In many cases the lack of belief in a god can lead to perpetual fear of death and also apathy due to feeling that nothing matters.</p>

<p>What seems to be suppressed most is that possibly humans are gods themselves, or that there is a consciousness that humans posses that is transcendent of our body and the 3d world or the possibility that we are all viewing reality from different perspectives while actually being of the same consciousness.  </p>

<p>So either no god and we are mortal or there is a god that could make us eternally suffer are the views that &#39;they&#39; seem to want us to hold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally speaking? Because I want to believe that something GOOD exist. That there is some kind of hope. I don&#39;t necessarily believe everything about Christianity or The Bible and I definitely think they&#39;ve turned it into a corporation but religion can be a great think, if applied correctly. And it doesn&#39;t even have to be a &#39;social&#39; thing. It&#39;s about each individual human within themselves. I don&#39;t agree with worshiping, I don&#39;t agree with all the money going to The Church and them abusing that money instead of helping people in need. But there is some authentic, genuine goodness about religion if applied in a non-extremist nature. Whether there is a God or not, I mean, what&#39;s the difference? It&#39;s an answer you literally can&#39;t answer with certainty. But if God, the one that preached eternal love, humbleness and kindness, helps motivate people and it&#39;s a source of strength for them, then even more power to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible you are looking at it the wrong way? Society is made to &quot;disprove&quot; the bible, which I believe the old testament is was made to install fear. The New Testament, however, even highly modified from the original intent, shows a God of Love.  What if there is God, and it is actually you?  All matter must pass and reincarnate until they are able to understand Godliness, true love.  None of this is done against freewill, you always have it, but all the pieces of a puzzle make a whole.  If you still dont believe me, prove me wrong on this statement, &quot;Every decision is made with one of two purposes, service to self, or servoce to others.&quot;   The world and every decision you make is black and white truely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally speaking? Because I want to believe that something GOOD exist. That there is some kind of hope. I don&#39;t necessarily believe everything about Christianity or The Bible and I definitely think they&#39;ve turned it into a corporation but religion can be a great think, if applied correctly. And it doesn&#39;t even have to be a &#39;social&#39; thing. It&#39;s about each individual human within themselves. I don&#39;t agree with worshiping, I don&#39;t agree with all the money going to The Church and them abusing that money instead of helping people in need. But there is some authentic, genuine goodness about religion if applied in a non-extremist nature. Whether there is a God or not, I mean, what&#39;s the difference? It&#39;s an answer you literally can&#39;t answer with certainty. But if God, the one that preached eternal love, humbleness and kindness, helps motivate people and it&#39;s a source of strength for them, then even more power to them. </p>
