I just recently heard about &quot;incel&quot;(Involuntary Celibate) and how disturbed and deranged these people are. They use to have a subreddit but it was banned. Now there are forums online that are 100x worse than what was on reddit. How much correlation is there between Incels and violence? *TLDR - If you dont know what Incel Is just google it and prepare to be disturbed </p>

- Same date as a G7 meeting on Building a more Secure World. Make a statement to the G7 (West)
- He was accused of being a copy cat for Elliot Rogers but a) Elliot used guns and knives, he drove a vehicle and could get a gun since he was in the army b) Elliot went specifically after women, his was random and could have been a college or bar attack c) Elliot used his own car and not a rental d) Elliot committed suicide, he was looking for death by cop<br/>
- He copied every past jihadist attack - rent a white van and drive it into people
- Still no word on his religious beliefs
- FB Just one post on his Facebook account supporting the incel movement
- FB archived soon after the van attack in Toronto when no one knew who he was
- FB photo exactly like his LinkedIn photo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trojan Horse.  Until Toronto, I had not heard any Incel &quot;violence&quot; as related to Incel.  I&#39;m sure somebody who identifies as Incel has done something stupid at some point.</p>

<p>TPTB are setting up incel as a hate group.  Incel hates women!</p>

<p>Once that is secure, the overlap from incel to 4chan to neckbeard to mom&#39;s basement is heavy, and this overlap will be used to silence all the above.</p>

<p>4chan hates women!  Neckbeards hate women!  If you live in parents basement you hate women!</p>

<p>The profile of the Toronto thing fits this perfect.  Neckbeard programmer mad at women who are not attracted to his Mountain Dew and Cheetos and computer life (no idea if true, just noting the presentation).</p>

<p>Incel will be Alt-Right will be Conspiracy Theorist all real quick.  All with intent to silence.</p>

<p>They are starting out with some of the more marginalized and weakest of cohorts, essentially HRC&#39;s &quot;deplorables.&quot;</p>
