Also, I was blown away to discover the more than 3 buildings were taken out! The smoking gun isn’t building 7, it’s building 6! To say that the two towers collapsing (which turned into dust) created a massive creator in building 6 is laughable. The video clearly shows one object hitting one of the towers with another object flying almost vertically toward another WTC building. Amazing times we live in indeed. </p>

<p>It wasnt an engine used on that plane... you do realize that planes have detailed maintenence histories and its easy to find out what type of engine was used.</p>

<p>The engine they found on the street was a totally different engine with different internals than the one that was on the flight that it was supposed to be from.</p>

<p>So what are the options?</p>

<p>They think the wrong plane hit the building?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>United 767s use a 7T9D-7R4D engine made by Pratt &amp; Whitney. The engine recovered has been identified as a 7T9D-7 used almost exclusively by 747s. This is a completely different engine type and engine size. While it&#39;s difficult to identify a destroyed engine from photographs alone, there is one very large clue: the cooling ducts don&#39;t match those used by a Boeing 767.</p>

<p>United 175 used this type of cooling duct on its engine: 801123. They have been using this type of flat cooling duct since 1983. The cooling duct on the recovered engine is part number 781765. This cooling duct has not been used by United since 1975.</p>

<p>Can you spot the cooling duct in this picture? There it is. Flight 175 did not use this cooling duct. A simple inspection of the engine and confirmation of the part numbers would settle this dispute in a flash. But the government refuses to show this engine for inspection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, both engines mentioned are subtypes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_JT9D">Pratt &amp; Whitney 7T9D engine</a>. In particular, the 7T9D-7R4D is just a different version of the 7T9D-7. They share <em>many</em> parts, not the least of which is the cooling duct assembly.</p>

<p>His assertion that one component of a cooling duct assembly being discontinued proves that the engine is a different model only goes to prove his ignorance of jet engines, and indeed of technical documents and practices.</p>

<p>The most glaring problem with that guy&#39;s analysis though, is that he&#39;s trying to compare a cooling duct with a cooling duct <em>assembly</em>. In the technical world, an &quot;assembly&quot; is a collection of parts, often pre-assembled, that can be bought as a single unit.</p>

<p>Do me a favor if you are serious about this conversation, and take a look at <a href="https://plus.google.com/+FredRobel/posts/HmQ8WfDkQVj">this image of a nice, shiny, clean JT9D-7R4D engine</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with the material it&#39;s made of, and everything to do with its mass, speed, and the amount of distance it has to stop in.</p>

<p>Q: What is the force required to fully stop a loaded 737-200 in 48 m (the length of the plane) </p>

<p>A: Kinetic energy is mass * velocity<sup>2</sup><br/>
E = 136078 kg * 264 m/s<sup>2</sup>
So the amount of work energy (F*d) done by the wall to stop the plane is 9.48E+09 J</p>

<p>Force = E/d = 9.48E+09 J / 48 m = 1.98E+08 N</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t give a good intuitive answer however. How many pounds of force would that be? 1N = .225 lb So   </p>

<p>1.98E+08 N * .225 lb/N = 4.44E+07 lb or over <strong>44 million pounds of force</strong>. Now that&#39;s exerted over the area of impact, but the front profile of the plane is streamlined. Cutting through the steel exterior beams like butter is almost exactly what I would expect. Not that the aluminum frame would go undamaged: it would crumple and tear and disintegrate as it plowed through the steel like the 100 ton battering ram that it was. Mass + high speed beats hardness every time. Remember, you can cut steel with water if it&#39;s moving fast enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can try to argue that that&#39;s wrong, but I&#39;m curious what you think the alternative is? We saw the plane go through, so are you saying it was made out of something else? I&#39;m not sure why that would matter.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re arguing that the plane was a missile, i don&#39;t think that&#39;s the sword to die on here. The evidence isn&#39;t really there and it just seems unnecessary to not just use a plane. Thats not the case for the other theories and I think it&#39;s not worth getting caught up on the missile theory (I&#39;m referring to the WTC planes not the pentagon/93, which were actually confusing)</p>

Could there be thermite or esplosives to help the destruction, maybe.

<p>Your proportions are way off. <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/arch/perimeter.html">The exterior was a 1-foot-thick hollow steel structural layer</a> (most of that was air), near the top that 300 ton projectile had to pass through barely 2 cumulative inches of steel by the time it would fly out the other side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tower is mostly made of air. There are steel columns around the edges and a big concrete column in the center. So to me it&#39;s very plausible that parts of the plane didn&#39;t hit anything (i.e. missed the center). The first part of the plane would be shredded by the edge columns, but that is only the <em>first</em> parts (nose). The rest of the plane (minus the wings, obviously also shredded) was free to pass right through the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of a movie...Die Hard 3:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As McClane solves Simon&#39;s riddles, he recognizes that Simon is using the school bomb distraction to draw the police away from Wall Street. They arrive too late to find that Simon and his agents used the destruction of the subway station to dig into the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and steal $140 billion of gold bullion in dump trucks. They follow the trucks to an aqueduct in the New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, and McClane has Carver continue on Simon&#39;s games. Within the tunnel he kills some of Simon&#39;s men, discovering they have a roll of quarters on them. Simon destroys a cofferdam, flooding the tunnel, but McClane escapes through a vent, ending up near Carver. They recognize the roll of quarters would pay for a toll road, and follow the trucks to a tanker vessel in the Long Island Sound. They sneak aboard, but realize too late it is a trap. They are tied to the real bomb and Simon says he will destroy the tanker, redistributing the bullion across the Sound, which would destroy the economies of the world. McClane convinces Simon to give him a bottle of aspirin. McClane is able to free them from the bomb before it explodes, sinking the tanker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

My gut kept telling something seemed off.  There was so much that happened at once it was hard to unravel the story... I recall seeing all of the weird news footage about WTC 7 live in DC and then it was never mentioned.  The weird plane crash in PA.  I attended a memorial ceremony in  shankesville after 9-11 and recall thinking the c rash site was not as I expected.  I thought the date I went was the week following the 11th but don’t remember.  I’m pretty sure someone said we shot the plane down.  </p>

That one is almost never spoken of, and when they do its usually spoken of as the plane that the people fought back and brought the plane down themselves.  More accurately, was most likely shot down.   </p>

<p>Interesting that almost everyone in the comment section was unaware that this took place, but you insist that it’s so obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with the material it&#39;s made of, and everything to do with its mass, speed, and the amount of distance it has to stop in.</p>

<p>Q: What is the force required to fully stop a loaded 737-200 in 48 m (the length of the plane) </p>

<p>A: Kinetic energy is mass * velocity<sup>2</sup><br/>
E = 136078 kg * 264 m/s<sup>2</sup>
So the amount of work energy (F*d) done by the wall to stop the plane is 9.48E+09 J</p>

<p>Force = E/d = 9.48E+09 J / 48 m = 1.98E+08 N</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t give a good intuitive answer however. How many pounds of force would that be? 1N = .225 lb So   </p>

<p>1.98E+08 N * .225 lb/N = 4.44E+07 lb or over <strong>44 million pounds of force</strong>. Now that&#39;s exerted over the area of impact, but the front profile of the plane is streamlined. Cutting through the steel exterior beams like butter is almost exactly what I would expect. Not that the aluminum frame would go undamaged: it would crumple and tear and disintegrate as it plowed through the steel like the 100 ton battering ram that it was. Mass + high speed beats hardness every time. Remember, you can cut steel with water if it&#39;s moving fast enough.</p>
