<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s both.</p>

<p>Never stop applying for jobs and remember that any job is better than no job at all. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a mortgage thing as well. If I don&#39;t pay my mortgage, I lose my house, then the tenant loses their house as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bit of compassion goes a long way in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a family member that rented houses. He charged absurdly low rent prices and always gave people breaks. He couldn&#39;t afford to pay the mortgages. The city ended up taking one of his houses and he was forced to give his houses away at absurdly low prices to get some money in the bank. Now he has no money, and his own son got him to sign a deal to transfer his house to him while he was high on pain pills and now he doesn&#39;t even own his own house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the personal story. Of course, rent stabilization &quot;favors the tenant.&quot; We have known for hundreds of years that markets do not provide sufficient affordable housing to run an economy. Areas suffer when rents become too high, and the inability to get good help on low level work stifles the economy and pushes wages up. So, good. It should &quot;favor the tenant.&quot;</p>

<p>Your second gripe about eviction is legitimate, but it is a different issue. The difficulties in evicting tenants is not necessarily connected to rent stabilization <em>unless</em> you believe that only people who are able to pay higher rents should have housing. </p>

<p>In fact, the Donald Trump administration is taking money from tenants and giving more profit to landlords (regardless of the eviction issue). These landlords include people like Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner, whose stabilized housing stocks are quite large. Further, the investment money for these people to profiteer is often lent under government programs. This is literally reverse Robin Hood.</p>

<p>Since you are willing to put up selected personal information, I would like to know how many units you hold, whether they are rent stabilized, and how much federal loan money you received to purchase them...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually what &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; means. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it&#39;s the definition of the term. Right and left aren&#39;t just labels people assign themselves, they have meanings. Right means you believe that hierarchies naturally exist in society, left means you believe everyone is equal. </p>

<p>To be fiscally conservative means that you believe &quot;fiscally&quot; that there are hierarchies in society. Having a lower class and upper class are inherent parts of that. If you don&#39;t believe that things should be that way, you are not a fiscal conservative. Just like being &quot;socially conservative&quot; means you believe there are hierarchies naturally in society (such as gay people shouldn&#39;t marry, immigrants are lazy, black people cause crime...) </p>

<p>You&#39;re complaining about fiscal conservatism existing on a message board that currently <em>loves</em> conservative politics and being upvoted for it, because most people who identify as conservative do not actually understand what it means to be conservative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy.[1][2][3][4] It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others (prioritarianism) as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished (by advocating for social justice).[1] The term left-wing can also refer to &quot;the radical, reforming, or socialist section of a political party or system&quot;.[5]</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics</a></p>

<p>Right-wing politics hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal or desirable,[1][2][3] typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics or tradition.[4]:p. 693, 721[5][6][7][8][9][page needed] Hierarchy and inequality may be viewed as natural results of traditional social differences[10][11] or the competition in market economies.[12][13] The term right-wing can generally refer to &quot;the conservative or reactionary section of a political party or system&quot;.[14]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In modern times, &quot;right-wing&quot; is sometimes used to describe laissez-faire capitalism. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right&#39;s support of capitalism can be traced to the late 19th century.[18] The so-called neoliberal Right, popularized by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, combines support for free markets, privatisation and deregulation with traditional right-wing support for social conformity.[8] Right-wing libertarianism (sometimes known as libertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism) supports a decentralized economy based on economic freedom and holds property rights, free markets and free trade to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.[51] Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism &quot;can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations&quot;. Gregory holds that the issue is not right or left, but &quot;whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal&quot;.[56]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both beliefs exist under the term &quot;fiscal conservative&quot;. This is why communism is a left-wing belief, because it&#39;s an extreme form of abolishing economic classes. In reality the most ethical system is a mixture of both right wing and left wing fiscal beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In recent times, the definitions of the words have been so contorted as to lose any meaning.

These various hyphenated &quot;ideologies&quot; are designed to mix up and confuse.</p>

<p>Quite simply, and to make sense of the world views that works in conversation:</p>

<p>Conservative means those who want to conserve their power, position, or belief systems against change or those who want to resort to a glorious past. Conservative also means biased.</p>

<p>Liberal means those who are willing to embrace change and especially to disperse power, allow competition for positions, and disrupt traditional belief systems when they don&#39;t make sense. Liberal means bias-free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fiscal conservatism is simply the state operating within the limits of it&#39;s financial resources and not borrowing anything but short term loans that would be quickly paid back and doesn&#39;t immediately imply a social conservatism that is unwilling to take any responsibility for society&#39;s most marginalized and vulnerable members. </p>

<p>Within the conservative philosophy, however, there was always an element of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;, which is to say those who are the most fortunate and who gain the most from the social and economic structure owe something to those who are served and gain the least by it. The graduated income tax was both endorsed and certainly not considered to be unfair in any way from that perspective. In short, a healthy and stable society is far better for business than an unhealthy and unstable one.</p>

<p>In British and Canadian terminology there were what they called Red Tories and Blue Tories in the conservative camp. The Red having a very strong sense of social responsibility and concern for the general health of society as a whole, while the Blue did not. </p>

<p>It was the preponderance of those Red Tories that was instrumental in the building of quality schools, well stocked libraries, hospitals, highways and public transportation systems, among other things.</p>

<p>I have a car, too, and here in Munich is a quite functioning public transportation system, but rather often it&#39;s faster and cheaper to go by car. Unless you want to spend half a day in the city core and have to pay €€€ for a parking place, provided you even find one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is very true. One of the main things about Capitalism is that it <em>requires</em> a certain amount of people be unemployed at all times. If too many people are employed then the employees have too much negotiating power to negotiate higher salaries etc., so they always make sure that a certain minimum-% is unemployed.</p>

<p>Homelessness is just another layer on that, it adds to the fear of the avergage worker as you point out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If everyone is employed then the employee has no fear of being fired, because he/she can easily find new employment. </p>

<p>Therefore if there is <em>some</em> unemployment, the employee will generally accept a lower wage because of the fear of becoming unemployed. Conversely, with higher employment rate the employee will ask for higher wage because he/she can more easily get hired or even be head-hunted for a better position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... what normally causes people to be fired with awful prospects? What if he runs up a colossal corporate debt? Loss of accreditation, failure to meet standards? Fraud investigations? Criminal acts? Corruption?</p>

<p>This was about homelessness.. What causes people to become homeless?</p>

<p>In this full employment then, even this person is guaranteed a job with similar salary so long as they are in the right sector? It is not achievable I don&#39;t think.</p>

<p>Full employment would have to be something that spontaneously arises when the conditions are correct like a rare and I would say extemely localised weather phenomena.</p>

<p>If there is lasting full employment... It can only be relevant to a majority or a utopian society, but it will not account for the outliers in actual reality.</p>

<p>There is no system of economy that can account for the small percentage who are simply not at all employable, and that people can become unemployable through time either through their own actions or external ones.</p>

<p>Universal income is one solution I suppose, but I doubt you can engineer full employment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are taking things too literally.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more of a sliding scale. The lesser the % of unemployed in a Capitalist society, the more negotiating power the employed have. Simply because it is more likely they can get employed elsewhere if they don&#39;t like it where they are. Therefore the &#39;Capitalists&#39; will always try to keep a certain % unemployed, however they also don&#39;t want too big a % unemployed as that is also bad (then people don&#39;t have money to buy the Capitalists products).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I was quite literally interpretting employees have nothing to fear... but this now makes sense to me. I think people are getting at here is that they think an otherwise low unemployment rate is artificially inflated in order to drive wages lower so long as this is doesn&#39;t negatively impinge on productivity. I&#39;m not sure giant monopolistic companies would intentionally self limit in this way, but rather outsource work thus creating this same effect.. i.e. globalism. Eventually however these outsourced employees and the new skill sets flowing in will probably eventually cause the workers to demand independence and ownership of their industries once they reach a critical mass. Look at what happened to indian pharma. Reflecting in corporate power what happened for governments and empires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>System (definition)  - a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a complex whole, a set of principles</p>

<p>The system is working as it is designed to. Most people are on the lookout for tricks in the economic/political system when the system itself is the trick.</p>

<p>We live in a world where things are run by the people at the top for their benefit. It&#39;s set up to work juuuust good enough that the rest of us put up with it.</p>

<p>Every now and then, things fuck up a bit and you get increases in poverty and homelessness. But instead of helping people out, the first response to to ignore them, increase law enforcement for the ones that get too uppity... and generally hope things sort themselves out.</p>

<p>If/when that doesn&#39;t happen, that&#39;s when you usually see some kind of major social rearrangement (e.g. French Revolution, Russian Revolution, War of Independence etc.) or there&#39;s a major war (e.g. the way WWII ended the Great Depression).</p>

<p>So I&#39;m looking ahead at all those jobs going out the window because of automation. Then there&#39;s the countless Trillions in future pension liabilities and no way there&#39;ll ever be enough money to cover it. Solution?</p>

<p>Have a huge war where maybe 50 or 60 million people get killed. Get&#39;s rid of unwanted/unnecessary surplus people who were just a drain on The System. Also makes a nice distraction from the real problem, which is The System that let things get that bad in the first place. </p>

<p>tldr; The real problem is that 99% of people work to support a system. The same system works to support the other 1%.</p>

<p>Some conspiracy theorists have a tendency to focus on and obsess over these details: who carried out 9/11? Who shot Kennedy? Which political party is more corrupt?

<p>On the other hand, &quot;non conspiracy theorists&quot; such as coincidence theorists and somnambulists typically deny the rash altogether. &quot;That can&#39;t have a deeper cause, you&#39;re just seeing things that aren&#39;t there.&quot; They&#39;ll ignore, ridicule, and try to suppress the rash-seers, usually in that order.

    <div class="md"><p>I could be wrong, often I am, but aren&#39;t the vast majority of the homeless in this country mentally ill or are suffering with severe addiction issues?</p>

<p>I know a lot of cats here aren&#39;t necessarily fans of capitalism. But I don&#39;t know a better system. Even back in the day, long before this system was implemented, people had to work. When you spent your day toiling the fields, hunting, fetching water, etc, that&#39;s real fucking work. And there wasn&#39;t a carrot at the finish line to keep you going. It was survival.</p>

<p>Now we live in a day and age were things are crazy easy. We no longer have to fetch water, hunt, toil the field, etc. Instead we pay a bill online, turn the faucet, drive to the grocery store, etc. Those are all services. We too must do something for those things. Also known as a job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coldly considered, you are 100% right.</p>

<p>But I think that&#39;s not the point. The system known as &quot;capitalism&quot; has its own regulations, that is, there is a virtual &quot;slider&quot; between &quot;pay you employee a huge amount of money&quot; and &quot;&quot;pay you employee no money&quot;. It&#39;s obvious that the boss doesn&#39;t want to pay more money than necessary to an employee. So, assuming that the boss has some influence on the politics, what would be the best conditions for the boss?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many potential employees - so he can select the best to work for him</p></li>
<li><p>Employees being in need of money to pay for the resources you mentioned</p></li>
<li><p>A threat of getting sick without access to medical help without money</p></li>
<li><p>A threat of getting homeless with all sorts of consequences without money</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So that money becomes a dire <em>need</em> for everyone.</p>

<p>Now, with high unemployment, the boss can choose the best ones who do the job for the least money. If the unemployment goes to zero, a boss who has a job position to fulfill needs to convince the employee of another boss to quit their actual job and work for the new boss. Thus he needs to offer more money.</p>

<p>See? In the end it&#39;s &quot;supply and demand&quot; or &quot;the free market&quot; at play.</p>

<p>That paragraph is halfway beside the point and true at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, wouldn&#39;t businesses want people to have jobs so that they too would be able to purchase or use their services?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good one. Yes, in principle, they would, but on the other hand, they don&#39;t want to spend extra money to get to that state. The immediate concern of any business is of course to maximize its own profits, then the well-being of their employees and in the 3rd place the well-being of the society and thus the well-being of all those who are not affiliated with the business in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism is a system in which we all have skin in the game.</p>

The rich can&#39;t legally have you imprisoned (yet) for questioning their agendas, but the threat of economic devastation via job loss certainly accomplishes the desired censorship. Also, it is very difficult to resist or even remain abreast of all the corruption of our oligarchy when you&#39;re working 65 hours a week at 3 jobs with no benefits. </p>

<p>And if the poor are the stick, maybe celebrities are the carrot, to keep us reaching up for more of what we don&#39;t have?</p>

<p>Absolutely.
You never get rich from your own hand&#39;s work. All you can possibly manage is having enough money for a life of your own, barely for a family and always with the threats of sickness and homelessness hanging over your head.</p>

<p>To get rich, you always need other people work for you (for as little pay as possible) while you &quot;sell&quot; their workforce for more money (as much as possible). The difference is what makes you rich.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s hardly a way out. As soon as you organize the work of others, with the best intent, you&#39;re on the way to become a Capitalist. (I know exactly one counter-example of a very small company where every &quot;employee&quot; &quot;owns&quot; a &quot;share&quot; of their company.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I don&#39;t think this is a conspiracy as much as just a side effect of capitalism.  Economically speaking it&#39;s great because everyone is free do do what they feel is best for them. Politically speaking it&#39;s terrible because those who are successfully succeed to be more successful in large part because of how much power they have over their surroundings. Ie. Your boss has control over you and your associates, his. He makes more money and can afford to better himself, tells you want to do to meet his needs, can take the credit of the team if he chooses, etc.. a rich person can afford large political donations to candidates supporting his desires while 1000 poor people can&#39;t afford collectively to match his singular contribution. There is some point in the middle where the worse off you are, the worse you will succumb to being. For the poor, it&#39;s often go turn to crime which ends them up in prison. Out of prison it&#39;s difficult to go straight so they end up homeless. Then while homeless they probably die in misery. I don&#39;t think this is a grand conspiracy or anything, I think it&#39;s just the drawbacks of our own beloved system that we have trouble identifying. It&#39;s super easy for us to poke holes in things like communism and socialism from our perspective and we have difficulty with the notion that like... 2 billion Chinese are just totally cool with being communist despite our views. They very likely have the same view of us thinking similarly that they can like all kinds of holes in capitalism that we are just completely deaf or numb to and they probably just chalk us up to being 350 million crazy Americans who are just cool with capitalism for some unexplainable reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A system has more qualities than a designer intentionally designs. </p>

<p>If a system begins to function differently after a certain number of cycles, the system isn&#39;t broken; it is designed as such.  </p>

<p>If there are problems with a system they are design flaws.  It seems trivial to point out, but it is an important concept to understand, imo.  It&#39;s the difference between treating symptoms and finding a cure.</p>

<p>Some design flaws can be accounted for. &quot;This part needs replacing every month.&quot;
If that part is an air filter, no problem.  But what if that part is something a little less tangible? What if that part was a debt system? a constitution? etc.</p>

<p>If a system has openings for corruption, it is a fault of the system.  We all know human nature, and accept that corruption will happen. We try to stop corruption when we find it, but these are retroactive measures trying to compensate for design flaws.   This is the system functioning as designed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system isnt designed to keep you poor. Its designed to favor better people over worse. You will be poor for years as a young adult. You have to learn so many things. Life is a bitch. I was hungry, wearing recycled cloths, making just enough money to pay my rent and a few bills. I would often feed my family of 3 at the time, on 40 dollars a week.</p>

<p>Afger about 5 years, i finally got a decent job. I quit 5 jobs previous to that as i would find another. I worked my ass off, and most people just took advantage of it because they knew i was desperate. I eventually learned to get what i could for myself from them, and do whats right for me and my family.</p>

<p>I do alright now, but the idea of having a nice family home, with a 401k, and a savings account, having fairly new cars for everybody in the family, is a pipe dream.</p>

<p>I burn about 3000 a month in just bills. I dont have much. There is alot of fucked up shit going on at the higher levels, where wealth and decedence fester, but you arent poor because you are a victim of some system. You are poor because you are stupid, worthless, and have no experience. I was the same way. Its simply not as easy as it used to be.</p>

<p>You can work on those things and try to be a man, or you can bitch like a women and hope someone feels sorry enough for you to give you what you need. Either way there is a cut, and if you dont make it society doesnt give a fuck about you. Humanity are experts at justifing, and making exuses why they cant help their fellow man.</p>

<p>You better wise up, or you will end up a drug addict or some other person who is too weak to deal with it th reality. The weight on you shoulders is cumalitive. You have to get to level ground out of the hole, before you can even begin to think about how you will get ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All this elitism from someone who rents thier luxury at rate of 3k a month. You worked hard, you are not better than anyone else. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get sick. Don&#39;t let your family get sick. Don&#39;t slow down. Don&#39;t let that income evaporate. Don&#39;t get caught in a natural disaster, get robbed, or  ever, EVER stop. Don&#39;t let the pressure get to you, don&#39;t let it get to your partner. Keep going, keep going, you&#39;re almost there.  Your one of the good ones, one of the chosen. You work harder than most, you are a good worker.</p>

<p>Good worker, so much better than the ones who aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You live in objectivly one of the best times in human history. You are the unbroken chain of reproduction that has gone one for billions of years since the dawn of life. Your ancestors starved, fought in wars, migrated thousands of miles in search for a better life. Your ancestors lived under rocks, in trees, they began to farm, and invent their way to a better life </p>

<p>You have no idea the potential that lies within you. Stop making excuses. You are just trying to make yourself feel better, because inside you know the truth. You dont have to live like others. You dont have to embrace their ideas ir culture. You dont have to acknowledge their memes, you can do whatever it is you want. You can live and think of what you want.</p>

<p>You live in the age of freedom and abundance. Your goverent will give you free food if you do a little paper work, you have every opportunity to succedd, and one day ypu will.</p>

<p>There is a learning process to life. Nobody just gets it. Even the intelligent, ecspecially the intelligent. You have to figure things out so stop assuming you know everything. Stop assuming you know how the world works because you dont.</p>

<p>All im trying to tell you is, you need to worry about yourself and your responsabilities, before you can fix the world. Its easy to escape by critisizimg the world but the only thing you can change, atleast for right now is yourself. Once you learn your own nature, then the nature of humanity will become apparent to you. You have to become the extraordnary man or women before you can even begin to understand the nature of extraordnairy men who actually influence the world.</p>

<p>You dont have to become perfect btw. Just work on yourself and try to know thyself a little at a time. You will mess up a lot, and many times you will choose to and its alright. You arent gonna change over night, but realize that it is yourself that needs to improve, and dont worry about the world. The world isnt gonna save you, you have to save yourself.</p>

<p>Also theres nothing wrong with you. I, and litterally ever other person had to go through the same thing. It is the process of becoming man, and learning to take care of yourself.</p>

<p>Also there is literally nothing more attractive to a women then a man. Women are attracted to men who can take care of bussiness, and do what needs to be done. If you can take care of a women, she will love you for your entire life. If you are weak she will be fearful, and look for other ways out.</p>

(See hostel). But it’s also important why we should help each other out as humans. All those homeless people, somewhere down the line somebody gave up on them. It’s very sad. I guess all we can do is try to help those in need and especially those around us that we see in our every day lives. Because once it starts approaching your doorstep’s, you ain’t that far behind it.

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of capitalism is profit. They ignore the harm to the environment and the harm to the people. You think we need new iPhone, tv, laptop, car, etc every few years?

We need a united human race.</p>
