        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry, this may be long.</p>

<p>So to start, I pay attention to some of the more mainstream twitter activity occasionally, and I stumbled upon something strange. So as some of you are probably aware Kanye West has returned to twitter, and very vocally at that. I went and listened to that  song he posted on his site, and at the end, the &quot;I&quot; Lines, to me, sounded exactly like Morse code. In Morse code, the &quot;I&quot;s  translate to &quot;5 O&quot;, twice. This is a term used for cops. This seems strange to me considering the context of previous tweets about &quot;A bar that will give Ebro closure&quot;. I looked into it further, and noticed something else. His screen shots sometimes have odd timestamps. Along with this I noticed the odd nuance he has of taking a photo, screen-shotting it, and posting it seemingly hours later. I would figure most would ss and post right after. This got me to looking at the time that displays on his phone screenshots more closely. Now for the weird part, I think he might be talking in code. My theory is the time displaying on the screenshots may be correlated to bible verses. These verses, a lot of them, paint a seemingly very obvious picture of something big coming out in the industry, which i think is kid related. </p>

<p>Also another note, in the other song of his that came out yesterday, he mentions &quot;Rich L.A leakers&quot;. What would be the reasoning for that if not something was being leaked currently? I can provide more details in the comments with lots of other correlations Ive found if you are curious, but I really dont know what to make of this info. </p>

<p>Also the reason that led me to reference the times with bible verses is from all of the weird bible stuff he talks about.</p>

<p>Edit: I posted a couple examples in the comments</p>

Very few will take the time to search what you mean thus many will not put much weight to the post. (Or maybe I should speak for myself). But you have definitely sparked interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His first actual tweet back was posted on april 12th. 4: 13 Is the verse &quot;I can do all things through christ who gives me strength&quot;. Seems to apply if you are going to start something big. Second is the photo he posted of I think himself when he was young, with a description saying caption this. the photo has a odd timestamp from 10 16. The verse for that is &quot;I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.&quot; Does this seem strange to anyone else? I have more</p>

If I were as “has-been” musician and I was just about to release some new music, would it benefit me and music sales to somehow be mysteriously controversial at the moment of the release? Publicity stunts in 2018 might include any and all of this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres something else. the second tweet he tweeted after coming back is a screenshot of a shirt from his tour back in 2016, before he went into rehab. It has a timstamp of 9-19. Corinthians 9:19 is &quot;Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.&quot; this could mean he is free now, but he has been keeping something secret for fear of what would happen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So i think ive worked up a theory now, and im getting chills. I think he may be warning all of his close friends in the industry involved in illegal activity to flee the U.S., that something might be coming. All of the get up off your feet, the 5 O thing, love EVERYONE, his friend getting closure, and his newest tweet posted recently of him with a saudi prince in a vehicle driving, dancing to the song. These all seem like very strong coincidences and symbolisms to me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing about his recent Tweet with the prince I overlooked due to thinking the video was the only potential message, it was posted at 11:54. John 11:54 says this &quot;Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.&quot; This seems like a really BIG coincidence. Maybe Kanye and some others ratted out a lot of people, and is now leaving the country for protection? Id like some thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another theory Ive thought up. So from his tweets and talks hes made it apparent he wants to run for president. Everyone knows people who run get heavily scrutinized. Could he be clearing a way for his possible run for presidency? Think about this, if he knows details of illegal activities, he would get lots of praise if it came out hes the one who brought it to light. He could never run in a hollywood that is corrupt with illegal activities, it would be far too easy to slander his name or create false cases. So his best course of action if he wants to run, bring this stuff to light. But heres the thing, although hes leaking this stuff, he still most likely has friends and connections that he doesn&#39;t want to endanger or maybe wants to give a heads up to, hence the codes regarding 5 0 and running</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a Kanye tweet you can pick a verse that is the Hour:Minute it was posted or the Day:Month it was posted. That means for every tweet there are two possible verses. Those verses can then come from any of the books in the bible. That means any tweet can correspond to be referencing one of 132 possible tweets (2 * 66 books in the Christian bible.)</p>

<p>With that though, you are picking the tweets that encode these message and which don&#39;t.</p>

<p>That means if Kanye posts one tweet every day for a week, you have 924 (7 * 132) possible verses that one of those tweets could correspond to.</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be very easy for you put any meaning you want to what Kanye says.</p>

<p>Am I missing something in your methodology?</p>

It was very obvious, and especially afterwards when I realized the rest of the lyrics. The first 5 or so I searched were all screenshots, the phone clock times in the screenshot being the verse, not twitter post times. So there arent nearly as many variables. The relevant verses were all the number 1 result on google, If i have to dig im considering it not relevant. The probability for this is far lower, which is why im looking into this </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys, heres a update. I think theres more morse in his new song he linked to. Its still seemingly obvious, but much more complex and hard to decipher. It starts at about 30 seconds in, goes for over a minute. It starts on the second? esketit line, where he starts actually rapping(If you can say that). I think I have it cracked now for the most part, but could use help and input. So the Esketit is 1 unit, when he says &quot;huh&quot; after it, it denotes a 3 unit. The double huh I think is back to back 3 units, not sure though. When he says &quot;scooby doo&quot; Its a word space. My ears are too tired to comprehend and decipher it fully right now, so if anyone could help and post what you get, it would be much appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: Update post. I think im done for now, please message me or Post anything you find. I&#39;d love some feedback from some other independent researchers, to compare. It seems to go far deeper than i originally thought, if you look. Ill come back when im finished compiling all of the details. Im saving my final theory for when i am completely finished, there are some key points that I am holding till all this evidence is Concrete. That is where I messed up originally, I introduced too much info at once without a solid final theory. I think i may be in over my head, seems like it isnt just &quot;Kanye West&quot; involved, but multiple accounts and celebs. The timestamps seem to be just the tip of the iceberg, much more solid correlations Ive now found not involving them. But some are still very relevant. Also, might not only be Hollywood</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Update: This is way more planned out then I originally thought. Some people don&#39;t seem to be who they appear to be either. Different groups Are Involved, each with equally different sides and views. EM could be extremely relevant, im still not completely sure, still waiting to confirm 100%. Still digging through the data. I have also now found correlations pertaining to a potential timeline. I hope I&#39;m wrong about this but if Im not, some thing or things very significant should happen within a week. Hopefully I can work out the exact details soon. Could potentially be a few different things, but all would be equally significant. I think there could also be some mind manipulation going on, I still haven&#39;t figured this aspect out completely, but ive uncovered quite a bit of evidence now suggesting this is at least partly going on. Its also not just a singular twitter account that is involved, its quite a few. Its groups, people like to stick together. I thought going into this it was going to be primarily centered around 1 person, but I was very wrong. This seems to be planned extremely well and in advance. Things seem to be ramping up and getting Hotter. Im still formatting a master list, I dont want to put out any more fragments if possible to avoid confusion. I think this may go deeper than just hollywood, u.s. Context, subtleties and nuances. Try to focus on those. Earth can be a strange place. So many coincidences and correlations if you look and follow them. I&#39;ll try to keep you guys updated as much as possible. I also welcome and encourage all feedback. Multiple minds are always better than 1.</p>
