        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Really curious to what you guys think of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/avicii/comments/8fk8ws/suicide_avicii_did_not_kill_himself/">this thread</a> breaking down some strangeness around the Avicii suicide.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a copy-and-paste if you don&#39;t feel like clicking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe Avicii killed himself.
I&#39;ve been so heavily affected by his death that I&#39;ve been obsessively scanning news articles. Here is why things aren&#39;t adding up:</p>

<p>(1) Oman, the location. 
He died with vacationing with friends... one of the people in the group, however, is confirmed to be one of his LONGTERM BEST FRIENDS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fricko89/">https://www.instagram.com/fricko89/</a>
Here is this friend&#39;s Instagram. The last photo showed he location tagged in Oman two days before Avicii&#39;s death. If you scroll through his Instagram you can see he was with Avicii throughout his entire rise to fame. </p>

<p>Many witnesses report Avicii to be in great spirits while on holiday, so much so that he EXTENDED his vacation time there. 
Now, if you&#39;re on vacation with one of your longterm friends... would you commit suicide? Avicii was a very caring person, evident in his documentary, I seriously doubt he would do that.</p>

<p>(2) The Aftermath
Avicii&#39;s brother was initially reported everywhere to be traveling to Oman to SEEK ANSWERS, to INVESTIGATE his brother&#39;s death. A few days later, Avicii&#39;s entire family followed (sisters and other brother included). Now, why would Avicii&#39;s entire family come to Oman if this case was cut-and-dry? 
Going further...
His body was found on ROYAL PROPERTY! the mansion of a relative of the Omani Sultan. It was not found in his &quot;hotel room&quot; as the media tried to portray everywhere. In fact, Avicii had checked out of his hotel room days prior and his brother had been tracking Avicii&#39;s movements. It was also found local afternoon time.... hmm.... police were VERY quick to access that no foul play was involved, way too quick. Two autospies were immediately concluded soon after... within 2-3 days of his passing and the result that no foul play was involved was again broadcasted, before his full family even arrived at the scene and issued a cause-of-death statement </p>

<p>(3) His Music 
Prior to leaving for Oman he had invited Joe Janiak to his LA house and they spent weeks writing new batches of songs. ON THE DAY BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE TO OMAN Avicii told Joe that he&#39;d reach to him when he returned from Oman... before literally turning away to go pack his suitcase since he was leaving the next morning.
Previous collaborator Nicki Romero reports that Avicii had sent him folders via WhatsApp of new track ideas about a month or so prior to his death, wanting to collaborate on some songs. 
Many reports claim that Avicii was extremely excited about his new music and focusing on creating tracks that had a more organic and authentic feel, using actual instruments (band member of Incubus most notably discussed this)
ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS TRIP TO OMAN Avicii had a conference call with his management team in which they discussed who he would like to bring in on some tracks (vocals). Over the next few days he continued to email them regarding this. 
TWO MORE EPS were in the works. Avicii wanted to release a THREE part EP, the first part was released this past summer. </p>

<p>(4) His girlfriend
Relationship ~9 months long, planning on kids together, obviously very involved with lots of plans. It is clear he was very smitten with her little one.</p>

<p>(5) His dog
Avicii spent hours and hours and hours training his dog, Liam. Liam had a literal Instagram page. It was clear Avicii loooooooooved Liam, and I&#39;m talking about the kind of training that show dogs go through. There&#39;s some videos on his Instagram, mainly of Avicii pretending to hold a gun and Liam shadowing his movements. Just one month ago Avicii posted a video of Liam on a hike in Africa, he was constantly talking about how sentimental he felt about how fast Liam is growing... he was completely and utterly smitten with this dog. </p>

<p>BEFORE ANYONE ELSE TELLS ME THAT THIS IS NOT RESPECTFUL... SHUT UP.
The <em>most</em> respectful thing you can do is to search for truth.
The <em>least</em> respectful thing you can do is swallow media news and shut up.
If there were truly suspicious circumstances in his death... don&#39;t you think he would want justice?
His family is very clearly using very open language in their letter. 
I think it&#39;s for a reason. </p>

<p>There&#39;s something not at all right here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having suffered depression none of those things listed matter, you&#39;re so consumed by it that literally nothing else matters. It&#39;s been well documented that he suffered depression for a very long time, one day you can be planning to make more music the next you don&#39;t even want to get out of bed. I think he just succumbed to the disease I&#39;m afraid</p>

<p>I&#39;m not undermining the terrible weight of depression and its latent potential for suicide, but it&#39;s disingenuous to me, to apply that label without really examining the facts first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I still believe it should be fully investigated as there were a lot of elements in what OP described that indicated he wasn&#39;t secretly on the brink of giving up (also was it a drug overdose or other means?), the family going there and then immediately turning around and accepting the suicide verdict, while at the same time not releasing any details as to how it happened is off to me.</p>

<p>They also discussed battles with depression and anxiety heavily re: Cornell &amp; Bennington and it was enough to make everyone kind of shrug their shoulders and go &quot;oh ok, the depression monster took him in his sleep- carry on&quot;.</p>

<p>It is possible depression legitimately was responsible for all these deaths. Again, not denigrating the seriousness of depression. I still believe everything should be investigated objectively before accepting that as the verdict. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Magical illness&quot;, you&#39;re one of the fortunate people who have never experienced chronic and/or acute depression before. You&#39;re right it is magical, in how it can invisibly devastate your mind and life while never leaving a mark on you that could justify the suffering your life has become. Extreme depression can literally cause brain, heart and cardiovascular damage- despite being some intangible, made up illness in the eyes that have never been haunted by it, magical is evidently real. 
FYI- don&#39;t talk shit about what you don&#39;t understand. 
On the other hand, I agree- it&#39;s definitely used as a cover for foul play and very potentially has been here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a DJ in a large city for a number of years, I&#39;ve opened for a few big names and played small and large clubs as well as raves.</p>

<p>Free booze and drugs were the norm, always. Some have it in contract that they must have party favors, others will say they won&#39;t go on unless they get this or that, despite contracts. These guys were making anywhere from a few hundred dollars a night, up to 100k a gig depending on how big they were.</p>

<p>Drugs and booze were standard, period. You don&#39;t get to play gigs without smoozing a promoter in the back room and you do that by doing coke with him or his buddies, that&#39;s the way it is. I&#39;ve seen super shit DJs play all over the States because they have a good cocaine connection and have the ability to speak to anyone, not because they are good at what they do, but because they know the right people and have the gift of gab.</p>

<p>The club world is overflowing with cocaine and drugs, it what runs the people that pay to get in, it&#39;s what the promoters are doing, it&#39;s what the artists are doing. Getting caught up in it all is so very easy. Staying sober through it All? Good fucking luck. He was a kid with a problem and in this industry there are no sober nights. </p>

<p>I feel this is a distraction from what I dunno but are we really surprised that this kid ODs after living the life for so long? It took me years to get sober and I left the scene completely. I feel for his family and his dog, but he had a choice and chose to relapse it happens every hour of every day.</p>
