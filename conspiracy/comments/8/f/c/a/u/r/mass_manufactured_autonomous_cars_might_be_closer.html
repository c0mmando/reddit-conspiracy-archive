        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Im sure you all have seen the new commercial for the Nissan Leaf, its &quot;revolutionizing&quot; driving by being the first car to have one pedal for accelerating and decelerating/braking. </p>

<p>Now while this may seem confusing it also introduces Nissan&#39;s new &quot;advanced auto-pilot&quot; system that Tesla, Subaru, and VW all use. TO sum it up, it has cameras and sensors to where you set your Cruise control and cameras lock on to the car in front of you. As the car brakes your car brakes automatically, it can even come to a complete stop (I can vouch for this as I own a Subaru with EyeSight). I set a max speed and distance from the car in front of me and it will keep that distance between me and the car. </p>

<p>Now Tesla and Nissans Cruise controls are different than subaru and VW&#39;s because these two can steer to keep your car in the lanes automatically, it will even switch lanes for you. When you want to switch lanes you put on your turn signal and the car will change lanes when safe automatically.</p>

<p>Now the reason why the Nissan Leaf is different, is because of the one pedal. Most might find the pedal confusing and turn to the Auto-Pilot for driving instead. Lets be honest why worry about distance or speed when the computers can do it for you.</p>

<p>This brings me back to my main point, as more and more people become okay with a computer driving for them and making these autopilots more widespread, this in turn will allow car companies to bring in completely autonomous cars without the huge uproar of something being fully autonomous.</p>

<p>This Nissan Leaf is essentially a gateway into mass manufacturing fully autonomous cars. </p>

<p>Now I am no way saying we will see fully autonomous cars next year because there are going to be a shitload of laws and restrictions put into place before mass production, but I think we can expect to see self driving cars in the very close future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with you.  It is fairly evident we are currently in the threshold between manual and autonomous vehicles and being gently conditioned to accept and be comfortable with it.  I give it 5 years, tops, and we it will become difficult to purchase a new vehicle without this type of tech.  I&#39;ve already told my 9 year old daughter that she will likely never have to learn to &#39;drive&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I think we all forget out how incredibly dangerous driving is. We think it’s so casual but it’s actual more like some sort of gladiator pit on the freeway. People get in wrecks and are swept off to the side so the other gladiators can fly over concrete in a metal box. It’ll be interesting once this shift happens. </p>

<p>Not necessarily. They might just lose their insurance, or sell their cars to whoever fabricated them (so they can reuse parts of the car for fabricating autonomous cars).</p>

<p>I suppose you can&#39;t follow your own logic. Self driving cars will be cheap, with big insurance. Non-self driving cars will be expensive with no insurance. Guess what 95% of people will choose?
