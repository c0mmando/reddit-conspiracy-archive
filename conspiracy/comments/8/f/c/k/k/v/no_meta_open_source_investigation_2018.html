All meta content must be in replies to the sticky comment.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>The purpose of this post is to conduct an open source investigation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_inter-Korean_summit">2018 inter-Korean summit</a> on April 27, 2018 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea/korean-leaders-aim-for-end-of-war-complete-denuclearization-after-historic-summit-idUSKBN1HX2I6">Reuters</a>). In the main discussion (i.e. everywhere but the sticky thread), users should gather evidence and make arguments about the summit, who all the interested parties are and what each of them hope to get out of these talks. Specifically, what do each of North Korea, South Korea, the US, China, Japan, Russia, the UK, etc. want from the North Korea situation, and what do factions within these and other countries want from it. </p>

<p>Some other useful information might be a history of the Korean Peninsula and its relations within and between foreign nations. The more sources and pieces of evidence we can gather here, the more we can understand the situation.</p>

<p>All sources, positions, and arguments are welcome, but there must be no commentary about this sub, its users, or conspiracy theorists in general in the main threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing off the top of my head just now, but honestly, pretty much any topic could work with this. Anything that is worthy of discussion, general conspiracies, recent events, recent conspiracies,....is worthy of a &#39;No Meta&#39; thread. </p>

<p>The greatest magic would happen if people could flair their own threads as &#39;No meta&#39; and then have a bot make a stickied comment, where the only meta discussion allowed would be replies to this bot (similar to the archive.is automod posts). Any violations would be strictly moderated and removed.</p>

<p>The only real problem I see with this is that it would make the work load of the moderators even bigger. It&#39;s probably hard as it is for you guys, this would only mean more moderation. But ultimately that is the case with any rule expansion and desire to make this sub better - it all leads to greater workloads for the mods.</p>

<p>Honestly the mods here should be payed, especially considering many of the shills likely are receiving a paycheck themselves.....</p>

<p>This is, indeed, my long-term plan. The automod code is easy enough to write, so that&#39;s not a big issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the work load of the moderators even bigger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no. Once we get the specifics of this worked out through more trials, I think actually moderating on a meta/no meta basis is actually easier to do objectively and quickly as compared to our current ruleset. If these threads are modded aggressively in the early stages, users will know what to expect and what is expected of them as we roll it out. Users who repeatedly violate the [no meta] tags will be banned, or what I like even better, just prohibited from posting in the [no meta] threads. \</p>

<p>The other idea I have, maybe as a temporary restriction or maybe indefinitely, is to have any [no meta] post a user makes be immediately removed by automod to await approval or rejection by the mods. We would then have a specific and limited list of reasons we could reject such a post, and all others would have to be approved. Reasons for rejection would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>breaking site-wide or sub-wide rules</li>
<li>common repost of something discussed in the last 7 days</li>
<li>unnecessarily inflammatory (OP should have a chance to reword)</li>
<li>maybe a few others as practice dictates</li>
</ul>

<p>If the mods can&#39;t justify removal based on one of these reasons, it has to be approved. That way, anyone could make their own [no meta] post for whatever discussion they wanted to have, but it would be limited so that they don&#39;t clutter the queues. </p>

<p>On this you do kind of have a point, and I know you said it at least half in jest, but I wouldn&#39;t want that at all. I like to think I can be and mostly am objective when it comes to modding here, but I know any type of financial incentive would cloud that objectivity, both for me and my fellow mods. </p>

<p>My reward will be a sub where people can intelligently and civilly discuss conspiracies and theories thereof, and that would be reward enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see that, it&#39;s just as always, time and energy spent are an issue. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how much time and energy moderating eats up, as I&#39;ve never been a mod of any subreddit on this site (or any forum whatsoever really), but I&#39;m sure it can be draining dealing with people, some of which are even paid to provoke, for any period of time (and even here I doubt it&#39;s just minutes per day).</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably seeing this too much from my personal viewpoint, but to me, contributing, writing, expressing yourself is one thing and an enjoyable one at that (even if you aren&#39;t getting paid for it), but being a cyber police officer is quite different. </p>

<p>Of course again, there is always the fact that you are making a huge contribution to the community by being said cyber policeman, as that helps conversations thrive and makes insightful discussions at all possible - which can spur you on to keep doing it, as is the case with any &quot;job&quot; that makes the world a better place in some way. It&#39;s just that, as far as I see it, it&#39;s far more draining than being a contributor. </p>

<p>Also, as said, there can be a problem with time for some, but then again I have no idea how much time being a moderator takes - it&#39;s possible I&#39;m blowing this out of proportion and it doesn&#39;t take that much time at all.</p>

<p>Oh, I see it the same way. I love contributing and interacting as a user far more than I do modding. If I could snap my fingers and know this sub would be modded to my liking without me having to do it, I&#39;d take that deal in a heartbeat. </p>

<p>I have no desire to have authority over others, even in the incredibly limited role as a mod of this sub, yet I do feel a certain responsibility for the sub to be well modded so that you and I and others like us can have civil discussion of a certain quality without all the bullshit that is inevitable on an open forum of this size and with this contentious of subject matter. I&#39;m not a mod here because I <em>want</em> to be, but because I see the need for this sub to be well-modded, and I believe I can (and do) do a good job at it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>For sure, but I don&#39;t let it weigh that heavily. I mostly try to appreciate and focus on the good content here, such as your own, and generally let the filth just wash off of me. It only gets draining when you let it be, and when that did happen, I took a two month break. </p>

<p>and you might be completely right. That&#39;s why I&#39;m just taking this one step at a time at this point and seeing where it goes. If nothing else, we&#39;ll at least get some good discussions out about this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &quot;evidence,&quot; not necessarily &quot;proof,&quot; which is almost impossible to attain. </p>

<p>For example, if a user&#39;s history consists of nothing but going to various subs and defending GMOs, another user can make a comment in this sticky thread presenting that as evidence, and suggesting that person might be a shill for Monsanto or others. </p>

<p>Personal attacks and abusive language are still not permitted, but a person can present evidence that a user <em>who has commented in the thread</em> might be a shill or a troll, (that is, you can&#39;t just call out someone who hasn&#39;t participated in the current thread.) </p>

<p>Once per user per post, a user can reply to a comment in the main discussion with a link to a comment in the sticky thread. So if I made some comment in the main thread, and you thought I was a shill, you could make a reply to a sticky thread calling that out. Let&#39;s pretend your current comment is the one calling me out. Then, in the main thread, you could reply to one of my comments with only the link to your comment in the sticky thread. So your reply in the main discussion would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8fckkv/no_meta_open_source_investigation_2018/dy4vpxy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8fckkv/no_meta_open_source_investigation_2018/dy4vpxy/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just that link. This way, someone reading through the thread would know that someone is making a meta comment relative to a user or a comment, but would not know anything else about that meta comment unless the reader actively follows the link, or opens the meta thread on their own.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ll try to make an example post which shows this more clearly in action. </p>

<p>Fair - sorry, didn&#39;t mean to put words in your mouth. Just misread. </p>

<p>I speak out of concern because, while I agree with a good 40% of the conspiracies I read on the sub, I tend to only comment on the ones I disagree with. So, to be clear, there would not be a scenario where, for example, if I comment on a particular aspect of investigation that I&#39;m critical of and doesn&#39;t bear much weight, no one would link to a thread where I spoke ill of a different conspiracy just to say, &quot;He&#39;s a skeptic, doesn&#39;t believe in anything, he&#39;s a shill,&quot; right? Whatever evidence people provide has to be related to the subject at hand?</p>

<p>Either way, you have got to Hand it to Trump and his team for this Q business, Trump has earned a very loyal following. The more items that Q predicts or talks about that come forth, the more the Q Phenomenon will expand thus more Trump supporters for the next election.</p>

<p>It has me intrigued to be honest.  </p>

<p>There was some cabal of self described witches who were in to occult shit and got caught currying favors from government positions. The cabal refused to leave office despite being caught but the public rallied to some incredible extent to force the issue and won... Or that&#39;s how it appeared to me.</p>

<p>This should have been a gigantic story akin to the Arab spring but even more so! I&#39;d love to see a book or documentary made in English from people close to the event.</p>

<p>What the hell was that cabal? How were they caught? How did the public feel about it before during and after the reveal? How much was revealed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your point. The most important part of the &quot;getting rid of the cult&quot; story was the impeachment and imprisonment of Park Geun-hye. Park Geun-hye is the daughter of a former South Korean dictator and was despised by North Korea for that, her political views and her hawkishness on North Korea. </p>

<p>As her replacement, they elected Moon Jae-In; a liberal peacenik who was expelled from university for organizing protests against said dictator. Moon campaigned on improving relations with North Korea and has been dovish on the North for pretty much his whole life. So yes, of course getting rid of the cult in the form of impeaching Park Geun-hye and electing Moon Jae-In led to peace talks. I don&#39;t see the conspiratorial angle here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the feeling that KJU&#39;s health is much, much worse than even our media is letting on (and they&#39;re saying he&#39;s pretty damn sick). As much as a piece of shit as the Kim family is, KJU has always been an outlier, growing up in Switzerland essentially, and having a clear penchant for western culture, even though it&#39;s not always obvious. His BFF is Dennis Rodman for god&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>So this makes me wonder if Kim is trying to at least trying something to build his country back up, but I&#39;m not optimistic at all. It will be a long time before the people of NK see any actual benefits from any of this. If any sanctions get lifted too, that money will not trickle down.</p>

Look at most of the middle east for example, the amount of historical artifacts and structures that can be visited is stunning. Plus, take the Dubai method and start building little resort towns in some of these places and you start building economies. Obviously that is all a very long ways away, but it&#39;s worth mentioning that Vietnam is one of the hottest tourist destinations and that&#39;s only been possible for the past 20 years.</p>

<p>This is the part of the puzzle that I am the most curious about. Did someone working for the US or Chinese intelligence agencies set off one of the NKs nukes inside of the test facility to trigger the collapse?</p>

<p>It really is the most elegant of the solutions. Destroy the facility with their own bomb. Make it know that regardless of how secret things are, someone can get to you/them. It solves the issue of their nuclear program and sends an extremely strong message, all while providing enough plausible deniability that NK cant just start launching missiles. </p>

<p>* tl;dr version is that the CIA fed info on rocket tests to a known Russian mole. In it, they mention an &quot;Ingredient X&quot; to increase power and efficiency. Of course, &quot;Ingredient X&quot; wasn&#39;t actually being used, since it was highly dangerous to make and unstable to boot. Russia gets busy experimenting to find out what &quot;Ingredient X&quot; could be, and apparently invents it by irradiating a particularly poisonous form of mercury. Their attempts to manufacture &quot;Ingredient X&quot; may have resulted in a well-known nuclear accident in the 80s. If NK got their hands on the research (or as a turnabout were fed the info by Russia), it&#39;s possible that NK not only destroyed their facility, but poisoned an enormous area with a radioactive and extremely potent neurotoxin as well. </p>

<li>Proxy wars make money and if successful are good for business</li>
<li>Just like the Herbalife store or nail salon, money needs to be laundered. Not drug dealer laundered, but corporate laundering. NK was one of the last open countries to accept anyone&#39;s money. </li>
<li>Let&#39;s not forget that NK was the rightful government to Korea. USA set up the (financially ) successful southern regime. </li>
<li>Assassinations are not uncommon on both sides.</li>
<li>The airplane bombing was just a false flag set up by CIA to make a war. Didn&#39;t work.</li>
<li>President Mr. Park was murdered by a general who wanted reunification. </li>
<li>Parks daughter was also president. She did not identify as heterosexual and found comfort in her BFF. This later got exposed as a scandal of shamanism (Korean way of saying non Christian cult) so she was thrown in jail. She was against reunification. </li>
<li>Sewol was torpedoed. Boats do not hit unknown rocks in daily shipping channels. </li>
<li>The island was knowingly bombed a few years prior. </li>
<li>Kim&#39;s brother was assassinated. Official story: NK targeted him. Unofficial: CIA flexed</li>
<li>The odd earthquakes lately are not natural at all. NK underground nukes set off a series of tremors down the BaekDu mountain range.</li>
<li>Kim went to china on a train. </li>
<li>CIA director visited Kim in his city. </li>
<li>Black money gets laundered through NK.</li>
<li>NK has mineral resources and Human Resources... cheapest labor in the world. Bangladesh is getting pricier every day. </li>
<li>Reports of NK nuke facility having a catastrophic event with many researchers dying. </li>
<li>The war is not in memory of any ruling person. Nobody really wants this stress. </li>
<li>Pence did not acknowledge NK at the Olympics </li>
<li>Although separated, NK also asserts jurisdiction on the islands off the coast that are disputed by Japan along with SK. With a weakening Japan, Korea is prime to rise up and take back once and for all the outlying islands. </li>
<li>USA wants to surround china. NK has always welcomed unification, but with the condition USA goes. Up until now that wasn&#39;t going to happen. </li>
<li>USA is getting pissed at SK business. Samsung and Apple are always suing and GM must close shop because SK can&#39;t control the labor unions. </li>
<li>Except china, all East Asian countries were US supported governments. </li>
<li>Otto actually was a spy from the Z society or whatever. The media spun it as drunk frat boy. </li>
<li>US citizens are conditioned to believe NK is evil, stupid, poor, and thoughtless. This is not the case. people in the north are still people. The government is run by very smart, intentional, rich players. </li>
<li>There is a wall</li>
<li>Most SK wanted socialism and still do</li>
<li>THAAD was installed</li>
<li>Hawaii was gonna get bombed but THAAD worked! </li>
<li>The world bank can finally close the NK black market</li>
</ol>

<p>Read up on Gwangju and Jeju Massacres. USA backed genocides in SK. 
SK government consists of USA military by constitution. </p>

<p>TLDR; both puppet governments are shills for outside power. The outside powers at turning the tables on this game of chess. </p>

<p>I think this is key to understanding the situation. The US likes the idea of a rouge state on China&#39;s doorstep, because it gives them a reason to have so many military assets in SK and Japan. A unified Korea would diminish the US&#39; sphere of influence in the region. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to tell people about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_(Christian_organization">&quot;The Fellowship Foundation&quot;</a>) a secretive evangelical network in the halls of government and business.  They&#39;re described by some as an &quot;underground state department.&quot;</p>

<p>They had some role to play in similar things in the past:
(Doug Coe was the longtime leader before hs recent death) </p>

<p>“Most of my friends are bad people,” Mr. Coe told the New Yorker in 2010, in one of the few interviews to which he consented. “They all broke the Ten Commandments, as far as I can tell.” But, he remarked, “Jesus even met with the Devil.”</p>

<p>According to Lindsay’s book, the Fellowship was regarded in some circles as an “underground State Department,” playing roles in the 1978 Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel and the brokerage of a peace agreement between Rwanda and Congo in 2002.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/doug-coe-spiritual-power-broker-who-convened-national-prayer-breakfast-dies-at-88/2017/02/22/3015d978-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.d42f60882526">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/doug-coe-spiritual-power-broker-who-convened-national-prayer-breakfast-dies-at-88/2017/02/22/3015d978-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.d42f60882526</a></p>

<p>Additionally, Sam Brownback (among others) made religious freedom trips to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sam+brownback+sudan+trips&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;amp;oq=sam+brownback+sudan+trips&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5649j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Sudan for years</a> (and other places) before its forming into 2 Sudans and plunging the south into civil war.  He is in <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120746516">the Fellowship</a> and now he is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/us/sam-brownback-kansas-ambassador.html">Ambassador for International Religious Freedom,</a> part of the State Dept.</p>

<p>Mike Pence, who won the evangelical vote for Trump and had a huge role in picking cabinet positions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VojMwT-CzrA">is a member.</a> Now we have the most <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=most+evangelical+cabinet+ever&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;amp;oq=most+evangelical+cabinet+ever&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5784j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">evangelical cabinet ever</a> .  In my opinion, I think it runs worse into [dominionist territory.}(<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/15/mike-pence-will-be-the-most-powerful-christian-supremacist-in-us-history/">https://theintercept.com/2016/11/15/mike-pence-will-be-the-most-powerful-christian-supremacist-in-us-history/</a>)</p>

<p>Mike Pompeo, like Brownback is from Kansas and largely fits the ideological profile, was the head of the State Department, and is now heading the CIA.  He made trips to North Korea.  Mike Pence, a member of the Fellowship, made trips to North Korea.  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sam+brownback+north+korea&amp;amp;rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&amp;amp;oq=sam+brownback+north+korea&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5832j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Sam Brownback has been working on North Korea for years.</a></p>

<p>tl;dr <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120746516">The Fellowship Foundation</a> probably had a significant, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-defends-religious-liberty-home-abroad-national-prayer/story?id=52928144">behind the scenes role in the Korean peace talks.</a> (I don&#39;t have any articles implying that, but Trump is tight with the group)</p>

<p>There&#39;s more, but it&#39;s late and I gotta go to bed.  Hopefully this adds to the discussion, which I will return to tomorrow.  The Korean peace possibilities are historic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call me a nut but I&#39;m starting to think nk(and maybe even sk to an extent) is a &quot;controlled&quot; by deep state players and this whole sharade is a play to distract from Syria and the real plan. The same way Isis is pumped up or toned down at times, nk is operated in the same way.</p>

<p>For example: trump uses Moab on Isis to make him seem like a great president, and people praise him. Then they say &quot;trump is winning against Isis&quot; and they goes into the background not to be mentioned. Then they say Assad is using chemical weapons, but ignore that if they attack Assad, then trump is actually helping Isis/rebels.</p>

<p>So with NK to get people off trumps back, they say &quot;oh look what trumps doing in NK, Kim wants to talk! He&#39;s doing a great thing&quot; now Syria is in the background. Who know she what&#39;s going on there now. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t qanon start some rumors about NK being a soros controlled place? Sounds absurd but what if the entire place is used for political theater?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(before you dismiss this, I ask of you to <em>consider the following</em>) It is curious to see that you guys have finally gotten out a post like this that rules all &#39;meta&#39; out with heavy moderation, which is an excellent idea--but funnily enough, not on a topic that is as seemingly controversial as where it had gotten to an extent that, for whatever reason, banning of users was required (there is a line before harassment that still allows for indirect blaming/reasonable name-calling, or in other words accusation, if you understand). I understand that even under such a parent idea like this, there may be heavy dispute regarding those who have evidently, objectively, and logically disprovable opinions that they are yet still willing to push (which is what I had seen happen on a recent sticky post), and I see that such a label/rule on a post was enacted (I am new here, I&#39;m not sure if this has happened before, if so, please inform me) on an idea regarding recent news. I can see this going in a direction toward the goal that the subreddit hopes to achieve, and this is only a logical step to take.</p>

<p>On a very recent sticky-post, there had been in it an idea that had generated dispute to the level of name-calling, heavy accusation, and outright conflict. This conflict, however, was happening on both sides of belief regarding the conspiracy theory that the post suggested. Unfortunately, I recall a user who had gone to the extent of applying his sound knowledge of the topic, albeit with some accusations and name-calls directed toward the opposer(but that is to be expected at the level of frustration I can easily imagine that user was at), and he had gone to the point where the opposer had lent toward the accusation that he was simply &#39;cheating,&#39; &#39;playing it all out,&#39; or simply lying. We can all at first glance see this as outright unreasonable, considering that the ideas and evidence the user was providing was sound and proven. We must realize that his basis was not to insult, rather it was it refute. Isn&#39;t this allowable? Was he banished from the subreddit simply due to the event that the opposer&#39;s feelings were probably hurt? I by all means do not wish to allow anywhere the act of harassment or any kind of it, but that was not harassment by any means. All he was doing was the refutation of the opposer&#39;s claims by means of objective evidence and plentiful sources for it, which lays unreasonable the fact that he was banned solely for his insults, whom had not at all been the central idea of his comments.</p>

<p>Off-topic, yes, but <em>come on.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be somewhat skeptical of an actual &quot;bombing,&quot; but I would not be terribly surprised if it were sabotaged. The US (and likely Israel) did something quite similar to Iran&#39;s nuclear program with STUXNET, using a computer hack to physically manipulate the centrifuges into destroying themselves.</p>

<p>If it were sabotaged, we&#39;ll still need to know who was responsible for the sabotage, and at that point, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to just say &quot;the US.&quot; Which faction in the US, and with the help or knowledge of which allies? I could also see a scenario in which China would sabotage NK&#39;s program, because an unified Korea without US troops in it is good for China. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>is it possible that China and Russia want stability on the Korean penninsula so that they can focus on developing their new military-economic partnership, which is both intended and perceived as a threat to the US?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US should take notice of China and Russia&#39;s increasingly close military ties, a top Chinese official said Tuesday. Gen. Wei Fenghe, China&#39;s new defense minister, gave the remarks in Moscow following a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, according to Russian state news agency TASS.</p>

<p>&quot;I am visiting Russia as a new defense minister of China to show the world a high level of development of our bilateral relations and firm determination of our armed forces to strengthen strategic cooperation,&quot; Wei said. &quot;The Chinese side has come (to Moscow) to show Americans the close ties between the armed forces of China and Russia ... we&#39;ve come to support you.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the last year, Russia and China have held joint naval drills in the South China Sea and the Baltics, as well as joint missile defense drills, according to the AP.</p>

<p>China and Russia have long supported each other&#39;s positions on North Korea and Syria at the United Nations, and Beijing increased its support for Moscow after the West imposed sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea, CNN reported. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The volume of trade between Russia and China has been rapidly growing, with an already 30-percent increase in the first quarter of 2018. The sides aim to boost trade to $200 billion by 2020.</p>

<p>China is Russia’s largest trading partner, accounting for 15 percent of Russian international trade last year. </p>

<p>In January, trade turnover grew to 17.2 percent. It is expected to exceed the $100-billion mark this year, according to the deputy chairman of China’s Ministry of Commerce. In 2017, bilateral trade amounted to $84.1 billion, up by 19 percent year-on-year, he said at a press conference on Friday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Europe’s oil refineries are increasingly missing out on Russian crude as the world’s biggest energy producer directs more and more barrels by pipeline to China.</p>

<p>Russia will ship an average of 19 percent less crude through its main ports on the Baltic and Black Seas in the first five months of 2018 compared with a year earlier, according to loading plans obtained by Bloomberg. Meanwhile piped flows to China soared 43 percent in the first three months, the most recent data from state operator Transneft PJSC show.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Noting that China and Russia have firmly supported each other in safeguarding their core national interests, and further strengthened political mutual trust, Xi said the two countries are strategic partners that have truly placed trust in each other,” China’s state-run Xinhua news agency reported at the time.</p>

<p>Areas of increased co-operation are likely to include the development of a free trade agreement for the Asia Pacific region, as well as increased bilateral trade in the fields of energy, investment, technology, aviation, aerospace and infrastructure.</p>

<p>A closer alignment of security objectives, particularly in promoting so-called cyber sovereignty - to counterbalance to what is seen as increasingly bellicose behaviour from the US, Nato and Japan - is also expected.</p>

<p>So, yeah. Based on this, I&#39;m increasingly skeptical whether Trump/the US actually had anything to do with NK/SK peace talks. It seems more likely that it was engineered by Russia and China and Trump either a) jumped on the bandwagon to make it look like the US had some role in it, b) participated in talks so that the US could have some skin in the game with Russia &amp; China, or c) both of the above.</p>
