Just a few months ago we were being threatened with nuclear annihilation and now we’re entering peace talks and denuclearization? What the hell happened? </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong I am happy for it but my happiness is tempered by a fear that this is all a game and that NK is going to flip this on us in no time. </p>

<p>I don’t know maybe I’m totally off base and should just be happy but my gut tells me to be hesitant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a reluctance to let go of a boogyman, but more of a understanding of history and the prior actions the NK regime has taken. For decades, the routine has been to make feints towards war, get the world&#39;s attention, make some symbol of possible decency, receive a benefit for the symbol, fail to fulfill their obligations, wash, rinse, repeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with the precious minerals that NK are sitting on. In an article last year it was said there are $6-10 trillion worth yet to be mined. I think that it has only just been found out and now the rest of the world are making the manouveres to get to this wealth. IMO option 1 was the propaganda of war to justify the US and over allies going in. But actually option 2 has happened. NK has softened it&#39;s stance and now they will allow the powers that be to come in </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US agreed to go easy on NK and allow China to get first pick of their resources as long as China didn&#39;t retaliate against Trumps economic policies and tariffs.  In the end it&#39;s a net gain for everyone.  China gets massive resources, the Kim&#39;s get a ton of money, and the US gets the credit and some trade benefits</p>

<p>I have a similar theory! Gonna paste a comment I wrote in /news awhile back. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Want a fun conspiracy theory?</p>

<p>We put a orbital kinetic weapon into space in September 2017 with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/07/spacex-us-air-force-shuttle-mission">top secret launch</a> then hit them with it twice in October 2017, causing major damage to their test facilities and <a href="https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1D018L">killing hundreds</a>. The first strike was to cause damage, the second was while rescue was underway. </p>

<p>General Mattis <a href="https://amp.businessinsider.com/mattis-secret-military-options-for-north-korea-2017-9">let slip a hint</a> in September 2017 that this was something considered as a possible option.</p>

<p><a href="https://amp.businessinsider.com/mattis-secret-military-options-for-north-korea-2017-9">Project Thor</a> has been a concept since the 1950s, and kinetic weapons were used in Vietnam with success, though not from orbit. They were referred to as <a href="https://amp.businessinsider.com/mattis-secret-military-options-for-north-korea-2017-9">Lazy Dogs</a></p>

<p>TL;DR: We crippled NK testing facilities with a weapon that makes nukes look like antiques and leaves little evidence of use. Kim spins this as two back to back quakes that just happen to hit these facilities at just the right times, even though they don&#39;t look much like quakes caused by nuke testing. The US allows the story to ride but Kim knows he&#39;s fucked whenever we want with no way to detect or respond to the threat. So it&#39;s time to play nice.</p>
