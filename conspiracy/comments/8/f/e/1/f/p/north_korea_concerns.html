       So I really don’t like to be negative about a possible end to the North Korean regime, but is anyone else super skeptical about this? Just a few months ago we were being threatened with nuclear annihilation and now we’re entering peace talks and denuclearization? What the hell happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t get me wrong I am happy for it but my happiness is tempered by a fear that this is all a game and that NK is going to flip this on us in no time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know maybe I’m totally off base and should just be happy but my gut tells me to be hesitant.

       I don't think it's a reluctance to let go of a boogyman, but more of a understanding of history and the prior actions the NK regime has taken. For decades, the routine has been to make feints towards war, get the world's attention, make some symbol of possible decency, receive a benefit for the symbol, fail to fulfill their obligations, wash, rinse, repeat.

       Kim Jong Il did this for decades. His son has done this for about 7 years now... This isn't just "the past", but a well established tends that has continued into current times, with no visible signal that or has changed. Sure, it might not be true this time, but it has been true "these days", and there's no reason to believe it's not true today.

       So, are you willing to concede then, that the "times are fast changing" comment does not truly factor into this discussion, since NK has shown not just a long history of this behavior, but that their behavior has been consistent and constant, carrying up into current day, and that there are no indications that this current event is a deviation from their historic norms?

       I think it has to do with the precious minerals that NK are sitting on. In an article last year it was said there are $6-10 trillion worth yet to be mined. I think that it has only just been found out and now the rest of the world are making the manouveres to get to this wealth. IMO option 1 was the propaganda of war to justify the US and over allies going in. But actually option 2 has happened. NK has softened it's stance and now they will allow the powers that be to come in

       The US agreed to go easy on NK and allow China to get first pick of their resources as long as China didn't retaliate against Trumps economic policies and tariffs.  In the end it's a net gain for everyone.  China gets massive resources, the Kim's get a ton of money, and the US gets the credit and some trade benefits

        then hit them with it twice in October 2017, causing major damage to their test facilities and

        TL;DR: We crippled NK testing facilities with a weapon that makes nukes look like antiques and leaves little evidence of use. Kim spins this as two back to back quakes that just happen to hit these facilities at just the right times, even though they don't look much like quakes caused by nuke testing. The US allows the story to ride but Kim knows he's fucked whenever we want with no way to detect or respond to the threat. So it's time to play nice.

       Keep in mind: The same people responsible for your fear of a “Nuclear North Korea Gone Mad” are the same people that have been selling “Russia is omnipotent and omnipresent, and are hacking your elections, and affecting your everyday life in ways you can’t imagine.”
Perhaps the only thing that’s changed is that they’ve stopped selling the NK bogeyman story?
