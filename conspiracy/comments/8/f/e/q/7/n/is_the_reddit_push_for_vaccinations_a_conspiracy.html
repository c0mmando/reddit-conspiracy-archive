       Definitely a part of it.

       Because if you question vaccines you're one of the "others", and nobody wants to be part of the "others".

       The funny thing is, you can't really question vaccines because they have about I dunno like 50-60 years of evidence to prove they are doing their job so

       Nobody disputes that vaccines are incredible medical discoveries. However, do people have a right to be skeptical as to what is in them?
      </p>
      <p>
       The CDC has been caught altering or hiding data regarding links to autism in certain vaccines. That's not particularly cool, IMO.

       But you can question vaccines as they are not side effect free and we need to encourage the discussion of their safety.

       Too many parents believe there are no side effects to these vaccinations which is ultimately untrue.

       I just think it’s weird that people get so passionate or think it’s their place to tell others what to put in their body. I have no horse in the race as I have no kids but good on those who are calling out the insanity of injecting children with a bunch of bullshit. To each their own but if they refuse, I support that, and vice versa.

       You say this as though it's the only other option. Don't like vaccines? Then you love to see children die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most "anti-vaxxers" are not against vaccines, they are for SAFE vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines aren't some magical elixir that is safe and side effect free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine manufacturers are currently exempt from any lawsuits from the children who suffer extreme and life debilitating damages. As long as we continue that exemption, they are under no obligation to produce safe vaccines because they are not liable for damages.

       both.  there's the pushing of bad tech by the paid promoters of it.  and there's the cult of groupthink that is convinced of their own rectitude, conditioned and programmed into shaming anyone else who doesn't abide by their beliefs.  it's ironic on many levels - not least because you have a group who thinks it's right, but is wrong, and who waves the flag of rationalism and science but can't walk the talk they lack the mental tools.  it's pretty amazing.  can't wait till that tipping point where people finally figure out how staggeringly deceived they've been.  but of course, that moment only truly happens if you can reason on your own.  all those who are permanently in a state of deferring thought to others will be endlessly led along by this cult of shame and groupthink, forever unable to discern the bars of the cage they choose to endure.

       My grandmother being an 2nd lieutenant nurse during WW2, then a nurse as a civilian responded to my question of would she rather be in the good old days or now presently...Her opinion is that the good ol days people fucking died from crazy ass diseases, modern medicine has changed that. We don’t see the consequences of not vaccinating for whooping cough, or what ever ailments you want to fill in for, we haven’t seen mass deaths because of some disease and people suffering.
Imo I think we should question everything because medicine is the practice of medicine not just pure truth of it.

       I’m sure everyone here has seen the hundreds of commercials for medications that you should “ask the doctor if it’s right for you.” The side effects are horrendous and they run the entire length of the commercial. It’s bipolar advertising where they are telling you it’s right for you while simultaneously saying that it could kill you, cause amputations, internal bleeding, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure everyone here has also seen the hundreds of commercials for class action attorneys filing lawsuits against the manufacturers of those same drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes anyone believe that vaccines are safe when every one of their other medications cause severe side effects?
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is, vaccines are mandatory. You don’t get a say in the matter. There is supposed to be Informed Consent with ALL medications. You should receive all of the known risks and side effects of taking ANY medication and have the right to say no if you feel the risks outweigh the benefits. With mandatory vaccines, you are denied that right and refusing to allow the doctor to administer the vaccine could result in your child not being allowed an education or even having CPS take your child from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also can’t sue the vaccine manufacturers because they are exempt from lawsuits. You have to go to the US Vaccine Court where damages are capped and there is no fault found with the manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the fact that pro-vaccine advocates claim vaccines are safe, almost $4 billion in damages has been paid out by the Vaccine Court. Most of that money comes from the tax payers.

       Just compare the cdc’s vaccine schedule from the 1980’s to what they push today. The 1983 schedule called for 24 doses whereas today it strictly calls for 70 doses of vaccines before a child turns 18. Are all those 80’s children disease riddled dangers to society because they had less than half the vaccines pumped in their veins? I’ve never heard of, much less met, an 80’s child who contracted a disease that could have been prevented by injecting more vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have we doubled the amount of injections in this short time because of some mass epidemic that I don’t know about? Or is it possible that there is a monetary influence between the pharmaceutical companies and the cdc? We see this all the time between regulatory bodies and businesses, if we’re not surprised when the fcc is working with the internet providers, why be surprised that the cdc is working with the pharmaceutical makers?  The more time I spend on Earth, the more I realize there’s little that won’t be done when there’s profits to be had.
