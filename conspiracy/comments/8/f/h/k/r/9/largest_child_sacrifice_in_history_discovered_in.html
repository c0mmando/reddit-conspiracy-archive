        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: Many people like to ignore the dark part of history that many ancient cultures practiced child sacrifice. They did this to their &quot;gods&quot; because they believed it was required, and for favor. Recently in Peru they have finished uncovering one of the biggest child sacrifice sites ever found with hundred of bodies.</p>

<p><a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/04/27/americas/peru-largest-child-sacrifice/index.html?__twitter_impression=true">https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/04/27/americas/peru-largest-child-sacrifice/index.html?__twitter_impression=true</a></p>

<p>The skeletal remains of more than 140 children and 200 baby llamas were found on the country&#39;s northern coast.
<em>The children ranged in age from 5 to 14, according to the report. The baby llamas were less than 18 months old.&quot;Skeletal remains of both children and animals show evidence of cuts to the sternum as well as rib dislocations,&quot; the report says</em></p>

<p><em>The children had their faces smeared with a red cinnabar-based pigment, the report says, which took place during the ceremony before their chests were cut open, most likely to remove their hearts</em></p>

<p>Many other cultures also did:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-01-23-ancient-carthaginians-really-did-sacrifice-their-children">http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-01-23-ancient-carthaginians-really-did-sacrifice-their-children</a></p>

<p>Children – both male and female, and mostly a few weeks old – were sacrificed by the Carthaginians at locations known as tophets. <em>The practice was also carried out by their neighbours at other Phoenician colonies in Sicily, Sardinia and Malta. Dedications from the children&#39;s parents to the gods are inscribed on slabs of stone above their cremated remains, ending with the explanation that the god or gods concerned had</em> &#39;heard my voice and blessed me&#39;.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch</a></p>

<p>Rabbinical tradition depicted Moloch as a bronze statue heated with fire into which the victims were thrown. This has been associated with reports by Greco-Roman authors on the child sacrifices in Carthage to Baal Hammon,[1] especially since archaeological excavations since the 1920s have produced evidence for child sacrifice in Carthage as well as inscriptions including the term MLK, either a theonym or a technical term associated with sacrifice. In interpretatio graeca, the Phoenician god was identified with Cronus, due to the parallel mytheme of Cronus devouring his children.</p>

<p>On a side note, I still find it interesting that the Basques worshiped a goddess called Mari, and that the Basques founded the Jesuits.  I happened to know a Jesuit priest at my church, and he was a HUGE Mary devotee, and went on many pilgrimages to Medugorje.</p>

<p>No weird coincidences there.</p>

The Catholic Church has always done everything they could to destroy it, and when they couldn&#39;t they infiltrated it.

<p>Not so much ignore, they are just ignorant of it, by design. These cults and beliefs didn&#39;t just fade away, they just hide behind others, even in modern times. Some in the shadows, and some in plain sight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the bible.  Understand why California and China are trying to ban it.  Understand why so many high level people in the government,  history, entertainment mention satan and selling their soul. 
Jesus is not a religion he is our savior.   Everything in the bible predicted Jesus and his death.<br/>
No one actually reads it.  It&#39;s the guide to life.  It&#39;s how to be a good person.  Why would anyone want to ban that book?</p>

<p>God never sends anyone to hell. Unfortunately people choose to go there. </p>

<p>Accepting Jesus Christ into your heart is the only way to wash away your sins. </p>

<p>I prayed for you to find Jesus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can act as high and mighty as you want about your belief, but the fact of the matter is that your religion is divisive in nature.  It&#39;s impossible for more than a fraction of the world to &quot;accept Jesus&quot; any more than we are willing to accepted a political party, or an ideology.  There&#39;s nothing to say that your religion is superior to the 100&#39;s of others in the world, and deep down you know that.  I&#39;m 100% sure that &quot;fake news&quot; has existed every since the birth of your bearded mascot.. so common sense tells most of us that the story of Jesus is bullshit.  You&#39;re bullshit, and you know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know nothing about Jesus and act hateful toward me and toward a recorded belief that is recorded in the Bible that has been around longer than many generations. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that make you think? A book has been unchanged for generations. Can you say that about your history books? </p>

<p>Why would following Jesus, who was middle Eastern be followed by people from every country? Asians, Koreans, black Americans, south Americans, etc. </p>

<p>You can say fakenews all you want but where is your information coming from? Have you ever been to a Christian church or read a page in the Bible? </p>

<p>Go to a Christian church and see that anyone is excepted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying religion doesn&#39;t help people, yet that is exactly what your argument is based on.  The argument I&#39;m making is that the story isn&#39;t real.  Being &quot;unchanged for generations&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything to me and doesn&#39;t prove a point.  The amount of people who follow the religion doesn&#39;t make a difference either.  Christianity remains to be a divisive religion because it doesn&#39;t accept the existence of other religions.  In the end, a story is a story, and personally I find Harry Potter to be more believable than the bullshit in your fairy tale.  Yes I have been in a Christian church and yes I have read passages from the bible - but I&#39;m not sure why my experiences have anything to do with the facts.  If anything, your posts have left me feeling more resentment towards Christianity...  so congratulations on working against your cause.</p>
