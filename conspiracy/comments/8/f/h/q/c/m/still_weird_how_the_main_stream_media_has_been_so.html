       Why is this weird to you? This evil shit is systematic in Government, the Media, Big Business, etc etc. Of course they are going to be hush hush about it (for now). The only problem is, they have no idea what is coming. We are in the Great Awakening/Unveiling.

       The concept of the general populace awakening and shifting to a golden age has been around forever, but never actually happens.  It gives people hope, pacifies them, and stops them from actually doing anything, because they think things are moving in the right direction, even though they are still stuck in the matrix.

       this NXIVM stuff seems to be just more of the weird occult/spirit cooking/sex stuff pizza gate truthers were warning about. hopefully this time around more people will wake up that there is a conspiracy to abuse and corrupt our society.. starting with our children.

       Completely different.  Pizzagate was essentially false claims made for political purposes, that had nothing pan out to be true ever, until it was vaguely mixed with real current events to disguise the psyop portion underneath the cloak of actual roundups and busts.  NXIVM, on the other hand is all real from the get go.

       and lots of independent research that can be easily verified. Look it up. So many "links" were debunked as false. When you filter out those false links, you ended up with a series of unrelated obscure unverifiable claims about the nature of some coincidences.

       I'm still waiting for people to debunk the actual Podesta emails, you know, the original kickstarter of Pizzagate. Ofcourse in any truth movement there are misaligned and false elements, but you can't disprove the whole hypothesis by pointing out the existence of those missteps.

       All of the so called "codes" being used in those emails are proven to be false.
For example that a white hancorshief means pedophilia, is proven to be false. ANd so on and so on.
All you have is a series of weird e-mails without contact.
I have a lot of inside jokes with my weird friend. If you read our conversation , you could easily determine that its a secret code, while in fact its just some rambling of couple of mad lads spewing inside jokes references.
Oh they say "oh i have a map to pizza" that MUST mean that "EnterFabricatedReasoningHere"
While there are actually unlimited possible reasons for that kind of language.
ITS NOT EVIDENCE. It all started on 4chan of all channels.
Its very clevery cooked up: Lots of weird e-mails, add 2 or 3 false statements of symbols used in the e-mails and tada : people will find a way to convince more people.

       How and when have them ever been proven to be false? I agree they're not really evidence though, circumstantial evidence yes. When you pile up said circumstantial evidence cumulatively over and over, even if some of it may lead astray, one can either work with heavy mental gymnastics to justify a different reality instead of at least entertaining the possibility that would easily explain most if not all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just the emails, those were simply a kickstart for people to start to look into correct direction: Instagram accounts, Podestas' artworks and connections to convicted pedophiles all point to the same direction.

       Its false cause nowhere it stated that it is true. The "codes" used just came out of nowhere. In not a single official fbi report have those codes been used/investigated. Those codes were clearly created after the facts.
       <br/>
       For example:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OrX0U4qwTM&amp;amp;t=696s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OrX0U4qwTM&amp;amp;t=696s
       </a>
       Podestas' artwork. like the statue with no face and shit ? Those are artworks that have symbolisms that has nothing to do with pedophilia. Ofcourse we could go in detail in all of this. But wont make any difference. I did enough of research on this with an open mind. Came to the conclusion that 50% is fabricated and the left over 50% is circumstantial evidence at best. 
Although i'm not saying that there are no bad guys in position of power. I'm not saying that all. Those guys need to be tackled individually. But claiming that a pedoring is being supported by al the democrats.. come on. 
What happened was is this: People on 4chan wanted to create a conspiracy (like they did millions of times)
Other people caught on because it perfectly suited their political viewpoints and looked for evidence to prove their claims. Then other people started to believe it cause humankind is gullible species. 
If you start with a rediculous claim that can't be proven, and you take a look at hundreds of emails/instagrams/people you damn sure will find coincidentals that will stroke with your claims. 
To be fair , in the beginning i was like "hmm maybe there is something to it" But then when i found out that lot of the real convincing prove was fabricated. Like the pic of obama playing pingpong (was actually just taken in the whitehouse), the pic of the so called basement (when u could clearly see on streetview and actual on site footage that there is no basement) The pic of him holding up a fish and a number was to symbolise some national waterday or something. (cant remember from the top of my head)
      </p>
      <p>
       The left over 50% left over cirumstantial evidence is soo far fethched. like this one guy had a guy working for him that had a connection with another guy that owned a house where a crime got commited.
      </p>
      <p>
       A weird pic of a kid bgeing taped to the table. A few months ago , my nephew taped his sister to the ground cause they were playing cops and robber. They were both laughing their ass off and i took a pic of the girl taped on the floor and sent it to my sister. Am i a pedophile now ? 
My mother has a few drawings of naked girls with their naked babies amongst hundreds of other themed pictures. 
I am known for loving spaghetti. Everybody knows i could eat spaghetti everyday. Lots of time i use that in a joke for example:
I wont be able to help you carry your boxes if they dont have spaghetti in it (when she asked me to help her move) which was another inside jokely way to say : "i can help you if you give me spaghetti afterwards".
      </p>
      <p>
       If people took a look at all of this and wanted to claim im a pedohpile, they would use all these things to "prove it"

       Bronfmans funded NXIVM, had a company with the Rothchilds, and there's a very direct connection between the Rothchilds and the Clintons via the emails.  Including sacrifice to Moloch.

      <p>
       Everyone that has a link with a person that worked with weinstein is a predator ? 
Lookup 6 degress of seperation We are ALL connected in some way to ANYBODY in the world. in maxium 6 steps. :

       .
"being linked" to someone is far from evidence. 
Especially when u are high ranked. U at least had dinner with or meeting with someone high placed. ANd yes some high placed people are scum of the earth. So being linked to actual criminals is really not evidence. I would say its common for everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       And " sacrifice to Moloch". From a different thread:
"Moloch is an ancient God whose worship required child sacrifice, and I'm sure it's already known that 'chicken' is a code for child. Why is it signed 'Tri'?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all based on the assumption that chicken is code for child. Come on. I hope you can see the logic here? 
There is a basic joke, someone invents that chicken is codeword for child and tada they have evidence... seriously ?
I've actually been involved in an online community hunting pedo's on sites like
       <a href="http://imgsrc.ru">
        http://imgsrc.ru
       </a>
       and tor network. 
NOWHERE in the real word are these codes being used. Nowhere i can find evidence that chicken is a code for child.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes it seems believable when someone says it . Especially when it has lots of other statements. If you don't disect every single claim extensively, u wont see any issue  and u might just believe it , 'because there is so much that points at the same thing' but everything you said so far i debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont have anything personal against you. I do believe that you actually believe in this. So ur doing what you should do and that is raise awareness and defend ur point of view. That being said. I'm afraid you believe in something that can't be proven and most of the circumstantial evidence that do exist , is fabricated to fit a narrative.

jokes about sacrifice  :

       Sacrificing animals is a very common mechanic in video games for kids (like minecraft) .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same as saying jokes about suicide means that you like people commiting suicide.
For example: I'm gonna kill myself now. 
Or : He is literally hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler, and suicide are on its own not funny. But they are the most common subjects in a joke.

       If u really think nobody jokes about sacrificing , then u also think nobody jokes about hitler .
      </p>
      <p>
       And may i remind, she sacrifices a chicken. .. A fucking chicken. 
Like for real i'm done here. I have irl stuff to do. If you can't even agree to the fact that people make jokes about terrible events/people, then yeah we are done here lol.

       killing a million of jew children , not that bad ? 
ffs ur pissing me off. Clamping on for dear life on a very flimsy arguement about how people wont joke about offering an ANIMAL to a god. No ofcourse not. It can't be joke.
Its obviously a code word for the fact shes going to offer a real child to the gods. Ofcourse, isnt that obvious ? thats just rediculous. 
I thought pizzagate supporters were just stupid. But when you take a JOKE as evidence that shes sacrificing kids. Yeah evolution will do it's thing and filter you people out very soon.
Or is evolution also not real together with global warming ? oh yeah the earth is flat.

       You should ask those currently conducting war in Palestine about that.  Seems to be the only genocide going on these days.

       Tell me, is it so
       <em>
        stupid
       </em>
       to believe in child trafficking when child abduction rates are HIGHEST in Virginia, D.C., and Maryland compared to the rest of the nation.  Somehow, those kids are just disappearing into thin air, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       FFS, the number in the UK are WORSE.  But keep making "fun" of it.  Your phony arguments and attacks on me only galvanize people that it is a VERY real thing.

       Somehow, after seeing your spelling and grammar, I think my far higher educated ass can run circles around you mentally, so yeah, we'll keep trying to bring awareness to the situation.

       I dont need to have a perfect to understand bullshit when i see it. 
U said that people never make cruel jokes...... And ur basing ur entire argument on that statement lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said child traficking isnt a thing. i stated multiple times that there are indeed evil people at work in the world. I don't deny that. 
I never said that. Thats a typical strawman arguement: You make a false statement that i said something and then you start arguin that statement that i never made.
Please stay on topic. 
Hillary making a cruel joke in her mail about sacrificing a chicken to a god is somehow evidence she actually sacrifice children and is part of a large pedo ring? Then you said "people dont make jokes about sacrificing to gods" to which i replied with a series of cartoons of just that. So that arguement is invalid. 
I'm just debunking any arguement u spew towards me. In stead of replying to my arguements, u just give me a brand new argument to dispute. 
And now ur eveng arguing against things i never said. So when holding urself to a very rediculous statement that nobody would joke about cruel stuff, u start putting statements in my mouth that i never said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never stated ur an idiot for believing in this conspiracy. 
What i am saying is that when you are confronted with actual facts and evidence and logic, that you spew nonsense like : "
And yes english is not my first language. I live in europe and speak 5 languages fluently and 2 languages on a basic level. How much do you ?

       Ok, since you are so well versed in the matter.  Show me any evidence of jokes in the emails, or humor of any kind.  Besides the Moloch reference, of course.  If she's so funny there's bound to be other laughers in there.

       This is such a pathetically weak argument. YOUR talking points are the exact same as other supporters of pizzagate, naturally the rebuttal of those points will be similar to other rebuttals.

       I mean, a very large number of people think satan isn't jokey material. I've seen jokes about doing various pagan practices for good luck, including sacrificing a chicken. The specific combination of that with moloch is not so completely beyond the pale it has to be real, and freely communicated through email.

       It is true cause nowhere it stated that it is false. No, logic doesn't work that way. Leaving all of that aside there's Madeleine McCann's case combined with conveniently missing email dates, date of a vacation and a photo sketch, not to mention connections to a nearby residence of where the incident occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       But above all what really ringed my alarms was the constant attempts to hide these links and connections, deletion of the source materials and media's reaction. Not since 9/11 have I seen such a campaign from the mainstream media to discredit a conspiracy theory. Hell, they even branded the term "fake news" because of it and kept repeating it. Truth does not fear investigation.

       research 6 degrees of seperation, if you look hard enough u are linked to ANY most crual and vial criminal in MAX 6 steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why they descredit it , is basically because there is no evidence to show it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allthough i wish a real journalist would take this matter in his own hands and debunk all evidence once and for all. Like every single arguement. Nothing wrong with investigating it . Cause i think 90% of the claims made are easily disproven . ANd other 10% are just coincidences which a scientist should take a look at the percentage of the posibilty.
Like i said. U are connected to hitler in 6 steps or less. So you must be a nazi, right?

       The theory goes : 6 degress or less. 
And when it comes to the same field 'politics and business' its even way less.
Thats why there is the game called: 6 degrees of Kevin bacon. The challenge is to find any actor that is linked to Kevin bacon in more then 2 steps....
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said earlier. HAving a link to someone criminal is SOOOO common and statistcally sooo fucking high.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat again. person X worked with harvy weinstein. Person A worked with person X. Does this mean that person A is a sexual predator ?
No of fucking course not. 
Sorry to say . But if you look at all the individual arguements for this consiparacy, u see its debunked easlily.  I have statistics saying that having a link to someone crimincal is extremely high. So there goes almost all "person x is linked to y and y is linked to A who commited a crime so X is also responsible for said crime"
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope u start to understand that if u look at all things closely , its not as evident as it might seem at first.

       All I'm doing is entertaining and keeping open a possibility, not closing it out. And to go back to the media issue, they didn't feel like reporting on the dozens of other conspiracy theories, but this one struck some nerve.

       Well, I always say everything is possible . Ofcourse it is. 
I think its very unlikely almost impossible to have such a big of a pedo ring without actual any evidence coming out .

       Yeah but maybe they shouldn't report on conspiracy theories. But do segments like: "today we debunk all the arguments used in conspiracy X"

       indeed , cheese pizza is relate to peadophiles. Guess its origin? 4chan. 
Admiralty alot of pedos on4chan . But u know why? Because the abbreviation is the same as child porn. 
About the hankerchief, please guide me to the document that has that as a code word. 
Making a statement and sayin "there is your evidence" is NOT evidence. lol Please give me evidence.

       It's REAL, most of us are beyond questioning it's validity. It seems like your ' research' entails trying to debunk Pizzagate instead of corroborating evidence.

      <p>
       After ‘Cheese Pizza’ Post, Officer Arrested For Child Porn...
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Authorities say a New Jersey corrections officer has been charged with receiving images of child sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutors say an undercover officer first made contact with Salamak after he posted on Craigslist that he was looking for women and moms “that are into Cheese Pizza,” a
       <strong>
        reference to child pornography

       No it doesn't. the keywords did not come from the FBI, it was made up by a 4chan poster. "cheese pizza" being an initialism for "child porn" is a real phrase, but "cheese pizza" is also not used in the emails anywhere. It would be like saying if they were talking about star trek it was pedo codewords because "captain picard" is also one for child porn.

       Because you can disprove it independently (with basic geometry for example) and regardless of how much circumstantial evidence you gather for it that you don't even need to acknowledge any circumstantial evidence for it.

       I really really want to know what a "pizza-related map is" and why it was on a handkerchief. It's code for something, obviously, but why wouldn't Podesta or someone else clear it up for us? It couldn't possibly be worse that what so many people think it means, could it?

       Pizzagate was really just the attempted interpretation of Wikileaks emails. None of that amounted to anything but conjecture. Walnuts and sauce, dominoes... all creative conjecture. Separate from that is the actual world of creepy pedo sex criminals, cults, etc. the existence of that does not make the original Pizzagate allegations true.

       That was all "interpreted meaning" that you were told what it meant, just like walnuts and cheese pizza.  Not one single anchor to anything factually meaningful.  The art was unremarkable dicey college aged crap.

       Pizzagate wasn't false, it was probably their most important quick-cover up to date. So they put out a shit ton of false info and totally changed the narrative. But if you look at the basis of Pizzagate, the Hillary emails, it's pretty obvious something was going on there. Everything else about the restaurant and what not was all bs.

       You just demonstrated Pizzagate perfectly! You didn't cite a single alleged fact that turned out to be true, but insinuated that there is "something" going on there.  That is the beginning and end of Pizzagate - an insinuation.

       It never produced an actionable bit of information about Podesta. It never produced an actionable bit of information about Alefinas. There was no basement. There was never a crime alleged. There was never a victim identified.  Nothing but creepy pasta, with no cheese, no walnuts, no sauce.... nothing.

       From what I have read the "sorority" was her idea and her initials are in the whole thing. They were told it was greek or roman symbols and basically pushed together in a peer pressure situation to get the branding. I would love to know who exactly bonded her out at 5m...it certainly WAS NOT SMALLVILLE!!

       One thing I will agree with, there isn’t a whole lot of mention of the Bronfman sisters and the rest of the rich fucks that were bankrolling this place. It seems they want to keep the focus on Allison Mack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I’ve only seen the sheet that listed Mack’s charges as Child Sex Trafficking here on Reddit but everywhere else just says trafficking and forced labor so I’m starting to wonder if the document floating around Reddit is fake.

       You linked to a Rolling Stone article. One of the many tentacles of the MSM. It's also been on cable news channels as well as news aggregator sites Yahoo, Reuters, and AP among others. Not sure any of that qualifies as being quiet. Google NXIVM right now. So, so many MSM articles, videos etc. right in your face. Not sure what else you want them to do.

       I read about Allison Mack and NXIVM when it was originally mentioned on this sub and read in to it and found clear evidence etc. I told wifey as we both watched Smallville together back in the day and she said something along the lines of "Yeah, Chloe was always a bit weird."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this past month with the arrest and further revelations I was thinking "Huh, that took a while..." but the thing is... it's not
       <em>
        interesting
       </em>
       , and also it's not
       <em>
        the main story in the news right now
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You expect them to talk about Allison Mack, a b-grade actor at best, in a sex trafficking cult, when they have the Korean peninsula, the Royal baby, Trump, Cosby, etc? There's so much to talk about right now. So many distractions. I don't blame them at the moment if they're not giving NXIVM much air time.

       Not to detract from her complicity in abhorrent criminal activity, but I do find it frustrating how it's her face on every article I've seen and not the cult leader's, Keith Rainiere. As the clear mastermind, they should at least show his face as well. She is probably a victim - turned perpetrator (not excusing her actions).

       Which major news organization is quiet about this? Why do you guys keep making the same weird argument that's either delusional or straight up lying? You're on the internet right now. Find me a news source that hasn't put up a story about this, because a 12 second Google search shows me you're completely wrong.

       As I understand it, NXIVM had some phase where it was mostly a high-intensity motivational organization before it became a culty sex organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's probably a lot of rich women who got involved with it when it was more normal and the more it's written about the more likely they are to be caught up in the scandal, even though they were only involved before the sex stuff started.

       I first learned of this group/cult months ago through MSM, although I'm not sure they focused on the sex trafficking.  There was a 20/20 show dedicated entirely to it last night, which did.
