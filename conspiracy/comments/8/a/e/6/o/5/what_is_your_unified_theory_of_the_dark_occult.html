       My own suspicion is that the dark occult illuminati doesn't exist even as a recognizable concept, it's just some words you threw together because you've no idea where you are or why, but for one reason or another you are compelled to make posts. Possibly there's a quota.

       Hey, just trying to be honest. That really is my suspicion. Also not sure it's fair to say 'dismiss', I did answer the question, didn't leave anything out. Yes that's because you didn't really bring anything, but that's beside the point. Oh wait, no, that is the point. You didn't bring anything. So what do you want?

       To poll what? Competing theories on the 'dark occult illuminati', three vaguely context-appropriate words that when placed in a row are so devoid of referent that if you google them in quotes the top result is this very post? Are you even trying?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am being mean, sorry. I know it's not your fault, I do. I hope you understand my frustration. I think you probably do, just from your total lack of commitment to your role. Which is a good thing, in context.

       Anyway. Forgiveness, that's the message. And forgive me one more thing, I just want to see if it works.

       You want to know what the Dark Occult  is? Look at the other comments for a damn start. “Dark occult” is a vague term
       <em>
        on purpose
       </em>
       because the aim is to encompass the existence of a mysterious organisation that has extreme influence on our world. We don’t know everything about it because we’re not in it, so we settle to call it a fitting name that doesn’t specify like “Freemason” or “Illuminati” does - “Dark Occult”. “Dark” = negative energy, evil, demonic, twisted etc. and “occult” = secret high knowledge, usually associated with spirituality and the supernatural.

       It's just another system. And it's useful for conceptualizing a theory of mind. But the power of memetic magick comes from the Intent and Will of the person utilizing it.

       I agree. Once a meme is created it takes on a life of its own. The strength of the meme is determined in its longevity and reproduction within the minds of others.

       My theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       That all the “Satanic Occult” crap is just a way of people trying not to see the truth:  that every single one of us has the capacity to be just as nihilistic, greedy, depraved and perverse as those in power were we in the same circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a monster to hide the one within.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you can have (essentially) whatever you want, what then?  How does the person find exhilaration or excitement?  How does one in that position manage to conceive of themselves as equal to all the normal slobs?  When one may use their money or influence to avoid consequences for nearly any action, what does crime or evil even mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Play a video game like GTA or Sim city...  do you act as a “morally good” person?  Do you becomes cold, callous, even murderous?  That is how those people feel about real life... there are no consequences and all of the regular people are just NPC’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no magic, there is no religion, and there is no mystery to it.

       Short-version:
      </p>
      <p>
       There exists 'shards' of reality. Among dimensions. The closer to totality you get, the cosmology of the universe exists as a simple shape, when broken down into it's parts, it appears as vast and complex maps.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the visual strain of understanding what can not be ever seen. Just as, things felt with no direct local to the stimulation lead us to assume the world is different, or our mind is just "playing tricks" - no middle ground between what just occurred. As, that middles ground is not immediate possessed as organ or sensate data easily understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, You also exist on these shards but possess continuity of conscious awareness and manifestation in majority on the one you assume is "reality". This shard of existence is the most middle ground of a spectrum your capable of materially and spiritually manifesting on, as synthesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       That assumed, when you lose connection with your material body, the form of your 'lost' self now attached to a shards vibration, and must go to that shard or be effected by the cross-over of the shard, while being lost ethereally on this one; existence as an ethereal form wandering the synthesis-shard (this one) is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that, it's possible to NOT LEAVE this shard after physical-bodily death. Not a great idea, and usually a cause of 'material-emotional' spiritual-possession (where the spirit is possessed by the realm it inhabits, and not the other way around). This leads to (minor) possession of material things. Not in that, one is totally possessed like in a movie, but that one might be persuaded to act in a way that 'feeds' the vibration-form 'haunting' a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       You vibrate. the entire universe vibrates. among this vibration is a means of recording this vibration relative the others, and their respective change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occultist want to know this truth in it's categorical and symbolic ways, and exploit the system materially,  but mostly AFTER DEATH, so that their form does not that have face karmic consequences, and can eternally 'feed' on suffering and 'dark-vibrations' of unique plenormic form.

       That’s a very human explanation of this though, similar to the usual quantum physics. You’re ignoring the fact that entities exist (calling them souls is just reductionist as well as taking away the necessity of meaning,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       “energy” as the ultimate form, which is a very cold way of look at this, as energy has no philosophical value), and that the “soul” is a very humanistic concept in the first place. You can’t explain what a soul is for a staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even your thinking is pretty linear and all. There is no “universe” in that sense, or “dimensions”.

       There are different groups of occult secret socities making up what one would term to be the Cabal. They all work towards a similar goal, but with different methodology used.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Roscicrucians, Thule, Vril, the Illuminati, Black Sun, Golden Dawn, Jesuits, Zionists are after similar things. They have differing belief systems however. At the top there will be a set of ruling class families, with the bloodline of the top family. Nobody knows who is truly at the top however. Some say the Rothschilds, some say the Papal bloodlines, some say the Queen. There's a lot of confusion in the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parties deal with different areas of civilisation. Some deal with finance, others with ideologies/social movements (think alt right vs SJWs; Soros and Mercer), military, politics, identity, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also - I personally believe - have the alien connection, and the invocation of deities. That's where more supernatural stuff comes into the question. Annunaki, Reptilians, Lucifer, Minerva, Moloch, Athena, Baal, Ra, Set, Xenu, AI (yes, AI) etc. Many different belief systems, many different parties, all working together (for mutual benefit; this is no collusion based on trust and faith) to achieve a goal that benefits all parties. Some say they do it to forward human evolution, some say its to create a dystopia with a set of elites and a slave class. There are so many options but all lead to the idea of a one world government and a single religion. Different parties will have different ideas behind the one belief system humanity will follow. Its actually quite complex. Not nearly as simple as people make it out to be.

       You want to know what the Dark Occult  is? Look at the other comments for a damn start. “Dark occult” is a vague term
       <em>
        on purpose
       </em>
       because the aim is to encompass the existence of a mysterious organisation that has extreme influence on our world. We don’t know everything about it because we’re not in it, so we settle to call it a fitting name that doesn’t specify like “Freemason” or “Illuminati” does - “Dark Occult”. “Dark” = negative energy, evil, demonic, twisted etc. and “occult” = secret high knowledge, usually associated with spirituality and the supernatural.
