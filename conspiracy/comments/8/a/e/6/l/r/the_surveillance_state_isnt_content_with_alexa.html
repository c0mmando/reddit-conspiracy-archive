<p>The eventual goal is to make interfacing with AI assistants such as Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri less embarrassing and more intimate, allowing people to communicate with them in a manner that appears to be silent to the outside world</p>

<p>Excuse me? 
Are they fucking serious?</p>

<p>AI &quot;assistants&quot; listening to everything going on in the room isn&#39;t enough  for the surveillance  state?  </p>

<p>Now they&#39;re actually openly pushing for an interface, a fucking <strong>technological interface between our &quot;inner voice&quot;  and obvious surveillance technology</strong>.</p>

<p>90% of people are going to eat this bullshit up having no idea they are literally enabling the establishment of an actual Thought Police movement. </p>

<p>Alexa listening to everything in your house</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t comment on Google devices, but I have several friends who work for the Alexa division at Amazon, and much of the workings of the Alexa/Echo devices are public knowledge if you are a skills developer or connected home, etc. tech partner so I&#39;m not really revealing any major secrets here.</p>

<p>The Echo units have two main &quot;modes.&quot; The first is a small firmware chip wired to the microphone that only contains about 50-60k of onboard memory. Its only purpose is to listen to the wake word, &quot;Alexa,&quot; &quot;Echo,&quot; etc. It doesn&#39;t do any actual language processing for this, but only listens for distinct combinations of syllables. This is why they can&#39;t be programmed to respond to arbitrary words.</p>

<p>Once the firmware chip hears the wake word, it powers up the main ARM chip, which runs a stripped down version of Linux. This startup process takes just under a second, during which time the firmware chip has barely enough memory to buffer what you&#39;re saying if you immediately start talking after the wake word without pausing. Once the ARM chip is on, the blue ring on the top illuminates and recording begins. The firmware chip dumps its buffer to the start of the recording and then serves as a pass-through for the mic. Only this main ARM chip and OS has access to the networking interface, in or out.</p>

<p>The purpose of this next stage is to wait until it&#39;s heard what sounds like a real natural sentence or question. Amazon is not interested in background noise -- that would be a waste of bandwidth and resources. So there is a rudimentary natural language processing step done locally to determine when you&#39;ve said a real sentence and stopped speaking. It also handles very simple &quot;local&quot; commands that don&#39;t need server processing, like &quot;Alexa stop.&quot; Only at that point is the full sentence sent up to the actual AWS servers for processing.</p>

<p>It is physically impossible for the device to be secretly constantly listening, as the mic, networking, main wake chip, blue LED ring, and main ARM chip just aren&#39;t wired that way from a power perspective. If you are curious to confirm any of the above, try disconnecting your home internet and playing around with the Alexa a bit, and you&#39;ll see that it only even realizes something is wrong at that very last step, when it goes to upload the processed sentence to the servers.</p>

<p>As for the stories about &quot;eerie&quot; advertising coincidences popping up due to things you&#39;ve said around Alexa, it just goes to show how spooky accurate advertisers&#39; overall profiles are of you these days. They can track everything you have done across every device you own, and then make such educated guesses about what you&#39;re probably interested in that they don&#39;t even need to listen in your home.</p>

<p>Yup,  most people have that plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a target in Iran sometimes they&#39;ve induced pain feelings in my body from just thinking about redditting, they also induced a voice in my head saying what I was thinking about once and another time they sent a street stalker that stalked me few times before (cuz they can&#39;t find enough desperate stalkers here) to talk loudly near me about something I was just looking at 5 minutes ago and I hadn&#39;t spoken about it, it was also beginning of my very overt targeting cuz I&#39;d just found out about targeting, the stalker lived close and they were very insistent on trying to freak me out any way possible. I&#39;ve heard from few sources an implant isn&#39;t even needed and our brain acts as a transmitter itself I&#39;m not sure though I still feel an implant is needed to assist in directing their weapons in the correct directions to lock onto targets better, I&#39;m open to both possibilities.  </p>

<p>When they caused forced speech to make me say something I felt lot of pressure moving all over under my scalp that could make my eyes move in different directions, I took a walk outside and the effect would go away in some areas like it would jump on something similar to WIFI signals, like there were already many devices set up to connect with my brain and some still couldn&#39;t maybe I&#39;m wrong but that&#39;s just how it felt. </p>
