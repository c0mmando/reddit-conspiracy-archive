       Every time there is a "shooting" in headlines, gun sales rise. Little has changed in the 2nd amendment for how many shootings we have had (correct me if I'm wrong). What if they are trying to get us all to buy guns to prepare for a civil war? Why waste army resources when we can take out each other. I know bill cooper warned us about civil war and I count him some what credible for his predictions because he was assassinated. Either they are very slowly taking our guns away over a long period of time, which is plausible, or they are tricking us into arming ourselves for what is to come.  This is pure speculation, what you think?

       I watched these movies.  In my opinion, Purging could only happen in largely disarmed populations.  Why?  Because modern firearms are absolutely unthinkably lethal in open environments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie, the victims are largely disarmed, or armed with rather antiquated weapons.  The only people with freedom to move are people with guns.  The movie portrays the armed factions as being totally insane, but they would have no one to prey upon if everyone were armed.

       Sikhs have a religious duty of self defense, so that is close.  It doesn't quite extend to carrying a firearm for many/most Sikhs, as far as I am aware.

       I think gun sales go up because the type of people that buy guns are afraid they are going to finally take them away. So they buy more.

       Could be, but I honestly want to buy a gun after a shooting or something like that because I want to be able to defend myself if I'm in a similar situation.

       So what sort of gun would you purchase to defend yourself in a situation like Las Vegas?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more of an excuse for someone else to shoot you because you have a gun out in a tense or hectic situation.  Like in a more concentrated scenario, there's a shooter so everyone with a gun shoot the guy with a gun.  Now everyone's shooting at each other, otherwise innocent people trying to "do the right thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Or all the times police have shot people just because they
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       they had a weapon.  Now imagine more and more people actually do have weapons.  Cop shoots a guy who pulled a gun during an encounter.  Who's gonna think twice about that?  In that case, the cop is defending himself the same way others claim to want to defend themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the real question is, why is everyone's apparent "defense" against a person with a deadly weapon to put others and themselves in more danger with use of an equally deadly weapon?  Do you really want to kill another human being?  What they're doing is shitty, but they are clearly not in their right mind.  Killing them isn't really solving the bigger problem, which is that people are going on random killing rampages.  Most people don't do that.

       How often do things like Las Vegas actually happen though?
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda get what you're getting at but I think your logic is a bit flawed. If someone confronts you with a gun and you don't have one then they absolutely have the upper hand. If you're both armed then it's a more level playing field. Why would anyone cede power to a more powerful adversary?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, these cats shooting up schools aren't mentally well. But did you notice what happened in the Maryland school shooting? The armed school officer took down the perp. Many, many lives were saved because he had a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda get where you're coming from. I've never thought I'd own a gun or have one in my home. But the older I get, the more aware I am that shit can go sideways outta nowhere. I'm a single female who lives alone. Despite popular belief these days there is a very real difference between women and men. If a man broke into my home and threatened me in some way I highly doubt I'd be able to fight him off. Now if I were properly trained and was comfortable using a gun, I do believe that my chances would dramatically increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2nd Amendment isn't really about that anyways though. It's about being able to take up arms against a tyrannical government. And I understand that the military has tanks and drones and nukes, but I don't believe ceding power to an already lopsided powerful foe is beneficial. If that makes sense.

       I had two guys pull a gun on me and try to rob me outside of work one night a few years ago. I'm a dumbass and all I could think was that I had just worked a double in order to pay my cable bill and they weren't going to get my hard earned cash. I was sitting in my car and despite being cornered and a gun being pulled on me I was able to get away without giving them what they wanted. Obviously if they had truly wanted to hurt me they could and would have. But I could have pulled a gun out if I'd had one and the power dynamic would have shifted tremendously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do understand what you're getting at. And I do think that it's possible that more guns can thoroughly exacerbate a situation. But again, I don't believe it's a good idea to cede power to criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you remember the Sutherland Springs church shooting? The one where that guy went in and shot up a bunch of church goers? 26 people lost their lives that day. You know how it was stopped? A good guy with a gun. Stephen Willeford, an NRA trained gun owner lived nearby and heard the shots. He took out his AR-15 and exchanged fire with the murderer connecting a few times and then sub sequentially chased him down. If he hadn't responded the way in which he did there would have absolutely been more deaths.

       So the argument is then not to defend yourself, but to defend others.  That's someone else who had time to prepare and take the gunman by surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to argue against guns or owning one.  Buy and/or carry one if it makes you feel safer.  But don't be one of those people who claims to have one for defense, then talk about gun safety and how it's locked up in a safe or think you're going to Wild Bill quick draw someone who pulls a gun on you.  Talk more about being like the guy at the church.  We need to help each other, not be so worried out in public every day that we think we need to have a gun on us at all times.  What kind of life is that?

       Defense is the argument. Defense of oneself and others. And again I believe that the purpose of the 2nd Amendment was to give us the right to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy that took out the church shooter got his gun from his safe before he confronted the shooter. Responsible gun ownership goes hand in hand with the right to bear arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree we should all be helping each other out. If only every person on the planet had your worldview there wouldn't be a need for guns in the first place. But not everyone is like you. There are bad cats out there who will use whatever they can get their hands on to gain an upper hand in any given situation and I think it's important that people have the means to defend themselves and others when those situations occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gun debate is controversial. That's probably why the down votes. For the record though, it wasn't me. I thoroughly enjoy discussing and debating topics with folks who are open minded enough to really get to the heart of an issue. And I think you're one of those individuals. I sincerely appreciate the discussion. It might surprise you to know that just a few years ago I was arguing from the same side you are. But like many things in life the older I get the more experiences I've gathered and the more I've allowed myself to hear opposing arguments the more I've evolved a bit on my opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I do appreciate this discussion. I feel like I've had a few good ones the past couple of days with cats who see things differently than I may. That gives me hope. In any case I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend!

       I mean this is all meant as just open questions, not really at you or anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have a tyrannical government.  What now?  Like what's the plan at this point?  Are "we" going to march on the Capitol with any number of handguns and "assault weapons" and hunting rifles and whatever else?  Are we going to systematically take out whoever we deem worthy of death in "the government?"  That just seems like a kind of outdated reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gun control issue just isn't getting to the root of the problem, people feeling the need to hurt or kill each other over things.  Like why is a dude robbing you at gunpoint?  He needs the money and is willing to go to that extreme to get some.  Why are people going on mass shootings?  They are mentally unstable or ill and in many, if not all, cases they either weren't helped at all or the "help" the received made things worse.  Why are sellers trying to push sales?  It's a business and there's a much higher supply than demand in a world where people feel, for the most part, safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for people trying to defend themselves and others, but maybe buying up more guns isn't really the best way to go about it.  We already have plenty of nonlethal alternatives for any kind of personal or small scale defense.  Like I'm sure in a crisis situation, anyone would rather be accidentally hurt or temporarily incapacitated by someone trying to put an end to it than killed on purpose.  And in some cases, the best or only thing you can do is try to run and hide and help victims when it's safe enough to do so.  Sucks, but you can't always be the hero who kills a killer, regardless of how prepared you think you are.  And worst case, you draw fire on yourself and others near you from the killer or police/security guard/other random citizen trying to stop the actual killer.

       I don't believe the government is tyrannical today, but who truly knows what the future holds. I don't necessarily believe that should it go that way, that the way to fight that tyranny would be to march on Washington and take out the tyrants. I believe it's more of a way to protect ourselves from that tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, if the Jews in Germany had guns and the ability to protect themselves back in the 30's and 40's it would have been far more difficult for the Nazi's to load them up in rail cars and send them to concentration camps. Now I realize that they were up against insurmountable odds, but at least they would have had a chance you know? Does that make sense? Usually the first thing an oppressive dictator will do when they take control is gather up the guns from the people. Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Castro all implemented that policy. And the reason for that is obvious.
      </p>

       Just because someone needs money doesn't give them the right to try to force me to give them mine. I'm not a 1%er. I'm a waitress who literally waits on people hand and foot in order to keep food on my table and a roof over my head. We all have the same opportunities in this country although I am aware that some have a better start in life than others. But even if someone has a terrible childhood that doesn't give them the right to force me or anyone else to give up what I've had to work for.

       I think there are probably many reasons for mass shootings. I think some people are just evil and want to take a bunch of people out. I think a lot of it probably does have to do with mental illness and I think that there is a case to be made that our current practice of just medicating such individuals may be contributing to what we've been witnessing these days. I think the media plays a role as well. I get that ratings are everything and people want to see stories like these, but I do believe that there is a link between the rise in school shootings in particular and the nonstop coverage provided by media outlets. I could be wrong about that, but I do believe we did see a rise in such occurrences after Columbine. Ultimately though I think mass shootings have many variables that come into play and therefore there just won't be a simple solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's somewhat silly the way gun and ammo sales go through the roof when highly publicized shootings take place as well. That being said, I kinda get it. There's always inevitably a push for more regulations on guns after such an event happens. Hell there was even a former Supreme Court Justice who recently said that the 2nd Amendment should be repelled. That's going to have a direct effect on the market when law abiding citizens feel as though they are being targeted because some deranged individual took advantage of a right our fore fathers provided us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do get your point about how more guns can make a situation incredibly worse. And it is a fair point. I just ultimately believe that I would rather be with someone properly trained to use a gun when faced with an unthinkable situation than not. If something crazy goes down we call the police. Why? Because they have guns, are properly trained, and are here to serve and protect. Again it goes back to why would you want to cede power to a criminal?

       I really do get where you're coming from. You seem to be a peaceful cat who just wants everyone to get along. And that's a noble thing to want. It's just been my experience that not everyone is coming from as pure of a place as you are my friend.

       Yeah, get a gun and training. Maybe a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, or even a 22 if a 9mm is too strong a kickback for you. Anything is better than nothing. Shotguns are good for home defense too!

       The risk from negligent discharges is extremely small, and even lower if you use a proper holster and practice safe handling techniques.  It is statistically zero.  My carrying a gun does not increase risk to myself or other innocent people around me.

       Well, actually these assholes seem to prefer gun-free zones.  They like to kill without fear of being shot themselves before the police show up.  Minimize gun free zones to places with active armed protection (like courthouses) and I suspect the rate of successful mass shootings will drop very close to zero.

       I would say your on a "more correct" track than you think. I personally think that it's a matter of a "fear based" society.
Yes gun sales go up after every shooting. Why? Because someone tells you that "they " are going to ban your guns or take them away because someone did wrong. 
This is helped along by conspiracy theories (which by them selves are not bad) but then the next event has to be a bit more extreme and impactful. This really true with elections too. 
We.all suffer from the politics of fear.

       So long as consumers consume, it makes no difference, their system of control is met with very little resistance, whether you're pro-gun rights, or in favor of anti-gun legislation, no matter your position, it's well within their control.

       It's a fair question.  In my opinion, the "tricking" theory falls flat in a couple of important ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       First is that similar media tactics are used in other areas.  Unless one wants to also consider that the media is working hard to "trick" us into being more racist and more sexist, I don't think one can reasonably claim that they are actually aiming to arm American. I know that among my left-leaning friends, the antigun sentiment is quite real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, there are some indications that the NRA membership rolls are several times larger than the NRA claims.  This would give them much greater political clout, and might perhaps explain why every attempt at gun control fails.  The NRA may in fact hold a great deal of political influence despite only modest lobbying, due to the effect of their voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us not forget that the number of gun-owning households is likely far greater than publicly known.  The best data we have is either telephone polling or implicatory from suicide rates, and both have serious sources of bias and error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taken together, I think it is perfectly plausible that the media is working quite earnestly to remove guns from the population, but are seriously underestimating both the actual rate of gun ownership and the political support for gun rights across America.  I think this explains most of the phenomena we see regarding gun legislation and gun purchasing behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, let's not forget that if an assault weapons ban ever does pass, banned guns will become stupidly valuable on the black market.  Even if you hate guns, buying a potentially-banned gun now and locking it away might be one of the smartest investments you could make if you don't care too much about legality.  I'm sure there are more than a few practically-minded democrat voters thinking along these lines right now.
