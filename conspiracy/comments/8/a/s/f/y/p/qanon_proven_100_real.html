I had a shred of hope at first that he might be legit, but I got turned off by all his vague predictions that never came to fruition. Honestly, Q might actually be somebody close to Trump, but I think he&#39;s there to inspire false hope into his supporters. To give the illusion that something is being done to the corrupt individuals in our government.</p>

<p>As you can see, the anon asked Q to tell Trump to say tippy top in January. Trump ended up using the phrase 3 months later. This is hardly a coincidence, considering this is a phrase he&#39;s used several times in the past. Here he is saying tippy tippy top in 2016. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding? You realize Cambridge Analytica tracks nearly everything we say online and then helps the President form his message based on what people say. Catchy slogans like Lock Her Up and Drain The Swamp we’re literally invented by random people online and then adopted by the President. Just because he says something and tips his cap to Q Anon or whatever, doesn’t mean Trump is a good President. Hundreds of Billions of dollars being funneled into the American war machine to fight Israel’s enemies while simultaneously bankrupting us is not the actions of an America First President. Allowing a private federal reserve to continue manipulating markets  and continue quantitative easing policies without investigation is not something an American First President would do. There are so many things a President could do and say to prove that he’s not an establishment puppet and Trump has done nothing </p>

<p>True for lock her up as phrasing but drain the swamp is old and both ideas are as old as American politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the government interest to acknowledge and support voices which &quot;pretend&quot; to be speaking for them which Q obviously does. That&#39;s a serious communication problem they wouldn&#39;t want to create. Therefore I don&#39;t consider your explanation likely.</p>

<p>You make assumptions about how &quot;easy&quot; things are for the current president without knowing the factors involved. Who are the players and how do they project their interest. What are the risks to do this and that in what order? We just don&#39;t truly know and therefore assuming Trump could just do X even if it&#39;s in his interest which we don&#39;t know either is pretty short sighted. I don&#39;t say this here to white wash what Trump does or not does but just to question the simplicity of the situation.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the older red team planner post which discusses more military aspects but has a few points which should always be considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please. Everyone running for President knows damn well that comes with risks. If he were truly anti-establishment he would certainly be willing to put his body on the line for the betterment of humanity. The fact that Trump can’t even honestly say that the stock market is a bubble, the fact that he can’t even admit something as small as that proves he’s an establishment puppet. If he can’t even say that without getting killed, imagine what would happen if he actually threatened the unelected power structure in the State Department, the Pentagon, and the Federal Reserve. The guy is a total establishment puppet, and even if he isn’t, he’s still a disgrace in my eyes for not exposing the sheer corruption that exists and not putting his body on the line </p>

<p>What&#39;s the gain outside of satisfying you?</p>

<p>They&#39;ll ride the economical dead horse as long as they can anyway before they aren&#39;t sure they have a working alternative. We should all pray that they find another alternative than WW3.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. To me it&#39;s clear these people are part of the government since last November. Therefore calling this a LARP makes no sense to me whatsoever.</p>

<p>If people would just call it a psyop there would be a lot more common ground. That still leaves a lot room to discuss the quality of informations. Like what is true, what is disinformation and who the targets are.</p>

<p>My side? What side is that, the one that asks for proof? Please, show me proof that this 4chan bullshit is real, I’m open to evidence, but there never seems to be any. All this shit just similar to cold readings Or Nostradamus nonsense. Speak in vague riddles and people will stretch it to fit their narrative and try to make it make it make sense.</p>

<p>Or are you referring to Trump doing an AMA over there? If that&#39;s the case, then sure, I could believe that. Obama did an AMA here years ago. It was bullshit and I can only assume a Trump AMA would be the very same level of bullshit. </p>
