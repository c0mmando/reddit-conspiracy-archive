       Check the top and most controversial posts for the past day and note the position of that post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that although this post is only 6 hours old, you’ll find it is already quite a ways down the controversial page, and it is no longer on the new or top pages for the past day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, there are plenty of posts with fewer points and fewer comments which appear above it. It’s as if posts like these are being suppressed.

       I don’t think this is something the mods are doing. I think it’s something Trump supporters are doing and also the lack of anti-Trump shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is as bad of an anti-Trump shilling problem as people say, a rare anti-Trump post like mine here would be heavily upvoted and “shilled”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people just don’t care though, and that there’s a way to keep posts off of controversial, most likely by not downvoting them. So while most of the comments disagree with my premise, most of the commenters probably didn’t downvote. As for upvotes, they are nearly nonexistent, as are supportive comments. The only couple of supportive comments are short comments which don’t lend to discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most anti-Trump posts end up like that, as evidenced by their absence in the most controversial for the past day/week/month/year, yet there appear to be plenty of them if you keep an eye on new, and there appears to be plenty of anti-Trump comments in many posts. I think these commenters aren’t voting though, because they mostly don’t care, which seems to conflict with the idea that there is an anti-Trump shilling effort here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe there is a shilling effort, but one side is more effective. I’m not sure really, I just know I’ve seen a discrepancy between the number of posts bitching about Trump in new over time, and the number which have “stuck” in top/controversial.

       I don’t understand, why are you threatening me? From my perspective it looks like topic dilution was used to bring things to this point and I was mocked for making this post in most of the comments, and did you look at the images? I didn’t make this up, you can sort by top or controversial for the past year and see the same thing for yourself.

       Are you saying that’s all intentional?

       I’d support Dwayne too. I can understand the desire to keep politics off of here, but that leaves us with politics and the_donald, neither which allow any sort of real discussion as far as I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that is it though, but the reason for my post was the discrepancy between the frequency of these posts found while watching new and the relative few which have managed to stick over the course of time. It’s as if someone is deliberately ensuring that you cannot find them on here. They aren’t on top, they aren’t on controversial. They exist and they get quite a few comments and sometimes even a few votes, but they just seem to get buried. It seems like someone (t_d, Cambridge Analytics) knows how to achieve this burial and has been taking steps to suppress these conspiracies from receiving any substantial discussion.

       You were pretty blatant about it, but I suspect most of the comments here complaining about my post are from regulars like you. Maybe that's why anti-Trump posts are absent in the past year.

       Maybe take into account that Trump’s popularity is higher than Obama’s was at this time in his presidency, he has given us tax cuts, putting more money in our pockets ($25 a week myself) pulled out of bad deals that cost our country billions if not trillions for nothing in return, jobs are up, economy is up, and we are having less illegal immigration for the first time in over a decade. Yeah things are looking up. Hard to bash something when it’s a good something.

       How about his stance on Mexicans, his stance on Muslims, his refusal to disclose his tax returns, his refusal to divest himself from a controlling interest in his companies, his treatment of women, his connections with the mob, his deceptive business practices like Trump University?

       And there are the CNN talking points.

      <p>
       He said that Mexico isn’t sending their best when it comes to illegals with drug trafficking and murders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn’t a Muslim ban, was a temporary ban on countries with high volume of terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave his companies to his sons as president cuz by law he can’t have control over them while president.
      </p>
      <p>
       What treatment of women? Haven’t seen anything other than possibly sleeping consensually with a prom star, like I give a shit that he got laid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Connection with the mob? Haven’t heard anything about that to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump university was simply a flop and he kept the money that was invested. Shitty thing to do maybe but not entirely illegal if I’m not mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the war that you seem to think is going to happen is the swamps in different countries trying to start a conflict.

       You're saying all of those things are CNN talking points? Because many of them were known before he ever ran for President, back when he was a Democrat even.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single one of them is true? So let me ask you, is there anything critical you have to say about him, even one thing? Because it's starting to sound like there isn't, which would make this an unproductive conversation for us to have.
      </p>

       He released his tax returns and proved he paid more than Comcast....so there is that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes there are things I am critical about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t like the ban on bump stocks he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t like that he wants sessions going after weed the way he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t like the attack on the air as that took place last year in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is not without flaws. No one is, and no one will ever be.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what he is doing is damn good for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Democrat he was would align more with republicans now because of how far left the Democrats have really gone, he hasn’t changed, the Democrats have.

       He never released his tax returns though. Did you really think he has? Do you have a link to those? I tried googling for them but all I could find is this article explaining why he hasn't and won't, or something:

       He hasn’t released his most recent ones because legally he doesn’t have to and it’s illegal for him to be forced to. Personally I don’t care about his tax returns. I don’t care about Obama’s either. Or bush’s, or Clinton’s. That’s their business, not mine, just like who they sleep with. However, in 2005, he paid more than Comcast on his taxes.

       Never stated he released his most recent tax returns. Good job adding words in your head to try and “get” me. I stated he released tax returns, I didn’t state when, because I couldn’t remember what year until I looked it up again.

       I did a quick search and he has released them in the past.

       No, you didn't. You just said he released his tax returns. I'm not trying to "get" you, I'm trying to see these tax returns he released, because I'm pretty sure he never released any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like he released three pages of his 1995 tax returns. Is that what you meant when you said

       I'm not trying to "get" you here. I just want to see the tax returns. I wouldn't be surprised if he has and I just didn't know about it, because I don't partake in T_D and as we both know politics is incredibly biased against him.

       Aside from the bump stock ban, when has T_D ever been critical of Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what you should have said in regards to the tax returns is that he hasn't released them, because releasing them in 1996 means nothing 22 years later when he is currently the President, and every past president has released their tax returns upon assuming office.

       Even if it was that long ago, he they were released. But again, by law, he doesn’t have to.

      <p>
       We have been critical of everything from trying to make a deal for DACA to bump stocks to the spending bill to the appointment of different people to his staff to the strike on Syrian soil last year. We question everything he does and let it play out. If it’s a bad call, we are willing to say so. It’s not just blind faith in T_D.

       That's not it at all actually. There are plenty of people bashing Trump, aren't there? I'm not upset about anything, but I am wondering why all of these posts discussing Trump's very questionable past and present behavior are being effectively buried here. It's not organic.

       Oh, so the death threats and sending white powder to family members of trump isn’t that hateful? The fires in his building and people laughing on twitter and hoping there is severe damage isn’t hateful? People outright on Facebook, Twitter, news article and interviews and places like Ellen, joking about killing trump isn’t hateful. Even if it was bad for obama, which I think I only ever saw a handful of things images or people dissing him, never reached the insanity of the left now, let alone that outright comments on national tv wanting him dead. Yeah, there is a big fucking difference.

       Yeah, there is a big difference. No one hated Trump until he started doing crazy shit. Hell, even the republicans hated him until it became clear that he was going to be their shot to win the presidency. In fact, if anything they started all of the Trump hate, didn't they?

       So him saying stuff that you don’t like or agree with justifies the outright calls for death, white powder sent to his family and the glee of people hearing about a fire in Trump tower. Gotcha.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the media that started all of the attacks. Whichever side party they land with doesn’t matter as the media is very corrupt.

       Why would anything justify calls for his death and white powder sent to his family? What the fuck seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, nothing justifies that, and whoever did that should be thrown in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, outright calls for his death and white powder sent to his family don't justify any wrongdoing he's guilty of.

       Nothing justifies vitriolic hate/death threats, it’s sick. On both sides, the few that I do see towards obama were made major news, however the ones that are made towards trump are flaunted as a badge of honor. It’s sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there is stuff that I’m not a fan of, but the good outweighs the bad in my opinion. And different presidents had had their strengths and weaknesses. However, I feel that trump has been attacked more than anyone before him and this nobody sees the good he has done and is blinded by everyone’s hate for him, so they jump on the band wagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can agree to disagree. That’s my take.

       Sure but why does this sub have to be full of pro trump stuff? Go to t_d for that, right?

       If there wasn’t anything about Trump here, it isn’t like I’d start posting about him. My post is about the fact that both top and controversial over the past year are full of pro-trump rhetoric.

       I think the problem is people no longer understand what true free speech is. Every one is so used to being coddled. They are told that they're opinion must be respected. But true free speech means fuck your opinion! Now, I don't mean that as an attack on OP. I say that towards everybody's view point. Including my own.True free speech means that view point that you hate, despise, and find to be most offensive is going to be as free to be spoken, heard, and pushed forward the same as the view you love. And on this subreddit you have both pro Trump and anti Trump views pushed with both sides complaining. Which tells me this subreddit is pretty tolerant and open.

       Nowhere is safe from censorship, not even this sub. If anything, this is one of the less "free" places on the site, and it's pretty obvious to see if you take the time to look for it. At least they make the log public here though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just pull up the top and most controversial posts for the past day, week, month, or year, and ask yourself what's missing. I saw a common theme, which is why I made the post I was referring to in this post. Speech is not free, it never was and it never has been. You have to fight tooth and nail for it, and even then the rug can be pulled out from under you if you step too far out of line.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is true everywhere, including reddit and including this sub, and there's always a "good reason" for it, it can always be explained away somehow.

       I didn't mean the individuals in the subreddit. I meant the subreddit itself allows for all to push their views. What you view of anti trump view being down voted is confirmation bias. There are many anti trump views votes up and reach high up on the top list. For example, how many times have u seen a variation of this headline, "Trump is done for sure". As a Trump supporter I see them all the time. It is my confirmation bias. My mind immediately notices them. It will quickly dismiss and forget posts about flat earth.  Even though there may be more flat earth posts in a day.
