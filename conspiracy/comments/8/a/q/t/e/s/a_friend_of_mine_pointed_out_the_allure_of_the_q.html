        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...exactly why the Q thing reeks so hard of propaganda, and comes off like a conspiracy theorist appeal campaign; it&#39;s inherently positive in nature, in contrast to all the depressing theories that have been launched since before the election. </p>

<p>Q kinda provides the best of all conspiracy worlds-- constant noting of enemies, a riddle and puzzle game-playing aspect to be deciphered, and a series of hoped-for problem solvers that just so happen to be the president and the people he&#39;s chosen to surround himself with. </p>

<p>For my friend, the fact that the only people to buy Q are obvious Trump supporters is secondary to the positive aspects of the overarching narrative. He&#39;s a hopeful guy who wants to see real change, and so is taken by the theory not based on any presented &quot;evidence&quot; or the likelihood that it is real, but on the promoted Hope and Change proponents aim to inspire in the conspiracy-minded. It seems to be these aspects that are the most compelling. </p>

<p>And for me, it&#39;s these same aspects that make the whole thing seem suspicious and like an organized but effective psyop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Q group is who they day they are, ie Military intelligence close to the POTUS, then the whole thing is, by definition, a psychological operation. Is a psyop aimed at achieving a positive end a novelty? If what is promised is actually achieved, then will anyone really care to remember the methods utilized to achieve the goal? Especially when those methods have been used to society&#39;s detriment for centuries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few months back it conclusively outed itself as bullshit. I don&#39;t remember the exact date, so this will require digging to confirm, but here you go.</p>

<p>Q posted an image that a few days later was tweeted by a White House Twitter account. 4chan went crazy, Q was confirmed legit. The only problem was that the Twitter account in question actually posted the same picture <em>every year</em> on the same date to commemorate some minor holiday or anniversary (sorry I forget which one).</p>

<p>That to me is clear proof of manufacturing &quot;clues.&quot; He slipped up and made it too obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Q should have just kept throwing out riddles instead of actual predictions that will or won&#39;t come true. Recently he&#39;s told his followers that an extremely damning Hillary tape is about to come out, possibly having to do with Epstein. A couple days ago he said an Obama picture would surface that would shut down the internet. Apparently hes dressed like a terrorist and shooting an American flag with an Ak-47.</p>

<p>Now these predictions are complete hilarious fan fiction that gets his fans extremely excited. But at some point I hope his followers realize they dont need Q anymore. He got them together to investigate stuff and fight for what they believe in, that&#39;s great. But now hes jist sending them on wild goose chases and getting them excited over bullshit that will never happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes and no. Yes it&#39;s a psyop, obviously, it basically presents as such; if you asked a &#39;true believer&#39; to describe in general terms what was happening, their response would be a passable definition of the term.</p>

<p>But no in the sense that that&#39;s all that&#39;s going on. In broader context, you could call it a sort of nega-psyop, like a prophylactic, a way of innoculating trump&#39;s supporters against a much bigger trick they were playing on everybody else. I&#39;ll call it &#39;Operation: Crouching Sessions, Hidden Huber&#39;.</p>

<p>Goes like this - the mueller probe, Trump/Russia in general, is the primary threat to Trump&#39;s political existence. They needed a counterstrategy, and we know what that is - to try and show that the whole thing&#39;s a frame-up, rooted in high-level corruption in the DOJ and FBI.</p>

<p>The problem they have is operation security - if they pursue their strategy openly it&#39;ll all leak through to the media, who&#39;ll leap out of their skins to spin it any which way and send the whole thing to clown town. </p>

<p>So, they hatch a plan - appear to be pursuing their goals through the OIG, which has no prosecutorial power and so can be safely ignored by the other team. While in secret they appoint a prosecutor (Huber), who can work behind the scenes and give the OIG investigation real actual teeth. By the time Huber is revealed, the work is more or less over, there&#39;s nothing left to interfere with. Moreover, the media have spent so much time ignoring/downplaying the OIG&#39;s efforts - which is the right move, if the OIG is acting alone - that they can&#39;t suddenly admit what&#39;s happening and claim it&#39;s all been a great injustice all along. It&#39;ll be too late.</p>

<p>Not a bad plan. The one problem - it requires 6 months of silence, in which trump&#39;s team have to pretend that nothing&#39;s really happening. They can&#39;t have their supporters taking the same bait as their opponents, thinking that a toothless OIG report is the only card trump&#39;s left with and that there&#39;s no hope for him.</p>

<p>So, they hatch the second plan - a nega-psyop, to convince trump&#39;s supporters (and anyone else paying attention) that the psyop being played on everybody else isn&#39;t real. Q is a part of that, as are (to varying degrees) Hannity, Sara Carter, Assange and anybody else who&#39;s spent the last 6 months waggling their eyebrows and saying &#39;tick tock&#39;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my take, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really sure how to parse that, sorry. If you&#39;re suggesting that the mueller probe is no longer a threat to trump, I tend to agree, it&#39;s looking very much like a busted flush at the moment. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting that it was <em>never</em> a threat to trump, or even intended to be, and that my claiming otherwise is some oblique attempt to frame him in a victim posture - well, that&#39;s a longer and more tedious conversation. One I&#39;m happy to have, mind you, even though I know from experience that the most I can hope to get out of it is an idea of what you have to pretend you can&#39;t understand in order to keep it going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s essentially a psy-op in my opinion. </p>

<p>The social engineers created an unverifiable anonymous user, to play upon their desperation for some kind of &quot;savior&quot; or &quot;hero&quot;. Plus, Q seems to serve as positive PR for Trump and his administration.</p>

<p>It&#39;s essentially propaganda to try and convince the small (and I mean VERY small, and ever shrinking) circle of pro-trump conspiracy theorists, that POTUS is &quot;taking down the elites&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s there to give you false hope and make you subdued and unwilling to actively pursue the crimes of the elite ourselves, because you thunk some insider has it all taken care of. </p>

<p>In reality, the intelligence agencies or potential shills sit around and come up with a narrative, throw you some breadcrumbs to make it look legit, and are leading the Q followers on big time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, where are you getting that vibe from? The ship is sinking, rightfully so..</p>

<p>Immediately following the election there may have been some conspiracy theorists who legitimately thought Trump was an &quot;outsider&quot; on this sub. It was pretty bad for awhile having to deal with that blatant partisan bias here, but after we discovered his Epstein connections, rape allegations, Rothschild connections, pro-war rhetoric, things fizzled out and people came to their senses. </p>

<p>People on this sub realized how ridiculous it was to ever think a U.S. president, chosen and installed by the ruling class, was ever going to &quot;take down the elites.&quot; They tricked us with a phony reverse psychology election. </p>

<p>Now, once they saw people were jumping the Trump ship, they had to devise a way to bring them all back, so they created &quot;Q&quot;. The last thing they want is the country united under hatred and skepticism for one of their puppet presidents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take it a step farther.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a writer, and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about how basically EVERY. SINGLE western work basically follows the story structure of the &#39;hero&#39;s journey&#39;. I&#39;ve been thinking about it because I want to try to do something that DOESN&#39;T follow that story structure, but is still rewarding for an audience conditioned to that arc.</p>

<p>If we consider that we&#39;re essentially brainwashed since childhood to believe in &#39;the discourse of capitalism&#39; (your value is based on how much money you have, possessing physical objects will increase your happiness, your social standing is based on your capacity to consume, etc.), simply through being inundated with smiling faces on advertisements since we were born, consider how much more powerful the perpetual conditioning of a particular form of a story can be.</p>

<p>During the 2016 elections, I noted that, in a state of unknowing and fear, we&#39;ll often sort of symbolically revert to the state of children....we don&#39;t know what to do, so we look for some Father figure to &#39;make everything right again&#39;. Trump filled that role, hence he&#39;s popularity.</p>

<p>One of the things I noted, during the whole pizzagate thing, was a constant theme of &#39;It&#39;s about to Happen!&#39; or &#39;Thursday, the big news will come&#39;. After being burned a few times, I started to think, the purpose of these posts is to keep people in a holding pattern....if you think some BIG NEWS is right around the corner, you&#39;ll just be anxiously waiting to see what happens. You won&#39;t be taking it on yourself to exact charge; you think something is brewing in the wings and you&#39;re just expectantly waiting on the outcome. Obviously, nothing ever happened; HRC is still running around, the swamp is swampier than ever, billionaires got their tax cuts.</p>

<p>I think Q is an extension of this strategy. I think we&#39;ve been so conditioned by movies and books to expect that there is such a thing as &#39;heros&#39; that will always magically &#39;save the day&#39;, that we irrationally give credence to narratives that fit that idea. All those &#39;Q-anon patriot&#39; are waiting for a &#39;hero&#39; to save them; as a society, we&#39;re totally complacent because we have the false notion that &#39;the system will correct itself&#39; or that &#39;a savior&#39; will show up to &#39;right the wrongs&#39;.</p>

<p>I believe this is false. I believe if anyone is going to enact change, it needs to be us. There is no hero coming to save us, TPTB are against us, and if we want anything to change it starts with us. YOU, me, everyone, if we want change to happened, WE have to do it. No one will come in and save us, there is no Jesus figure that will take on all our sins and die for us. It&#39;s on us, totally and entirely. That seems like a gargantuan task, because who are we? We&#39;re not people in positions of power, we&#39;re not big shots....what are we supposed to do?</p>

<p>If you understand this &#39;hero&#39;s journey&#39; conditioning, then you can understand how to &#39;hack&#39; it. You can create a Q-type thing, that plays into all the archetypes and ideals people are conditioned to believe (as OP has astutely pointed out). As long as everyone thinks the &#39;big thing&#39; is right around the corner, they&#39;re not focusing on all the bad shit that&#39;s happened unchecked; they&#39;re giving lame-ass motherfuckers the space to work their deceptions in the shadows. Reinvigorated by the idea there&#39;s &#39;patriots&#39; working behind the scenes to &#39;bring down the cabal&#39;, they completely ignore all the horrible shit that&#39;s going down in front of their eyes...it&#39;s &#39;4D chess&#39;, there&#39;s some ulterior motive to all the ostensibly fucking over of our own interests that&#39;s occurring right under our noses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a brilliant little piece of propaganda. It&#39;s so good that even I&#39;m holding out a modicum of hope that there is some pedo-take-down occuring behind the scenes....however, if I disregard that brainwashed/hero-conditioned part of my brain, occam&#39;s razor says it&#39;s bullshit to keep the rubes docile and complacent...a skillset our Gov &amp; intelligence agencies have completely mastered over the years.</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dang I agree with you across the board, down to my own recent reading of Joseph Campbell&#39;s Hero&#39;s Journey archetype and the massive trouble that arises when you try to apply this to the real world-- particularly regarding unknown/future events, whereas the past can be manipulated into good v evil arcs and patterns depending on whichever bias is producing the narrative. </p>

<p>I look at the intentions and &quot;hope and change&quot; aspect of the Q movement and think, how is this any different than a general political campaign? You want your candidate to be the ultimate savior of all the world&#39;s problems and you want others to be believe the same. Then I recall this is a campaign, Trump is gunning for 2020 and his promoters know exactly the kinds of things his support has been propelled by. Notions of him taking down &quot;the cabal&quot; have always been central to his promoted rebel appeal. When this all fits so damn snuggly with the Q narrative, it really makes you wonder. </p>

<p>Ditto for the Russian collusion theory too-- his opponents want him to be viewed as a traitor and cheat, and they will maintain this even if he gets off easy in the Mueller investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like postmodern lit. The thing is, it&#39;s so hard to make something popular that doesn&#39;t fit that arc. You can make some arthouse film or avant guarde piece —where &#39;there is no meaning&#39;, or there&#39;s a contrarian take on the traditional structure — and maybe people that are students of story structure will appreciate that you zigged when people normally zag, but for a general audience shit will be dissonant, unrewarding, cacophonic. I understand this can and has worked well in literature...atm, I&#39;m focused on film and TV, where it&#39;s worked much less often and much less successfully. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve figured out how I can do an &#39;inverse&#39; hero&#39;s journey, where events are the opposite of the normal journey, but a hero&#39;s journey is still taking place on a &#39;internal&#39; level. We&#39;ll see how that shapes out though....still building now.</p>

<p>Any postmodern lit recommendations? Always on the look out for new stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for current TV, I highly recommend the series Atlanta. The dude running the show is trying to portray the black experience in America as a Twin Peaks-type series of absurdity and chaos with real people struggling to make sense of it all and live. It&#39;s really something and thrives on protagonists who are anti-heros at best, deeply flawed but trying real people in the midst of nonsense and pain. </p>

<p>As for lit, you can always check out one of the massive postmodern tomes (Wallace, Gaddis, Pynchon) but my favorite is probably Don Delillo. It&#39;s a pretty relevant &quot;genre&quot; to be working in right now IMO, as we are in the guts of the postmodern, postmodern age as we speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, how did I know you&#39;d say Don Delillo? MF is ALWAYS the &#39;postmodern&#39; author people say they love. TBH, I&#39;ll take Pynchon over Delillo any day, but I appreciate your point.</p>

<p>Love Atlanta. Although it follows the hero&#39;s journey too, does it not? Paperboi and Earn have both embarked on a personal hero&#39;s journey; there&#39;s the call to action of getting hot, they turn down &#39;mentors&#39;, they &#39;cross the threshold&#39; into being a part of the game, they&#39;re tested by &#39;allies, enemies, and rivals&#39;, Earn looks inside himself, etc.....I haven&#39;t seen any of the 2nd season yet, so maybe it diverges. Love Donald Glover though. I think the most exciting &#39;alternative structure&#39; thing I&#39;ve seen in film recently is Soddenberg&#39;s &#39;Mosaic&#39;. He released it as a kind of &#39;choose your own adventure&#39; app, and then strung together the most prevalent storylines and released as a coherent story on HBO. Def working &#39;watching&#39;/&#39;experiencing&#39; it over the app, though.</p>

<p>Gaspar Noe is also pretty good about subverting traditional forms.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re thirsty for more &#39;out there&#39; post modern authors, check out Pierre Guyotat for an extreme example of &#39;no structure&#39;, Roberto Bolano is great, Michel Houellebecq, Bulgakov...there&#39;s a book that it seems like everyone knows, but House of Leaves by Danielewski is a good playing-with-structure novel if you haven&#39;t read it (he worked with Dierrida before he died, I believe).</p>

<p>Anyway, nice chatting. Good to see other people are sort of &#39;seeing through&#39; Q. Do you know who Vladislav Surkov is? I think he&#39;s the best propaganda guy to exist in our lifetimes, and I think we&#39;re regularly subject to the reiteration of his machavellian ideas via western hacks or copycats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for all the recs dude, I&#39;m working on a sleepless night and could use some &quot;alternative structures&quot; to tuck me in properly. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always appreciated Delillo&#39;s elemental, myth quality, the lack of obnoxious game-playing with the reader, and how clearly the next gen of writers ripped him off. House of Leaves was cool but I felt it was experimental to a fault, came off as novelty after awhile and didn&#39;t end up revealing much along the lines of profundity. His latter books seem even more divergent along these lines. He&#39;s still doing that 18 novel cycle right? Motherfucker sure is dedicated. </p>

<p>Definitely do check out season 2 of Atlanta, it&#39;s just getting better and better. I see yr point about standard expectant arcs for Earn and Al but there&#39;s a listlessness and return to reality there that continues to oppress, even when it looks like breakthroughs are on the horizon. Plus the dilemma of getting what you &quot;want&quot; and worked toward but not finding some immediate salvation in your apparent success. Fantastic series. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well written, I wish I was able to come to that conclusion a lot quicker. Not being American I had to jump into the Trump mess to figure out why everyone got so polarized about everything and came pretty much to the conclusion the propaganda in America has reached new levels of complexity. Also it was enjoyable seeing how many Trump supporters , when feeling safe in a particular group would let slip a lot of closed minded beliefs that they would never admit in person. 
The &quot;Hero&#39;s Journey&quot; as you put it, is how virtually all American media , be it &quot;news&quot; or fiction follows. To the point I feel they have managed to mold many generations to only grasp onto a fictional outlook of reality. There also seems to be a very interesting situation in where people will believe a lie told to them with very little evidence, but require a mountain of super detail information to question what they&#39;ve been told. Unless it comes from a &quot;Hero/Savior&quot; type figure that is already known to them. 
They are getting very good at distracting people as people move closer to an actual truth of situations. All these things create an environment for many &quot;false heroes&quot; and media personalities to arise and profit off of this type of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>Everybody has a theory. The real meaning of this, the motivation behind that. But at the end of the day only facts matter.</p>

<p>1.TPP was the ultimate deep state contract. Written in secret, where even Senators had to go into a room with no pen, paper, phone or aid, and read hundreds upon hundreds of incredibly techincal documents that literally no one person on earth could understand. I would have guaranteed Big Pharma (the most or 2nd most profitable industry on earth) their margins for decades. Along with many others...</p>

<p>2.Paris Accords. A literal cash transfer of $100 Trillion or so, from the working people of the planet to the wise ones who can spend on whatever they want. It would have guaranteed the position of scientific intelligentsia for the rest of the Century.</p>

<p>Both were killed by Trump.</p>

<p>I give zero fucks about your application of Joseph Campbell&#39;s theory (he stole it from Jung anyway) to the current saga, I care about real life. If you willfully believe the biggest home runs since the Federal Reserve and the creation of the IMF were not important than you are not nearly as smart as you think you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the easiest way to prove that Q is absolutely real: only posts which negatively speculate on the drops get upvotes here. That all happened within the span of a week. The drops used to be posted here every day and made the front page. Then, instantly, they were all downvoted into oblivion.</p>

<p>Go and try it for yourself.</p>

<p>Anyways, Q had been proven 100% real. Four words: &quot;Tip top tippy top&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, where are you getting that vibe from? The ship is sinking, rightfully so..</p>

<p>Immediately following the election there may have been some conspiracy theorists who legitimately thought Trump was an &quot;outsider&quot; on this sub. It was pretty bad for awhile having to deal with that blatant partisan bias here, but after we discovered his Epstein connections, rape allegations, Rothschild connections, pro-war rhetoric, things fizzled out and people came to their senses. </p>

<p>People on this sub realized how ridiculous it was to ever think a U.S. president, chosen and installed by the ruling class, was ever going to &quot;take down the elites.&quot; They tricked us with a phony reverse psychology election. </p>

<p>Now, once they saw people were jumping the Trump ship, they had to devise a way to bring them all back, so they created &quot;Q&quot;. The last thing they want is the country united under hatred and skepticism for one of their puppet presidents. </p>

<p>Q posted an image that a few days later was tweeted by a White House Twitter account. 4chan went crazy, Q was confirmed legit. The only problem was that the Twitter account in question actually posted the same picture <em>every year</em> on the same date to commemorate some minor holiday or anniversary (sorry I forget which one).</p>
