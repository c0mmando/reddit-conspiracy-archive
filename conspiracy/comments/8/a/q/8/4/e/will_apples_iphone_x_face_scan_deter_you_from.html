       We know the answer for the helpless general population. But what are your stances on this face scan technology? Are we in a learned helpless state where we should just adopt the newer technology anyways- the finger print scanner and information they have on us is immense already. Are there any alternatives?

       There's a lot of tracking built into it, but its all easily managable too. Shutup10 is a great little program that will do most of the registry edits for you in a really clear, understandable way.

       I wouldn't use an apple phone even if someone gave it to me for free with or without facial scanner. It's crazy how stuff gets rehashed every year with essentially the same functions but a brand spanking new price tag. It's almost like these companies have found a way to get people to keeping buying the same older priced gadget every mining their pockets with cash. Admittedly though I have a Note 8 though because my LG got so old it pretty much died completely. I mean the Note 8 is nice an all but I still do the same exact shit I did with my 5 year old LG. So why the $1000 price tag? Ridiculousness.

       I've said this before and I will keep saying it again. The Facial Recognition feature on the iPhone X js their way of harvesting people's faces in one giant database which is then compromised to the CIA and other secret service agencies. I have an s8+ that is pretty new and working great, and now just a month ago samsung released the s9/s9+ which was very quick. I never understood what was the point trying to keep up with "upgrades" if your current phone is working just fine? And we all know the upgrades are bullshit half the time, barely anything changes from one phone to another. They just want to keep the people in this cyclical loop of hyperconsumerist culture.

       I agree with you but let me ask you this:  Where do you see your hardware usage in say....five years when all cellphones no longer have the audio port?  Then what?  Or say all phones have face scanning and now thats the default for locking a phone?
      </p>
      <p>
       My game plan is a flip phone...If I get forced out of the modern hardware, I'm going WAY back in one giant leap...I'm not going down this path...

       Oh man.  I never plan that far ahead. I really don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have an option for wired headset. Hopefully, by then, technology would’ve improved battery life, which is my main gripe about it. I do have a pair of pretty decent BT headphones, but I only use them at home. They’re big around the ear types. I use earbuds when I’m out.

       I thought I would be ok with Bluetooth headsets and speakers but honestly it’s one more thing to keep charged and to maintain.   I’ve had a few headsets already where I didn’t use them for a month and the battery was too far gone to come back so they were junked.    I prefer an option to plug in for the best quality and least hassle with sharing music with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Visiting a friends house with an already established Bluetooth system is a nightmare.

       Entering a passcode will most likely always be there as a failsafe for Face ID, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see both being mandatory at some point in the future.

       Maybe not mandatory, but what if it came out one day that Face ID was always working, even if you turned it off. The same way some apple phones were found to be tracking you everywhere you went “totally by accident, we swear (™)”.

       This is such a self-centered view. Maybe you live a type of life that allows for that, I'm moving that way myself, but for the large majority of the people in modern society that really isnt an option anymore if they want to maintain their current life.

       I never said you could keep your current lifestyle,  it's an obvious change that you would be willing to make. I don't know why you got so defensive, maybe you're not open to this kind of departure with your beloved technology? I've never depended on it so not upgrading and getting the newest tech is not a big change for me. And bonus points for not living in a straw hut in the middle of nowhere! Lived in the Bay Area in California and now still live in Cali with out being a shunned non-techie,  lol.

       Defensive? I said I'm on the same path as you. Im just pointing out that it's akin to saying "Just give up the internet" or "Just move to the other side of the world" for the large majority of people and making a comment like that really adds nothing.

       I think of no one does day something like this,  then people assume everyone has a cell phone and lives the tech life. I don't meet many people who don't have one,  even people who live more simply than I do. Sorry if I read your tone wrong,  but you made it sound impassible to go without one and I just want people to know it's not that hard and people do it.

       I think one of my biggest issues (or advantages depending on your perspective) with the iPhone X facial recognition system often gets overlooked. Sure, they probably use that biometric data and store it elsewhere for future use. But what I often think of is how when I first got a cell phone, any agency could access my data but you couldn’t necessarily verify that it was actually me using the phone at that time. That’s because access to unlock a device was either just the push of a button or simple passcode to gain entry. Now with the massive push by the industry for added security features via fingerprint scanning or facial recognition, every time that phone is unlocked it’s practically verifying that is is indeed me who is searching these phrases, visiting these sites, at this location, taking these photos, and are texting/calling/emailing these people. It’s an excellent tool for tracking our movement and tendencies with a built-in confirmation system of user identity.

       Wow... Very good point. I need to think on this for awhile. The ability to plausibly deny that you were the one using a device is pretty important. I always just assumed if questioned about something shady, someone could just say “It was somebody else”. I guess one should keep in mind that if you are going to do something questionable, you should probably have a secondary device, preferably without biometrics.

       People in this thread need to inform themselves. The fingerprint sensor never stored any data outside of the device, neither does the facial scanner. This is unique to Apple, most likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay attention to court cases and international kerfuffles. India wanted Apple to share biometric data, which Apple could not technically give.

       I have an iPhone X, I have never used faceID I just type in a 4 digit numerical code like the good old iphone 5 days. 
I however did use the touchID, because the government already has my fingerprints on file anyway because of my concealed carry permit.

       Yeah exactly. They are proven to have extremely addictive qualities, and only designed to last a couple years. They've been caught recently sending updates designed to slow phones (even though we've known this for years).
