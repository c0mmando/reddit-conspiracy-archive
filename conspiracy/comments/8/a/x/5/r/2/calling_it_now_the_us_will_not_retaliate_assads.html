       (I may be wrong. in which case, my benefit of a doubt in Trump is indeed over.) Trump's announcement of leaving Syria was a bait. and someone swallowed it. That's all. Bonus theory: There wasn't even a gas attack. Just staged and faked by White Helmets.

       One can only hope, other wise that plan mentioned will continue as usual ... It has taken a bit longer than expected. Although Bolton has been screaming to bomb Iran for more than a decade.

       As we saw last night, Israeli jets were not supported by American jets or anything else.  We also saw last night that Israel is heeding Russia's warning to not even enter Syrian air space.  Israel simply has no ability to attack either Syria or Iran, and the USA is not going to do it, either, whether with or without Israel.

       it wasn't Assad's gas attack, it was the US/Israel's gas attack.

       Trump knows this was a CIA/Mossad job, which is why Trump won't "retaliate" to the false flag.

       I'm inclined to think that the 'gas attack' was pretty much Israel's doing, as was the missiles fired from Lebanese air space early Monday morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also inclined to think that there are enough people in the US military who understand that the USA does not have the ability to prevail in The Middle East versus Russia that the USA will therefore not be challenging Russia there - or anywhere - anytime soon, if ever.  Russia has proven it has a military defense capability and enough support from China which can prevent the USA/NATO from successfully attacking Russia.

       More like he is chaining Bolton in place actually. Trump could simply ignore Bolton (or just kick him out if he's too intrusive). Bolton......can't. Which is ultimately what he would probably do: ignore the fool.

       He's already ignoring the congress and the CIA already, so Bolton and the NSA isn't some exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Bolton NEEDS Trump to approve to go to war or doing pretty much anything. If Trump ignores him, he couldn't do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do we REALLY see Trump doing anything overtly hawkish? He's pretty much just all talk about doing it. Which is kinda genius really since nobody could really do shit without his approval in the matter of foreign state affairs, so all he needs to do to stop the war is do nothing. And do nothing he is.

       He has been parroting the same lines as the neo-cons then appoints them to key cabinet positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only hope he will do the right thing and avoid wars, but the direction he is on looks like more of the same Zionist war mongering.

       No mention of Yemen, Saudis still getting weapons to oppress their neighbor. Trying to get out of the Iran peace deal. Meanwhile if somebody sneezes in Syria his state department is all over it.

       Again, the dude is pretty much doing the "all talk, no action" strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could say about Yemen. But that's pretty much a conflict the US has zero involvement whatsoever aside from selling weapons, which isn't even THAT involved since the US thrives by selling weapons anyways.

       deal, don't twisting words dude. Which again, isn't really mark any thing significant about his stance. So again, all talk, no action.

       Pledge full military support to Israel: Isn't that just ally talk? He again doing nothing to not play ball.

       Talk precedes action, always has.  I'm not letting my guard down, or cutting Trump any slack.  He might give us some domestic policy that I like, but I have seen nothing from him that indicates his foreign policy is anything but neo-conservative.

       I find it strange that the investigators sent by Russia claim to have found no evidence. Could this really be totally faked? Those people looked dead as fuck to me..

       I find it cute that anyone here actually attributes anything to Trump.  He won't do shit, the people running this country will tell him what to do.

       I'm inclined to think that the 'gas attack' was pretty much Israel's doing, as was the missiles fired from Lebanese air space early Monday morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also inclined to think that there are enough people in the US military who understand that the USA does not have the ability to prevail in The Middle East versus Russia that the USA will therefore not be challenging Russia there - or anywhere - anytime soon, if ever.  Russia has proven it has a military defense capability and enough support from China which can prevent the USA/NATO from successfully attacking Russia.

       More like he is chaining Bolton in place actually. Trump could simply ignore Bolton (or just kick him out if he's too intrusive). Bolton......can't. Which is ultimately what he would probably do: ignore the fool.
