    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s already ignoring the congress and the CIA already, so Bolton and the NSA isn&#39;t some exception.</p>

<p>Also, Bolton NEEDS Trump to approve to go to war or doing pretty much anything. If Trump ignores him, he couldn&#39;t do shit. </p>

<p>Also, do we REALLY see Trump doing anything overtly hawkish? He&#39;s pretty much just all talk about doing it. Which is kinda genius really since nobody could really do shit without his approval in the matter of foreign state affairs, so all he needs to do to stop the war is do nothing. And do nothing he is.</p>

<p>I can only hope he will do the right thing and avoid wars, but the direction he is on looks like more of the same Zionist war mongering.  </p>

<p>No mention of Yemen, Saudis still getting weapons to oppress their neighbor. Trying to get out of the Iran peace deal. Meanwhile if somebody sneezes in Syria his state department is all over it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the dude is pretty much doing the &quot;all talk, no action&quot; strategy.</p>

<p>You could say about Yemen. But that&#39;s pretty much a conflict the US has zero involvement whatsoever aside from selling weapons, which isn&#39;t even THAT involved since the US thrives by selling weapons anyways.</p>

<p>He is trying to get out the Iran <strong>NUCLEAR</strong> deal, don&#39;t twisting words dude. Which again, isn&#39;t really mark any thing significant about his stance. So again, all talk, no action.</p>

<p>Pledge full military support to Israel: Isn&#39;t that just ally talk? He again doing nothing to not play ball.</p>
