       I'm not here to tell you what they are or if built then who did it. I just collected as many anomalies as I could regarding the Moon and Mars. I believe theres more to the story here that we're not getting, I think some of these images speak for themselves. I did my best to gather non-hoaxed images, so please if there is one among these then let me know so I can remove. Also if you have one to add then feel free to message me so we can put it up!

       It’s insane how “people” on this sub go out of their way to defend NASA and SpaceX. We are being lied to on a grand scale. NASA is Hollywood. Our entire lives we’ve been filled with fairy tales regarding the true nature of our world. It’s beyond fucked. Good post. Glad people are catching on that the moon is a not a natural object

       Something is definitely weird, and here is my wild speculation..
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon is exactly the right distance away for a full eclipse and not a transect, given that it does move farther out over time, what a spectacular happenstance! 13.6 bil years, and we are here, with MANY 'goldilocks' scenarios that needed to happen, and then the more we learn the more goldilocks scenarios we seem to find...
      </p>
      <p>
       Either we are the luckiest planet in all of the known universe/multiverse/holoprojection whatever, or...someone looked at the requirements for life and selected input: water planet, changing temperature around the phase state for water, provide all necessary elements in abundance to enable biology and later technology, provide a moon for stability of orbit, and bonus for changing seasons causing lessening of runaway effects, and let's throw in that it provides an exact eclipse, and make sure it isn't too far away so as to conceal the solar corona.  Just weird. I bet its a duck blind for Earth, by maybe past whoever eons ago, or a station for the scientist that created/provided start up inputs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we are in a simulation or a type of 'natural simulation' that we just don't understand or can conceive of yet that may be tied into some type of cycle of information propagation or something..there has to be a goal right? Right?!

       Or those are the conditions that made life possible. And there are millions of other planets like this one in a 13bi years old. We are not special, we happened. You're looking at it the wrong way, literally.

       There are not millions of other planets like ours because no other planet can sustain or even house life. We keep searching and searching and yet no planet like Earth exists. Earth is an anomaly in the grand scheme of things.

       Ok first the Goldilocks zone is kinda bs, for example Mercury could be a habitable planet if we could reduce it's carbon dioxide count. Second, we have found many other planets similar to ours. Third, most people incorrectly assume to have life you need our exact conditions. This is false as silicon can also be used for life instead of carbon. Lastly we have found lifeforms on Earth that live/exist in acid. Just food for thought.

       I mean... given hundreds of billion years and trillions upon trillions of stars, each with their own potential solar systems, its not so hard to imagine that our planet was just lucky enough to host life.
Considering the possibility of quadrillions of planets out there, it was bound to happen through sheer randomness. Unfortunately we are (probably) not that special.

       Yeah, I don't know/have not the math behind it except for ball park drake-like equation by me, undergraduate pleb. An actual scientist/physicist did some drake-similar type math around it. I can't find the damn source right now, of course, lol, anyway his conjecture one or two of these goldie locks scenarios to happen, yeah totally possible... But for 3 or more of them, ESPECIALLY a moon the size of ours. n-body simulations and other studies looking into show that a moon this large, is WEIRD as well moon formation by colliding planets resulting in a captured moon after a collision like hypthesized is WERID and both of those are highly improbably to the extreme by all educated guesses so far....  One is that we just happen to be near a nubula that was far enough along to have supernova remnanats that ocntained most of the elements?  The statiscs behind that alone must be pretty astronomical that stars were just far along enough to have cooked up the right elements after Iron. Since anything after iron cannot be made in a star but a supernova.  They you account for not all stars go supernova, and what percentage of those had elements beyond iron and in quantities (many supernoa) to create the startdust that formed the acretion disk that is our solar system that happens to have a comet magnet (Jupiter in just he right place) and all the rest of the goldilocks zones from the 1st one, our nice tropical orbit of sun to, well that fundamental arrangements in serious of events of most things dying on this planet in a specific way and order.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT that said. There was good point that someone else replied with, that it isn't that we happened upon the moon being where it is, or that were are in a orbital goldilocks zone, its that its required for us to be here - meaning we are here, because it worked and statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't that statistically we are just here and would love to see some math around than based on more than 3 gooldie lox variables.
      </p>
      <p>
       And its a neat thought experiment to ask what if it is statistically impossible/improbable for us to be here, I don't pretend to know and voice my forceful thoughts on anyone...  I just think based on all the different things we are finding out sceince wise, especially at the quantum scale - weird stuff goldiloxing there pointing to simulation, it seems creepily like it points to being that, and its fun to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank for hour reply, all that said you might be right.

       Life based on what we can fathom, know or even understand as humans. There may be possibilities and species, we can even comprehend could exist because they don't exist as we know existence, and life.

       That's my hope/thought too. Even microbial life has to exist in some form somewhere.

       I also often wonder if Mars was once earth like and over time turned into a giant dustbowl and some species just evolved to live underground and near ice pockets or something equally as unique. No reason it couldn't be possible... I just hope I live to see some discovery of non-Earth life.

       We need to keep looking into the Moon and Mars, and especially the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many inconistancies and editing in the records of the missions to the moon, and the lunar photography we are allowed access to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there is definatly something dodgy with the Moon, and my personal opinion is that they found something there, either life, or evidence of former life, and have hidden it from the public by claiming the Moon is a dead, desolate body, floating silently in space. Whatever they are hiding, I think is may be based on the far side, I mean, where better to hide something?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have recently found this repository of lunar photography from the Lunar Orbiter missions, prior to Apollo, which you may find interesting :

       Thanks and Gladly! I feel the same way, and even if it doesn't outright change someones mind, I really hope it will open up the possibility that there is something strange going on. I personally fall for the "aliens told us to get off, we actually don't own it" or something like that, but I change my mind everyday when it comes to this stuff cause you really just can't know for sure. But I agree that our gov. is most definitely hiding something juicy up there! Thanks for the repository too, I really like that they have the orbiter and pic info(I originally wanted to add for authenticity but it proved to be more difficult than I hoped). Plus the info is out there if they really want to check, which I do greatly encourage!

       Pretty sad that this type of post has only 3 comments, when the gas attack on Syria, or the arguments with the dick in charge of facebook has hundreds. Nothing is more important to the human race than furthering our understanding of our past and future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I have always believed there was more to Mars than meets the eye. I remember back in the old days (late 90's) of the internet (world wide web for puritans), I began researching pyramids of Mars and the theory that we came from Mars, be it bacterial form or in evolved human form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at some of these pictures I can only make two assumptions;
      </p>
      <p>
       1) These are very elaborate fakes, created by NASA to either cover up what is really going on or covering up for the fact that we still haven't learned space travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) These images are real and tbh, some of them are terrorfying. Like, they make me feel dread jut looking at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some of the images can be discounted as shadows and lucky rock formations (I believe the face of mars is just that) the rest are extremely difficult to explain away. The temples and pyramids are way too coincidental to be mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if somebody were to tell me that the pyramids on Mars were (at some point in time) perfectly lined up to Orion's belt, then I would say 100% that there was/is a civilisation on Mars.

       I appreciate your interest, this is something that I feel is just as important that pertains to all of us as well. Whether its the government lying to us(again), then what is it all about and why? Or is this proof of knowledge that we all deserve to know, what we should be able to know the kind of situation that put us in. For me it was looking at these that got me more interested in this "fringe" stuff a few years back. I personally believe they are real and the only reason they get leaked is because we give nasa too much credit on keeping a secret. They are still human. Hell it could even be on purpose to seed the public, idk. But if I'm wrong then I'll gladly be it, because you're right some of these are disturbing to think about. I just hope we as a race can look at this with reason instead of blindly believing narratives or throwing it all away without even considering the possibility. Because I don't understand how a reasonable person can just instantly dismiss some of these without even pushing for a possible investigation to be certain. Either send curiosity to investigate, or take a closer picture that doesn't look like dog shit. If we need a new orbiter then lets do it, Elon just sent a damn car over there and taxpayers can get something useful like a good picture. I know its just wishful thinking tho, so don't beat me up

       In the defence of NASA/TPTB, maybe revealing alien life would lead to mass riots and widespread panic? Maybe the rumoured depopulation event in the next 5 years is from the revealing of alien life?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's interesting about Mars, is that the next time it is the closest to Earth (happens around every 40 years) that A LOT of nations are sending shit up there. America, Russia, China are all going, which is no surprise, neither is the European space agency. But India are going (why?) and so are the United Arab emirates. Infact, IIRC it will be the first ever UAE space attempt...to go to Mars...the same time as everybody else.

       It's possible that its a lot cheaper to get to the moon when its closer? Also, having the technology to send a rocket to the moon and land something on it, is very valuable and sends a message to the world.

       It is much cheaper to go when it's closer. It's why most space stations are near the equator of the Earth, we are 'closer' to the moon on the equator and we need less energy to overcome gravity (so I'm told)

       Someone a couple months ago had a post about Mars with 3 big pyramid distanced at the same as in Egypt but larger. Made me think NASA is either just putting sand on earth pictures, or we've been to mars a loooooong time ago.

       You read that CIA report on the remote viewing to Mars? Some guy remote views based on unknown coordinates written in an envelope he holds (the coordinates direct to the Cydonia region: pyramids + the face) and after he reports about nothing being there, he's asked to top back a million years and then he's able to describe some tall, robed people taking shelter in a pyramid until some other people return from somewhere. It's fuckin nuts!

       What part of the moon should one focus on to see for themselves?(I guess best way to describe would be what number on a clock face it would align with and how far from center?)

       11:30 pm just move the scope slowly around the top left side and there should be a grayish line with black circles every 200 miles, it's so precise it's creepy. Definitely my favorite section to look at

       I have an orion starblast 6i and I got that for about 350 when it came out.  A 70/700 might be able to see the lines but I doubt you could see them in much detail. If you can afford it I recommend the 6i.

       Okay, thanks a bunch, I got a 70/700 two months ago, I doubt I'll change soon, but I'll try to take a look nevertheless ! 
Did you happen to see some other anomalies too ?

       No but here's a cool thing you can do. If you get up early in the morning on clear days depending on the day you can see the moon, mercury and Venus in much better detail than at nighttime

       Too many things to list which require a lot of explanation on my part. But...the fact that the temperature in moon light is generally a few degrees colder than the temperature in night shade raises huge red flags for me.

       Tons and tons of experiments have shown that the moon emits a "cold light". I first tested it myself a few years ago during a full moon and the temperature difference was 5 degrees. Since then I've tested it a handful more times to show disbelievers (friends &amp; family) and the direct moon light has always been between 2 and 5 degrees colder than the shade.
      </p>
      <p>
       One would reasonably assume that since the moon is reflecting the sun light, direct moon light temperatures would be warmer than night shade temperatures, correct?

       I'm just trying to think of a reasonable explanation as to why light would be colder. All I have is that the greenhouse affect of the planets' atmosphere, combined with heat created from the ground/nearby buildings would make the shade warmer than the light...

       Valid theory that I have also thought of. However, it doesn't explain how the temperature is 5 degrees colder when the thermometer is more than 6 feet off the ground in the middle of a field, and how it is 5 degrees warmer in the same field at the same altitude in the shade of a pine tree.

       Think of a thermos on a countertop. You take a pot of hot water and pour it in the thermos and on everything around it. Then you wait a few hours, and measure temperatures. The thermos is still warm, the countertop is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pot of hot water is the sun. Light poured over everything during the day. The tree is the thermos, holding the energy it absorbed throughout the day. the countertop is the field, having lost its heat. The kitchen lights are the moonlight. If you measure the temperature in the shade of the thermos you are

       Sun provides heat, moon does not.  But it doesn't sap heat neither.  In the shade of day, you are shielded from heat.  But in the shade of night, you are shielded from air cycles where the warm air rises and cool air falls.  Run your experiment on a clear moonless night and you will find the same temperature difference as on a full-moon night.  It's the open air, not the moon light.

       It's funny that the Earth supposedly tilts 66.6 degrees up from the ecliptic plane. That number appears fairly frequently in mainstream science regarding Earth, like the curvature .666 feet per mile squared, and Space, like 66,600 mph around the Sun, and so on. Either some Satanist wrote those numbers into the science books or they are
       <em>
        incredible

       coincidences.

       It's like they hide the numbers and snicker about it, like when they flash their secret hand gestures, and hide their symbols in their logos. They'll tell you it's 23.4 degrees tilted from up and down, but measured up from the plane everything travels on in the Solar System and it just so happens it's exactly their favorite number. The curvature of Earth is a seemingly meaningless 8 inches per mile squared, but it
       <em>
        just so happens
       </em>
       to have their favorite number in it in feet.

       What is special about the number, then? Are you saying that these figures are correct, and it's a massive coincidence? Or are you saying the figures are fake and powerful people (whose favorite secret number is 666 for

       Just look at the moon when the sun is out and you can see the angle isn’t right for the moon to be reflecting sunlight.  And it just doesn’t look like it reflects sunlight.  I agree with with you, and see so many trying to debunk this moonlight is colder with absolute nonsense.

        The moonlight does not cause an object to get colder. It’s the object in the shade that gets warmer. When an object (or surface) is covered or shaded with a hand, roof, tree or cloud, it radiates less of its heat into the night air, and it will become slightly warmer than an object (or surface) that is exposed to the open night sky. Actually, the Moon’s light (which is, of course, reflected sunlight) doesn’t have much to do with it at all. It’s all about Radiative cooling.

       Yeah, literally seconds of time that these people haven't bothered haven't to spend. Also, just because it's the first link to a search doesn't mean it should be disregarded, read the content and then make you own a opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay to believe something, but when you're referring to a phenomena as proof for this believe, at least make sure it's well thought out and be open to opposing opinions.

       I mean it's not really, but on the other hand it also has to be. So it's both depending on your perception of it. All physical objects are also ultraphysical and transcend the physical by their basic nature.

       Very intrested in his reply but for plato (I believe) there’s an object (let’s say a book) and then there’s the idea in our mind of that (book) object that is not physical but is implanted in our mind

       I have shared my reply below, if you are curious :)
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I absolutely adore Plato and his conception on the theory of ideas and forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically all the Cosmos is mind, it is made up of thoughts, or information and all beings transcend it as they are beyond their avatars in this world (body and mind, body being simply mind in gross form and by mind I mean identity, the body being an extension thereof).
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are the most poweful conscious creators of this reality, as we are the most potent manifestation of Source consciousness in the physical domain. Ultimately all beings are individuated sparks, or souls, unique parts of this infinite consciousness that transcends the information based system it has created and is inherently immortal and beyond time, space and all laws, as all laws of physics. ...etc. are fundamentally like programs, conglomerations of thought that are the building blocks of this holographic reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can think of reality basically as a computer. But not one powered by technology,  electricity and the like, but one that is powered by the infinite consciousness we all are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying reality is a "computer simulation" comes close only as a metaphor (due to reality being information based) for the inexplicable infinite potential reality truly is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, at least, is my take on it :)
      </p>
      <p>
       More in my other comment (and I almost forgot to mention the wondeful sub, r/holofractal, with some amazing theories on this).

       This is very interesting but I can’t fathom how conciouscness can create it’s own universe to live in including it’s own host body out of nothing, I’m guessing you’re saying conciousness is a force outside of the physical world but I’m having trouble wrapping my head around it

       Yes, that is what I'm saying. But ultimately even saying it's consciousness is wrong in a way. It's this beingness, this infinite potential.  Really any name I give it can never describe it because it is prior to description (as descriptions are only available to us in the realm of mind, which is all there is that is manifested, but you can't describe that force, will,...which is beyond this world, which we all are, individuated and collective, through words and concepts that come after it, that are within the system that created it, within the manifested  Universe) .

       This theory is both interesting as fuck as well as comforting to think about, it means we could achieve anything we want in life (within the realm of possibilities)
It also answers a question i used to ask myself, which is why is reality this way instead of another? Like seriously observe the world you live in for a second and realize how weird it is; the answer apparently is that everything exists

       I have gone on a crazy inner pilgrimage for the last decade and have had many experiences that can be dubbed as "paranormal" (transcending the body, contacting beings that are not in physical anymore, including my grandmother after she passed, as well as seeing her leave her body in my mind's eye and getting a call moments later from the doctors that she passed, various psychic abilities where I was seamlessly able to predict events in my life, the experience of stepping into another's "energy field" and literally feeling their emotions and knowing their thoughts. ..which would have been impossible were I only confined to the body,...,as well as experiencing many transcendent events where I felt extreme bliss, love, joy, ecstasy and had the experience that I was that freedom behind it all, that I was beyond the body and mind).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been practicing various meditative, introspective and general spiritual practices for over a decade now and this is what I've discovered, both from intuition and from experience, as well as corroborating with the experiences of others and seeing that others have experienced similar things and intuited similar working theories on our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't claim to have all the answers and I definitely may be wrong on some parts, but the general gist of it is I would personally say is the way I wrote it is. To be fair I personally would say that the details I've intuited about reality are correct as well, since I spent a lot of time meditating, reading and meditating on what I've read, but I can never claim full knowledge, because there is always more to learn, deeper layers to understand and aspects of reality and myself that I could still.understand more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is a fascinating path and has shown me that reality truly is stranger than fiction ;)

       Ok, so to share some more of my perspective on this:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is based on various esoteric teachings from eastern and western mystical traditions. All of these are and likely will soon be (already are in some ways) explained by modern mainstream science as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of it is imagining that all objects, including humans reside in an array of dimensions, that are all here now, but they are not visible to you unless you tune into them. Our scientific instruments cannot access rhe subtle dimensions yet (in a way even radiowaves etc. are part of such subtle dimensions, so in a certain sense they can), but humans and all beings, because they are naturally not merely physical, can through meditative, consciousness expanding practices, introspective and contemplative practices....tune into these dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is then the explanation for psychic abilities, the ability to contact entities of both positive and negative orientation ("angels" and "demons"),.... such a theory also brings forth the understanding that since all beings are not merely physical, they are, in their essence immortal and leave their presence in the physical domain (physical body) at the time of death and return with every new birth (also known as reincarnation). Because humans can access these states and dimensions naturally, a variety of mystical, esoteric and spiritual traditions has sprung up based on the experiential understanding of how the Cosmos works. Eventually this will be explained by science as well, as our instruments for measuring reality evolve, even though even now and throughout history there has been research by lone wolf scientists on these fringe topics with plenty of intriguing discoveries, and it continues now more than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an in-depth but still layman enough conglomeration of official scientific viewpoints on these fringe topics, I recommend the book The Field, by Lynne Mctaggart. She is a journalist that brought together the research (through interviews. ..) of many scientists working on these fringe topics. A very interesting book for a more mainstream, scientific explanation of spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also confirm this theory experimentally through my own very vivid spiritual and paranormal, entheogenic experiences after a decade of meditative and contemplative practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I would say you are not the body, nor the mind, which are your avatars in this world. You are the presence, being, awareness, bliss, the love, the will and freedom that is behind all of creation. So are all other beings, all of which are fundamentally both individual and infinitely interconnected, in unity within the field of infinite possiblities that we could call Source or which some call God.

       I have read parts of The Law of One and what I've read resonated with me strongly. But ultimately my realizations were pulled mainly frkm elsewhere,  from multiple sources, both from eastern and western spiritual traditions, as well as my own intuitive insight after more than a decade of meditative and introspective practice.

       Yes, I've read also that the composition of the moon vs Earth is not what you would expect if the moon came from the earth/asteroid.  I do believe we have an idea of what the moon is and we may even have evidence as you suggest.  I do not believe for a second that what has been put forth by NASA is close to anything resembling the truth

       He told me that the moon rocks he studied were minerals that could also be found on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking through a microscope, the difference was that the crystalline moon rocks were extremely sharp and needle-like  since they were never disturbed by wind or water.  On Earth, this mineral would look rounded.

       Correct, my understanding is that they are found on Earth but layered differently.  It was more a thought exercise to show the silliness of the double impact theory, not so much

       I'm not sure we're making the same points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying that the moon rocks are probably authentic because they have structure that could not conceivably be faked and could never be found on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories on the formation of the moon are interesting though.  I'd be pretty pumped if it turned out to be an alien base or something.

       We are saying the same thing, maybe different conclusions.  I can believe that we do have real moon rocks and they are not like that of earth.  Though this leads me to believe the moon has always been independent of earth, as in not a broken off chunk of earth from a double impact.

       Scientists working in universities from the whole world can be "easily be paid off"? That takes more work to believe than the moon is real. Like really, the university in your city probably has a sample or did a study on it.

       You didn't even search for this, you just assumed it didn't because you haven't heard of. And you can also google any place close to you that did conduct a study on it (or a museum) and see for yourself instead of blindly guessing on the internet with your lack of knowledge on the subject. If you truly are in search of answers, I suggest reading the "other side".

       You are doing it the wrong way. When you are arguing with someone who isnt using the same facts as you, one has to take their argument to the logical conclusion. How can you be sure anything is real? This leaves them at solipsism and then you can ignore them because why argue with a figment of your imagination. If they agree that other things exist independently of them you go from there.

       Or a creator. The moon is too perfect for us. The more I got into space (talking your average kids journey from No Place Like Space to Pale Blue Dot to date nights at the Adler) the more I started leaning towards a creator. Like my whole youth teachers spent their time telling me we are meaningless and knowing what I know about school now and knowing what I know about the moon now, something isn’t sitting right. The moon was placed there.

       God. I could be going down the entirely wrong path currently but it seems to me that our world is probably much much simpler than we are told. The sky is a clock, sun for days, Moon for months, stars for years. We are fixed in position and reside in an electric universe. Things like ocean tides, hold a static filled balloon up to a faucet and you can pull water towards the balloon. I think we live in a simple magnetic/electric universe and what we experience daily is the truth.

       Interesting perspective! As a former atheist, it feels weird saying this but I do believe you're right but on a larger scale. Although I don't believe in the orthodox version of "God", I do believe in a creator whether its possibly conscious or more likely something beyond out understanding that somehow brought this into the making. I would personally believe that highly advanced ET's could have towed our moon into the precise position its in now, but I wont argue that cause I have no freakin clue! I've just always had a hard time believing that "God" would alter the world for just one form on life on one planet, when the possibilities of life are so vast in the universe. Especially with the looks of some of these photos, I think there is a very real possibility of other life besides us. But like I said idk haha!

       .......that's. What? Your balloon theory is easily explained by basic principles of electricity and magnetism. On top of that, we're in a fixed position??? We know that the earth rotates around the sun. Or entire solar system orbits the center of the Galaxy. Our Galaxy is part of a galaxy cluster that exert gravitational effects on each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are most certainly not in a fixed position. Everything you said is easily explained or disproven without being explained by some bearded omnipotent being that was bored one day and decided to create things.

       Word.  Puzzling to find those who rely on mainstream science so willingly to subscribe to the theory that there is a creation without a creator.  In no way can man's mind solve that puzzle but yet on reddit and in our school systems "lol nope, no god, just a big bang, dont ask questions.  something can come from nothing, we just dont have any other examples of this"

       We are human. We are not perfect. We are still trying to u derstand things in the universe. But provable science has a lot more merit thus far than some "invisible hand" that led to our creation.

       I see it this way: there is a purpose to science. Science is useful. Particularly for making predictions. We need reliable predictions in order to survive in our harsh environment that we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, somebody said that for all we know, the universe might end in 10 seconds. Which is true, it might. But we’re better off pretending that it won’t, otherwise we wouldn’t ever get anything done. So we have science to offer useful predictions, like the universe will still be here 10 seconds from now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people extrapolate from there and conclude that the concept of god is useless, because it offers no useful prediction. I agree that it doesn’t, but at the same time, there are some questions that science doesn’t answer either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the origin of the universe. Somebody says it must have been created by god, another guy says no, it was the Big Bang, yet another guy says there was no creation, we’ve always been there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, all three are inadequate answers. God doesn’t help with predictions, since if there’s a whimsical god, then there can’t be reliable predictions, because there will always be the element of god’s whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       But science doesn’t help with answering why something exists, it only describes how things exist, and that only in the context of prior explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in my opinion, you need both the how and the why to have a complete answer.

       Can we as mere humans ever have the 'complete answer'?

       I meant more in terms of things we can even get answers to. Of course we will never have the complete answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for taking science on faith, that is actually one of the strengths of science. It makes it so that a general consensus can be attained around something like flight, so average people don’t have to know anything about it to be reasonably sure the plane won’t crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, while that is a very useful world view to have, It doesn’t explain absolutely everything. I feel like a lot of arguments are shut down prematurely because somebody goes “Because, science!”. That’s what I mean when I say science explains the how, and that the how is only part of it.

       The universe didn't create you. Everything that you are was already here. All of the atoms that make up you existed before they combined to make up what you know as "you". 
There is a possibility that everything that exists has always existed thus no need for a creator. The atoms just combine to "create" different iterations of itself ie.The earth, you and anything else.

       It's a quote from a movie we had to watch at our chapel, for our junior hockey team lol. Our coach wanted us to have proper morals, they just won the league two years in a row, so his got a good system. I'd say non of us were believers, but now I'm open to it.

       I'm probably just being a cynical asshole. I shouldn't act like I know your experience or how you interpreted it. If you feel like your world view has grown because of this movie and your coach then that's great.

       Nope, Earth is process of billions of years and collisions. You probably studied it at school if you didn't sleep/skip those classes. What doesn't make sense is to assume there's a guy or intelligent design overlooking us with literally no evidence for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The universe has a creator: big bang. The big bang might have a creator, but that doesn't mean it's Zeus or Flying Spaghetti Monster does it? It's very likely a part of a whole bigger process of explosions and things we don't understand, but just like heliocentrism: what we don't understand today doesn't make 'god' a valid explanation.

       We went to the same schools brother.  30 years of my life indoctrination, I too was a hardcore atheist.  I mean if everything we learn is true then god is just a silly thought.  But lately I am finding out what school is really about and why I learned the things I learned.  Shoot, I even learned out this guy Newton, he believed in god just as your false idol Einstein.  Makes you go hmmm doesn't it?  Anyway, here is a good quote for you as you and I seem very much alike just at different points in the journeyhttps://

       Yes, a person from 500 years ago believed in god. What a surprise - seeing that anyone who didn't was burnt. Also, again, you're evoking the god of the gaps (if I don't understand something it must be god). Also Einstein did not believe in god, but Spinoza's god.

      <p>
       Yes, it did. Just like it happens everywhere in the universe. And it is not perfect otherwise we wouldn't have deserts, or ice caps, or be burnt by the sun. Again, assuming what you don't understand as god.
      </p>

       You should really start reading what you don't know, just like when you thought the moon wasn't real.

       What if "God" is another instance of "Magic is technology that hasn't been invented yet". Seems pretty arrogant to write off something that you can have no possible understanding of, literally. For instance, the Big Bang could just be the equivalent of the creator snapping his fingers yet(figuratively speaking of course), you simply cannot know. I just choose to believe there is a creator but I could just as easily be wrong, something that you do not seem open to.

       That is true. But there is nothing that suggests that. There are a lot of good hypothesis out there trying to explain this, and some might be pretty close.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the thing is: there is nothing that suggests that there is a god. God is as likely as last-thursdayism. It can't be totally shrugged off, but just like there is a possibility the universe will end in 10 seconds or you'll suffer Spontaneous Human Combustion it is not
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       to actually have a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibility exists, of course, but we've never found a supporting evidence to the idea of god but the real (and low) possibility of its existence - which can be assumed to Zeus, Yahweh, Aliens or literally any idea you can come up with. It's a good thought tho

       If what you were saying were true, it would have 0 impact on any of our lives. If there is a creator that started the big bang, he is clearly not influencing anything happening within this universe. Every rule was already set shortly after/at the time of the big bang and now it's just 'playing out'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why it would be relevant to us whether or not such a creator existed.

       The concept that there is no creator watching over our shoulders is very scary to some people.  So much so that they ignore logic and place their energy in "faith".  Faith helps get rid of that fear (that there is no creator, heaven, etc.).
      </p>

       No point in using logic to debate with someone's faith.

       I think the bigger question here is consciousness. I belive the real physical universe (reality) is explainable and will continually be explained even if the amount of information is infinite, it can all still be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really boggles my mind, like I said, is consciousness. If there is any evidence to be found of the concept of God/Gods being real (whatever that actually means. . . Think about it) it will be found through the study of our own conscious minds.

       Yea, I have heard of it but haven't really looked into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean t more the implications of being conscious. For example, I know I am conscious, but I can never truly know if anyone else is conscious, or at least conscious in the same way as me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good  basic example are colors. I know what the color red looks like, and you know too. But really we have just agreed upon the language/symbol for red. I mean who's to say the red I see is the same as the red you see?

       It's a human construct, an illusion.  Time as we know it was for the railroads, otherwise it was just island time.  Everything in 4D works in 3D.  There is no bending of the space time or any of that hocus pocus.  Also the speed of light is not constant as the aether moves through us.

       So you're saying the idea of "Spacetime" isn't real. A 3D object isn't able to move or change unless it moves through an extra dimension of time so on some level must exist.

       I guess in my modest journey to read more from outside of the mainstream science we are bombarded with, is that I believe gravity to be a false representation of our true nature.  It's merely a description of something (a constant) and an explanation of nothing (what causes this constant).  Far more likely, since we cannot replicate gravity, is that these tangible things we experience daily (vibrations, electricity, magnetism) are the very things that create order in our world.  We have been dumbed down into thinking we cannot possibly understand and yet we encounter our world and our existence daily.

       Gravity is caused by mass.  Mass warps spacetime around it, which has the effect of "pulling" the masses inhabiting that warped spacetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can we not "replicate" gravity?  Every object with mass exerts it's own gravitational "field".

       We can't make anything large enough to notably replicate gravity (like "hey I can sideways on this") but everything has a gravitational pull.
      </p>
      <p>
       That combined with the word salad of "this stuff creates order" without any evidence to back it up makes your theory kind of pointless.

       A timeless eternal being cannot have a cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keith Ward points out in his book " God, chance and necessity ", if one asks what caused God, the answer is that nothing could create a being a reality which wholly transcends space-time and which is self existant. To fail to grasp such an idea, is the fail to grasp what God "
      </p>
      <p>
       The arguement that " if the universe needs a creator,therfore God needs a creator " is a fallacious argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that begins to exist has a cause. Everything that comes into being out of nothing. But if something is eternal and timeless, it doesn't fall under that premise, it doesn't need a cause. Even Dennet recognises this, stating that if eternal verities exist like numbers or mathetmatical objects, they don't need a cause as they don't come into being.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is simply that God is uncaused.

       Begging the question and special pleading to avoid infinite regress
The kalam argument seems to have been worded specifically to address the refutation of the cosmological argument, as it made the qualification that only things that begin have causes. The kalam arguer will simply state that God didn't begin, and so no regress occurs and no Creator of God is necessary.
In Dan Barker's article Cosmological Kalamity, he writes
The curious clause “everything that begins to exist” implies that reality can be divided into two sets: items that begin to exist (BE), and those that do not (NBE). In order for this cosmological argument to work, NBE (if such a set is meaningful) cannot be empty[2], but more important, it must accommodate more than one item to avoid being simply a synonym for God. If God is the only object allowed in NBE, then BE is merely a mask for the Creator, and the premise “everything that begins to exist has a cause” is equivalent to “everything except God has a cause.” As with the earlier failures, this puts God into the definition of the premise of the argument that is supposed to prove God’s existence, and we are back to begging the question.
In other words, the set of items that do not begin to exist must be pluralized - otherwise it is just another word for God.
The wording of Kalam is arguably a form of special pleading on the part of the theist. As Richard Dawkins put it, the cosmological argument makes "the entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress." Whether we qualify the first premise to exclude non-beginning things (as the kalam argument does) or not (as the cosmological does), the essential question is why it is more logically defensible to claim that for the rule that everything must have a cause, an exception is made for God but not for the natural universe as a whole? Why does god not begin? It appears to be a wholly arbitrary choice.
Not all events necessarily have causes
Main Article: Not all events necessarily have causes
The argument asserts that "everything that begins to exist has a cause". However, this is arguably a false statement and a hasty generalization. It is possible that some events, particularly on the quantum scale (such as in the early universe), do not have causes (or at least we do not fully understand the cause at this time). Thunderf00t's video on Kalam questions the validity of using everyday concepts like "everything that begins to exist has a cause" in extreme situations such as the beginning of the universe. [2] Hume argues the only way to know if principles (such as causality) hold in very different conditions is to have direct experience of it.

       Fallacy of Composition
Main Article: Fallacy of composition
In the first premise, Craig declares "everything that begins requires a cause," and goes on to place the universe at the same logical level as its contents.
In an article titled Cosmological Kalamity, Dan Barker writes:
The first premise refers to every "thing," and the second premise treats the "universe as if it were a member of the set of "things." But since a set should not be considered a member of itself, the cosmological argument is comparing apples and oranges.
Describing the way physical objects within the universe behave relies on induction and physical laws, neither of which apply in the absence of a spacetime universe. Everything we are familiar with is an object within a set (the universe). It is a fallacy of composition to assert that the properties of things we are familiar with (objects within the set) are also properties of the set as a whole (the universe). Example: "Each part of an airplane has the property of being unable to fly. Therefore the airplane has the property of being unable to fly." The conclusion doesn't follow because the only way to determine whether the airplane has the property of being able to fly or not would be to get outside the plane (set) and then make observations. Unfortunately we are stuck inside the universe, so any conclusions we can draw about individual components of the universe (within the set) do not necessarily apply to the set as a whole.
See Russell's paradox for issues that arise from allowing a set to be a member of itself.

       I’m cutting because I’m on mobile and you apparently couldn’t be bothered to click the link. My argument is that you’re premises have merely been asserted, not demonstrated. Until you can demonstrate that a) everything that begins to exist has a cause and b) the universe began to exist then you don’t really have an argument.

       Equivocation of "beginning to exist"
Kalam also equivocates on the first premise when it refers to everything that "begins to exist". Presumably this premise is referring to everything around us on this planet--everything in your house, everything on the streets, everything we see in the cosmos. However all of these things did not "begin to exist" in the same sense theists are claiming the universe "began to exist" (creation ex nihilo). According to the laws of thermodynamics, matter can neither be created nor destroyed, and everything we are familiar with is a actually reconfiguration of preexisting matter than has been around for billions of years. The atoms that comprise people, places, and planets do not "come into existence" in the same sense Kalam is claiming the universe came into existence (matter appearing from a previous state of non-being/non-existence). Rather they have always existed in some form, and the objects we see around us are merely the latest rearrangements of those atoms. So in speaking of the universe requiring a "cause" for it's existence, Kalam is not referring to it as you would an automobile, which is being "caused" by a group of laborers rearranging physical matter into the form of a car, or mountains being "caused" by the shifting of tectonic plates (also made of atoms which have been around since the big bang), but of something being caused by creation ex nihilo, which is not at all the type of creation we are familiar with in every other circumstance. Kalam therefore is using a word game to equivocate between the behavior of matter and the origin of matter. This is an equivocation between wildly different things.
In summary: Kalam proponents believe God made the universe exist ex nihilo. But everything around us only "begins to exist" in a trivial sense, as rearrangements of preexisting, uncreated stuff. Since the universe is literally the only example of something truly "beginning to exist" from a previous state of nothingness, this means there is a sample set of one in this category, leaving no inductive support for the premise that "whatever begins to exist (ex nihilo) has a cause".
Once the argument is reformulated to take into account the hidden premises, it looks like this:
Every rearrangement of pre-existing matter has a cause. (supported by every observation, ever.)
The universe began to exist from absolute nonexistence, NOT from a rearrangement of pre-existing matter.
Therefore the universe has a cause.
In other words:
Every X has a cause.
The universe Y.
Therefore the universe has a cause.
As you can see, once the equivocation is made plain, the argument is invalid.
Further equivocation
There is a further type of equivocation on the phrase "begins to exist". Premise 1 refers to things that begin to exist within time. In other words, there was a time when a thing did not exist, followed by a time when it existed. This is not the case with the universe, since time is part of the universe. The universe is a finite age (13.8 billion years), and because time did not come into existence until after the inflation began, there is literally NO TIME at which the universe did not exist. It has existed at every point in time. Rephrasing the argument to accurately include this information, we get something like this:
Let X = "a thing which began to exist a finite time ago after a point when it did not exist"
Let Y = "a thing which has existed for a finite time, but which exists at every point in time"
Everything that is X has a cause for it's existence.
The Universe is Y.
Therefore the universe has a cause for it's existence.
Once again, equivocation is at play. Premise 1 and 2 are comparing apples and oranges. The universe has existed at every moment in time and did not begin to exist in the same way that every object in P1 began to exist, so the argument is invalid.

Overall, this argument is an example of a proof by logic, where philosophers attempt to "demonstrate" god with a logical syllogism alone, devoid of any confirming evidence. This is arguably inappropriate for establishing matters of fact.
Is God distinct from the universe?
Let S1 = a state of affairs in which the Universe did not exist, and S2 = a state of affairs in which the Universe did exist.
The theist is trying to claim that the Universe began to exist, that is, there was a state in which there was God, "and then" there was a state in which there was the Universe. In other words, they want to say S1 "and then" S2. In order to do that, they must show that S1 and S2 are distinct. The possibilities are:
The Universe never began to exist
The Universe never existed
S1 and S2 follow each other in time
Some agent in S1 is the atemporal cause of S2
If we can eliminate all four examples, then there is no way to distinguish between the two states. If that is the case, then there is no "beginning" - no state at which the Universe began to exist, thus undermining the conclusion.
If we try to prove by contradiction that the Universe never began to exist, the contradiction becomes evident. By assuming the Universe began to exist, it rules out (1). The Universe exists, so that rules out (2). (3) is disproven by the fact that time is a property of the Universe, and therefore can't be applied outside of the Universe. (4) can't be true because Craig defines "atemporal causation" as follows:
To borrow an illustration from Kant, a heavy ball’s resting on a cushion is the cause of a depression in the cushion, even if the ball has been resting on the cushion from eternity past.
However, this cannot be used to distinguish between S1 and S2 because it requires cause and effect to be simultaneous. S1 and S2 cannot be simultaneous, as the Universe would exist at the same instant that it doesn't exist - a contradiction. By assuming that the Universe began to exist, we have ruled out all explanations for how it could have begun to exist. Thus, we cannot distinguish at the moment between S1 and S2 - undermining their conclusion.
Unparsimonious explanation
Main Article: Ultimate 747 gambit
The God hypothesis is not only unnecessary, it is not parsimonious. In order to explain something apparently designed and which cannot create itself, a being is conjured into existence which would require even more unlikely explanation.
Why only one cause?
In the construction of a house, there may be twenty people involved. There may be a large amount and wide variety of materials. There must be an appropriate location, and a diverse set of conditions that allowed the entire process to take place. Yet, the first premise would have us believe that all of this comprises just one "cause." This fails even on the most basic intuitive level, and even when it involves an object with which we are intimately familiar. Discussing something as foreign to our intuitions as the beginning of time would seem to compound the problem further.
However, even if we grant that each "thing" in the universe has exactly one cause, and that postulating an uncaused cause is sufficient to explain the origin of all things, it still would not follow that there could be only one uncaused cause. There could be several such influences working in concert, as polytheists would have us believe. There could be millions of uncaused causes that began separately but whose creations have since intermingled to form the universe we have now. In short, it isn't clear why anyone should suggest "a cause" rather than an unknown number of them - unless, of course, one's goal is to support an ideology that claims a singular creator for other reasons.

       Well take Vr for example. Right now it's a bulky yet effective way of being in another world completely generated by computers. It's not much of a leap to envisage a future where it's implanted or on your eyes/ears. Even now most tv you watch is computer generated. In the future you really won't be able to tell the difference.

        Russell's teapot is an analogy, formulated by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making unfalsifiable claims, rather than shifting the burden of disproof to others. Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion. He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a teapot orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the existence of God, and has had influence in various fields and media.

       But that's not the case, that's a false logic. This can be used to justify anything: either there are unicorns, flying spaghetti monsters, goblins, imps, magic, angels, total destruction of the universe in 10 seconds or there isn't. It doesn't mean anything if you don't find something that
       <em>
        suggests
       </em>
       it's real. Anything stated as scientific evidence
       <em>

       evidence for itself (big bang, your existence, earth, gravity, so on), god doesn't because it only exists in

I'm not talking about flying spaghetti monsters(hell it could be too, people really like using this one for some reason), I'm talking about something that could've created this(even if its not the highest power) instead of your idea of it just popping up. This to me seems like a more complicated situation. You simply can't know, so why would you act like you know and shut everyone else out. The Big Bang theory simply traces back to the earliest moments of the universe, you have no way of knowing how or why. It is simply your choice then to believe that nothing created it, just as its my choice to believe something did(no not a guy with a beard or flying spaghetti monster).

       It can be used to make

       Yes, and you can't also prove that the universe won't self-destruct in 10 seconds. But the supporting evidence for both are lacking.

       Because it was specifically "created" to counter-argument religious arguments. It actually has a cool story.

      <p>
       I definitely do not support the idea of it just popping up. There are alot of hypothesis that are mathematically correct but haven't been proven yet because it's so hard to test it. I have no problem stating that I don't know it yet, and we'll probably die without an explanation like people died thinking geocentrism was true, but it doesn't mean the god of the gaps is a good idea.

       I believe that the moon rotates around the earth at such a predictable pattern for the same as our planet rotates around the sun in the "Goldilocks" distance; out of sheer chance. As do many other planets we have discovered but cannot reach. And the moon interacts with our planet as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The universe is ever-expanding; constantly creating new things. To think that we are alone in this universe is asanine and selfish. If it is constantly expanding; there can be a basically infintessimle chance of life existing elsewhere. There is a chance that we got lucky. There is a chance that there are beings who got more lucky before us. Or after.
      </p>
      <p>
       We still have natural disasters and the earth trying to shrug us off like a disease that we are accelerating ourselves. Our planet doesn't particularly like us.

       Your guess is as good as mine, especially seeing as it will never be possible to know the full truth. Even if you go to a heaven after you die, you could be there a million years and then learn that it's a simulation running on another dimension. But I've seen things that make me think that only have been created by a sentient creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       A deep sea fish starts evolving. Evolution is blind luck, literally trying everything. So every possible variation of the fish is tried, but only the one that randomly
       <em>
        grows a lightbulb in its forehead
       </em>
       survives? A gut worm's life cycle is thus: a worm crawls out of your anus and lays eggs, hoping you scratch it, get the eggs in your fingernails and eventually touch food, and
       <em>
        eat the egg.
       </em>
       So it just figured that out somehow? A bug comes out of nowhere in the forest, evolution tries a bunch of things, and only when it randomly started
       <em>
        looking exactly like a leaf
       </em>
       did it start surviving? A fruit tree only reproduces when an animal eats the fruit, shits the seeds out in natural fertilizer. How did it know that? Some trees seeds only crack open when a forest fire burns the hard husk. How did that come to be randomly? And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about cartoons coming into existence out of nowhere, you just described the theory of evolution. Either way, everything came from somewhere, and it makes more sense, when something consciously, deliberately, and ingeniusly created all of this.

       This is false. Natural selection does it, and it's not blind it's just that if you're not adapted to your habitat you'll die and eventually be extint. It doesn't try, it weeds out. The rest of your comment is written as if this is true and evolution has a "mind" and "tries" things out, which is not true.

       No it doesn't, first because your argument about evolution was wrong and it's simply natural selection. Secondly because there is nothing thay suggests a god or intelligent being did it.

       Maybe it's all a bad design. Maybe the creators are colassal assholes with a sick sense of humor. Still, I'd say most of reality

       What if an alien race wanted to watch intelligent life develop? Say they're a type 2 civ,  capable of harvesting the total solar energy of its parent star.

       Evolution and time could've made an alien race so far advanced they'd still seem godlike to us.  Our whole planet

       Those are very fair points that can be backed up with some evidence, but overall (even tho they might be real) it's still
       <em>
        unlikely
       </em>
       due to the amount of baseless assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, about the moon being a giant alien space station, some say it has hollow parts:
       <em>
        "Between 1972 and 1977, seismometers installed on the Moon by the Apollo missions recorded moonquakes. The Moon was described as "ringing like a bell" during some of those quakes, specifically the shallow ones. This phrase was brought to popular attention in March 1970, in an article in Popular Science. When Apollo 12 deliberately crashed the Ascent Stage of its Lunar Module onto the Moon’s surface, it was claimed that the Moon rang like a bell for an hour, leading to arguments that it must be hollow like a bell. Lunar seismology experiments since then have shown that the lunar body has shallow moonquakes that act differently from quakes on Earth, due to differences in texture, type and density of the planetary strata, but there is no evidence of any large empty space inside the body."

      <p>
       let's draft up something super dumb and theoretical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day my mom was telling me the other day that if I went back to live in Jamaica (I am Jamaican), people would be able to tell that I was from a foreign country (I live in Canada) just by looking at my teeth, which has been surgically repaired and perfected courtesy advanced orthodontic practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... What if you sent a girl like Kylie Jenner back about... 300 years. Would she be seen as an alien, a witch or a god?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything from her perfectly straight teeth, manufactured bronzed skin (that has been smoothed down thanks to years of careful applied skin product), as well as her surgically enhanced body would be... Well... impossible for someone to achieve all those years back.
      </p>

       I don't know. As an artist and designer myself, I believe there is a greater designer...

       Sir Isaac Newton couldn't look at gravity through a microscope or grasp it in it's hands- it's just something you have to accept is there. Imagine seeing an apple fall from a tree.

       That is simply not true. If by my own (little) knowledge I already know something isn't true, there's no real point on continuing it. For example: I know that the earth is not flat to a point it's ridiculous and easy to prove it, why would I continue to search as if it were? It's literal waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And feel free to rebut me, I encourage it. I'm very likely more wrong than right, but you have to point it out to continue the discussion instead of saying that "I'm not open to changing my mind" without a point.

       Look how far our signals have reached outside our own system and how it weakens the further it goes, it almost becomes background noise. The Fermi paradox doesn’t hold all the answers.

       I agree, I was just providing a contrast to what I learned.  In JUCO I took astronomy as my two electives.  Awesome class, fun teacher, I mean why not take Astronomy while in JUCO?  Anyway, I learned about the Drake Equation but not the Fermi Paradox.  Just the ying and the yang to show how little we are told about our world.

       Was a toilet read for me.  Some of the chapters were a grind, some super interesting.  The more time that passes since I have read it the more I wonder what is the exact purpose of the book.  I mean they give Uncle Sam a lot of the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the moon landing and their citations but still put together a pretty compelling thought exercise.  I just hope that it's not fully a 'limited hangout' type book

       I'm sorry but this is possibly the dumbest thing I've ever read. The moon is too perfect? How is it too perfect? You went from explainable science straight to a creator?

       Seems very unlikely.  Check the math.  Also, it's a computer model that even the designer thinks is flawed beyond any practical use.  Makes you wonder why this is still pushed on  us when everyone else has been like "fuck that" and walked away from that theory

       This is false. The planetary impact hypothesis is the only one which can explain the size, composition, and orbital dynamics of the moon-Earth system. There are certainly refinements to be made, but the idea that it should be dismissed because it: "Seems very unlikely. Check the math" is laughable.

       This general hypothesis of giant impact/moon formation isn't just something pushed by "one lady". It's the model currently favored by the scientific community based on the data we have. Any subsequent refinements will entail ironing out details concerning HOW exactly it happened.

       Absolutely, it's tied to this paper from two Khazakstanian mathematicians which was published in 2013

       ! Appropriately titled, wow! Signal in reference. In it they find that if you take the genetic code of the Euplotid (a cute unicellular protozoa), the 64 possible codons, and arrange them according to two rules you end up with a seemingly mathematically interesting arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I found is that it's also a clever message, namely its a genetic signal pointing to a tRNA that mediates a +1 Programmed Ribosomal Frameshift during the translation of over 3,000 proteins in the actual organism Euplotid. Without this tRNA (that "coincidentally" looks exactly like a cross or ankh) the organism would be absolutely unable to live, and propagate the signal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go over it here in more detail with explanation if curious:

       13000 years ago there were parts of the world that were at least at the level of technology that we were at 100 years ago or so.  When they failed to stop the asteroid that hit earth they fled the effected area and settled in areas like Egypt and south America - most likely in some kind of plane...and they were seen as gods from above.... especially since they brought technology and know-how that the people of those regions had never fathomed.

       You’re gonna dig Magicians. Loved both books. Find his early lectures as well. Egypt, Gnostics, Psychedelics, Ancient History and monuments. That man belongs on this sub. The treatment of archaeological finds and the information held within is OUR past!! We should all want to know. I’m not a bible quoter but i came across a line that really stuck with me. Jesus was asked “how will it all end?” To which he replied “then you must know already how it all began”

       There’s something enormous getting covered up and it feels like he and his colleagues are on the brink of overthrowing the old paradigm.

       Dude I'm way ahead of you lmao, I've seen pretty much everyone of his lectures on youtube(just finished the Gnostics one) and all of his JRE appearances! He really is man, its incredible that it hasn't overthrown it already considering the amount of hard evidence there is, piri reis map etc. Good quote btw, not much of I bible guy myself but there is a lot of interesting stuff in that book, specifically Eziekiels book. Ive looked in to Tellengers work a bit but ill have to go full force if your recommending it. I'd love to pick your brain sometime man, we seem on the same page haha! I'm gonna start Magicians tonight!

       Absolutely man I would love to chat with some like-minded folks. And yes I did see what they wanted to call a debate LOL. It’s kind of sad because it seems that Zahi is really living with his head in the sand. You’re the director of antiquities in Egypt and you have no idea what Gobekli Tepe is just north of you??? It seems almost like being in Egyptologist is the equivalent of having doctorate in Marvel and DC history.

       Same here man, with even the potential historical paradigm shift right around the corner possibly were in for an interesting ride. I just wonder how long it'll take for his findings to go mainstream, there is some solid evidence there that isn't like these photos left up to speculation. I have a question for you though, whats your take on who were the various Civilizers such as Viracocha and Quetzalcoatl, etc. I know Graham typically shys away for ETs but could that be a real possibility considering all the "magic" and "fire in the skies" stuff they could do. Seems more complex than just leftover people from before the Deluge helping out then leaving.

       The better technology gets, the more invisible it becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I lean more towards lost civilization over alien intervention is that is seems far more likely given our current understanding of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I can imagine a future (or past) where nano bots are capable of interpreting the instructions from just my firing synapses that can reproduce themselves out of the materials around them to construct whatever I can imagine. Then the excess fall apart or just become part of whatever they are constructing when done.  I can’t imagine folding space time to travel 100s of lightyears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because there isn’t an advanced technology visible in our archeological record that would look similar to our current or greater level doesn’t mean there wasn’t one. The early is old. Humans believed to be a few hundred thousand? How man few-hundred-thousands in a billion? We could’ve raised 1000s of civilizations in that time wiped back to nothing but dust again and again. No aliens, just older US’s

       True, Magic is a technology that hasn't been invented yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an interesting dilemma. So do you not believe that ET life is here visiting us? Just curious, I'm not going to try and convenience you that there is by any means but from what I've seen and gathered, I have personally been convinced. I've had my own experience, and there are UFO sightings coming out every day along with the testimonies of highly reputable people so that was enough for me. But I'll stand corrected if wrong. I bring this up because if ET life is here today then I'm sure they were here yesterday, so they could be a possibility considering their capabilities. Btw I am by no means discrediting the abilities of humans, because it could just as easily be what you describe. Idk I guess in the end we are still left just our speculations, the spanish really messed up destroying all of that knowledge... It really sucks too that we weren't left with more definitive evidence of these cultures like ruins or something.

       I’d easier believe that remnants of an ancient civilization, or a parallel civilization live among us than beings from another planet outside our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could Mars have once supported life? Probably. Could their be a planet opposite ours behind the Sun we never see and its existence intentionally hidden from us? It’s possible I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be that my concept of time doesn’t let me realistically conceive of generations long voyages Aliens make to visit us because our lifespans are so short.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just thing the answers to all UFO or paranormal stories are easier explained by things beings from this planet did or can do. In my mind, given the distances involved, there is a better chance of a highly advanced being or civilization living under our oceans than traveling back and forth across 100s of light years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree about the wipe out of the codex. No atrocity in human history was worse than that. But at least we are in some exciting times with new finds that keep both expanding the size and scope of the pre Columbian world and pushing back the time it existed.

       Gobekli Tepe is impressive, but I also don't believe there was ever a civilization that before us that had that kind of technology. Perhaps engines powered by steam? Early forms of electricity and all kinds of advanced mathematics though.

       Why are you assuming the entire planet was that advanced?  It only needed to be one area.  We dont know their culture.  Maybe they didnt care about conquering the world and stayed in their own area?  The impact only needed to be large enough to wipe out that community.

       I'm not saying is equivalent. But I'll least say whoever built Gobekli Tepe were master stone masons. The size of some of the blocks and the precision with which they've been carved and put together is simply too good to attribute the building of it to primitive man.
       <br/>
       You point to skyscrapers like they're the pinnacle of architecture. Let me ask you: which is more likely to be around in another 13,000 years? Empire state building or the pyramids of Giza?

       If we wanted to build a giant stone pyramids like Giza, we probably could do it and much more efficiently than they did. We just don't have any desire to stack a bunch of rocks in the desert nowadays, it's a big waste of time, resources, and effort.

       And I didn't say skyscrapers are the pinnacle of architecture, I was just saying that a lot more advanced technology goes into making them than stone pillars and walls.

       Yeah, we could. But it would take the technology we use today to replicate it. And that's exactly the point. The megalithic structures of thousands of years ago were unable to be replicated to the degree of accuracy that they've been built to until we had technology.
       <br/>
       It also seems like you're really playing down the architectural marvels that are the ancient megalithic sites:
       <br/>
       "...some some pillars and stone walls..."
       <br/>
       "...stack a bunch of rocks in the desert..."
       <br/>
       These are giant stone bricks we're talking about weighing tens of tons, mortarlessly put together so accurately that it's impossible to stick a razor blade between them. It's not just a "bunch of rocks".

       Look at some of the crazy things that Japanese people do with wood on YouTube. If you've got generations of craftsmen working with a certain material because it's a valued thing in their society, you eventually end up with master craftsmen who are capable of doing crazy stuff like that with their hands. We might not have any stone masons today capable of carving things like these ancient societies, but that's not because it's impossible. It's because carving giant pieces of stone to exact specifications with chisels isn't a valuable skill anymore, so no one bothers to do it. That doesn't mean we're technologically inferior to societies that had such expert stone masons though. And if we wanted to reacquire those skills, with enough time and money it could be done.

       You're actually helping make my point here. Except that I'm not saying we're technologically inferior today to how they were then. I'm simply saying they were technologically advanced. It might not have been advancement down the same avenues as us, but they were certainly technologically advanced in megalithic stone architecture. But whatever those technologies were, we can at least all agree, that they have been lost to time. But the creations haven't. And the creations weren't made by hammer and chisel.

       why?  if an asteroid hit earth now and destroyed most of the northern hemisphere (usa, greenland, Iceland, canada, Europe, russia, china, japan, india... what evidence of us existing would still be around 13000 years later?  Especially of the impact was so strong it triggered an ice age?

       There's plenty of evidence.  Just look at monolithic structures, their positions, the precision, the significance of it all.  Hell, look at the proven 12,000+ year old Gobekli Tepe in Turkey.  Keep in mind that mainstream archaeology tells us that we were cavemen 12,000 years ago.  Our history, as told today, seems to be wildly inaccurate.

       7 astronauts have come forward and claimed they have been part of the Mars jump room or ARC program since the mod eighties.  I think we have sufficient evidence to suggest larger questions then just surface anomalies.

       "We" have larger questions, but everyone else doesn't seem to grasp this yet. Babysteps! I'm personally much deeper into these topics than just this post. I'm just hoping someone who never gave this the time of day will consider there might be something more going on here

       I’m on book 3 the waste lands. I have around 30 pages or so. I’ve been reading it when I could which is only 2 days a week. The series is good but it would be better if I read for fiction books. I’m more of a non fiction type of guy.

       Pre-existing space Fleet operations that we're currently aware of, this program was developed completely in secret and separate from NASA's activities.  Discovery of pre-existing technology lead to the design and creation of a transportation system.  Capitalizing on existing functions of the fabric of space to jump from one point to another.  In this case to the surface of Mars where it was found not only previously existing civilization but previous communication and travel to earth had occurred in the past.  From sometime in the mid 80s until current day they have maintained a research base and facility but it is clear that conditions and local wildlife are incredibly difficult.

       130 minutes is halfway? Sorry i jest,
I would end up summarizing it at best and i don't feel it would be as beneficial as listening to any part of it.

       My original comment was just expressing my opinion that we should set the bar high in demanding some real answers.  I recommend the video because it touches both on moon photography,  and on mars explorations that corroborate the odd photos in OP's submissions.

       That the reports from these astronauts are not limited to surfaces structures temples and oddities on the surface but include species wildlife and not only other species of human but other humanoids.  There was always the suspicion that the Marines had established bases on the surface of mars 5 years ago or more.
As silly and or fascinating as it might be it turns out that there must have been a Department of Defense scriptwriter present to offer soft de classification when the original Doom game was produced it would have been within a few years of the program's Inception

       Flat-earthers (not saying step2thejep is) will never believe anything unless you buy a weather balloon, strap a gopro to it with a gps, and let it go in front of them. Even then theyll say it was probably tampered with.

       Telescopes show us magnified light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory of 'outer space' is that the light is being emitted by gigantic, solid, physical objects, millions of miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it was known that there were lights in the sky well before science fiction began popularising the idea of 'outer space'.

       NASA is nothing but straight up deception and yet strangely it's the most defended government agency on the sub.  How off is that?  The government agency that used CGI and Hollywood is the agency that so many accounts want to defend.  It's right here in plain sight for all of us, the pushback these threads garner should be setting off alarm bells for every genuine free thinker

       I don't know enough to even be skeptical of these photos other than the blurred areas that don't appear to be naturally occurring. Makes me wonder what is hiding. I can't interpret the rest of what I'm seeing. lol

       NASA lies to us like the rest of them. They're either concealing/withholding the truth or entirely fabricating and falsifying information to an extent by which all of the shapes and symbols we identify with in those photos are planted there by "NASA."

       This is just a personal feeling I wanted to share. I've always had a strange fixation on the moon. Ever since I was little. I've always dreamt about the moon and whenever I wasn't dreaming of the moon, I was dreaming in blues and whites. The color the full moon drapes across fields and houses during a full moon. It's always been with me and I always anticipate the full moon each month.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the moon just "feels" surreal. "Feelings" don't do much in the way of proof or anything else but it is a very odd thing to be hanging in the sky. I've always been more fascinated with the effect it has on humanity but it also doesn't surprise me to think that there is/was some type of life on the moon.

       I have been captivated by the moon ever since I began questioning the notion that it is a solid, physical object.

       Many people get upset by my skepticism, but this reveals that my skepticism is well-placed.

       The more triggered people get by a question, the more you know it is a dogmatic belief system.

       Propotionality with the masses involved and inverse proportionality with the distance squared (space is three-dimensional). It is not exactly intuitive, but when you look at the other forces of nature, it's pretty consistent. Then again, you can listen to millions of scientists who have verfied this stuff for themselves and their students, or you can follow a con artist or cult leader who knows everything you will ever need to know, without actually looking at stuff. The willful stupidity and self delusion of it is what triggers many people. We don't want that to happen to anyone we care about.

       Even if everything we see is a trick, we still get benefits from being able to reason about apparent phenomena that passes before our senses.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Moon's case, we are able to look at it in great detail, both visually and with electromagnetic sensors. It reflects from the Sun and we can bounce a laser off of it. It also blocks sunlight. We can send a machine into orbit up around it. We can put a shockwave sensor on it and get expected data that indicates that it is made of solid rock. Your model doesn't superceed the already well working assumption that the Moon and Stars are real(tm) for all practical purposes.

       Well of course they did. Their worked directly affected preservation of humanity. Shelter maintained? Check. Food in stock? Check. No ones going batshit crazy or developing an illness? Check.
Nowadays you have to go to school for a quarter of your life to figure out how to be a good slave for society's sake and live the rest of your life out based on your slavery. Not based on the nurturing and preservation of mankind, but the growth of consumerism, capitalism and vanity... living the resource-abundant, overall destructive hyper capitalist society lifestyle isn't necessary nor does it prove how great the white man is.

       That's not important- because we
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       cities. We have grand sky-scrapers and displays of our wealth and our power.
       <em>
        We live in the West.
       </em>
       Where you are enabled to be who
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       want to be. This is the place where your basic physiological needs are met easily. Your life is in your hands because you have the
       <em>
        freedom
       </em>
       to be who you want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The West has a very deep-rooted characteristic I can't find the word for right now, and you can see its effects in the manifests of its societies and their behaviors as international actors (such as colonization, for example; or the Manifest Destiny).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a strong belief in the West that has an idea about the way people are in Africa, living in villages- that's poverty and suffering and they are "undeveloped." They're either primitive or they don't have "rights." They're "living in the past," and we're "headed towards a brighter future." That we are "developed," and because other nations do not live the "resource-abundant, overall destructive hyper capitalist society lifestyle," they are "under-developed," (and we need to "save them" from their ways lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       They still teach kids that in school. I was taught that.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say things like that, "the white man," I just mean in regards to the relationship between development, race and geography- the associations of the West with being "First [in the] World," and "developed" while other countries are "under-developed" or "Third World," and that their cultures and lifestyles are considered "primitive" and ours "advanced."

       The ridiculous theories of God aside, I see blurry low-res images. A lot of what you're pointing to very well could be natural formations. It's impossible to tell without better quality images. These photos don't really prove or disprove anything.

       Yeah, that one, and several others have very clearly been photoshopped. I don't get why anyone thinks they can get away with that. It just discredits discussion, but maybe that's the point.

       because anyone with a fairly basic telescope can look at it freely whenever they like. there seems to be a lot more evidence to tell me that its actually a moon, then evidence to tell me that its merely a light. In fact I am not well versed on that theory. Can you explain the basics?

       light is only one source of observation. If I were standing near you, I could see you because of the light that reflects off of you. That does not mean that you are made of light. I could touch you, hear you and maybe smell you, all things that would prove your existence to me, without seeing you. If there was no object (the moon), by the rules and laws we believe to be true about the properties of light, what evidence is there that the moon is a source of light?
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine there are other instruments that can be used to measure the moon that do not require light to prove its existence, but I will admit that I don't know what they are.

       I am a solid, physical object. The question is, are the things in the sky we call 'planets' and 'stars' also solid, physical objects (like people) or are they merely lights (like rainbows).

       Cool but a lot of this can be explained. There's a lot of image artifacts being shown as anomalies and the domes on Mars could just be the asteroids that originally created the crater.

       Okay, so this in no way accounts for the majority of these pictures, so I am not making any claims about those ones, BUT...
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture of the round structures in the center of impact craters (I think the majority of them were in the moon collection) are a normal phenomenon with impacts. Think about what water looks like when a drip impacts the surface. There is something similar to an impact crater immediately followed by a small dollop what resurfaces in the center as the pressure under the water springs up. High speed impacts behave similarly but the entropy of rock and dirt are a lot slower than water and they maintain the crater and drop that springs back a lot longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest, I am not going to bother venturing a guess. They could be a product of pareidolia, but I still think they all look really interesting and am not willing to just dismiss them all outright without more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love looking at these sorts of images, honestly. They seriously get my imagination pumping!

       Thank you looking at the with an unbiased and healthy skeptic view point! Thats an interesting theory about the round structures, I'll have to check that out.

       Thanks, and I did see that haha! Personally I do speculate about what these things could be because they seem quite off to me. But all any of these pictures really point out to me is that we are simply not getting the full story here. I really don't care what the truth is, I'm simply one of those people that just wants to know so we can do something about it. All I had intended to do with this was get people talking, and it seems to contain the most commits on this forum as of now so I'm more than happy. It's been nice seeing people share, question, and speculate even more than just these photos, I love it! Thats what this forum is all about, at least to me

       I like to believe that humans terraformed Earth millions of years ago and lived in a utopia, but one day there was a solar flare and knocked out all their electronics but they had become so dependent on technology that they didn’t know how to fix anything, and then they started building pyramids to signal for help but none came. It’s fun to think about :)

       There was Project/operation clementine (operation golden dragon (conspiracy)) back before that.  They did some pretty high resolution imaging of the moon and some of these pictures look like some of those that evolved from some of the imaging done then

       these are great, thanks for the time &amp; effort! I agree, there's seemingly something there to be known that is being concealed. If one were to follow the "Earth as a classroom" hypothesis, and that people choose to forget their true nature and incarnate here in order to learn something, then it's possible that revealing this knowledge is counterproductive to the reason for us being here in the first place. Maybe we are misfit/misbehaving souls that were sent here for rehabilitation and it's not desired that we should be aware of the bigger picture, since it's not desired that we be part of that picture until we are ready. Or maybe it's just governments keeping knowledge to themselves so that they hold the power. Or a combination of the above.

       Yeah of course! I'm glad you enjoyed them! And interesting theory, could have something there. I personally feel that the powers at be are keeping this from us to a certain degree, and I don't feel that its in our best interest knowing them lol

       Some of the images seem like a stretch, but as for the rest I wish there were attached coordinates or something so they can be independently verified.  You can buy pretty decent telescopes these days and I'd love a chance to see this stuff myself.

       Yeah I had to leave out a lot cause I felt the same. And I originally intended to but it proved more difficult than I thought, I'll go back later and try to add as many as I can though once I get home! I'll try to add the image number and source as well. Some of the images have a little information and I'm sure if you were really interested you could track it down, but I'll do my best to help you out!

       Right?! I could take a better picture with my Sony camera, and they're supposed to be cutting edge. Hopefully we can get some better ones with future missions but I'm sure there'll be plenty of "smudge" marks haha!

       Exactly why they keep full disclosure on the subject. It would change the world view of every nation and basically prove everyones religion is wrong. Not that big of a deal in western countries but could you imagine as where? It would straight up start WWIII. Anyways I encourage you to watch this

       That's not what I'm concerned about. Finding a prior species would indicate that life is more common than we think, and since we don't see it anywhere, there's a strong chance that civilizations destroy themselves after a certain point. This would mean there's a super strong chance we will destroy ourselves

       Don’t worry about credit or anything, NASA took all the photos anyway. The more these get distributed the sooner we’ll get disclosure.

       The (con) artists name says it all, these are all martian grainy details that have been "enhanced" by the artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, it's a cool art project and testament to the mass of imagery of rocky martian surface we've started to gather with those nifty rovers.

       Except that many of them were in the foreground and didn’t require any enhancement, and those details are still visible in the raw gigapans. Besides, considering that several bones and fossils have been clearly pictured, is it really so unreasonable to expect that there might still be life there? Like the post title says, you decide.

       No clear pictures of bones or fossils yet that I have seen. A bone or fossil shaped rock or mineral deposit is not proof of anything other than the brains aptitude for image recognition. If you looked at clouds and saw familiar shapes like an animal or object, you wouldn't therefore suggest that the cloud is alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see the need of anyone to color in details of a mars rock to make it look like a person, other than as a joke. It completely invalidates any possible real discovery from that source. The original image and what can be gathered from it is much more interesting to me.

       If it was just a couple things, it would be easy to blow them off but it's literally a pile of images from both places that keep getting bigger as better tech is used and more images are uploaded from the rovers and orbiters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common sense at this point would lead to the idea that there is artificial shit on both the moon and Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope I'm still alive when they finally quit fucking around and denying shit and we go explore and find stuff on both.

       I didn't see an image of the five sided pyramid on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's near the Mars face and there was another regular pyramid looking structure near their too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was taken by the same probe that took pics of the face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rember years later they took a high res images of the face so they could say it's not a face.  But they never did the same for the pyramids nearby.

       There are too many pictures to go through one by one, I guess the main point is that these places are supposed to be completely barren with just dust, sand, or rocks so why are there so many weird looking things and these are just a few. There are tons more and I plan to keep adding, but its ultimately up to you and your reasoning to decide what you see. I hope you at least enjoyed them and thanks for checking them out!

       Never forget Buzz Aldrin mentioned a tower on Phobos on live television and how we need to go there because someone other than us put it there. Shortly thereafter the MSM started suggesting that he was going a little senile.

       For anyone interested in mars, I'd highly recommend listening to Graham Hancock (already mentioned but just throwing it out there again). He has a specific segmemt on Mars, just search Graham Hancock Mars on youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read both Fingerprints of the Gods and Magicians of the Gods and he is definitely on to something. He believes there was a civilization on Mars at one point. The sphinx head and tomb found in the images support this. It's such a deep rabbit hole but once you get into it it's pretty crazy shit.

       My best suggestion is to find a pair of Gen 3/4 Nightvision goggles.  We are not alone.  We are being lied to.  It's quite obvious that both Mars and the Moon are already colonized by beings more advanced and intelligent than us.

       That "pillar" is not alien, just the spaceship still standing after all these years. What, you think they abadoned the well feasible moon shot, that was made public knowledge by Jules Verne? For proof just ask yourself, do you spot any similarities between the names "Jules VERNE" and "VERNEr von Brown"?

       Was a toilet read for me.  Some of the chapters were a grind, some super interesting.  The more time that passes since I have read it the more I wonder what is the exact purpose of the book.  I mean they give Uncle Sam a lot of the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the moon landing and their citations but still put together a pretty compelling thought exercise.  I just hope that it's not fully a 'limited hangout' type book

       Your guess is as good as mine, especially seeing as it will never be possible to know the full truth. Even if you go to a heaven after you die, you could be there a million years and then learn that it's a simulation running on another dimension. But I've seen things that make me think that only have been created by a sentient creator.

       A deep sea fish starts evolving. Evolution is blind luck, literally trying everything. So every possible variation of the fish is tried, but only the one that randomly
       <em>
        grows a lightbulb in its forehead
       </em>
       survives? A gut worm's life cycle is thus: a worm crawls out of your anus and lays eggs, hoping you scratch it, get the eggs in your fingernails and eventually touch food, and
       <em>
        eat the egg.
       </em>
       So it just figured that out somehow? A bug comes out of nowhere in the forest, evolution tries a bunch of things, and only when it randomly started
       <em>
        looking exactly like a leaf
       </em>
       did it start surviving? A fruit tree only reproduces when an animal eats the fruit, shits the seeds out in natural fertilizer. How did it know that? Some trees seeds only crack open when a forest fire burns the hard husk. How did that come to be randomly? And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about cartoons coming into existence out of nowhere, you just described the theory of evolution. Either way, everything came from somewhere, and it makes more sense, when something consciously, deliberately, and ingeniusly created all of this.

       Dude I'm way ahead of you lmao, I've seen pretty much everyone of his lectures on youtube(just finished the Gnostics one) and all of his JRE appearances! He really is man, its incredible that it hasn't overthrown it already considering the amount of hard evidence there is, piri reis map etc. Good quote btw, not much of I bible guy myself but there is a lot of interesting stuff in that book, specifically Eziekiels book. Ive looked in to Tellengers work a bit but ill have to go full force if your recommending it. I'd love to pick your brain sometime man, we seem on the same page haha! I'm gonna start Magicians tonight!

       The (con) artists name says it all, these are all martian grainy details that have been "enhanced" by the artist.

       Still, it's a cool art project and testament to the mass of imagery of rocky martian surface we've started to gather with those nifty rovers.

        Just think about the way that a baby grows and how microscopic that process starts off. Almost everything that makes our world go from one stage to the next is invisible to our eyes. I don't know how to explain it better than: the way we need to make sense of the way this world works is understand the design of objects and motions. Going back to the reproductive system- we understand how this happens because we can visually see it- the sperm swims to the egg- but do you ever wonder why? Why does the sperm swim to the egg?

       There is no absolute truth. I won't tell you why it happens, but know that it's all part of a chain of events that leads to another. It's not accidental.

       If you don't have supporting evidence but your own imagination.. I'm sorry but that's even weaker. Your feelings aren't proof of anything, in fact, there's literally nothing that suggests there's a god. Nothing needs a god to exist, it is only real in some human minds.

       light is only one source of observation. If I were standing near you, I could see you because of the light that reflects off of you. That does not mean that you are made of light. I could touch you, hear you and maybe smell you, all things that would prove your existence to me, without seeing you. If there was no object (the moon), by the rules and laws we believe to be true about the properties of light, what evidence is there that the moon is a source of light?
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine there are other instruments that can be used to measure the moon that do not require light to prove its existence, but I will admit that I don't know what they are.
