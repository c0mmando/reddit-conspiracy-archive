       Still might as well not pay for American middleman markup. Plenty of good phones straight from manufacturer. Android is fine if you can build it yourself and remove the spyware. I think there are also some custom OS builds you can use.

       It’s open source so nothing would stop you from scrubbing it. There used to be a project that aimed to do that, but I can’t find it now. Wouldn’t be feasible to do yourself unless you had a team and planned on releasing it so you’d get some value out of the massive amount of time it would take. There are other suitable alternatives. It’s just unfortunate because the UX is pretty good, just like Apple. Sadly, they are both more spying tool than mobile OS now.

      <p>
       Samsung is a Korean company and their phones are made in Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Koreans (and Korean businesses) know better than to let somebody from some other country make their stuff for them. Koreans have a stronger sense of community and national identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       American businessmen have no sense of community and give no fucks about their national identity. They see their fellow Americans as a resource to be exploited. The thing they care about most is making a higher profit by selling crap made somewhere else. They see themselves as being separate from their customers and that's why they don't give a fuck about putting all their potential customers out of work by outsourcing every job they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think this makes no sense, just look at the difference between the US and Korea. China is kicking America's ass in trade. Korea lives right next door to China and they're doing just fine.

      </p>
      <p>
       entrap:  trick or deceive (someone), especially by inducing them to commit a crime in order to secure their prosecution.

       You must be wilfully ignorant. First of all "YouTube" is just a video server. It does not create it's own content but merely allowed us all to provide our own content to share. Now that it's the largest version of itself (video servers) and most widely used it's beginning to censor its content providers based on buzzwords in the news and larger competition wanting to stiffle the individual users. The result will be large privately funded channels with corporate agendas taking over and the smaller and less "popular" channels being phased out of the general searches. Less peer created videos and more studio-like scripted bs and limited hangouts.

       What you're failing to see is the censorship of dissenting and non corporate content. It's not just pushing alternative viewpoints away it's literally hiding and banning them, removing them from the public view. This is certainly legal yet ethically as YouTube gains more and more power removing competition, it's begins to become shadier and shadier to the point where they're a government talking piece.

       As long as there are other video streaming services (networks, private video blogs, pornhub) alphebet can appeal to who they want.  I find entertainment there, thus I will continue to use them.  As for the "censorship" (which is not applicable since they are not the government), I'd rather have a platform that doesn't reward vile content.

       Vile content? Like that body language lady who is now banned after looking closely at politicians? Or Life of Boris who earns nothing from his videos while youtube and the advertizers pockets the money made from his content? Same with pewdiepie, who ended up having to upload 9 different edits of the same harmless video, or shane dawson.

       They are censored and demonitized at every opportunity, Youtube pockets the ad revenue.

       Fuck youtube, decentralized content platforms on blockchain will kill it off.

       If so, good for them.  As long as they provide a better product (which is all that this is) then I'll pick the best one.  Right now YouTube provides the best content.  Don't be butthurt just because they have to create algorithms (which will always be faulty) to check the MASSIVE amount of data that is uploaded to their platform.  Its a part of being successful.  If uploaders don't like it they should go elsewhere... Then there will be an organic shift in the market (and you can complain about the next supplier that gets big).

       Make sure that you ppint this out to OP's who still don't understand how to use the archive feature as well.  We are giving hits to cnbc and cnn all the time and all i can think is that people are either so fucking ignorant to be giving them their dollars and clicks when they don't need to be.

       If you agree with hooktube then join me in encouraging posters to do the same to the standard MSM propaganda site as well.

       I consistently get downvoted when i point this out and I can only think of one reason why this would be.

       Still waiting for a legitimate reason do dislike them other than "they are implementing a successful business practice".
      </p>

       Thanks by the way for the private post in which you linked a dick and spoke about enigmas.  Very mature.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note I think this conversation (or whatever it has been) has been exhausted.  Hope you find peace with yourself and the way the world works.
