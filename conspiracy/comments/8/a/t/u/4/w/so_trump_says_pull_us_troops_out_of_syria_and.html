       A few weeks ago, Russia even predicted, based on evidence from a tip, that the ISIS rebels were about to stage a false flag chemical attack in Ghouta, to be blamed on Assad!!  See here:

       Words don't equal action. We have to wait and see if what he said actually comes to. In reality all he said was "Big price to pay", which could mean many things. He was just talking about planning a withdrawal from Syria.

       I wish you were right, but no, war in the Middle East is exactly where we are headed - American boys dying for Israel's expansion throughout the Middle East. It does not matter what the 'normies' think. Millions took to the streets to protest the Iraq war and we still invaded Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is on the warpath again, and woe to the world if we do not stop them. ZIONISTS ARE EVIL BEYOND HUMAN COMPREHENSION.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point:
"ISRAEL NERVE GAS SMELT GOOD, IT MADE YOU WANT TO BREATHE DEEPLY"
The sick Zionists threw poisoned nerve gas into school playgrounds had rainbow-colored smoke and tasted like mint so the CHILDREN GULPED IN THE POISON and within a few minutes collapsed, convulsed and some died: 
 “Like mint,” several people said. One resident later recalled, “the smell was good. You want to breathe more. You feel good when you inhale it.” A girl reported that “its taste was like sugar. The smell was sweet”. “First… the smoke was white, then yellow, then black,” a teenage victim later recalled. Another victim said that the smoke changed colors “like a rainbow.”

      <p>
       ZIONISTS ARE SO SICK AND EVIL THAT THEY CREATE A NERVE GAS FOR CHILDREN TASTING LIKE CANDY AND RAINBOW COLORED.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the evil ones that American boys will die for UNLESS WE STOP THEM.

       The moderators of the_donald are quick to suppress any dissent from Trump's position on an issue.  I am confidant that an overwhelming majority of posters in the_donald are against war with Syria and believe this is a false flag by the "Deep State" to pressure Trump into escalating the war with Syria.

      </p>
      <p>
       as for censoring posts on t_d, it makes sense as pretty much the rest of reddit is against trump, so if they allowed anything to be posted on there it would turn in to a shit fest

       I remember telling my younger brother years ago to be careful posting stuff on social media and text messages because it's all getting collected by something called the NSA. He was younger back then and I just wanted him to be careful in case he ran for office or something in the future. He laughed at me and we got in a huge fight about it...a year later Snowden blows the whistle.

       You're fucking insane if you think pizzagate is bullshit. I bet you watched that interview with Alefantis on FOX news and that was enough to debunk it for you, wasn't it? 
Have you seen one shred of the Podesta emails Wikileaks was kind enough to bring us? If you have, then you would know, Pizzagate is not bullshit.

       You have an FBI database, that has all of these words listed as code for pedophilia, and you have thousands of emails, that are littered with the words from that database. If that is mental gymnastics for your brain, its not very athletic.

       Can you explain to me what "should I play dominos on pizza or pasta" means? What the hell is that shit dude? I definitely base most of my shit as far as pizzagate goes off of speculation, but you have to admit there is some weird shit going on. What about Alefantis threatening that youtube user who posted all the videos about the kill room?

       Well as far as the the threatening goes some people get upset when they are wrongly accused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pasta or pizza possibly means exactly that, dude lost a game of dominos and is joking around about what he should eat. You're getting information off pure speculation and treating it as gospel, that's fucked up. Do your own research and you'll find that the "words" part it totally based off a 4Chan bull shit post.

       So being wrongfully accused gives him the green light to threaten to kill the mans entire family? If someone tells me I did something I didn’t, me telling said person that I will kill him and all of his loved ones is a giant red flag. Also, being accused of fucking and killing children is not an accusation that you just throw out there dude. You can say someone is racist, an asshole, sexist, stupid or shit like that. You don’t just call someone a pedophile for no reason. The fact that no one thinks there is something wrong with that alone is baffling.

       To me saying nothing would be a red flag. Kind of like how the president attacks literally everything on twitter except the Stormy Daniels thing. That's how you can tell it's 100% true. I'm not saying it's ok to threaten, don't know where you got that from, I'm saying it's a better explanation than him actually having a kill room. Now did he threaten this guy on a post or is this someone claiming they got a voicemail. I've heard about the voicemail thing and that's just about as big of a larp as Q.

       a year or so ago i saw a video of one of these 'bombings of civilians', it was people crushed under rubble and screaming then when the camera cut, the rest of the video was everyone getting up and moving the fake rocks and nobody was actually hurt

       makes you wonder how much of the shit we see is even real, or why even bother making the effort to stage things just do whatever you want and most people wont care anyways. or maybe its like the matrix, you have to give people the illusion of choice and that they have some control over what goes on

       Just wondering: have any chemical/gas attacks been been definitively pinned on Assad? The only one I am aware of that comes close was the last one, where he was found responsible for the release of toxins—which is what Assad claimed as well, that his jets bombed a rebel production/storage facility. (The wording of the investigation was once-again vague so as to be easily construed in various ways.)

       Yes Israel, the horror terror state of the world. Israelis have a long history of replacing tear-gas with nerve-gas and using grenades containing nerve-gas on Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel troops lobbed gas canisters into Palestinian school playgrounds with poisonous nerve gas that has rainbow-colored smoke and tasted like mint - all to make the children breathe the poison in deeply. 
Here is a quote: “Like mint,” several people said. One resident later recalled, “the smell was good. You want to breathe more. You feel good when you inhale it.” A girl reported that “its taste was like sugar. The smell was sweet”. “First… the smoke was white, then yellow, then black,” a teenage victim later recalled. Another victim said that the smoke changed colors “like a rainbow.”

       THIS IS THE EVIL WE ARE UP AGAINST - ISRAEL MAKES NERVE GAS TASTE GOOD TO CHILDREN SO THEY GULP IN THE POISON. NO COUNTRY, NO PEOPLE ARE MORE EVIL THAN ZIONISTS.

       It's so blatant and transparent you can't help but be in disbelief that people actually believe the Media narrative. It's obvious that TPTB want more WAR and Trump does not. It will be interesting to see this play out.

       Assad wasn't to blame. The US was. We're doing everything we can to continue to push regime change even when it's not in our best interest as a country and a neighbor to everyone other country in the world. I hope the Corrupt Intelligence Agency at the helm is ready for some serious blowback, because they're earned it this time.
