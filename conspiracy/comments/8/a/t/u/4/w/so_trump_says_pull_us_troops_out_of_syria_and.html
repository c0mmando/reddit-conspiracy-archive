    <div class="md"><p>I wish you were right, but no, war in the Middle East is exactly where we are headed - American boys dying for Israel&#39;s expansion throughout the Middle East. It does not matter what the &#39;normies&#39; think. Millions took to the streets to protest the Iraq war and we still invaded Iraq. </p>

<p>Israel is on the warpath again, and woe to the world if we do not stop them. ZIONISTS ARE EVIL BEYOND HUMAN COMPREHENSION. </p>

<p>Case in point:
&quot;ISRAEL NERVE GAS SMELT GOOD, IT MADE YOU WANT TO BREATHE DEEPLY&quot;
The sick Zionists threw poisoned nerve gas into school playgrounds had rainbow-colored smoke and tasted like mint so the CHILDREN GULPED IN THE POISON and within a few minutes collapsed, convulsed and some died: 
 “Like mint,” several people said. One resident later recalled, “the smell was good. You want to breathe more. You feel good when you inhale it.” A girl reported that “its taste was like sugar. The smell was sweet”. “First… the smoke was white, then yellow, then black,” a teenage victim later recalled. Another victim said that the smoke changed colors “like a rainbow.”

<p>ZIONISTS ARE SO SICK AND EVIL THAT THEY CREATE A NERVE GAS FOR CHILDREN TASTING LIKE CANDY AND RAINBOW COLORED. </p>

<p>These are the evil ones that American boys will die for UNLESS WE STOP THEM. </p>

<p>lol wtf? joining a discord with some 17 year olds isnt some top secret spy mission, relax</p>

<p>as for censoring posts on t_d, it makes sense as pretty much the rest of reddit is against trump, so if they allowed anything to be posted on there it would turn in to a shit fest</p>

<p>yes some conspiracy theories are retarded, and many people who believe in some form of conspiracy theory are retarded</p>

<p>if you were to tell people a few months ago that facebook is spying on everything they do, using it to manipulate what you think about certain things, and even present them with a published study where facebook affected the content of unknowing user&#39;s &#39;news feeds&#39; to experiment on how they could affect a persons mood and make them happy or depressed, you&#39;d get called a tinfoil retard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So being wrongfully accused gives him the green light to threaten to kill the mans entire family? If someone tells me I did something I didn’t, me telling said person that I will kill him and all of his loved ones is a giant red flag. Also, being accused of fucking and killing children is not an accusation that you just throw out there dude. You can say someone is racist, an asshole, sexist, stupid or shit like that.

<p>Israel troops lobbed gas canisters into Palestinian school playgrounds with poisonous nerve gas that has rainbow-colored smoke and tasted like mint - all to make the children breathe the poison in deeply. 
Here is a quote: “Like mint,” several people said. One resident later recalled, “the smell was good. You want to breathe more. You feel good when you inhale it.” A girl reported that “its taste was like sugar. The smell was sweet”. “First… the smoke was white, then yellow, then black,” a teenage victim later recalled. Another victim said that the smoke changed colors “like a rainbow.” <a href="http://group194.net/english/article/23392#.WsoRmJge7aA.twitter">http://group194.net/english/article/23392#.WsoRmJge7aA.twitter</a></p>
