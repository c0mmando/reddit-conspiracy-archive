      <p>
       I'm curious as to what degree the users here still believe that our high level elected officials still make decisions and enact policies on their own, and act autonomously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I've always been under the impression that people in positions of immense power, like the presidency, were "installed" into those positions by the ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at where the funding comes for most high elected officials, it comes from big banks, wall street firms, corporations, media, and wealthy individual billionaires. These are the same groups that the global crime syndicate consists of and is run by. Often, people from these same circles are placed into cabinet positions once their "puppet" is elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it's not enough just for this crime syndicate, to select a candidate that has agreed in advance to do their bidding; They need to select
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       candidates that signed on to the agenda, run them against each other, and that they can craft an entire scripted election narrative around. All they have to do is use their controlled media, to cover their two pre-selected candidates the most, and catapult them into the nominations of their party. Then, it's merely a scripted puppet show, with scripted debates, and scripted partisan tension and theatrics. Since they control both candidates and the media, they can shift the narrative and choose a different winner if they have to, by gauging what the public is thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they've selected a winner and he/she is elected, the candidate simply follows orders, carries out the policies the crime syndicate demands, passes the bills they want pass, and bombs the countries they want bombed. They can also order them to make a statement or say something controversial to stir the pot and create partisan division.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Say something offensive about *insert racial group here"
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       "Tell conservatives that they didn't build their own businesses."
      </p>
      <p>
       To my estimation, our elected officials at the highest levels have virtually no autonomy at the position, and are essentially instructed on what to do by their corporate oligarch masters, to better help form their vision of a world government.
      </p>

       Those who run for the Presidency but aren't bought get mistreated and cheated against in the Primaries, lied about by the MSM, and shunned by their own Parties.

       Those who do manage to get into positions of power don't often last long. Cynthia Mckenna is one, or JFK, or RFK.

       I agree that presidents are "installed." I was a little shocked they allowed a black man into power, but one acquaintance made a good point. "What if they just keep him so busy he doesn't know whats going on?"

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYS647HTgks">
        Mike Lofgren, a congressional staff member for 28 years, joins Bill Moyers to talk about what he calls Washington's "Deep State," in which elected and unelected figures collude to protect and serve powerful vested interests. "It is how we had deregulation, financialization of the economy, the Wall Street bust, the erosion or our civil liberties and perpetual war," Lofgren tells Moyers.

       This should wake a lot of people up to how this country is really run. While everyone fights about electing their favorite puppets in the spotlights, behind a curtain are un-elected men in the shadows, with unknown agendas, and unchecked unlimited power, pulling the strings.

       Not sure I believe that the elites of the world
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       control who is allowed to control a country, but I definitely believe that they have a tremendous amount of influence on all of the major possitions. And if on the off chance that someone who they didn't like started looking like they could win it would be a simple matter for them to get them out of the race.

       How would we interpret Trump election in light of this theory.  Was his win, despite HRC clearly being the darling of the media/TPTB just basically psyop?  I have a hard time not believing US elections are not horribly compromised so not sure what else to make of his victory.

       Retail politics is basically reality TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real secret they don't want you to know is this:  your vote DOES matter.  It legitimizes what they do in office.  They've already won the battle in America.  Only 50% of us turn out to vote for politicians who can receive up to 100% of their campaign funding by anonymous corporate donors.
