<p>Why isn&#39;t Congress getting involved?</p>

<p>It seems to me we are now at the point where the US does one of two things.</p>

<p>Wait for an investigation into the latest chemical weapons attack to be done...</p>

<p>Or, conduct a military strike on a sovereign nation...which is an act of war.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t anyone bringing up the role that Congress should be assuming at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The even more important question is- why isn&#39;t <em>Congress</em> bringing up the role that they should play? They have given up so much responsibility that they are effectively neutering themselves as time goes on. They gave the power of the purse to the Fed, they&#39;ve given the power of war to the President. I would say it&#39;s time for Congress to step up and do their fucking job, but we all know they won&#39;t, because they don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>Also, I personally think Congress should be expanded, in line with the idea of the original founding fathers. Washington said no HoR Rep should have a district of greater than 30k people- well the current average district size is 700k+, because the HoR capped their membership in the 20&#39;s to preserve their power. I believe Congress should be doubled or tripled in size, to roughly 1200 Representatives- with this you could stop creating alphabet agencies to do Congress&#39; job, and instead appoint actual fucking Congressman to run the goddamn government, instead of bureaucrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bradok...I can&#39;t put into words how much I respect you and the views/opinions you express on this sub.</p>

<p>You are a voice of well-informed reason on so many topics/issues that are discussed on this sub.</p>

<p>How do we force Congress to take the role of assuming their legal responsibility?</p>

<p>If Trump acts on his own...Congress will have grounds to impeach him, I believe. Last year&#39;s cruise missile strike definitely toed the line in regards to this. The media didn&#39;t push it...which is why it never got brought up by anyone other than Kaine and Flake.</p>

<p>The overall damage and lack of a large casualty rate also played a part.</p>

<p>But if Trump orders strikes that result in a large casualty rate or serious damage to Syrian military sites this time...I believe that Congress will move to impeach him, while at the same time, take advantage of what they will label as a &quot;war that Trump started, but we now need to finish&quot;...</p>

<p>They get what they want and once again, dodge any responsibility while doing it.</p>

<p>We are in dangerous waters right now imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think impeachment would come down to inherently political lines. I don&#39;t know if the Reps would be willing to do it for something like this- even though it could be interpreted that way. But if the Dems win Congress in November this year, it might be a different story, though they seem to be looking to take him down for some nebulous Russian collusion (which is funny, because escalating tensions in Syria doesn&#39;t help Russia at all, but don&#39;t try and explain that to them, they&#39;ll just get pissy).</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t even have enough faith that this would piss Congress off- so far both sides have shown they&#39;re willing to escalate the war in Syria (funny how no one ever declared war, but it most definitely is one, eh?). I think the MIC has their claws sunk deep into Congress- I just don&#39;t see them impeaching him over a military strike. They might get on national TV and pretend to be upset but their donors and the intelligence agencies will talk to them behind closed doors and convince them that this is &quot;the right course of action&quot; as they always seem to do... </p>

<p>But no matter what you&#39;re right...we are in dangerous waters right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I know how they&#39;re going to do it bradok...they&#39;re going to claim that the targets were IRGC. This is why Trump listed Iran as being one of the responsible parties.</p>

<p>Legally, Trump can conduct a notary strike on the IRGC because they have been officially designated a terrorist organization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good news...I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department statement emphasized that the development did not mean that the United States has designated the IRGS as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>

<p>Had to go do some research into the fine print. This brings us back to forcing Congress to assume responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got another thought...Trump is demanding that Douma be opened up to humanitarian aid...</p>

<p>What if we have assets that are trapped in the area? And the only way to get them out is through the confusion humanitarian aid would bring?</p>

<p>Latest news I&#39;m hearing is that buses are being brought into Douma in the next 48 hours to move Jaysh Al Islam.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hearing they&#39;ve made a deal to leave. This could be a game changer.</p>

<p>Apparently, Syrian forces hit them hard last night for the mortar attacks on Damascus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the most rational and well spoken posts Ive seen in a while. I think I have been remiss in scaling the intent of our founding fathers. I tend to think they had no idea how big the US would get, so what they felt 30,000 meant or any other number needs to be scaled to our current population. I think you are right, we may need more, not fewer representatives.</p>

<p>The chances of a sensible voice aneaking thru would be greater. The voices of the average people would be multiplied and the lunatic fringe would be abated. </p>
