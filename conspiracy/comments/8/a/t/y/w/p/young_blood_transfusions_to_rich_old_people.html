       I live in a relatively low-income/urban shithole. A few months ago I noticed this place 'CSL PLASMA' being opened in a mostly abandoned strip-mall down the road from me. I thought it was really strange that plasma donations were essentially "going corporate". The posters/propaganda on the windows make me uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It made sense to me that they would put a place like this in a low-income area, as you can make "up to $400" donating plasma.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with the recent "trend" of
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/young-blood-transfusions-are-on-the-menu-at-society-gala/">
        young blood transfusions being on menus at society galas
       </a>
       , I can't help but think something creepier is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are your plasma donations really going to people who need it? (especially if done at some McPlasma place such as CSL Plasma), or is it being sold to rich, old people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       Oh well then yea. My mind immediately went to younger in terms of “elite paying for blood transfusions”. But who’s to say that wouldn’t be happening in addition to 18-30 year olds too.

       You can be in your 50’s and donate too if you pass their screening. Plasma goes to make medicine and be given medically.  The elites are not buying plasma from potential heroin/ meth addicts.

       That's how Queen Elizabeth II has stayed alive so long, she gets a blood transfusion of young blood every year. All elites do most likely but I know the Royal family has admitted as such.

       I used to do this about twice every week for about $70/week. If it's "up to $400" now, they're going to be getting a lot of plasma. It most definitely gave me an uneasy feeling after a while.

       I don't like the idea of people donating their blood/plasma and being told it's going somewhere that it's not going.

       Kind of like how when you donate money to certain charities, none of that money even touches the charity.

       I agree but I think this applies more to blood 'donations' at something like the Red Cross or whatever. The place discussed by op actually pays people for their plasma so it's fair game imo.

       It pays them, but tells them their plasma is going to sick kids and shit. Maybe some of it does, and some of it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you're saying. A lot of the people who donate for the $$ don't care, they just need the money. But some people donate because they're under the illusion that they are helping people. It should be more transparent IMO.

       There was a csl plasma center where I lived in northern Minnesota that was strategically placed in a low income area as well. My roommates would go donate as much as they could (we were poor college kids).
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to do it once and the whole thing was so fucking uncomfortable for me I never went back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of doubt their using it for "young blood transfusions" though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's just a super cheap way for them to collect plasma, that they can re sell and make giant profits.

       Every blood donation place in my area that I've ever been to does the exact same thing. It's usually a snack (like a debbie cake) and a juice or a soda, along with either a free t-shirt or a stress toy.

       It's because plasma products sell for ridiculous prices. They use them to treat cancer. And numerous other things. It seems like half the commercial areas in my area have some type of medical facilities.

       Why would the rich want plasma or blood from low income shitholes? Unless the screening is perfect, it would be hard to trust the blood to be clean. And the screening isnt perfect.

       Rich people are often unwilling to risk things like that, and theyd be aware that no screening is perfect. Perfect screening for just about anything rich or poor doesnt exist.

       There are many new treatments for very painful and rare ailments that require plasma to make or stem cell products . So I’m not surprised that the need worldwide grows . I received one of the stem cell type treatments mine was harvested at a live birth of a baby and then processed . Some of these can be life changing or life saving . I am not rich and am in my  early 40 ‘s . Most of the medical care is to right issues people suffer from this is why the need has grown for these products . The pain has been reduced enough I can mostly handle it .
