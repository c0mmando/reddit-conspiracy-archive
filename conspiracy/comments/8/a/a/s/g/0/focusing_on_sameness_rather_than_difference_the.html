       If there is one thing we need to do if we want to make any sort of difference in the world, change the dystopian path we are on, move towards a brighter future for humanity and our planet - it is working together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see people bickering over the smallest of things. When they discuss an event from a certain angle that might signal foul play or a conspiracy is at work, they will fight each other endlessly over the details, over the political motivations, over who has done what, who is right and who is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delving into the details of geopolitical events, world happenings, even philosophical questions is wonderful. But as we do so we have to acknowledge that when we do get into the details, disagreements will almost always be present. When it comes to looking deeply at any situation, story, happening, existential question, metaphysical discussion,..... we are bound to have different viewpoints, different perceptions when we look at the very heart of the issue. And that's OK. We all should learn that in order to move forward, agreeing to disagree is fine. Holding on to some viewpoint and making it a part of your identity is what creates the madness, the resistance, the desire for endless bickering and drama. The desire to be right, to feel better, smarter than others, to prove them wrong - the unchecked ego in all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no matter how much we disagree on deeper aspects of what is actually happening on this planet, I think there are plenty of things
       <em>
        we can
       </em>
       agree on. If people are willing to debate in peace and with a friendly vibe, debate is good - but even then it is important to find the things that we all think matter, that we all think are real and need to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crux of humanity is that we are divided. We are being endlessly divided and we are dividing ourselves up with our own attitude and unchecked egotistic tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we unite and focus on what we truly agree on needs to change, if we forget our differences and instead seek our commonalities - we CAN make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is one thing about those with unchecked power, it is that they seem to work with far more unity than us. A friend of mine recently remarked - "Even the darkness is working together, yet us, we that are meant to bring light into this world are endlessly bickering and cannot find any true common ground." I agree. If we cannot find common ground, how can we make any significant change?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus I ask of you - next time you are debating with anyone, when you participate in any discussion, whether it is in real life or on a forum - seek to find the things you agree on and do not dwell on opinions that divide you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek to find commonalities, not differences. This is the only true way to move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you say we can all agree on?
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is by no means an exhaustive list and is simply my perspective on what I've observed throughout the years of being in this and similar communities:
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say the vast majority of us want the endless wars and killing of innocents to stop. Wars for resources, wars waged for geopolitical means, for territorial control, for spreading a certain ideology (including the ideology of "freedom" and "democracy", which can many times be far from that), wars that fuel arms sales and are good for business and the financing of the military industrial complex....
      </p>
      <p>
       I would guess we want massive corruption and lobbying by special interest groups in the higher echelons of our society to cease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe global warming is real or not, I am sure nobody wants to continue polluting our planet and destroying our wonderful biosphere, cutting down rainforests, creating rampant air pollution, endless smog, destroying the supply of our drinking water, creating mass extinction of wildlife population...
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt people support the mass creation of
       <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a24675/pentagon-autonomous-swarming-drones/">
        autonomous military technology
       </a>
       , drones that could be controlled and placed into the hands of a small elite, an elite that could, especially with advanced AI, program them to literally become their own personal army, wardens of a new prison society, a new prison planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt people want the poisoning of our food with endless chemicals and pesticides, when approaches like
       <a href="https://permaculturenews.org/2009/05/21/permaculture-miracles-in-the-austrian-mountains/">
        permaculture farming
       </a>
       (linked is a truly miraculous story of how permaculture changes lives and nature, yields amazing healthy crops with minimal human labour) etc. are available to give us a healthy and plentiful supply of crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe people do not want to be a part of a mass surveillance state, a state where every piece of information, every little detail about you is known, sold and used for purposes that I am sure many of you would never condone, purposes that go far beyond mere advertising. Do we forget what is happening in China at the moment? The
       <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-31/chinas-social-credit-system-punishes-untrustworthy-citizens/9596204">
        Social Credit System
       </a>
       combined with their
       <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/surveillance-03302018111415.html">
        total surveillance state
       </a>
       is in full swing. The Chinese are not protesting this or resisting. Do you wish this to be a reality in your own country?
      </p>
      <p>
       To top it off, I think people are inherently good and I think most of us want a society based on this goodness, based on empathy and compassion, based on the golden rule of reciprocity. The vast majority of us are capable of empathy and are not psychopaths or sociopaths. But many of us have forgotten the importance of practising compassion, the art of stepping into another's shoes, of seeing things from another's perspective. Compassion and empathy could save this planet. If we were able to look at things from a perspective beyond anger, resentment and fear, we could come really far. I think most of us want this world to become a place where empathy is the norm, not the exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of us also desire to be happy, at peace and fulfilled within. Here I can only give you my personal perspective, but to me, I have found that true happiness, peace, freedom and love lie within all of us. They are, in my view, our natural state, that has been fogged up by the massive social conditioning, physical, mental and emotion poison and pain that is thrown at the vast majority of us almost from birth. Rare escape this conditioning. But with introspection, meditative practices, letting go, eating healthy, coming in touch with nature, spending time in a natural environment, being purposefully creative and expressing oneself in a way that benefits not only them, but the whole, expanding one's compassion towards all of life, being altruistic....this can be healed. You can slowly come back to your natural state of happiness and well-being. That for which no real cause or external stimulus is required. If we could come to this and create from this space, miracles could happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       (for more of my perspective on the last two points, you can check out
       <a href="http://www.embraceyourexperience.com">
        my thoughts on happiness, freedom, love, peace, spirituality and similar topics on my blog
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I know you may not agree with certain points on this list. That is OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, it is important to know, focus and find the major points that we can all see as true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Debate the details, but do not dwell on the differences of perspective that arise. Allow yourself to agree to disagree. Let us shape a common way forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever you meet with someone that may not agree with you on some of your more fringe perspectives on reality  (and trust me, I know how that's like, as I have some views on certain topics that would be considered very fringe to the majority), let that go and don't try to bicker and convince him or her that you are right and they are wrong. Try to find an entry point to what they can accept as true and find common ground. Then move from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can make it. But we have to be united to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       United we stand, divided we will surely fall.

       As soon as I saw the title it got me thinking: humans tend to get wrangled into different camps of thought politically, religiously, Coke or Pepsi, people who love or hate coconut,  mon and on, we do a pretty good job of dividing ourselves on a daily basis.  Corporate government does an even better job dividing us right down the middle on issues we are told are big but really only matter in the context of how we supposedly vote for our leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is it we can all agree on? What is the one thing that should be uniting all types of people?
      </p>
      <p>
       We all NEED clean air and water and shelter, and access to healthy food that we can afford.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who gets in the way of access to any of those things? Corporate government, capitalist greed, fascist control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are literally the essential elements of human life – The pursuit of liberty and happiness can't even begin without those as a foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet every day we hear about corporations poisoning our food,  polluting our water, Banks evicting people over minor infractions,  charging people more for being poor than for the rich misgandling millions of dollars- banks holding on to the properties of failed businesses, land that could be used to house or grow food every single person on earth... and the government controlled by banks and corporations, concerned only with making laws that benefit those lobbyists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since class is only a construct, a sorting system established by those in power, there is no reason that humans of every shade and personal belief  should not be gathering to overthrow anyone that is responsible for the poisoning or obstruction of those basic needs of human life.
      </p>
      <p>
       How bad will it have to get before all humans realize this?

       Great comment and I agree. Starting with the basics, protecting our rights to survive (and thrive!) through clean water, healthy food, an unpolluted environment, having our baic needs met.... is key. People need to be shown and made aware that these very fundamentals are in many ways being compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes people don't wake up until a calamity happens to them, but if people are shown that this is already happening, not only in some far away third world country, but far closer to their home, they may rethink their distractions and instead focus on things that matter more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is key to spread awareness, to show people what is going on. That is why there is a war on information, while the news becomes more and more untrustworthy.  People don't know what to believe anymore and confusion often breeds apathy or misplaced action and blame.  False info needs to be counteracted with good information, as best as is possible in this era of mass confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that we need to tap into people's empathy and invoke their sense of compassion and brotherhood - if people can relate to one another as humans and to nature as living beings, a huge impetus to action could arise, as well as a bond that goes beyond the mere intellectual understanding of unity.

       This is a great post and I really like the content on your blog. I have actually been thinking the last few days that since we are ruled through fear and hate, the best thing we can do to fight TPTB is to trust and love one another. But
       <em>
        how

       to do that when all the forces around us are trying to tear us apart is an entirely different question, and I like that you are suggesting tools we can all use toward that end. Of course there is also the problem that the notion of 'togetherness' and 'humanity is one' has been co-opted by (and promoted to advance) the NWO agenda. Haven't figured how to drive around that bugaboo.

       I agree wholeheartedly with your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have personally discovered, through my own experience, that the more I umlearn the social conditioning, the more I let go of the pain, fear, anger....inside me, the more compassion, a sense of unity and a strong desire to act positively and proactively, to make the world better for all of us, arises.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have engaged in serious introspection and meditative practices for more than a decade and in my opinion, this is the way forward. I have seen this in myself and others. Compassion and empathy, the desire to aid, be altruistic are there, you do not have to learn them, you just have to
       <em>
        uncover
       </em>
       them. Sure, there may be some outliers, people that are much more inclined to having sociopathic tendencies (often also due to serious pain in their childhood upbringing) , but these are still the minority.  And I would argue that even these people, stuck in a blank space of resistance, unable to feel at all, separated from their emotions and thus unable to truly be compassionate, even these people can make massive changes in their psyche if they engage in honestly looking within, letting go, integrating the pain, facing their shadow. All it takes is time, effort and baby steps along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I always say, this is simply my perspective, but I encourage others to try it for themselves and see the results in their own experience.

       You can not subjugate and obtain power doing this, so people who see the world with a consequentialist lens ("the ends justify the means") will always force division on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is really hard to view the world as one big community, and humans are tribalistic animals. You can unite people on superficial concepts like race or nationality, you can unite them around a belief system like religions do, or you can unite them in common self interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       but as a group gets large enough there will always be fractures and the types of people I mentioned previously will always step forward to stoke schisms in the group for their own short term power or goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be amazing if people could come together and see the world as one massive community and only behave in ways that benefit the whole of humanity, but even if this utopia was attained, it would be FAR more difficult and bloody to maintain it.

       I do think that there is massive potential for unity in humanity. If we simply acknowledge that the other person is a living being, that already is finding some incredibly powerful common ground, a powerful similarity from which empathy and compassion can spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen it in myself. As I have unlearned much of the social conditioning,  as I engaged in introspective, meditative and contemplative practices, I have found that compassion and a desire to help others, to find unity with others (not only humans, but all life, plants and animals alike) has become much more natural to me. I have seen this same change in others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus the key is to unlearn, to let go of the misconceptions that humans are inherently unable to be empathic, unable to work together, unable to find common ground, unable to be a part of society that is not based on war and insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing we cannot work together and cooperate is the wet dream of every figure that is in power and wants to maintain and expand it. I think we as humans are far more capable and incredible than we give ourselves credit for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply my perspective of course.

       You can only really control yourself, which for the most part is fine. You can find your own inner peace and understanding and hope to be an example for others, and that will work for some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone is the same though, and that, at least in my experience and observations, is where this breaks down. When you are giving people the benefit of the doubt and respecting them as human, they still have their own agency and the potential to have a less empathetic reciprocation of your outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say that is a reason to treat everyone else with the same guarded approach that should be reserved for the pathological few, but it is also worth noting the damage that they can do with that vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgiveness and acceptance that some people don't match our personal ideals can serve as a strength in maintaining our own outlooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a micro and macro view of humanity are very different things. The first is governed by interpersonal communication, while the latter is based on superstition, tribalism, and identity. People who embrace an identity seek to "other" those outside it to validate their own. Some adopt the identity of those around them, where other people will reject it and use cultural relativism as justification to attack their own culture. Ideally people would reject these group identities all together and embrace individualism, but sadly group identity gives people power in numbers and a self-righteous cause to enforce upon the "other"ed identities that are viewed as either opposing them or just in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a very messy thing, and humans are no easier to herd (even to something as truly righteous as enlightenment) than cats. Even when presented with clear the benefits and fully understanding what it takes, people will naturally fall back into their comfortable tribes because it is simply a matter of instinct.

       Yes, I see your point and I know that people prefer to be comfortable than to change, I have seen this in myself many times as well haha :)
      </p>
      <p>
       But humanity is nearing a tipping point. Our technology is becoming more and more advanced, far more than we are responsibly ready for. Our environment is being polluted beyond belief. The human population is rapidly rising. And to top it off, we are being pushed and pushed further into dystopian territory. It's literally now or never. If people don't at least attempt some sort of change now, the future will be very difficult for all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that no matter how much our animalistic tendencies and instincts still govern us, we can transcend them and solidify ourselves as rational beings. Rational beings with heart, with the ability to relate and connect, with the ability to work together against all odds. I have seen people change, I have seen myself change. Change can be slow and usually it is, but in dire need, in a world that has the potential to turn into a hellish dystopia, people might just leap out of the boiling pot and choose a different way. Often it is at the brink of disaster that we change, sometimes we are already over the cliff and change comes only after the dust settles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call me a blind optimist, an idealist, but I think change will come, change for the better, hopefully before more suffering is dished out to this planet and all of us. I choose to not underestimate people and thus also not underestimate myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I am wrong then so be it. But the moment we accept that we are defeated, it's over. The moment we accept that humanity can't change and can't create a better world, it's over. If we choose to believe in defeat we are defeated, but if we see the potential instead of seeing the current mistakes and insanity, we still have a shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       And personally, I'd prefer we have a shot and play to win, instead of giving up what could be moments from crossing the finish line.

       So many people I talk to on a regular basis think that we are "divided". That couldn't be further from the truth. Media has told us all that we're divided therefore people think we are divided. Just because we don't agree on a few things politically does not make us divided. We all wake up, go to work, stores, restaurants, etc. We hold the door open for each other, we let each other into lanes when people have to merge. Basically we are pretty nice to each other even though most of our politics are different. Divided is when people used to see black people and they would not engage because they already see a barier. There are NO BARRIERS today since we have come such a long way. Do not let them convince you otherwise. The media is SCUM and they are profiting by convincing us that we are divided. United we stand.

       I agree, we are far more united than we realize. The divisons are artificial and artificially hyped up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also key to see this truth, acknowledge it and allow it to expand. What we focus on is key and becomes more vivid in our lives and our society. Thus if we focus on the unity that is already there, major change could happen.

       Embrace differences in people.  Do not totally and completely advocate for everyone to be "the same".  Because then every would be the same.  That's not the point to life, its not the point to advocate that everyone act the same even when they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fingerprints don't lie, embrace the difference in life.  Welcome it, and remove the mentality that differences mean that people can't work together.
      </p>
      <p>
       United we stand and divided we fall is true, but it all depends on how you look at it and how you achieve solidarity.

       Oh no, I'm not advocating that at all, you must have misread my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we are different and have different opinions is wonderful. It is important to embrace our diversity and the uniqueness everyone brings to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we want to make a difference and move forward, we should focus on what unites and binds us, we should embrace our differences of opinion and try to find common ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying anyone should change or that we should all be the "same". Far from it. The diversity of our opinions makes us strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But whenever we interact with people, online or offline, whenever we debate,  discuss, whenever we want to make a plan to move forward, it's important to see and realize just how much we actually do have in common, how much actually unites us (and there is plenty, more than people may realize).
      </p>
      <p>
       If we see that, we can work together, find compassion and empathy for each other,  see the other's point of view more clearly and from a perspectice that enhances our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding similarities and commonalities never means giving up your own uniqueness. It is finding that which is shared and making our mutual creation and power to change for the benefit of all that much stronger as a result of it.
