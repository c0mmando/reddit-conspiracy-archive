       It's just there to divide us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sinclair stuff is obvious propaganda, it's completely obvious, it's simply there to cause more divide. Bloomberg a leftwing organization and Sinclair's closest competitor pushed this story, no doubt from orders on high.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were too many up votes, it was pushed on Reddit too hard, also Reddit and other media distributors pretended to censor it too much. Drumming up a Streisand effect for the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious because nothing organic gets that many votes. The Conan stuff is also inorganic, and a common rebuttal for the Sinclair stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure that top comment with the gold is fake too, likely prewritten and upvoted by reddit, bots, and gilded by an alt. No self respecting person would waste $4 on a comment in conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something is too popular be weary, chances are it's popular because the media is pushing it, and not because
       <strong>
        most
       </strong>
       people feel that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It only takes 3 high status individuals to form a consensus despite the validity of the claim they're making. This trick may work on normal people, but I hope the real truth seekers here are more skeptical. The goal is to fracture America, and politics is an easy area to exploit they have the propaganda WMDs to try to fuck our minds into submission. Don't let them win, Star Wars the last jedi sucks and Black Panther was an OK movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the media you consume is owned by a few individuals, the views they put out are their message. Fair and unbiased was a crock of shit, the media has been owned since the days of the printing press. Don't get fooled by high production values and Hollywood slickness, see the truth for what it is. Any time TV tries to portray reality is when it's at it's most dangerous to the average undiscerning person.

       That's what I never understood- how the hell did this become a partisan issue?
       <em>
        All
       </em>
       the news is Corporate Propaganda- CNN, MSNBC, Fox, ABC, NYT, LAT, WaPo...none of them should be trusted. And the "journalists" are better understood as talking heads patronized with their jobs by their Corporate masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone pushing this as a partisan issue is either misguided or in bad faith.

       Have you noticed the number online in this sub right before the Sinclair story hit, during and shortly after? And what the number online is now that the story is old news?
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now 2,800 online. For the Sinclair story, 8-9,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large botnet got settled here right before the video came out to spread and push the story to the top. It is now the most upvoted post in this subs history.

       What? That number of users online is way out of the norm for any day of the week. It was a botnet. Right after that botnet got here the video gets posted and becomes the highest upvoted post in the many years of this subs history. The numbers online are now back to normal, the botnet is gone.

       You compared it to the number of users here right now and linked it to a post talking about the number of users online. I repeat, what time of day was that posted and on what day of the week? Comparing it to that time and that time only is the only valid metric.

       It's at least in part because the stories hit r/all, and because people are often curious how this sub reacts to conspiracy theories when they are proven true. Even though this sub largely ignored Sinclair before now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Really, I think it is suspicious as fuck that the topic of Sinclair was so suppressed here before now. A blatantly biased, hyper-partisan, pro-administration media organization has been quietly buying up local networks, and the executive branch has been quietly bending the rules to allow them to buy up more and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took a video showing the creepy as fuck in-unison propaganda script being read on air by a shit load of different local news networks, and the fucking president of the united states openly promoting Sinclair for people here to pay any fucking attention.

       On the Zionest point: You do realize Obama didn't veto UN condemnation of Israel settlements and cut funding to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-BDS cosponsors on both Senate and House bills have 2 and a half times more Republican signers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican congressman take up the free trip to Israel more frequently than Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there are Democrat supporters of Israel, however the support is clearly not on the same level.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the corporate point I entice you to read about ALEC. Basically corporations and congressman would write laws together. It was exposed and many withdrew afterwards. Guess which political party it was mostly composed of? Hint, it's the same party which just gave corporations a huge tax cut.

       At best you could argue Obama's hands were tied. The conflict in Syria reached it's worst during Obama's years. The two different parties have a different makeup and media has a different spin when the two sides does the exact same thing. Something to consider is that TPTB wants conservatives to look bad to slowly move the younger generations to the left, right into the Agenda 2030 trap.

       The point is both parties have more than enough room to reverse each other's action, yet they don't. You obviously believe otherwise else we wouldn't have this discussion. Both parties has its key selling points and goals but they work together. It's political theater. The real problems are never talked about by design. You should know this.

       If your problem is both parties believe in our monetary system just say so. Saying both parties act the same to corporations and zionism is flat out wrong.

       While the tone of the democratic party on Israel is more a recent change over the last decade, Conservatives have been the party of business for more than a century now.

       That's literally how the parties break down. Republicans are the party of business, hence de-regulation, lower corporate taxes, tarriffs to protect businesses and so on. Even in the past when Republicans made NAFTA and championed global trade it was primary due to the circumstances faviring globalization for corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the Democratic party taxed corporations for Obamacare, lower military spending, champion LGBT rights, make regulations and protect the environment.

       There is a reason inequality in pay started to drop in the end years of Obama's term while the Stock Market boomed during Trumps.

       If you don't like the source there are plenty out there.

      <p>
       For my more frequent trips requires some investigation. The official numbers are not posted. I compared group trips such as the yearly august recess trip. Republicans on average were about double the democrats. On a side note the few documents I could find from the House Ethics Committee showed more often trips for the fewer democrats. A case could be made that that democrats are more feverent supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would take a while to dig up my info again and would need time if you are interested. It's also wise to investigate for yourself and the info is out there.

       The “neo” prefix does not imply “neoconservative”. Neoliberalism is something different.

       Turns out when you spend a year screeching about fake news and manipulation and then get caught for fake news and manipulation, people are inclined to give you a hard time about it.

       I’m talking about Sinclair and the rest of the media in general, not you personally. Of course Sinclair is getting crap. They got caught pushing misinformation with a prepared statement that was complaining about misinformation. On top of that, they are part of a media apparatus which has spent the better part of the last two years complaining about misinformation.
      </p>

       It’s deliciously ironic and hypocritical, so of course people are going to call them out on it. It’s like if PETA got caught running a dog fighting ring.
