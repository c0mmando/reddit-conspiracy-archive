       If the Illuminati or whoever is behind spraying the air to harm us or to control the weather, don't they breathe the same air? How do they not get affected too? Do they have special air filters in their homes and cars? Wouldn't we know about this?

       i just think if we take what their perceived goals are, and then think about how we would do it, spraying a chemical at 30k feet doesnt seem to be high on the list of ideal options

       I have to imagine it wouldn't be anything actually toxic or detectable. Like, something that wouldn't make you sick directly. If it was me, I'd use something that just weakens your immune system for other things. Right before flu season I would increase chemtrails. It wouldn't make you sick but it would help the flu kill you luckily. This way we don't need anything as complicated to give you. We can make sure the elite are taking vitamins and supplements so they stay healthier. I think something like that is the best way to go unnoticed.

       if they had vitamins and supplements that worked id expect them to try to make a billion dollars off selling them to everybody else. make em expensive if you want, i would if i was running that industry

      <p>
       actually i like my budlight idea. most 'elites' wouldnt touch budlight with a 10 foot pole, but they sell it by the ton to the public. so they make profit while pacifying the dummies. seems completely win win.

       It depends on what they are spraying and why.  The issue there is there is much debate even among those who research chemtrails about what is being sprayed and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I know:  Our government, having communicated with aliens, has learned that the motherload of technological information exists in the universal consciousness that many alien races can access, and humans mostly can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out that autistic people can often access that universal consciousness. This is why they are often noncommunicative, but at the same time, super geniuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also turns out that organophosphates can trigger autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also turns out, organophosphates are found in jet fuel. And jet exhaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also turns out, the levels of organophosphates in jet fuel can be manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now you know what they are spraying. And why. The government wants more autistic people so they can gain access to this universal consciousness, and unlock its secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, since adults (and even children) are not nearly as affected by organophosphates as developing fetuses are, they don't care that they breathe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I know too that many people disagree with me on what is being sprayed and why.  But, I know this because I was peripherally involved in a project called Project Caleb (which is not the religious thing you find when you google it, that's just a cover) which ran from the 1970s to the early 1990s, and sought to determine how autistic people communicated telepathically and accessed the universal consciousness.

       Well that certainly explains the spike in Autism which I always wondered about. Seems like the schools are filled with kids with all kinds of disorders and issues on the autism spectrum. It was never like this when I was growing up.

       Absolutely, 100% intentional.  There are many races of aliens that basically share any thoughts they want; a shared or universal consciousness.  It's completely natural to them, and they are almost not understanding of why humans can't.  This is one of the things they attempt to study about us the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out, that autistic people's brains are wire
       <em>
        just enough
       </em>
       differently that they are not disconnected from this universal consciousness the way most "normal" people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just consider a savant who, never having seen a piano before, can just sit down and play beautiful compositions.  How do they do it?  It's not that they have an innate understanding of music expressed via piano, it's that they can truly just access the experiences of people who play the piano well, and they instantly
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       the recall of those experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same is true of anything, really, including physics and weapons.  The government really, really wants access to that information, which is out there, and they think autistic people are the key.

       Interesting theory on chemtrails.  You could definitely be on to something. Makes as much sense, if not more, as some other theories I have heard. The autism angle in regards to this is enlightening as well. I do believe though that we all have access to the universal consciousness you are speaking of. This sounds very much like the Akashic Records that Edgar Cayce ( the sleeping prophet) had access to.

       For decades, I was not a proponent of drugs, such as LSD, DMT, Mushrooms, MDMA, etc.  Knowing MANY people who took such drugs, and being with them when they did, I really thought that such drugs merely fooled you into thinking the experience was profound; that you've experienced some kind of higher plane of consciousness, or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have come to change that opinion over the past couple of years, however.  Our brains are clearly electrical-chemical "devices".  And one way humans can access this universal consciousness is via altering the chemical makeup of our brains.  I do believe now, that "trips" are indeed often taking people to higher planes, to access the universal consciousness on some level.

       Fasting into a ketosis state is the best way. See for yourself, see how people look going into fasting clinics, and how they look going out, its incredible.

       We are being poisoned with heavy metals non-stop it seems. 
Adding heavy metals to food, water, air, vaccines, etc, etc, etc.

       Aluminum is probably one of the most prevalent based on how many different foods and products we come into contact with daily that contains it. Another reason aluminum is most likely one of the main culprets is because of the sudden rise in all of the problems associated with aluminum toxicity - this would include alzheimers, autism, impaired mental ability (why does it seem like people are getting stupider..), Parkinsons, as well as many more problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing people who have access to whatever treatments they would like and have the money to afford them probably undergo a normal chelation routine. There are a few good drugs available to get rid of aluminum that has accumulated in the body yet they only advertise it as an iron chelation agent. If you dig a little more though you will find out that it is very efficient at removing aluminum from the body as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps one of the drugs listed below is one of the methods used to avoid the toxic effects of aluminum?

       That would all depend on what is being sprayed and why. From many of my observations the trails spray in front of the sun and prevent natural light from reaching us. Nice sunny days with clear skies in the morning are usually weirdly covered up muggy days by mid after noon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is with this conspiracy theory and many others is that we cannot say definitively why they are doing what they are doing. What I can say for sure is that when I was young long exhaust trails that stay in the sky for hours and even expand as time passes were not common place and I feel didn't exist at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have watched the trails many times over the past few years and they are long, taking up a huge portion of the sky, they expand and often another plane will fly past it and leave a second trail and they become one larger trail and even appear cloud like.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't appear natural and I never used to see it. I feel something is up.

       Not much no. Sheer volume maybe. But now even if this was a normal byproduct of airline travel it is altering our skies. They regulate car emissions rather strictly. Why not planes then?

       I found it interesting that someone actually took the time to comment on how blue the sky was in this old interview with Eminem from 1999.  So this is 19 years ago. You gotta scroll down a ways to get to the comment.

       That is what the sky used to look like. Even on a clear day now it is never a rich, solid blue like I remember seeing all the time when I was younger.  Just look up old photographs and videos and I think we would all be shocked by the comparisons.

       It might be that the people with what we call Morgellons disease are the ones of us whose bodies are rejecting the inorganic fibers and other stuff falling from the sky. If this stuff is in the air and soil (which some samples show) and we're all breathing it, then we likely all have the Morgellons disease and just don't know it.

       hi, good for you to even be interested, it is all way over my head,i just know i believeit all. I am old enough i never grew up w Chemtrails or even the Pesticides used today. I read a man today who wants to have his forearm removed he was diagnosed w Morgellans. I never studied more than surface to know, i thought it would show in all body parts, but maybe not? End of the day, we have the Elite of the World who will do everything they can to remove us. Look at Bill Gates and his worldwide birth control, controlled starvation , all for a group of evil selfish people.

       I've also heard something a long the lines of a sun shield and it's being used to combat global warming.

      <p>
       If that were the truth then why so much secrecy and denial?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's to combat global warming you'd think they'd come right out and say. However the weather is only more and more messed up nowadays so whatever they say they're doing ain't working. I mean it's April 6th and it has snowed a lot today.

       I have seen this tied in to flat earth before too which I don't particularly buy in but people can research whatever they want.  Maybe there's another reason they wouldn't announce it that ties into that.

       When any new technology is developed, it takes time to optimize it. They very well may have been experimenting with the solar radiation management flavor of chemtrails back in the 80's, in fact, I think it WOULD take a few decades to perfect that type of thing.

       I see contrails, they also sublimate within seconds due to the extreme low Rh here. Never have they been persistent in arid climates.  Breaks solubility curve chemistry if it is water.

       We are entering a solar minimum, the apparent side effects of which is an increase in cloud cover, which they are preventing and eradicating using artificial methods. Its their only way to keep this system stable and running, it cant really be anymore obvious if you think about it from a different perspective; and acknowledge the sources bellow, and also learn to critically observe things from ones own eyes (this helps:

       I'm not sure where I stand on this whole issue.  But just the other day I was walking my dog and noticed a jet flying overhead.  The contrails were around 25-50x the length of the jet and quickly dissipated, just like how I remember from childhood.  The trails were gone a few min after the jet was no longer visible over the horizon.  Other planes that day left trails that lingered and billowed out.  The difference was night and day and I have to assume all those planes were flying at similar enough altitudes that weather conditions shouldn't have made a difference.
      </p>

       It really got me thinking.

       I always thought there were no trails when I was a kid too, but then I started paying attention to movies from back in the 60-70s and I notice them quite often.  Not in the mass amounts that there are now mind you, but def have been going on for a while.  My theory is that not only do they do it to slow the melting of snow it the mountains, they are doing it to create an ultra conductive  atmosphere for a very efficient and reliable internet of things.  Or, if you wanna go really fringe, creating an atmosphere that is livable for other beings.  Lol

       Do you have any movies from the 60's and 70's I can watch and see this in? Genuinely interested. I remember what I call contrails and they were always about an inch long behind the jets and disappear with the path of the jet. It's the ones that stay in the air all day that worry me.

       I agree, I am in California and I watch them all the time.  They tend to start the sprays in the very early morning so by 9am, the trails over the Sierra Nevada are outrageous.  Figure they are trying to save the snow pack at the expense of our health.  One movie I seem to remember was "Rollercoaster"

       Let me predict with absolute certainty..... nothing has changed and nothing will change. There will still be aircraft leaving trails that spread out and merge and cover the sky. That's because they're not chemtrails, and never were. You can plot how long they will persist on a graph if you know the temperature, humidity, and pressure at that point.

        i think the effects can be mitigated with room air filters.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       you just don't want to spend a majority of your day / night breathing "unfiltered" air -- not unlike water.  (drinking unfiltered water our of the tap is risky to your health)
      </p>
      <p>
       and let's face it... only the "elite" really have enough money to buy air filters -- one for every room, mind you... and keep the filters fresh.  that's actually kinda expensive for people who live pay-check-to-pay-check (i.e., like 90% of the country?)
      </p>
      <p>
       for the truly health conscious, i recommend :

       The answer i get is "duh they have underground cities" to which i respond. Don't tptb like viewing sunlight, taking a stroll on the beach or grass or anything else that pleasures a human.

       Outdoors is overrated. If I ever got super rich, I'd happily live in an ivory tower in the skies limiting my contact with "regular people".

       Why do they need to live in a cave to avoid spraying which they know exactly what's being sprayed? They also know the locations  being sprayed. The world is
       <strong>
        HUGE
       </strong>
       , I'm sure they have spots that they don't spray and live in.

       So when all the crust of the earth has been sprayed and is "uninhabitable" by pro chemspray theorists standards. Where will they live? Oh right you said on their islands. But spraying happens on a glabal stratospheric scale according to the theorists. So where on the planet is safe from said chemtrails.

       The rich sit in HVAC pampered interiors, they don't breathe anything that gets dumped outside.
      </p>

       They eat Greenhouse derived food. The chemtrails if they existed for the purposes of dosing the population, they would likely do it over fields of produce destined to go to lower class markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       more likely though, is that the chemtrails would be a weather modification effort, or strategic military benefit, any side effects that hurt the lower class is lucky side effect.

       This was my big argument against chemtrails. But knowing what horrific abuse they inflict to themselves and others, I think they probably don't care, or just offset it with medical care.

       I have wondered this myself.... when it comes to things like putting poison in chemtrails or in our water, everyone uses these things. We all breathe that same air, and even tap water we can avoid at home but if you eat dinner at a restaurant then they prob use tap water for a variety of things. It would make much more sense to make it very easily labeled, so like anything that is "low fat/low sugar" and uses fake fats/sugars is bad for you and should be avoided.... that way someone who has "inside knowledge" just avoids diet coke while those who don't know would drink this diet coke that can actually harm you in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno what the endgame with chemtrails is.... they def exist and have become much more obvious in the past few years so not sure what is going on and why.

       I agree, I am in California and I watch them all the time.  They tend to start the sprays in the very early morning so by 9am, the trails over the Sierra Nevada are outrageous.  Figure they are trying to save the snow pack at the expense of our health.  One movie I seem to remember was "Rollercoaster"
