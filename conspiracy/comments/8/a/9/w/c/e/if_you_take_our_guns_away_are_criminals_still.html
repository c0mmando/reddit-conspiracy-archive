So the criminals are still going to hold on to their guns, their still gonna have them. Their still gonna break in my house and their still gonna shoot me with ‘em. And guess whose gonna be the one that suffers? It’s gonna be me. Well I’m here to tell you tonight, it is not going to happen without a fight! And when I say fight, I don’t mean shots fired, I don’t mean fists thrown. I mean I’m going to come down here to this city council and raise hell, just like these loonies from the left do, until you listen to the majority of the people in this city. And I am the Majority! The Majority of the people in this city are law abiding! And they follow the law, and they want their constitutional rights to be able to Bear Arms!
They want to be able to go to the gun show and buy a hunting rifle or sport rifle. There aren’t military grade weapons sold at the gun show! An AR15 is Not a military grade weapon! Anybody going into combat with an AR15 is a Fool! It’s a semi automatic 22 rifle. You’d be killed in 15 minutes in combat with that thing!

<p>You support &quot;limitations&quot; on our 2nd amendment rights by saying &quot;you can still own a gun to protect your family, just not this one, that one , or any of these because they look scary&quot;.</p>

<p>Limited access to the religions you&#39;re allowed to practice or us saying &quot; sure buddy, you can have free speech, but you can&#39;t say any of the following&quot; is the same thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually for better background checks than outright bans but am not really passionate either way. I don&#39;t think a ban would be the end of the world though.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just sick of hearing people pretend they are coming for <em>all</em> the guns when they <em>might</em> be banning <em>some</em> guns. It&#39;s fear mongering and an over reaction. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The only reason these would be the same thing is because all of these rights will never be taken away from Americans but everyone loves getting all worked up pretending like they are. </p>

<p>As Americans they already have us by the balls as is. They never need to take away any of these &quot;rights&quot; because that would fuck up the good thing they have going. A whole population of slaves thinking they&#39;re free. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about we limit what books you can read?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t have an issue with people committing mass murder with books. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t sit there and act like there is no basis for some people wanting the laws changed. It&#39;s cool if you disagree with that but to pretend the only reason is to &quot;take our guns&quot; is ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, who is making the straw man now?</p>

<p>u/Sluts_Love_Me (nice username BTW) says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You support &quot;limitations&quot; on our 2nd amendment rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you respond with a straw-man</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m actually for better background checks than outright bans</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not dispute the point u/Sluts_Love_Me made.  A background check is unambiguously a limitation on the 2nd amendment.  You may agree or disagree about the reasonableness of that limitation, but this point does not address the issue you are responding to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just sick of hearing people pretend they are coming for all the guns when they might be banning some guns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not what people are saying.  No one is claiming that people are out to ban &quot;all the guns&quot;.  There are very few people with this view.  That does not change the fact that saying &quot;We are not trying to ban your guns&quot; and then literally banning guns, and holding signs that say things like &quot;yes we want to ban your guns&quot; is trying to ban guns.  This is the definition of a straw man -- you are responding to an argument you made, not the argument that is being presented to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#39;t have an issue with people committing mass murder with books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Books is shorthand for speech in this instance, and in fact we do have a long and sordid history of people using speech to incite genocides and mass murders.  Just look at the 20th century for irrefutable proof of this.  Hundreds of millions of people died in the last century due to ideologies.  Your staggering ignorance of recent history is shocking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree obviously. Lot&#39;s of things have changed since the 2nd amendment was adopted. There just needs to be logical unemotional discussion and solution put forward that makes everyone happy. That probably won&#39;t happen though because every citizen at each others throats is really all TPTB want out of this.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I see people in this sub every single day insinuate the end game is to eventually disarm the population. </p>

<p>I never said anything of the sort, never held a sign, never said there would or wouldn&#39;t be a gun ban. My sole point was the right to bear arms will always be intact in America. I truly believe that and in fact support it.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly why it&#39;s foolish to think guns are going to be taken away. Ban &quot;Scary Guns&quot; and you&#39;re still left with Mini-14&#39;s style rifles that can just as easily rapid fire,  .223 at 400 meters. </p>

<p>Everyone has a different opinion on what gun is the best for home defense. Some people say shotguns, even though you&#39;re most likely just going to wound a target. Some say handguns, even though in a face to face situation your heartbeat will be +130 bpm and your accuracy will turn into that of a Hollywood villain. Some say AR-15, because of the low recoil and high ammo capacity. But people say you don&#39;t have the maneuverability with a long rifle. </p>

<p>Because if you ban one of these categories of firearms, there&#39;s still two &quot;strong&quot; home defense tools to choose from. </p>

<p>There&#39;s literally no way America will ban all guns. Too many people who have them, too many criminals who have them, and too much money to be made manufacturing and lobbying for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They won&#39;t ban all guns but they&#39;ll try one category at a time. You&#39;re right about an ar-15 being a great gun if it we&#39;re a little more manueverable. That&#39;s why it&#39;s ridiculous to ban short barreled rifles. The bad guys aren&#39;t gonna have any problem dropping a short barrel onto an ar-15 if they are already in the state of mind to commit multiple felonies. The legal gun ownership defending hiss family will certainly be deterred from doing the same in an attempt to provide his family with the best defense possible.</p>

<p>FTFY </p>

<p>Rifles don&#39;t win rebellions. I&#39;d like to be wrong, please show me where any rebellion wasn&#39;t supplied with Mortars, Artillery, missiles, improvised explosives, or any other form of bombs from an outside force. I think the Bolshevik revolution was just rifles but I could be wrong. </p>

<p>To win a revolution, you need help from an outside faction. IRA was internally supplied (I think) and that didn&#39;t go so well. Vietcong, French Resistance (WWII), taliban, al quaeda, ISIS, were all supplied by an established faction with weapons, ammo, bombs and rockets to get them to be able to fight.  </p>

<p>You could argue that homemade explosives would do the trick but my main argument is that a revolution needs outside support. </p>

<p>Not trying to be snarky, but I really like discussing the possibility of revolution. Cuz I don&#39;t know how it would be possible without resorting to tactics like ISIS. </p>

<p>Perhaps, but without rifles, all the artillery and explosives in the will won&#39;t help you. The ability to engage your enemy individually at distance is the key to any offensive or defensive military and guerilla conflict. </p>

<p>In the US, any insurrection&#39;s success would be dictated by the actions of the miltary and whether they were willing to fight civilians. </p>

<p>When was the last time you got shot? Or are you just a melodramatic coward?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>In 1982, the British fought the Argentinians on the Falkland Islands. At that time the Argentinians were armed with the FN-FAL. The British Army service rifle was a variant of the FN-FAL called the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle.</p>

<p>The two rifles were identical in every way, except the SLR was semi-automatic only, while the original FAL was capable of fully automatic fire.</p>

<p>Guess who won that war? Hint: it wasn&#39;t the guys carrying fully automatic rifles... it was the guys with superior training and tactics.</p>

<p>Even when the service rifle has fully automatic fire capability, modern armies are trained to use semi-automatic fire predominantly because there are very few occasions where spraying rounds is a benefit to a soldier. Aimed rapid fire semi-auto shots are much more likely to hit a target than &quot;spraying and praying&quot;.</p>

<p>Full-auto fire is good for keeping heads down (suppression), but semi-auto is much better for killing the enemy.</p>

<p>Yes and no. AR platform obviously comes in various calibers, not just .22, but it still isn&#39;t a &quot;military grade&quot; weapon any more than any other civilian-legal rifle made. </p>

<p>WWI was primarily fought with single action rifles, but you&#39;d be laughed down for describing a Mosin Nagant as &quot;military grade&quot;. It&#39;s certainly deadly in the right circumstances, it&#39;s a great gun, but that&#39;s where the similarities end.</p>

<p>Do you know how difficult it is to repeal an amendment?  In a Congress with a Republican majority?  The main legislation people are asking for is to repeal the gun show loophole and add universal background checks.  You&#39;re trying to polarize the discussion to make it a black and white issue when the real point is America believes in sensible gun control and doesnt want to repeal the 2nd amendment.</p>

<p>Like I also said earlier, the argument would also imply that any regulation of voting is an incremental battle to repeal the right to vote.  It&#39;s not a black and white issue and to continue to paint in such a way is just another way to divide us instead of solve actual problems.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Repealing the 2nd amendment wasnt even talked about until the Miami school shooting.  It&#39;s a response to a LACK OF ACTION on sensible gun control.</p>

<p>Those who believe in gun control do not believe in banning all guns.  The fact remains a majority of America believes in sensible gun control like universal background checks and closing the gun show loophole.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with gun laws in America is a LACK OF FEDERAL STANDARDS which create loopholes because guns are regulated on a state by state basis.  The creation of federal standards, by Congress, would address the problem areas such as crazy whackjobs buying guns totally legally and using them in mass shootings.  It would also close down the gunshow loophole which is the primary avenue for unregulated 3rd party sales, contributing to the handgun problem.  Of course, you wont solve the violent crime problem in major metropolitan areas without addressing the underlying poverty problem causing people to turn to crime in order to feed their families.</p>

<p>The fact is gun control is not a black and white issue.  Those people who believe in gun control dont believe in taking away the right to own guns otherwise theyd want to repeal the 2nd amendment.  It is guys like you who keep painting this issue in black and white terms and refuse to have a rational conversation about the ways people are getting legally acquired guns and using them in mass shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that is precisely the point!  Criminals and those who do not value human life do not change based on a law, do they?  So what happens if the people who legally have guns i.e. the police or sheriff&#39;s dept. are sent to defend you against that murderer and you get a sheriff Israel who gives a stand down order?  What is the response time even if not told to stage the perimeter?  Maybe 7 min. if directly in town and of course based upon proximity to a given officer on patrol.  Do you really want to put Your protection, the protection of your family solely in their hands?  I wouldn&#39;t, the criminal is not going to say, &quot;here&#39;s the white flag until the authorities arrive.  I&#39;ll just wait over here so we can make it a fair fight!&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I don&#39;t want to take away your guns. No one on the left I&#39;ve ever talked to wants to talk away your guns. The people screaming take their guns are just the loud minority. They are not worth listening to.</p>

<p>However, we run into a problem in this country. We can&#39;t even talk about gun control without people getting all up in arms...like this post. This post is funny to me, because the whole idea of a criminal is that they don&#39;t follow the law. So to say criminals will still have guns......no shit, it&#39;s in the definition of the word criminal.</p>

<p>My two cents: I don&#39;t want to take some guns away from all people, I want to take all guns away from some people. We have a serious mental health issue in this country that no one wants to talk about. And until we can realize that, and start correcting it, this cycle of shootings will continue. And they will all be done by males. </p>

<p>What is happening to men in our society that caused this outcome?</p>

<p>We need to have an honest discussion. I would prefer not needing to ban types of weapons and I think other measures (intensive background checks, longer waits, training...etc) should be prioritized but good lord, it’s impossible to have that discussion without a bunch of bs talking points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah-- everyone replies the exact same way when I say that repeated patterns from the left have been &quot;put toe in door... wait... crank door open further... wait... ban all guns.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s just a fact of life.  No leftist right now can be trusted that &quot;common sense gun control&quot; isn&#39;t just a stepping stone to &quot;total ban.&quot;  It&#39;s impossible.  The situation since parkland has only thrown it into stark relief-- that started out with &quot;we need to be reasonable&quot; and now it&#39;s on to banning.</p>

<p>So... clean up the left.  We on the gun side have argued in good faith for decades-- we&#39;re pretty dumb, it took a lot before we learned.  But now that we&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s going to be at least as long a journey for the left to get back a reputation for honesty as it was squandering it.</p>

<p>I definitely do not agree that guns should be banned, but I will say that part of way some are calling for ARs to be banned or whatever is because we are not able to discuss any other control measures. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t come to the table to discuss problems, the steps seen as necessary are going to become more extreme. </p>

First introduced in 1996, the legislation didn&#39;t ban gun investigations explicitly (it forbade the use of federal dollars in the advocacy or promotion of gun control), but Congress that year also cut the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the exact amount it had previously devoted to firearm research”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-if-the-cdc-could-fund-gun-research/">https://www.wired.com/story/what-if-the-cdc-could-fund-gun-research/</a></p>

<p>“The legislation didn&#39;t explicitly ban gun research, but funding cuts reduced it by 90 percent, according to Dr. Mark Rosenberg, the former director of the CDC&#39;s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. The NRA was motivated to support the amendment after a landmark 1993 study that concluded that having a gun in the home was more dangerous than not having one.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed!  Sadly, they are not using the gun laws already in effect.  It was shown during the Texas shooting in the church and at this latest school shooting.  The shooter in Texas was never supposed to have access to guns.  How did he fall through the FBI&#39;s gun checks?   Perhaps those illegally obtaining them have no need to abide by the law.  Are the already established laws failing? If so, how are creating more laws, which the criminals get around, going to help?  With this only hinder law abiding citizens from protecting themselves against the criminals? </p>

<p>The alleged shooter at Parkland was reported to local authorities at least 39 times and had been reported to the FBI who did nothing.  They were aware of the threat.  He was not to have weapons, yet there was not a consequence.  It&#39;s the same story.  Criminals who want to obtain weapons in the form of guns, will always figure out a way.  </p>

<p>The question becomes why is that?  Why do the &quot;powers that be&quot; want to disarm the general public, yet they are aware criminals are equipped with a steady supply?  Who is supplying them?  Is it profitable for the same groups orchestrating and organizing for more gun bans, to readily supply criminals?  Does it help with their agenda of a controlled public?  Will it aide them in decreasing the population or ridding it of those who don&#39;t easily submit or succumb to their control?</p>

<p>I agree with you, it is used as a method to divide.  This plays right into the controllers&#39; hands.  The challenge becomes getting people to think for themselves and see the holes not only in the narrative of the event, but also the major flaws in their solution.  Take all the guns away, who still has access?  It has been proven in Chicago and Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying that.  There are some people that either can&#39;t handle or don&#39;t like the recoil from a 12 gauge shotgun.  And with handguns, some people have real trouble with accuracy.  The AR-15 and similar platforms provides easy to handle recoil and accuracy as well as the customizability to fit it to your specific needs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The school shooting would not have occurred if the local authorities called about Cruz&#39;s issues 39 times and the FBI would have followed the gun laws already in place.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t intend to ignore your statement.  I just wasn&#39;t sure where you were going with the whole, &quot;except to shoot up schools.&quot;  This was Robinson&#39;s speech.  I do agree with him as the AR15 is not an assault rifle. You may already know this, but it stands for ArmaLite.  As far as shooting up the school, this could have been accomplished with any weapon.   </p>

<p>As far as to the holes in the story or the narrative being pushed that I chose to address. . .clearly people have to look at the event, what took place during, around and prior to that event.  You must look at it as a whole and all the components and people involved.  You can&#39;t just pick out one angle, tool or alleged culprit and say, &quot;ban the Ar15&#39;s because that&#39;s what was used in this shooting and other shooting!&quot;  If we do, won&#39;t the next triggered school shooter simply pick a different gun?  Yes, because they have more access. . .they do not live within the parameters of the law; therefore, they won&#39;t just say, &quot;darn, I guess I&#39;ll give up on my goal of shooting up a school because they have banned the weapon of choice I&#39;ve heard so much about on the &quot;tell a vision box&quot; and here I featured it on my &quot;kill bullies&quot; vision board, dream over!&quot;  No, you and I both know they will find another gun, what MSM won&#39;t tell you is it will likely be one that may have a higher capacity magazine than what was used in the shooting.  Did they say in their findings where they were trying to pin it on Cruz what size magazine was used?  Some states limit the drum to 10 or 15 rounds, but they do make them available to hold far more rounds.  </p>

<p>Once again, ban high capacity magazines, are they still out there somewhere available to the criminal element?  Won&#39;t they just build their own weapon?  Now, should the average law abiding citizen have a right to protect against that?</p>

<p>The AR15 is lightweight, accurate and has a low recoil.  Should we ban all guns that fit this description?  Should we ban all semi-automatics? 
If we do will criminals still have access?  They are also customizable.  Should we ban all guns with add ons?  What if some of the criminals continue to add on?  There are far more powerful rifles on the market, so what happens when a different weapon starts getting so much attention and being used?  </p>

<p>Still not sure why some of these vehicles that have been used to mow people down haven&#39;t been banned.  When does that injustice end?  I believe people realized that law abiding citizens were not using cars or vehicles as weapons, but rather it was the person driving the car at fault who clearly doesn&#39;t value life.  The car, or in this instance the gun isn&#39;t making that life altering decision, it is the end user.  </p>

<p>Same with the AR15!  BTW it was reported a shooter identified by at least one of the victims was in full swat gear.  This means they would have had access to an array of weapons/arsenal as most criminals do.  Also odd how they had a drill just that morning.  Some very interesting aspects and details surround this shooting, which those opposed never answer, nor seem willing to debate.  But I am definitely game, I simply can&#39;t dismiss details that relate directly in favor of the MSM&#39;s singular focus. . . &quot;The Gun, the Gun.  Guns are bad!  No more misery and mass deaths if we just ban them!&quot;  </p>

<p>Why zero focus on the at risk teen it was pinned on, and no apparent culpability from the array of people including law enforcement and FBI gun checks that failed him and the victims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK if you can, take a step back and look at it from the other side&#39;s perspective.  I know, I know they don&#39;t try to see yours, but lets be the adults here.</p>

<p>From everything I&#39;ve read and seen posted about the AR15 it seems like it&#39;s not really hunting rifle.  There would be better options for home defense.</p>

<p>I can see people coming to the conclusion that this weapon is basically a poor man&#39;s version of a military weapon.  It has little other purpose than being able to fire a lot of rounds in a very short period of time, be more accurate than a pistol at moderate ranges say 20-100 or so yards.</p>

<p>Honestly if you were to design a weapon for mass shootings with the caveat that it can&#39;t be fully automatic, you&#39;d come up with something like the AR15.</p>

<p>If you want to make headway in convincing on the fence types to come around to your way of thinking, I&#39;d say defending this gun is probably not helping your case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that is precisely the point!  Criminals and those who do not value human life do not change based on a law, do they?  So what happens if the people who legally have guns i.e. the police or sheriff&#39;s dept. are sent to defend you against that murderer and you get a sheriff Israel who gives a stand down order?  What is the response time even if not told to stage the perimeter?  Maybe 7 min. if directly in town and of course based upon proximity to a given officer on patrol.  Do you really want to put Your protection, the protection of your family solely in their hands?

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I don&#39;t want to take away your guns. No one on the left I&#39;ve ever talked to wants to talk away your guns. The people screaming take their guns are just the loud minority. They are not worth listening to.</p>

<p>However, we run into a problem in this country. We can&#39;t even talk about gun control without people getting all up in arms...like this post. This post is funny to me, because the whole idea of a criminal is that they don&#39;t follow the law. So to say criminals will still have guns......no shit, it&#39;s in the definition of the word criminal.</p>

<p>My two cents: I don&#39;t want to take some guns away from all people, I want to take all guns away from some people. We have a serious mental health issue in this country that no one wants to talk about. And until we can realize that, and start correcting it, this cycle of shootings will continue. And they will all be done by males. </p>

<p>What is happening to men in our society that caused this outcome?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it false that in spite of all the gun control laws and checks criminals are still obtaining weapons?  Is it true that the recent Texas church shooter wasn&#39;t supposed to have access to guns due to the gun checks, but the FBI dropped the ball?  Is it true that Cruz was reported to local authorities at least 39 times and 2 known times to the FBI, yet somehow still obtained guns according to them? So has it been proven criminals will always have guns in spite of the gun control laws already in place, apparently not affecting the criminal element?  Do you want to count on a sheriff Israel being the one who is called out to your place when a criminal who does indeed have a gun breaks into your home?  Do you want to bank on him not giving a stand down order?  I don&#39;t, but you do have that right if you wish it for yourself.  People who have been given the right to protect themselves simply want the law upheld!  Criminals pay no attention to laws!</p>
