       Hardly possible, because we're all either British or American.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, (since it was me who stickied the current post calling into question the UK government's narrative on the Salisbury poisonings) I am British. I have no Russian ancestry, I don't speak Russian, never been to Russia, no financial relationship with any organisation connected to, or acting on behalf of Russia. Can I be any more unequivocal?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, many of my posts on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       have been critical of the British government. You're obviously new here because anyone who contributes regularly to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       who believes their own government is immune from criticism doesn't understand what this sub is really about. And in the case of the Salisbury poisonings, I would add that my position is in no sense "pro-Russian" - I am essentially criticising the UK government for attributing blame for these poisonings without having to hand the evidence to back up their accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       As this fiasco has unravelled, it is has become clear that Theresa May and Boris Johnson have made a monumental cock-up. They went all-in with their flimsy narrative of Russian state involvement without considering what would happen if the anyone demanded to see the evidence - because they clearly, and embarrassingly, don't have any.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make matters worse, there was no diplomatic fall-back position in case things went wrong. The UK government is now horribly exposed, with no way of back-tracking without loss of face. This shit-show has been one of the most inept displays of international diplomacy by a British government in my lifetime, and as a Brit, I expect better from my government.

       Not so sure about that. We are still going after Syria. Trump was all on board the Russia hacking train. He levied sanctions against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it was discovered that the majority of Russian hacking was in favor of Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate I would be delighted if Trump was indeed a Russian puppet.

       They had to impose the sanctions for optics and it most likely didn't stem from Trump himself. I highly doubt Trump even understands the full dynamic of what's going on in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       The office really is above Trump. He doesn't have the capacity or desire to understand the global power dynamic or even basic civics. He's an empty suit. His divisiveness alone is exactly why he's there and you bet your ass Putin loves to see the American public at each others throats.

       You seem to have a reading comprehension problem. I just said the divisiveness is why he's there. TPTB want us at each others throats. There is a dark manipulative hand at work to divide and Trump is the biggest tool in their arsenal along social media right now.

       That's not an answer... that's a dodge.

       Democrats do not like his policies, but they never like Republican policies... that's why they're Democrats. So what has Trump done that Bush Jnr, Bush Snr or Reagan didn't do?

       Caitlin Johnstone makes short work of these "Trump is a Putin Puppet" marginals. Caity sez: Whenever I point out that the Trump administration is being vastly more hawkish toward Russia than Obama was, I get a bunch of Russiagaters arguing that Trump did collude, but then the relationship went south. Which always reminds me of this Python gag:

       Putin must be behind Amazon trying to get a dedicated listening device in every home. I'm pretty sure he also was behind Mueller's intentional hindering of the 9/11 investigation. Putin is a sly fucking Fox, and everything I don't like can be pinned on him now.

       you're soaking in it? Pretty negative reaction to anything anti Russian in this thread so far. One of the users literally said "I'm more pro Russian than I am American at this point".

       I'm being completely honest. If you don't believe it, that's up to you. These things have happened to me here. The mods have a private sub to discuss "problem users". Look at some of the mod activity here by clicking on their accounts. Some are literally comment removal machines. Not saying all the mods have an agenda but a handful most certainly do and it's painfully obvious.

       How so? I'm not bullshitting you about being buried by pro Russia users here. It's overwhelming at times.

      <p>
       There is all kinds of brigading that goes on here depending on different factors. For example when the subs visitors recently shot up to around 9,000 for a few days. That imo was probably due to an influx of users from TMOR that got involved in some inter sub spat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, as another example. Look at any gun discussion thread. Always brigaded by libertarians that
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       to argue until the cows come home on that topic. Some of which probably don't visit conspiracy on the regular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it so hard to believe that during one of the biggest actual political conspiracies in the history of the United States there would be operatives online trying to muddy the waters?

       See, this is a dishonest statement.  It obviously is
       <em>

       holding you back from spouting stuff non-stop.  How does it overwhelm you exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say ONE look at the politics sub tells you where the conspiracy really lies, and I would suggest that you go there if the "alternate" view bothers you so much on Russia.  I'll tell ya what, I'm not pro-Russia or anti-Russia, but if don't think Russia is the devil on the politics sub, you will get downvoted into oblivion.
       <br/>
       In essence, a constant brigade.  That's far weirder than a "handful of moderators" out of what, 22, that bother you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the gist of it.  You really don't have a consistent message, it's just casting aspersion on everything about this sub...

       As an American the system isn't perfect, far from it. But it's worked for 240 years. It's also the system I've bought into and have to live under as long as I stay here so yeah, I will trust a proven 240 old decent system with major flaws over burning the whole fucking thing to the ground.

       I trust Russians more than anyone in this crazy world.  At least they're not killing innocent people in Syria and turning their backs as Israel snipers pick off little Palestinians kids.  The NWO is true evil and I would only hope that there are Russians in here who are interested in an alternate future from what we are headed for right now.

       Whether some mods are actually Russian I don't know and don't really think it matters. What does matter is a huge pro Russian presence on this sub that is very aggressive and breaks rules in order to goad people with the "wrong" opinion into breaking the rules in order to ban them. You wouldn't realize that if you have the same pro Russian opinion.

       That confirms nothing about the Trump/Russia hysteria. Trump is a dick. The Russians are being scapegoated by those who wish to make war against Russia. This subreddit is the only place where anti-Russia propaganda can be debunked without being buried by the usual suspects.

       you could make an argument for which came first. while i know there has been some form of currency throughout civilization on the whole, the wealthy families were still beholden to their culturally specific regions, before govt, there were religious orders. For example, the pharoahs were seen as Gods, not in regards to the jewels we dug out of the soil to lay at their feet, but because of the knowledge they squirreled away and the political integration of aforementioned familial lines into Rome. The lineages through time have acquired their wealth by being able to manipulate the power systems. Their wealth can pay the people to move the mountains, but it can't actually lift them itself. I'd rather be Baelish than Jamie, is what I'm saying.

       its a symbiotic relationship, power brings you money, money brings you power, and they build together.

       look at lebron james, born with insane physical gifts that made him powerful, leveraged that into money, further improved his body, makes more money

       I’ve been critical of the mods plenty here, but I’m going to quibble with your point a little. Both the posts have been well sourced and relevant, and thus I do feel belong as stickies. I do wish we had seen so more conspiracies go up as stickies during this time, no just these, but I don’t really have a problem with them as much as the lack of diversity in content of the stickies over the last 3 weeks.

       Good! If I ran Reddit, I'd require at least one Russian mod on all political subs. Orwell said "in times of Universal Deceipt, telling the Truth is a Revolutionary Act."
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why we need more Russian involved in online discussions, because the poles have reversed and now America has become an EMPIRE of LIES, and Russian's are the oppressed underdogs who're telling the Truth, only few of us can see it.

       They had to impose the sanctions for optics and it most likely didn't stem from Trump himself. I highly doubt Trump even understands the full dynamic of what's going on in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       The office really is above Trump. He doesn't have the capacity or desire to understand the global power dynamic or even basic civics. He's an empty suit. His divisiveness alone is exactly why he's there and you bet your ass Putin loves to see the American public at each others throats.
