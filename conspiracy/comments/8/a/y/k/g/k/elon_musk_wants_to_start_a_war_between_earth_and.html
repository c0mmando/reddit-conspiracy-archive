       I'm pretty sure that Elon wants to start an intergalactic war between the 2 most popular planets. But how will he start this war? How will he fight it? Well, it won't be for another couple of decades. First he has to establish a Martian currency. He has a lot of experience in that field, as he created Pay Pal. Imagine the amount of war bonds he will sell to the Martians! But how will the Martians get around Mars to fight the war? That's right, Trains and Tesla. That's why Elon is super into vehicles, he wants a way to transport his troops to the front lines as fast as possible. This is why Elon wants to get to Mars as fast as possible. Yet you may be asking yourself, what will they fight with? Yup! You got it! Flamethrowers. We need to stop this maniac before he gets to Mars and eliminates all life on Earth. This is why we need to fight for the right to keep our second amendment. We need guns to kill this South African colonizer. Cut off his funds, and #BOYCOTTESLA

       Yeah, when this charlatan tells you we are going to Mars in the next two years you know something is going to happen before then.  We aren't going to fucking Mars on the back of this patsy.  Before we end up on Mars there will be Blue Beam or a market crash that allows Musk to back away from his promises.  SpaceX is a government backed money grab, nothing more.

       Also, this wasn't about the motivation of the attacker, 9/11 Truthers put up ridiculous claims about the collapse. The freefall speed thing, the thermite thing. WTC 7, etc. That's what I have a problem with. Steelbeams don't melt. Yes, they don't. They don't need to. It's enough to weaken them.

       There are theories regarding 9/11 being done with hologram planes, DEWs (directed energy weapons), with no one actually dying.  Just saying I don’t subscribe to that nonsense.  Thank you for clarifying your stance.  Are you aware the engineers who built those towers said they were built to withstand multiple plane impacts?  A plane hit the Empire State Building a few decades back but it didn’t collapse.  Have you considered eyewitness testimony, including from firefighters on-scene which said they heard what sounded like multiple charges exploding right before the collapses?  Have you considered that building 7 was “pulled,” meaning professionally demolished with charges which cut through steel shortly after the towers fell?  Are you aware that the process for doing such a tedious job requires a week or two, at least of planning and prep work?  Are you aware that you believe the mainstream narrative?

      <p>
       You don't need multiple impacts, you just need one if you're unlucky. It wasn't the impact itself that brought the towers down, although the weakening of the structure certainly helped. It was the fact that the crash blew the fireproof coating from the exposed steel beams. The fire did the rest weakening the beams until they couldn't hold the floors above them anymore.

       Afaik that was a returning B52 Bomber, a much smaller plane, flying very slow with barely any fuel left. Two completely different scenarios.

       "Have you considered eyewitness testimony, including from firefighters on-scene which said they heard what sounded like multiple charges exploding right before the collapses?"

      <p>
       Many things can explode, or sound like explosions, gas tanks for example, monitors, etc, this isn't evidence of an explosion through explosives, which would leave traces.

       " Have you considered that building 7 was “pulled,” meaning professionally demolished with charges which cut through steel shortly after the towers fell?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You're either willfully or out of ignorance putting things out of context. It was the fire fighters who got pulled, they where told to retreat as the building visibly buckled and moved, evidence that a collapse was imminent.
