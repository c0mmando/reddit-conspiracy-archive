       I don’t think it does. I think Brahe had it right. I think it’s a ridiculous thought to think we are flying through space and yet our stars never change cause they are just sooooo far. Believe what you want but don’t be scared to poke around. You may also find many other things and people (Einstein) were just flat out wrong.

       And further from THE SUN OUR SOURCE OF HEAT.  I don’t know that it’s 66.6 degrees.  It could be 65.6 degrees.  Would that make you see reason?  That being on the opposite side of the sun in the curve of an ELLIPTICAL orbit is a good theory, at least, for why the stars are different then AND the weather is cooler?  You don’t see the logic in that?

       The Earth's elliptical orbit doesn't have anything to do with the difference in temperature between seasons. If winter was caused by being at the focal point of an elliptical orbit, you'd have two winters per year (one for each vertex) and both the north and the south hemisphere would have winter at the same time (as the difference in distance due to axis tilt is negligible compared to orbit eccentricity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Seasons are cause by the Earth's axis being tilted, leading to differences in how many hours of daylight each hemisphere gets and differences in the angle of incidence of sunlight with that hemisphere.

       On a guttural level, it seems to make more sense because we are so used to dealing with convection rather than radiation. Our heat sources transfer their energy into the atmosphere and then that heated air has to make its way all the way over to us for us to get warmth, that whole process is relatively inefficient, so energy drops off quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In space, there is close to nothing to interact with, so the difference between perihelion and aphelion doesn't cause a large drop-off in energy, and it helps that Earth's orbit is one of the most circular in the solar system. The solar irradiance outside Earth's atmosphere only fluctuates about +/- 3% from the mean throughout Earth's orbit, whereas in the middle of the U.S. the difference in angle of the sun and the difference in how long the sun is in the sky contributes to a +/- 20% difference in irradiance.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's actually really cool is that the northern hemisphere has it's summer during the time when the Earth is the farthest away from the sun and the southern hemisphere experiences summer when the Earth is at its perihelion; yet, on average, the northern hemisphere's summer is significantly hotter than the south's.

But in fact many of the stellar positions in his star catalogues were less accurate than that. The median errors for the stellar positions in his final published catalog were about 1'.5, indicating that only half of the entries were more accurate than that, with an overall mean error in each coordinate of around 2'.[66] Although the stellar observations as recorded in his observational logs were more accurate, varying from 32.3" to 48.8" for different instruments,[67] systematic errors of as much as 3' were introduced into some of the stellar positions Tycho published in his star catalog — due for instance, to his application of an erroneous ancient value of parallax and his neglect of polestar refraction.[68] Incorrect transcription in the final published star catalogue, by scribes in Brahe's employ, was the source of even larger errors, sometimes by many degrees.

       Your using a weird definition to get anywhere near 66.6 degrees, right? The tilt is currently 23.5 degrees  and 90-23.5=66.5, so I’m assuming that where you got your weird number.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this tilt changes, over the course of several thousands of years the tilt oscillates a couple degrees.

       After reading through your comments I think I see what’s giving you a hard time. First I want to point out that this particular flat earth postulate is the only one that I have ever heard of that made me think ‘yea, I can see why people would think that or have a hard time understanding’.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble seems to be that the magnitudes of scale are impossible to grasp intuitively. However you already know that and don’t find it sufficient, so I’m not sure what to tell you. It is however commonly accepted that the Dinosaurs did not see the same sky that we do, the constellations were different. That was MILLIONS of years ago, while the pyramids (which were built to align with some constellations) were merely built THOUSANDS of years ago. Even within those thousands of years though, the stars have shifted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Betelgeuse is 650+ Ly away, it could have burned out around the time of Columbus and we would still see it. Magnitudes of scale really do screw with your mind,  I would suggest running through the actual math a few times to convince yourself.

       Mars and other planets exterior to Earth appear to move backward in their motion as a perspective effect when Earth passes them at its closest approach. It’s called retrograde motion. It’s equivalent to a car you pass on the highway appearing from your perspective to be moving backwards even though you are both moving forward. But if you assume that earth is statuonary, you are required to explain that weird notion of the planets by positing ridiculous orbital paths wherein they travel in many small loops as they orbit around the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don’t know Ptolemy or what retrograde motion is you probably are jumping the gun a bit with your username just fyi.

       You mean the model that was proved false?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In regards to the stars, Tycho also believed that if the Earth orbited the Sun annually there should be an observable stellar parallax over any period of six months, during which the angular orientation of a given star would change thanks to Earth's changing position (this parallax does exist, but is so small it was not detected until 1838, when Friedrich Bessel discovered a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of the star 61 Cygni[9]).

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Tycho himself stated that if the earth orbits the sun parallax motion would be observed. If parallax motion was observed
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       theory would be falsified.

       The fact than any stars at all have parallax means that the Earth revolves around the Sun. Otherwise parallax
       <em>
        would not work
       </em>
       . Also, no observed parallax does not equal no parallax. More distant stars will have smaller parallax and there are instrumentation limitations on detecting such small changes. (I’m sure you don’t know what the diffraction limit is but it comes into play here.) Also your 50% stat is bullshit because there is no complete parallax survey of every star and it’s always possible to define a sample where 50% have no measured parallax by simply populating that sample with more distant faint stars.

       So congrats on not rising to the challenge I posed to you over in another comment! Go back, dust off your JUCO textbooks and actually break their spine for once will you?

       If you don’t even know enough about basic astronomy’s that you didn’t know what retrograde motion was until I just told you now, then you are not qualified to even make an assessment of the worth of any of that bullshit you linked.

       Someone who has encountered a gish gallop. I literally work with data from satellites daily. I’ve met the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute and a current ISS flight director. And I’ve actually been to the Southern Hemisphere and seen that stars there revolve around the Southern celestial pole. The earth isn’t flat and NASA does real things. I don’t need to go line by line and disprove a bunch of nonsense from idiots who don’t even know enough to to know how uninformed they are.

       How about this then. You’ve given me a slew of BS to look at. Let me give you one thing to mull over that supports the accepted picture of astronomy. Just one. And if you can actually address it, and if you are right you should be able to, then we can talk about me maybe taking a look at your flat earth bullshit sources. Sounds pretty fair right?

       There are few real flat earthers and they don't come around here much. Mostly because people provide proof like this.

      <p>
       In my opinion FE was invented by the cia to discredit conspiracy theorists and some people actually believed it for whatever twisted reasons. Anyways if I had said just last week that Google writes the code for ai drones, my friends would laugh and ask if I believed in flat earth too. This is how tptb stop us from spreading non government approved narratives.

       From the Biblical idea which spawned science itself: “If our God is a rational one, then His creation is also rational, and, therefore, able to be studied and understood.”  What about Flat Earth is rational?  The required answers to questions easily solved by heliocentrism and “round-Earth” are not answered by Flat Earth.    Yet, here you are.

       Lots of cultures realized that the world was round. I'm not sure if it was general knowledge throughout cultures or if it was rediscovered repeatedly when civilizations got advanced enough. We're talking at least as far back as greeks and possibly much further back. I think there was a little bit of history embellishment- like in the case of Columbus. It was very well known that the world was round then but it sounds better when he was the wise one and everyone else was stupid and believed the world was flat. I think that this was used as an insult for a long time before the CIA used it. For instance: oh those
       <em>
        blank
       </em>
       they are so primitive they still think the world is flat! Or, look at how smart we are compared to X group who treat diseases with magic and think the world is flat!
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA brought it back for whatever reasons and its worked just as well for them to discredit the conspiracy crowd. Personally I don't try to fight the believers but I appreciate when people are on the fence and I try to help out how I can. I think everyone should look into it and come to their own conclusions- to me it seems like a nice little training exercise in free thinking. I know for some they see through it instantly and assume the rest of the conspiracies are just as bad- which is probably the point. To stop people from looking deeper or to keep them fighting with the believers instead of looking at more important things.

       We don’t know everything. Nobody on this earth knows everything. There’s been places in space where physics have bizarro which would question everything we know. There are principles in life that we have not evolved to understand. So stop with this flat earth shit. Flat earthers will believe what they want to believe. It doesn’t matter what you think about the shape of the earth. It just matters that do what you want to do.

       All of it. It’s akin to a group working on a puzzle. Most people will just walk by if they aren’t interested. Others will stop and help. But with FE and PG there where dozens of accounts just being snarky and condescending. I don’t think that is an organic response to something. There seems to be a need to fuck with the puzzle people are working on when it comes to certain topics

       There are some people who really tune into the flat earth bashing. These people are absolute mouth breathers but it's Interesting because this segment of the population doesn't have any crazy beliefs or ideas, just all straight Indoctrination. It surprised me to see just how many people fall into that category. Totally dedicated to this theory that they know very little about. Those people almost worry me more than any kind of controlled opposition or whatever.

       that's a really disingenuous analogy. People spouting Flat Earth don't have the humility of the image someone working on a puzzle invokes, they've got it all figured out and everyone else is just 'indoctrinated sheep' according to those I've talked to. Nothing to 'figure out', everything from NASA is a lie and the Bible says the Earth has a firmament so it's true! Who cares if it's impossible since the whole earth would see the same constellations at night. Just More NASA lies, because NASA has nothing better to do... lol.

       It's less a group of honest puzzle solvers and more a group of people shouting nonsense with their ears clasped shut and hands covering their eyes and ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people spout nonsense, guess what it's going to annoy the people around them, it's true as in the world as it is in an Internet forum. Only difference is online people don't have to put up with your shit to get along, and well let you know right away if they think an idea is retarded.

       Please don't think I'm trying to be argumentive saying this, just curious about your opinion, but saying that, do you believe space is actually not real, or just that NASA fakes a lot of their research?

       If it's the former, what's your opinion on the soviet union space program, whom were responsible for several pioneering accomplishments, as well as the deaths of many people/animal, some of which are believed to have covered up by the program?

       Thanks for the polite discussion. I first came to the conclusion that NASA is faking a lot of their footage. The next question, as you mentioned, is: why would they fake it? The main theories are that they wanted to be the first to the moon and thought it necessary to fake it in order to be first and that they didn't want to show live footage in case something bad happened, so it was pre-recorded. If either theory was true, we might observe deception in the first few attempts to get into space, but after all the hullabaloo, we should be seeing real stuff. We shouldn't continue receiving digitally manipulated footage in 2018 when there no longer exist the pressures associated with the first attempts. Because they are still lying to us, it makes me wonder if anyone has ever made it into space. If nobody from the US has actually been passed low earth orbit, what is the likelihood that the Russians have overcome whatever problems the US faces? Very low to zero. So if other countries claim to corroborate the US, but the US is lying, then it stands to reason that they are lying as well.
