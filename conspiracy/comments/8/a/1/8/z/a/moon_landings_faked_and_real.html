       I'm sure others have discussed this theory so I figured I would ask here.  It just came to me the other day that both sides of the moon landing story are probably real, the launches were real and the moon footage was faked.  We watched a the world's greatest magic show and feat of diversion on a global scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would only make sense if you need to go to the moon and recover or explore something in secret, you would have to use a magic trick, you could not hide something that big any other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we witnessed were real rocket launches and recoveries, but what we all saw happening on the moon was fake, that part was done in a studio.  What was the real mission on the surface of the moon, who knows, but it was kept secret from the public.  Would we really spend all that money and effort, and return for that many trips just to jump around, sing, and bring back a few rocks? Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I'm not the first to think of this so does anyone else have links to investigations into this theory? What's the story?

       Yeah, if no other reason, the risk of something catastrophic happening to an astronaut on live tv would be too big a risk to take. They just wouldn't do that.

       Imagine a big old space worm shot out of the dirt and tore the astronauts in half. Instant worldwide panic.

      <p>
       I mean I am pretty sure that there is no such thing, but how sure was the government back then? And what about all the mundane risks? I agree, we were only shown something that was safe to see.

       Your thoughts are the same as mine. Man got to the moon but it was a suicide mission. The footage of amstrong, aldrin and 3rd guy was filmed on earth but using descriptions from the astronaughts on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is what happened to Russia as well, the difference being that Russia werent so desperate to win the space race, America was for various understandable reasons.

       In any conspiracy i just take the advice of Yoda from the first season of X-files "the truth is always conveniently hidden between two lies"
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the moon landing was faked, but man DID get to the moon.

       Hey. I'm not alone in this theory. I've been told I'm stupid for believing this in person yet no one can agree if we went or not. I thought I was the first to meet in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we went but we're told to leave and not come back by ________. So we staged it back home. They will give any excuse as to why we can't go back, and none of those excuses make sense since we have "already" been there.

       How... would you prove such a thing?  It’s much easier to provide evidence suggesting it’s impossible to get there, especially with 1960/70s technology, hell even what we’re aware of today.  Seems like a way to hold on to a deep love of the potential for space travel/aliens/spaceship moon.  The real brain-**** is what if Russia was faking it all first?  (By “it all” I mean reaching space first/first man in space/first orbit/probes/etc...)  If we knew they were lying (about the more major accomplishments), it’s an easy goal to out-lie them.

       It’s possible technology from a previous generation on earth, think library of Alexandria, ended up on the moon and we needed to at least take a peek at it or get it back into LEO for further science.
      </p>
      <p>
       So...Astronauts were sent to retrieve it, however, there was no ability to return more than 25 lbs from the surface, so we have a couple fallen soldiers up there who still need to be brought home?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiding the fact we left some folks up there would shake some people to their core, especially military and honor types.

       You bring up a good point.  If there was ever a great civilization here, I believe one of those buried libraries exists somewhere.  Hitler actually had the right approach in regard to looking at all these ancient texts to find lost knowledge. Not the right guy, but the right concept.  Q has told us, most of it lies within the Vatican vaults.

       What seals the case for it being real, for me, is the camera footage. Compare it to hollywood movies of the 60’s and the technology they had at the time.

       As I understand the conspiracy theories it was done by Stanley Kubrick, who has also hinted at it being faked.  I find it more than likely true, for many logical reasons, some of them not exactly nefarious, but in the interest of national security.

       they didn’t have the technology to fake it back then. look at hollywood movies of that time. There was no cgi or anything like that back then.

       Kubrick was a master at attention to detail, we've all seen 2001, 50 year old technology.  People watched all of this on shitty definition black and white, static filled TVs. Yeah, it was definitely possible, actually quite easy.

       but we are not watching it on black and white tvs. We are watching it on high definition monitors and it still looks authentic to us, right now, in 2018, 50 years later!  Even some of the absolute best hollywood cgi Today, still looks fake. You’re telling me kubrick had better tech 50 years ago then hollywood has today?  Yeah, no.

       I've become skeptical about manned-lunar missions.   An electrical engineer did an analysis of the LM computer with Jim Fetzer and came to the conclusion it was entirely useless.  There were simply no avionic systems capable of assisted lunar landings back in the day and a manual landing would be sketchy as fuck - too much information to process simultaneously.  Then there are also navigation system issues.  The tech was too archaic for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there were suicide missions to orbit the moon but that's extreme optimism.  I would love to be wrong about all this.

       Outside of the pure technical aspects, there are the lost original tapes, lost rocks, an ambivalence about everything that documented the project, and then there is the esoteric piece of it. I can't put my finger on it, but something about the astronauts just doesn't feel right to me too. Neil Armstrong spent his whole life in seclusion, in practical silence about the moon missions, and the astronauts that do talk about it come across as they are not genuine. Its as if they are always 'on script', emotionless about their experience.  Maybe its just me, that's not evidence, just gut feel.
