       The amount of holes in the LV shooting investigation is laughable at best, criminal at worst and the prostitution and trafficking of underage kids for sex hasn’t gone anywhere. No answers for either of those whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there’s the YouTube shooter. I haven’t heard one story since yesterday about her. It’s as if the story fell off the face of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main thing is the LV shooting. People stopped asking questions so people stopped trying to give answers. This has been plenty of time for the authorities in LV and the FBI to fabricate some sort of bullshit that they can pass of to the general public with ease. With everyone on their case, they kept making mistakes with their story. How did this die out???

       I just don’t like how people want to focus on trump when he’s literally just one man. And this sub, of all subs, should know that the president is just a poster boy. He’s not the root or the cause. He’s the middle man with a mask of authority. It’s not true authority. Not anymore at least.

       Fucking
       <em>
        thank you
       </em>
       . I get labelled as  a Trump supporter for telling people the MSM lies to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a different strategy by the same people.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand "well at least it isn't Trump" while TPTB do what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand: "well Trump is an asshole of course he would do that". Which makes Trump the lightning rod for TPTB doing what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president is a puppet. And even better? The midterms are probably going to show a lot of people swinging Democrat because of the media shit show about Trump. And many of the dem potential candidatea are ex CIA (no such thing as an ex-spook).

       Well considering how people try to shoehorn Trump into things not about Trump to derail conversation on different topics? And how Trump is just a stupid controlled person (read: president) but people can't help but blame everything on him? Then yes. Just
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       those really in charge want it this way.

       I think LV and Pgate are pretty well saturated into the ethos/community of this sub already. I see discussions all the time, and I personally talk about Pgate relatively often. YouTube isn't getting a lot of coverage because the MSM hasn't really touched it that much...there's not much of a narrative to comment on and dissect, which is interesting in and of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit- you should make some SP's about the stuff you want to talk about and throw it out to the community :)

       Same here- it's why /new is so addicting. There's no fun hopping into a 12 hour old thread where the discussion has already been hashed out- I want to contribute to the discussion while it's all still fresh. I've learned a lot and heard a lot of different views from people by browsing /new.

       It's been something it took me a while to comprehend but that's the Reality my friend- most people just
       <em>
        do

       accept what the MSM has to say. They don't watch much news, and when they do they catch 5 minutes here or there, and take it as gospel. The vast majority of people do this.

       I can’t watch the news anymore. I get too pissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate, with a passion, what society has become. It almost makes me literally sick to my stomach sometimes.

      <p>
       I’m a white, conservative (more like libertarian but that’s another discussion for another thread in another sub), male Christian so, right now, I’m the epitome of evil according to society.

       I know how you feel. As a fellow Christian, my advice is not to let the powers that be put hate in your heart. They're not worth it. Jesus taught us to forgive and love all, even the frustratingly ignorant and downright wrongheaded. It isn't easy, but I'm working on it.

       No, it's not. On the contrary, it's the only think that has ever worked. MLK and Gandhi took on Empire and won by uniting people, not by dividing people, or devolving into violence, hatred and resentment.

       Dude guy walked into factory 20 miles from where I lived as a kid and killed 6 people and himself. It was never anything bigger then local news because this shit happens all the time. When it’s a school or the shooting is politely motivated enough for the MSM to pick it up it will be heard but this is just a crazy jaded women shooting up her workplace.

       You're just proving my point. Those should both be big stories. Mass murder, or attempted mass murder is a big deal. These things don't happen in most places. We shouldn't just passively accept them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect these stories are buried because more MSM attention may force a conversation about the totality of the factors that cause these shootings; a conversation that runs deeper than just "guns are bad, mmmkay".
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the conversation we need to have as a society and culture. As long as these stories are buried, or used superficially to achieve a narrow political agenda, they will keep happening.

       Exactly my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why allow the narrative to continue?  Why does the media, who is infinitely smaller compared to the general public, get to dictate what the narrative is?  That should be us, the people, who the media serves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without us just completely accepting what they say, the tables turn. That’s when the narrative gets thrown out, the local, state and federal authorities can’t push their bullshit agendas and that’s when the people, as a whole start refusing anything other than truth.

       You're absolutely right. But the thing is they are the ones who control the mainstream media, so they control the information that gets heard by the masses. If people like you were put in front of a national audience as much as the establishment talking heads, a lot more people would be raising these questions. But they intentionally don't put people like that on TV, and so the questioning goes away.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer is to use channels they don't control to reach people already disenfranchised with the MSM. Podcasts are probably what helped wake me up the most, because I could listen at work and in the car. As internet technology progresses it's getting easier and cheaper to start a podcast or put up a website and gain an audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what people should understand is that alternative media is under attack by the mainstream. They use censorship and propaganda to direct the narrative and convince people to believe whatever BS they are fed. Alternative media should be focusing on exposing the lies, but by doing that they make themselves a target of censorship and being called "fake news".

       Same here- it's why /new is so addicting. There's no fun hopping into a 12 hour old thread where the discussion has already been hashed out- I want to contribute to the discussion while it's all still fresh. I've learned a lot and heard a lot of different views from people by browsing /new.

       It's been something it took me a while to comprehend but that's the Reality my friend- most people just
       <em>
        do
       </em>
