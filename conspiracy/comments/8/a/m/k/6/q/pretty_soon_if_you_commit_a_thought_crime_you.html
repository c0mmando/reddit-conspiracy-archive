<p>&#39;Thought crime&#39; being saying something &#39;racist&#39;, or &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; or &#39;occult&#39; related.</p>

<p>Just look at the recent Florida incident, or the Nazi pug etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not sustainable for the peasants to be allowed to say things like:</p>

<ul>
<li> Epstein ran a pedophile ring to blackmail politicians. </li>
<li> Israel did 911. </li>
<li> Many Western Politicians are pedophiles and some even Satanists who sacrifice human babies to Baal </li>
</ul>

<h3>After this belief becomes widespread there will be large crowds marching on Langley or the MI5 building to effect change.</h3>

<p>So they&#39;re circumventing this by criminalizing &quot;wrong think&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most laws are designed to be objective and universal.</p>

<p>Speech is subject to interpretation. For example, some people might interpret Ricky Gervais&#39; joke as he LITERALLY masturbated to Schindler&#39;s list.</p>

<p>So the law is totally subjective and it&#39;s merely the Government prosecuted people it doesn&#39;t like for saying things it doesn&#39;t want people saying.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fascism.</p>

<p>The only reason you don&#39;t object to it is that at the moment they&#39;ve targeted people you don&#39;t like. When they start targeting you and your friends then you&#39;ll start freaking.</p>

<p>advocating for violence against citizens of your own nation is unacceptable and it is not fascism to shut that shit down. Each individual case should be looked at for context and the guy with his stupid dog video, assuming they didn&#39;t find anything else incriminating, should have been shown some mercy if his claim that he was just trying to piss of his girlfriend checks out, but that sort of speech should not be allowed to go unchecked because it&#39;s just going to escalate into something really horrific.</p>

<p>Ricky Gervais has waded into the debate sparked by a radio station that killed a baby rabbit live on air by joking about “battering a Danish DJ to death”.</p>

<p>RICKY Gervais’ sick joke about a dead baby lasted for more than ten minutes and made references to cot death, The Sun Online can reveal.</p>

<p><strong>The tasteless comments also saw Ricky trying to make his audience laugh by saying that the death of a youngster adopted from a foreign country “wouldn’t matter as much” as a biological child.</strong></p>

<p>The show mines the very worst things in human existence – paedophilia, terrorism, rape, murder, fundamentalism, animal cruelty, the death of a child – and attempts to chisel out jokes. Sometimes, unexpectedly, it works. A section on how everything is far worse than it used to be – bombers and serial killers included – has a seductive comic logic.</p>

<p>Police said Alfonseca walked into a TowneBank and handed the teller a note asking for $150,000 in bonds -- and included the word &quot;please.&quot; </p>

<p>Attempting to rob a bank, even if just saying words to that effect, is a direct threat of coercion, I.e. Violence.</p>

<p>Although I do not agree with someone saying &quot;gas the Jews&quot; In Any context - if it is merely words online: it means nothing and poses no such direct threat.

<p>in the US you are right. The law in the US is only violated if there is a likeliness that it will actually result in lawless behavior. </p>

<p>if he was in the united states, he may be shunned, fired from his job, etc, but it would be a constitutional violation to lock him up for that video. the UK&#39;s laws are a little bit less forgiving, but the difference is not extreme.</p>

<p>you&#39;re being deliberately dense again. &quot;Offensive phrases&quot; are fine. Public calls for violence are not the same fucking thing. Stop lumping them together like there&#39;s no difference. </p>

<p>the dog has nothing to do with why he was arrested.</p>

<p>he was arrested because he was saying, out of his own mouth, &quot;gas the jews&quot; and &quot;sieg heil&quot; and stuff on a video that he himself uploaded to social media.</p>

<p>just because you include a dog in your video doesn&#39;t mean your words suddenly don&#39;t count anymore.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s actually compare the video to another video aimed at racial/genocidal issues such as anything from early Dave Chappelle, which often poke fun at them, so like the previous user stated, is it only amateur comedians who weren&#39;t accepted into the bulletproof folder?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being absolutist, but I&#39;m talking to someone who is attempting to use state power to punish people they view are dangerous, and what do you view them dangerous for? Oh yeah, ironically saying &quot;gas the Jews&quot; while teaching a pug to react to it.</p>

<p>Too bad it&#39;s not nearly as effective in real life as the sci-fi version. Although I suppose the programs are still getting massive amounts of funding. Probably vertically integrated and tied in with the mass surveillance and collection of all that meta-data by the NSA. Also too bad the best they have to show for it is shit like the Newburg Four where they probably used behavioural modification on people of less than average intelligence to create would-be terrorists the feds could arrest and parade to the media as a victory. Too bad again the worst they have to show for it is shit like pulse nightclub or the Navy Yard shooting awhile back where you just know something ain&#39;t right. Like so many of these mass shootings, it&#39;s hard to argue the feds didn&#39;t drop the ball in a big way despite all those fancy-dancy fucking profilers, both human and ai, that aren&#39;t a fraction as effective in real life as they are in so many cheesy TV shows that normalize the population to their existence. I bet those tv shows actually help secure funding too. I can just see a budget proposal meeting where the boss man gets told some shit like &quot; Oh Yeah, our program will be like the real life version of NCIS, CSI, Criminal Minds and Mindhunter all rolled up into one, only much more sophisticated!!!&quot; Sold!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was an interesting link although the length of the article and the philisophical nature was a bit much for me. I got mayne the first half the rest I skimmed. I will say this, after 30 years playing the guitar, and having taken piano lessons for years even before I picked up the guitar, you sure sent me down one hell of a rabbit hole. After getting half way through your article I found myself googling other rarticles and trying to figure out if my main tuner would allow me to try a=432. It won&#39;t. I think I have another that will, but pitch isn&#39;t my strong suit. I will give it a try when I can. </p>

<p>I did find this article which you may find interesting:</p>

<p><a href="http://factmyth.com/factoids/432-hz-is-better-than-440-hz/">http://factmyth.com/factoids/432-hz-is-better-than-440-hz/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s also very long but the crux is that various tunings have strengths and weaknesses.The authors contention is that tuning to A=432 offers pleasing single notes and appealing wave forms in a visual sense but can create unpleasant harmonics and chords and scales also suffer. Tuning to A=440 creates less pleasing or more tense single notes and less visually appealing wave forms but chords, scales and harmonics work out nicer. That tension in single notes is relative though because tension in music isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the conspiracy angle. With admittedly very little experience or knowledge in the matter I tend to agree with the author that the conspiracy angle doesn&#39;t hold up for several reasons.</p>

<p>First is the explanation about how A=440 holds together scales, chords and harmonics better. So if you use A=432 and play a single notes it will be pleasing if you are in the mood to relax or analyze the wave forms from a visual perspective. However, as soon as you start to create scales and chords things get harsh, especially in certain harmonics and I am a big believer in harmonics. I also love tension in music so the single notes thing works better for me personally. Keep in mind these principles apply more on western instruments, guitars and pianos etc. Also keep in mind there instruments were developdd long before Nazi&#39;s were a thing.</p>

<p>Which brings me to the Nazi push to creat music that can be used as psychological warefare. Again, doesn&#39;t hold water for me.
My reasoning is this. The Nazis would have had to listen to this music also. So would all of Germany. Nazi&#39;s were a lot of horrible things, but they weren&#39;t haters of music or art. In fact, at the upper echelons they were quite enthralled with the arts, to the point they even admired art and music of their enemies, including the Jews. Germany has a rich history of musical culture. If they had been pushing to standardize a type of music that would psychically damage people then what would be left for them and their families and children to enjoy. I suppose you could argue they fed on negative energy to a significant extent, but negative energy doesn&#39;t equal out of tune scales and chords to me and I think most people would agree. Out of tune is just annoying to the ear. Besides, German and western instruments sound like they really do do better all around with the A=440. </p>

<p>Out it this way. Some western music gives people positive feelings, some gives negative feelings. When you listen to your favorite western music does it give you overwhelmingly negative energy? Likewise with Eastern music. Some is great, some doesn&#39;t jive. But their instruments and scale patterns and such aren&#39;t always compatible with western styles, structures and instruments. When western artists and Eastern artists get together with their traditional instruments concessions have to be made to make it work. Both sides have strengths and weaknesses and they aren&#39;t always compatible. When they are it&#39;s often great and elicits positive emotion regardless of which side is dominating the mix. But that&#39;s all relative. Music is so subjective and no too humans are the same from head to toe. To say humans all resonate chakra better at 432 than 440 sounds awfully vague. I like heavy metal or blues, someone else likes country, someone else like eastern sitar music. We all resonate differently imo, but as with so many things, ymmv.</p>

<p>In any case, thanks for the link, interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blown away with the information here. But I must apologise for pre-emptively sharing a link without thoroughly examining the information myself. This link does point out however that 440hz is disharmonious and that 432hz is scientificly better. But what I also found is that the Schuman scale is not precisely accurate. Instead of it being 8hz ( 8 x 55 = 440)  it should be 7.83 ( 8 x 55 = 430.65) <a href="https://youtu.be/VjBqNyCtsOs">https://youtu.be/VjBqNyCtsOs</a></p>

<p>As we are going off topic slightly I must agree that we are all being suppressed via many methods, and that some of us are aware of this, most of us do not actually take physical action to prevent these things from happening. Why is that? Are we that suppressed that we can&#39;t? Or is it simply that we are only looking out for ourselves? But isn&#39;t this abnormal to our nature? It seems only when disaster happens we act upon the aftermath rather than preventing such things from occurring.
I&#39;d like to know your viewpoint.</p>

<p>The minute you start criminalizing certain types a of speech you’re done - someone is controlling what thoughts are legal and which ones aren’t.</p>

<p>The global warming nuts would love to criminalize any speech which disagrees with their agenda.  Some Obama supporters even floated this idea.</p>

<p>Many women would love to criminalize speech that contradicts their political narrative around the mythical wage gap.  Just a matter of time before they push for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Ricky Gervais has waded into the debate sparked by a radio station that killed a baby rabbit live on air by joking about “battering a Danish DJ to death”.</p>

<p>RICKY Gervais’ sick joke about a dead baby lasted for more than ten minutes and made references to cot death, The Sun Online can reveal.</p>

<p><strong>The tasteless comments also saw Ricky trying to make his audience laugh by saying that the death of a youngster adopted from a foreign country “wouldn’t matter as much” as a biological child.</strong></p>

<p>The show mines the very worst things in human existence – paedophilia, terrorism, rape, murder, fundamentalism, animal cruelty, the death of a child – and attempts to chisel out jokes. Sometimes, unexpectedly, it works. A section on how everything is far worse than it used to be – bombers and serial killers included – has a seductive comic logic.</p>

<p>he was arrested because he was saying, out of his own mouth, &quot;gas the jews&quot; and &quot;sieg heil&quot; and stuff on a video that he himself uploaded to social media.</p>
