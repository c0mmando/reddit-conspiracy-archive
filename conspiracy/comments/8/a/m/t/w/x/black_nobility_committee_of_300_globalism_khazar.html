       Roots of Today's Ruling 
Oligarchy
      </p>
      <p>
       by Dr. John Coleman

       "Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic 
destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves." 
--Walter Rathenau, 1909, founder of the mammoth German General Electric 
Corporation
      </p>
      <p>
       The Committee of 300 is a product of the British East India Company's 
Council of 300. The East India Company was chartered by the British royal 
family in 1600. It made vast fortunes in the opium drug trade with China 
and became the largest company on earth in its time. Today, through many 
powerful alliances, the Committee of 300 rules the world and is the driving 
force behind the criminal agenda to create a "New World Order", under a 
"Totalitarian Global Government". There is no need to use "they" or "the 
enemy" except as shorthand. We know who "they", the enemy, is. The 
Committee of 300 with its "aristocracy", its ownership of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve banking system, insurance companies, giant corporations, 
foundations, communications networks, presided over by a hierarchy of 
conspirators — this is the enemy. Secret societies exist by deception. Each 
is a hierarchy with an inner circle at the top, who deceives those below with 
lies, such as claiming a noble agenda; thus, duping them into following a 
web of compartmentalized complicity. The inner circle of the Committee of 
300 is the Order of the Garter, headed by Queen Elizabeth Windsor II. It is 
interesting to note that the Windsor's changed their name from the 
Germanic Saxe-Coburg-Gotha during WWI, because of anti-German 
sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The enemy is clearly identifiable as the Committee of 300 and its front 
organizations, such as the Royal Institute for International Affairs (Chatham 
House), the Club of Rome, NATO, U.N., the Black Nobility, the Tavistock 
Institute, CFR and all its affiliated organizations, the think tanks and 
research institutions controlled by Stanford and the Tavistock Institute of 
Human Relations and last, but certainly not least, the military 
establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Committee of 300 is the ultimate secret society made up of an 
untouchable ruling class, which includes the Queen of the United Kingdom
      </p>
      <p>
       (Elizabeth II), the Queen of the Netherlands, the Queen of Denmark and the 
royal families of Europe. These aristocrats decided at the death of Queen 
Victoria, the matriarch of the Venetian Black Guelphs that, in order to gain 
world-wide control, it would be necessary for its aristocratic members to "go 
into business" with the non-aristocratic but extremely powerful leaders of 
corporate business on a global scale, and so the doors to ultimate power 
were opened to what the Queen of England likes to refer to as "the 
commoners". Through their illicit banking cartel, they own the stock of the 
Federal Reserve, which is a private for profit corporation that violates U.S. 
Constitution and is a ROOT of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decadent American families of the unholy partnership, thoroughly 
corrupted and wallowing in tainted opium money, went on to become what 
we know today as the Eastern Liberal Establishment. Its members, under 
the careful guidance and direction of the British Crown, and subsequently, 
its foreign policy executive arm, the Royal Institute for International Affairs 
(RIIA), now known as Chatham House, located in England (across St. 
James's Square from the Astors), ran the United States from top to bottom 
through their secret upper-level, parallel government, which is tightly 
meshed with the Committee of 300, the ultimate secret society. That 
secret, all-powerful government is more in control of the United States in 
2006 than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some notable members of the Committee of 300 include: The British royal 
family, Dutch royal family, House of Hapsburg, House of Orange, Duke of 
Alba, Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh, Lord Carrington, Lord Halifax, Lord 
Alfred Milner, John Jacob and Waldorf of the Astor Illuminati bloodline, 
Winston Churchill, Cecil Rhodes, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Juliana, 
Queen Beatrix, Queen Magreta, King Haakon of Norway, Colonel Mandel 
House, Aldous Huxley, John Forbes, Averill Harriman, William and 
McGeorge Bundy, George Bush, Prescott Bush, Henry Kissinger, J.P. 
Morgan, Maurice Strong, David Rockefeller, David and Evelyn Rothschild, 
Paul, Max and Felix Warburg, Ormsby and Al Gore, Bertrand Russell, Sir 
Earnest and Harry of the Oppenheimer Illuminati bloodline, Warren Buffet, 
Giuseppe Mazzini, Sir William Hesse, George Schultz, H.G. Wells, and Ted 
Turner.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Committee of 300, which has a 150-year history, we have some of 
the most brilliant intellects assembled to form a completely totalitarian, 
absolutely controlled "new" society only it isn't new, having drawn most of 
its ideas from the Clubs of Cultus Diabolicus. It strives toward a One World 
Government rather well described by one of its late members, H. G. Wells, 
in his work commissioned by the Committee which Wells boldly called: "The 
Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the Committee of 300's immense wealth arose out of the opium 
trade with China and India. Obscene profits went straight into the royal 
coffers, and into the pockets of the nobility, the oligarchs and plutocrats, 
and made them billionaires. The ordinary people of China, India, and 
England profited nothing from "opium revenues". In the same way the 
people of South Africa, black and white, never profited from the gold mining 
industry, whose revenues were piped directly into the City of London banks 
and Merchant banks. The Committee of 300 is responsible for the phony 
drug wars here in the U.S. These phony drug wars were to get us to give 
away our constitutional rights. Asset forfeiture is a prime example, where 
huge assets can be seized without trail and no proof of guilt needed. Also 
the Committee of 300 long ago decreed that there shall be a smaller-much 
smaller-and better world, that is, their idea of what constitutes a better 
world. The myriads of useless eaters consuming scarce natural resources 
were to be culled by up to 99%. Industrial progress supports population 
growth. Therefore the command to multiply and subdue the earth found in 
Genesis had to be subverted. This called for an attack upon Christianity; 
the slow but sure disintegration of industrial nation states; the destruction of
      </p>
      <p>
       billions of people, referred to by the Committee of 300 as "surplus 
population," and the removal of any leader who dared to stand in the way of 
the Committee's global planning to reach the foregoing objectives. Not that 
the U.S. government didn't know, but as it was part of the conspiracy, it 
helped to keep the lid on information rather than let the truth be known. 
Queen, Elizabeth II, is the head of the Committee of 300. The Committee 
of 300 looks to social convulsions on a global scale, followed by 
depressions, as a softening-up technique for bigger things to come, as its 
principal method of creating masses of people all over the world who will 
become its "welfare" recipients of the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current criminal agenda of the Committee of 300 is further evidenced by 
recently leaked Club of Rome documents, as they describe how they will 
use drugs to help stifle resistance to their New World Order scheme: 
"...having been failed by Christianity, and with unemployment rife on every 
hand, those who have been without jobs for five years or more, will turn 
away from the church and seek solace in drugs. By then, full control of the 
drug trade must be completed in order that the government of all countries 
who are under our jurisdiction have a monopoly in place which we will 
control by controlling supplies reaching the market... Drug bars will take 
care of the unruly and the discontented. Would-be revolutionaries will be 
turned into harmless addicts with no will of their own..." The crowned 
cobras of Europe and their Eastern Liberal Establishment families will not 
tolerate any true war against drugs. The war on drugs, which the Bush 
administration was allegedly fighting, was for the legalization of all types 
and classes of drugs. Such drugs are not solely a social aberration, but a 
full-scale attempt to gain control of the minds of the people of the United 
States. At present, this is the principal task of the Committee of 300. 
Nothing has changed in the opium-heroin-cocaine trade. It is still in the 
hands of the same "upper class" families in Britain and the United States. It 
is still a fabulously profitable trade where what appear to be big losses 
through sometimes seizures of drug shipments are actually small interlopers 
trying to break into the preserves of the drug trade hierarchy, who sit in 
paneled board rooms in New York, Hong Kong and London over port and 
cigars and congratulate another success in the eradication of "competitors."
      </p>
      <p>
       Included in the Committee of 300 membership are the old families of the 
European Black Nobility, the American Eastern Liberal Establishment (in 
Freemason hierarchy and the Order of Skull and Bone), the Illuminati, or as 
it is known by the Committee "MORIAH CONQUERING WIND," the 
Mumma Group, The National and World Council of Churches, the Circle of 
Initiates, the Nine Unknown Men, Lucis Trust, Jesuit Liberation Theologists, 
The Order of the Elders of Zion, the Nasi Princes, International Monetary 
Fund (IMF), the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the United Nations 
(U.N.), the Central, British Quator Coronati, Italian P2 Masonry — especially 
those in the Vatican hierarchy — the Central Intelligence Agency, Tavistock 
Institute selected personnel, various members of leading foundations and 
insurance companies, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the Milner 
Group-Round Table, Cini Foundation, German Marshall Fund, Ditchley 
Foundation, NATO, Club of Rome, Environmentalists, The Order of St. John 
of Jerusalem, One World Government Church, Socialist International, Black 
Order, Thule Society, Anenherbe-Rosicrucianists, The Great Superior Ones 
and literally HUNDREDS of other organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of John F. Kennedy, the assassination was carried out with 
great attendant publicity and with the utmost brutality to serve as a warning 
to world leaders not to get out of line. Pope John Paul I was quietly 
murdered because he was getting close to the Committee of 300 through 
Freemasons in the Vatican hierarchy. His successor, Pope John Paul II, 
was publicly humiliated as a warning to cease and desist — which he has 
done. As we shall see, certain Vatican leaders are today seated on the 
Committee of 300.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Committee of 300 appears to base much of its important decisions 
affecting mankind on the philosophy of Polish aristocrat, Felix Dzerzinski, 
who regarded mankind as being slightly above the level of cattle. As a 
close friend of British intelligence agent Sydney Reilly (Reilly was actually 
Dzerzinski's controller during the Bolshevik Revolution's formative years), 
he often confided in Reilly during his drinking bouts. Dzerzinski was, of 
course, the beast who ran the Red Terror apparatus. He once told Reilly, 
while the two were on a drinking binge, that "Man is of no importance. Look 
at what happens when you starve him. He begins to eat his dead 
companions to stay alive. Man is only interested in his own survival. That 
is all that counts. All the Spinoza stuff is a lot of rubbish."
      </p>
      <p>
       The roots of the East India Company (chartered by Queen Elizabeth I on 
December 31, 1600 and dissolved in 1873) sprout from the European Black 
Nobility. The Black Nobility are the oligarchic families of Venice and Genoa, 
who in the 12th century held the privileged trading rights (monopolies). The 
first of three crusades, from 1063 to 1123, established the power of the 
Venetian Black Nobility and solidified the power of the wealthy ruling class. 
The Black Nobility aristocracy achieved complete control over Venice in 
1171, when the appointment of the doge was transferred to what was 
known as the Great Council, which consisted of members of the commercial 
aristocracy, a complete triumph for them. Venice has remained in their 
hands ever since, but the power and influence of the Venetian Black Nobility 
extends far beyond its borders, and today, is felt in every corner of the 
globe. In 1204 the oligarchic family parceled out feudal enclaves to their 
members, and from this epoch dates the great building-up of power and 
pressure until the government became a closed corporation of the leading 
Black Nobility families.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that the European Black Nobility is responsible for the 
insidious entanglements of numerous secret societies, lodges, and 
organizations, which are backed with high finance and powerful political 
connections. Such organizations include: Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg 
Group (German version of CFR), Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), 
United Nations (founded by CFR), Illuminati order Skull &amp; Bones (inner 
circle of the CFR), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Bank of 
International Settlement, Club of Rome, Chatham House (formally the Royal 
Institute of International Affairs - RIIA), Round Table, Tavistock Institute for 
Human Studies (England's psychological warfare think tank), Associated 
Press, Reuters (Rothschild owned news monopoly used for brainwashing 
the masses), and many others, all of which, whether they are dupes or 
adapts, work in favor of Great Britain's aristocracy and their one world 
government agenda. Although there is a wide cross-section, all roads lead 
to the Queen of England. The technique for keeping their illicit scheme 
secret is compartmentalization. Only the people in the inner circle, who are 
part of the capstone at the top of the pyramid, know the entire extent of the 
fraud. Adepts are few and dupes many. Typically, the dupes are told lies 
that their involvement is benevolent; thus, they become unwitting 
accomplices in crime. This is why it is imperative to expose this diabolical 
ring of power. Illicit secret societies cannot withstand the light of day. 
Once exposed, the cabal and their minions will fall like a house of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The European Black Nobility earned its title through dirty tricks, so when the 
population revolted against the monopolies in government, as anywhere 
else, the leaders of the uprising were quickly seized and brutally hanged. 
They use secret assassinations, murder, the bankrupting of opposing 
citizens or companies, kidnapping and rape. All the families listed are 
connected with the House of Guelph, one of the original Black Nobility 
families of Venice from which the House of Windsor and thus the present 
Queen of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth II, descends. -Dr. John Coleman, 
former British Intelligence Officer, The Conspirator's Hierarchy: The 
Committee of 300

       Thank you sir! This subject often falls on deaf ears and is hard to piece together due to it overlooking every aspect of life for many centuries and how censored/secretive it is. However, I would like to get info regarding the papal nobility, I’m not too knowledgeable in it.

       Searching for terms like the Tusculum Popes and just the Papal Nobility should get you into the same areas of the web you found this Dr. Coleman article. I don't have the links on hand because this was some of the stuff I cut my conspiracy teeth on quite a while ago, but I made an SP a few months back that touches on it a bit. I'll link the SP but if you have already found what you have on the Black Nobility and Council of 300, you are already looking in the right parts of the net.

       This is great stuff. Thank you again kind sir! This is ultimately what we should be using our voices for, I feel as if we are caught up in the tiers of corruption and not seeking the source anymore. I’m glad there’s still others that have valuable knowledge and expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again.

       Lots of good information here, but, I see a bunch of misinformation and disinformation. The biggest of all, is that it leads back to the Queen of England.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is nothing more than a Dame of The Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and is a part of the Order of the Garter, and Order of the Bath. However,  She is beholden to the Knight (or Higher Authority)
       <em>
        that gave her those distinctions
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In the UK, or City of London, that would be House of Percy and/or House of Breakspear, then there is the House of Rosenberg, which is a powerful off branch of House of Orsini.
      </p>
      <p>
       This author is conflating the Black Nobility, with European Nobility. The Black Nobility are Roman, Venetian, and Swiss,
       <em>
        who control European Nobility
       </em>
       . Some of these Roman/Papal bloodlines are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Farnese
       </li>
       <li>
        Borghese
       </li>
       <li>
        Aldobrandini
       </li>
       <li>
        Orsini
       </li>
       <li>
        Medici
       </li>
       <li>
        Breakspear
       </li>
       <li>
        Sforza
       </li>
       <li>
        Barbernini
       </li>
       <li>
        Conti
       </li>
       <li>
        Colonna
       </li>
       <li>
        Este-Welf
       </li>
       <li>
        Chigi
       </li>
       <li>
        Somaglia
       </li>
       <li>
        Gaetani
       </li>
       <li>
        Pamphili
       </li>
       <li>
        Schiaratura
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Many of these bloodlines trace their lineage back to Roman Emperors, Popes, and even the Pharaohs.
       <em>
        Or so they claim...
       </em>
       I'll give you two people (bloodlines), and you tell me who
       <em>
        you think is more powerful
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        King Felipe VI of Spain
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Queen Elizabeth II
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This should test your Lineage/Heraldy knowledge :)

       Thank you! I appreciate the thorough insight on this and the cross-correction. I’ll have to revisit the drawing board now! I was looking at it in the perspective that if this is true, she is already a public figure head and most likely the masses wouldn’t think she was/ or is the head of an international multi century cabal, and they’d just continue to elect her the “public head”, but I do see your points that an entire other bloodline/region controls this.
      </p>

       Also, I’ve been a long time lurker for the last 2-3 years and became familiarized with your posts, I find it both amusing and satisfying that you commented. Gracias mi amigo.

       You're welcome, and I highly suggest you research Heraldy (Symbolism) - Bloodlines, if you are going down this rabbit hole. You're going to need it! They hide in plain sight.

       Here is Queen Elizabeth II Coat of Arms:

       As compared to King Felipe VI of Spain:

       This is by far my favorite topic :), and trying to root the origins of these bloodlines (TPTB) back to Sumeria and possibly to pre-Deluge bloodlines.

       Shame I have only been able to trace them back to Rome and Late Egypt.

       I've only been able to postulate the bloodlines reliable back to the early medieval period but things started to break down for my research in late antiquity. The logic is there- these families could have hidden within the Church or the Constantinople nobility, I figure it's probably a mix of both.
      </p>

       I think the Vatican vaults are allowed to because, well it's the Vatican, and for some reason that makes people not question things :\

       Oh shit! He's back! Only a 25 day ban for your blow up after not being modded? Not bad. I'll say, not many users could get away with telling the mods to suck their uncut dick (tmi, in my opinion), use a known alt, and be allowed back. Perks of the conclave I guess. I look forward to our future transgressions! Can you give me a one word or emoji filled response, just for old times sake?

       Come on Grace. We aren't stupid so stop trying to pretend like we are. We know this user is a protected member of your conclave. They've been banned from this sub multiple times, from the site itself, evaded your bans (which you admitted to knowing, tsk tsk), etc. This user is simply a mouthpiece for you mods to instigate shit flinging in the comments so you can ban users you guys don't like. Don't whine about not getting admin help when you knowingly don't abide by site rules.
