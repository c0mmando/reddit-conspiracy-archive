       Plenty of evidence that we didn't travel to the moon and that we have no real photo of earth. Based off of what we can observe, the sun's path in our sky seems to prove we are on a globe, as it moves 15 degrees per hour from wherever you see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone care to discuss whats going on here? At one point I have believed both sides and now I believe neither. Globe was my default, then flat earth completely shut down NASA for me, the flat earth map seemed plausible but the sun physics don't make sense.

       There are people here who believe those things and people who don't. I'm one that believes the Earth is round and am not convinced that we didn't land on the moon...but I don't really have any issues with those who do. I just tend to stay away from those debates, but since you are asking a general question I figured I'd chime in.

       Both sides rather fight on what side is right instead of trying to work together and elaborate and come up with their own conclusion based on what they both know. But I feel like both sides totally attack the other depending what point of view you have on it.

       Lol, the "side" of people who believe flat earth is WAY smaller than those who deny it on this sub. It's not some kind of left/right type of issue. It's a small vocal minority pushing their agenda.

       Yup both sides have their respective aspects that don't quite add up. Like if flat earthers
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wanted to the could do some crazy experiments. But the key is that a certain degree of faith is required to believe either theory

       You should elaborate on this. It'll show

       I mean it doesn’t make sense on the flat earth model, like we can’t have a flat earth model where the sun moves 15 degrees every hour at any location like we can observe in real life. That very last phrase wasn’t supposed to be taken out of context

       I just think it's funny that you try to hard to discredit flat earth and this is the best you can do.  Anyone that wants to learn about sunsets can look it up themselves - you appear to have some bizarre type of rage boner going here that you're trying to offend me with and I just think it's hilarious :)

       Actually, you did not start out asking a question.  You said you would love a flat earther to explain something to you - so I suggested that you go look on youtube.  Then you asked me to do it, and now because I refuse to give in to your demand you're acting like I am unable to.  It's really very juvenile and if you had any real arguments against flat earth - besides the appearance of the sun - as it sets on a horizontal and level horizon (which proves its flat) - then I assume you would use them :)

       The earth is certainly flat and motionless - go measure anywhere you like.  You'll find out it's flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is that the luminaries - though they do move in predictable ways, their position cannot be triangulated accurately.  This is acknowledged by mainstream science.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also pretty clear the current "flat earth movement" - i.e., FECore - are all a bunch of total shills.  So the earth is flat, you won't figure it out by looking at the sun and stars, and there's certainly a controlled opposition movement of fake flat earthers trying to ugly up the whole mess.  But you can go measure yourself, it's flat and motionless.

       I think it's better to view the Earth as a hundred sided die- it's not going to be round to the human eye and in fact it's better understood as a bunch of flat pieces linked together that, when one steps back from it, look like a sphere.

       The flat earth model is much better than the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The globe has no credible experiments to defend it, and to verify the flat model all you need is a decent digital camera or telescope and a landmark.  You can verify it from almost anywhere on earth :)
      </p>
      <p>
       The globe falls short in many areas.  Check out "Kings Dethroned" by Gerrard Hickson for your tour.  He wasn't even a flat earther but he wrote an entire book detailing all the problems with the heliocentric model.  It's the trash :)

       You're not asking me to learn the answers, you're asking me to harass me.  The answers are very simple and you've been trying to confuse this subject for years.  You have literally spent years arguing the same points no matter how many times I've explained them to you - no matter how many threads pop up, you seem to be persistently ignorant of basic flat earth information and only out to attack and discredit the point of view despite being totally ignorant of it :)

       Well let's start by listing off some observations that are evidence of Earth moving.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        CMD Dipole.
       </li>
       <li>
        CMD Dipole annual variation.
       </li>
       <li>
        Yearly meteor showers (where the hell is that debris coming from and why every year at the same time?).
       </li>
       <li>
        Yearly variations of the Doppler shift of stars.
       </li>
       <li>
        Stellar parallax.
       </li>
       <li>
        Viewable constellations change throughout the year.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And a few that show the Earth is rotating.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        No change in apparent size of the sun.
       </li>
       <li>
        Sun moves at 15 degrees per hour across the sky no matter where you are.
       </li>
       <li>
        Coriolis Force.
       </li>
       <li>
        We launch rockets as close to the equator as possible for a reason.
       </li>
       <li>
        Track the ISS (and/or most satellites) and you'll notice that after each orbit it will have moved West.

       Again, you are clearly new to this and not very familiar with the flat earth.  You appear to think you know best without ever having investigated flat earth - which is a common position I've found.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're really curious, check out Kings Dethroned.  It explains in great detail how we can KNOW FOR CERTAIN that the heliocentric model is a broken abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you're doing is interpreting evidence through the current framework.  Notice how you listed no experimental evidence?  No proofs that the everyday person could perform?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, your silence re:who proved the earth is moving speaks volumes.  No mainstream scientist has ever been credited with proving that the earth moves or rotates on an axis - these are nothing more than ideas or more abstractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       All visual tests you can perform will indicate that the horizon is flat and that bodies of water are flat and not convex - all motion tests you can perform will indicate the earth is motionless and does not spin or rotate.  If all the tests confirm that the earth is flat and motionless, why do you continue to assume it's a spinning ball based on merely your abstractions and observations that you cannot verify with experimentation?
      </p>
      <p>
       All scientific evidence (scientific meaning independently observable and repeatedly testable) indicates that earth is flat and motionless.

       Sure stuff like the CMB and Doppler shift are a bit much for the average individual, but the others are VERY much achievable. Are you telling me someone can't observe the angular difference between Polaris and Sigma Octantis? That they can't measure the rate at which the Sun crosses the sky? Track the ISS? Find evidence of the Coriolis force? Please.

       Again, in a discussion about the shape of the earth, it's very silly to continue to make your judgments based on the motion of the celestial bodies.  You could very easily just look at the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Measure the earth - it's flat and motionless.  Not a single one of your observations directly relates to the shape of the earth - at all.  You haven't even mentioned "earth" in any of your points.

        Again, in a discussion about the shape of the earth, it's very silly to continue to make your judgments based on the motion of the celestial bodies.

       Stop dodging. Models are supposed to have predictive power. They should lead us to other properties of reality. If those properties are confirmed, it helps show the validity of the model.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Flat Earth model implies certain properties of reality. Such as...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        No star can be more than 90 degrees from Polaris (at least no viewable star).
       </li>
       <li>
        A single celestial pole.
       </li>
       <li>
        Varying speed of the Sun as it moves from the tropic of cancer/capricorn, leading to varying degrees of movement across the sky over the course of the year.
       </li>
       <li>
        A close Sun means a significant horizontal component exists. The sun should progressively grow in the morning and then begin shrinking after noon.
       </li>
       <li>
        The sun would appear to rise towards the north during the equinox for an observer at the equator.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Why does reality contradict the model? What explanations do you have?

       You continue to try to discern the shape of the earth by staring at the sky - sorry, but if you're not willing to address the shape of the earth yet still want to insist you're experienced in "flat earth research" then I really don't have any way to help you.

       Unbelievable. You continue to handwave the issues away. For the sake of conversation, we both agree the earth is flat. Now, what are your explanations for those observations? Surely you agree that they don't conform to what we'd expect, right?

       As I've stated repeatedly and you continue to gloss over apparently - the motion of the Sun and stars is not conclusive proof of the shape of the earth.  This is terribly flawed reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there are also no experimental observations which can be make that indicate the Sun is ~93 million miles away.  The post you linked is extremely uninformed and this sort of material does not surprise me, coming from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The poster doesn't understand that we cannot triangulate the position of the Sun accurately - all of his work is based on the assumption that the triangulations are accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, he has no direct measurements which indicate the earth is round or that there is any curvature - because there is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       For someone who has been at this for years, I find your posts and attitude to be shallow and pedantic.  I would have thought there would be some progress in flat earth denial around here over the last couple years but it doesn't seem like it - you are still super clueless about the basics of the reality we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who looks into Flat Earth with an open mind and is willing to do their own research and experimentations can easily find the truth - that the earth is flat and motionless.

You, like usual, show up and claim that FE is nonsense with no actual argumentation or evidence and then because you are unable to make any sort of cogent argument, you start attacking me.

       Dude the guy you are arguing with, wadewilsonpope, only seems to pop up on flat earth threads and he claims it's because he's interested in space. Dude doesn't participate in any other discussion threads except for the FE / fake space threads. Fishy no?

       There are dozens of accounts that appear only to bash and deny the flat earth.  It's generally the same accounts that have been showing up this way for literally years in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       They show up in swarms acting like anti-intellectual bullies, spamming the threads with insults and demands just trying to dump all over FE threads to make them unrecognizable and painful to sort through - like it's their job.  It's very fishy in my opinion :)

       I agree. I think I used to have a similar mentality in high school when I thought I knew everything about the world. I just continued learning after I graduated. These people either stopped learning or continued milking the teat of institutional academia. Resorting to the phrase "prove it" is like a child closing his eyes and saying that if he doesn't see something, it doesn't exist. It's just lazy. Most people aren't looking for you to prove it, only for you to post something they've already planned to refute.

       It's really that simple. No other argument is needed to completely disprove Flat Earth. The Earth is obscuring the Sun relative to our position as it rotates. This cannot be explained by the Flat Earth model.

       I’ve studied the media and completely believe the so called “movement” is definitely run by shills. Can we observe 15 degrees per hour though? Is that possible on a flat plane? I’m looking for this to be debunked and it doesn’t look like it can be, which proves globe. I’m with you on every other proof but how do we explain this?

       The issue with the 15° per hour is that on a flat model it would still travel in a circle. Therefore still 15° per hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world was measured by hand by tens of thousands of men over hundreds of years. A 66' chain some stakes and a theodolite. Once data was amassed from all over the world and compared using Euclidean geometry errors occured. Once spherical algebra was utilized this error diasapeared. And the size of this sphere? A few percent off of what Eratosthenes calculated 2200 years ago

       Anyone with high school math skills can redo this work. That's why you don't see university grads regurgitating flat earth nonsense. Except to fool the weak and gullible.

       On a flat earth, the sun would moving closer to you in the morning, and further away in the afternoon. This means it would appear to accelerate through the sky in the morning, then decelerate in the afternoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because of perspective (that favourite of the 'flat earth crowd).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TvNyXv0.png">
        Here is why:
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In this image when the sun is further away from you, even though it moves the same physical distance, it covers a smaller angle of your field of view. When it is close to you, the exact same physical distance covers a much larger angle of your field of view. It would
       <em>
        appear
       </em>
       to be moving much faster when it is close than when it is far away.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the real earth, this doesn't happen. In the early morning, the sun covers the same angle of your view as it does at lunch time. This is because the sun
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       getting closer to you, it is rotating into view, and the speed of the rotation is constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter where you are on the planet, no matter what time of day, the sun
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       covers the same angle in your field of view in an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is utterly impossible on a flat earth where the sun is moving closer to and further away from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is yet
       <em>
        another
       </em>
       simple observable fact that utterly disproves the flat earth model.

       Right. Of course. And not altering in size, and setting and there being absolutely no math at all to corroborate a flat earth.

       If you are in Australia the sun would move smaller degrees when it came towards you then faster when above then slower when away.

       Fake theories? Damn probably most of them. Remember we're just regular people and TPTB have a full time staff. Entire offices dedicated to disinformation and infiltration of radical groups. As soon as we find something real they come in and lay false trails and when we aren't actively going after something juicy they build elaborate false leads for us to waste time on. Its as simple as coming in here and other forums and just starting fights or straight up lying about the facts to lead the casuals away. There is so much information now that instead of fighting to suppress they fight to push out so much info no one can put the pieces together. I mean just look at how they treat FOI requests- nothing for years and then wham literal tons of documents. Good luck finding anything either way.

       It's a misunderstanding. Space observations have long been made with digital photography for obvious reasons, and so in some stupid sense the pictures are "doctored" by the processing algorithms that produce the images from layers of collected data. However, early satellite images were indeed captured on film, and NASA has more recently taken whole Earth shots on real film and can easily do so again.

       There is a shitload of science that would pretty much fall apart if the earth was not round.  I respect it when people have specific questions that there do not seem to be answers for.  I do not respect it when people form beliefs contrary to evidence.  Anyone who believes the earth is flat needs to form the questions they do not have answers for.  Then, they can go do independent research because answers for those questions are likely to be readily available.  Then, if they have questions where the answers actually
       <em>
        are not
       </em>
       readily available, come back and ask the questions!

       The Earth is a ball of matter just like every other body we see out in space. There are thousands of simple ways to observe and measure this basic fact. The Flat Earth movement has been amplified through a CIA psyop. It was a brainwashing experiment with the intended side effect of discrediting conspiracy communities. The heliocentric model can be conclusively proven by watching the terminator of Venus for a couple of years, and this simple geometric observation has been known since the invention of telescopes. People who don't understand this are unspeakably gullible or else they are not genuine.

       We might have told some fibs early in the moon program for falsely inflated Cold War bragging rights, but we definitely went there multiple times. All it would take is funding and the political mandate to go back again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have lost interest in having these debates over and over. It is a waste of time because the number of people with genuine doubts is exceedingly small and the resolutions to those doubts are conclusive and totally satisfying.

       In my youth my father was
       <em>
        vocal
       </em>
       about the NASA/Moon bs. So, while I greatly respected my father, I still had to pass the stuff they expected of me at school. My head had to be in two Worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've flown in a Cessna plane over the Utah Salt Flats and up through the glacier leading to Mt. McKinley - I never thought to "observe" a flat aspect because why would I? We're told the Earth is huge and it is a ball. Except when it is Pear Shaped. Except when NASA photo shops Earth Rise from the Moon. Or when they fake a video/photo of the Moon crossing the Earth.
      </p>

       The Midnight Sun is something to experience and so is extreme long darkness. Both are disorienting to your body and your brain. I've been on a fishing rig out of Sitka in a fog blanket that rolled in and losing the Sun and the sense of Shore made me so sick - all I could do was trust the lovely Inuit Captain, while I puked over the side.

       Using the Stars on a deep black Moonless night on a sled, the mushers headlamp streaming out well in the distance until suddenly it bounces back closer, we're almost off the lake! As the tree line comes out of the blackness...the peaceful swooshing of the sled changes to the landscape I cannot see, the dogs pulling toward the smells they knew with no trail and the Musher knowing every shift of his weight in concert with the dogs - the light is bouncing crazy now off the trees blackness! I hunker down, knowing we have five miles of pulling and I need to relax. We're going up but it all feels effortless to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the earliest spiritual/religious peoples depict a flat earth. It all changed, so we're told when Math and Science took over. The Antikythera mechanism - does it favor geocentric or heliocentric? You decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth be told the Earth is in terrible shape because people are shitty toward one another. The Pederast crap nearly broke me. I went looking into Flat Earth for a mental reprieve, much like others that consider Aliens, Time Travel, Hollow Earth.

       I think people should reject that type of thinking.  I also happen to believe you should reject the FE idea because its absolutely based on nonsense.  Depending on how you look at things, at least NASA has something behind it, something you can look at and look into.  Don't mean I buy into everything they do.

       Unbelievable. You continue to handwave the issues away. For the sake of conversation, we both agree the earth is flat. Now, what are your explanations for those observations? Surely you agree that they don't conform to what we'd expect, right?
