       As someone who has had two definitive daylight sightings of a UFO in my 42 years, it frustrates me to hear someone who used to be so open minded about most things, totally dismiss any credible witnesses such as military pilots as crazy. Tonight he dismissed many pilots eyewitnesses accounts as crazy or "attention seekers".  His argument was that if you place 100 people in a room one of them is going to be crazy. Then he brought up ball lighting.  I'm marveling that he didn't bring up swamp gas.  This guys seems like someone got to him. Almost as if he touched a nerve along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had backed off big time regarding his moon landing claims and seems to cower if anyone brings it up. He won't even mention the Van Allen radiation belt anymore and claims he doesn't know enough about science to discuss it. Yet he will demolish the idea of UFO'S with fervor, which he also knows nothing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims that this ideology comes from a show he did where he spent time with believers in UFO's and Bigfoot. So this guy is basing his viewpoint on a subject based entirety off people with no psychological profile, discovered by television producers. Seemingly lumping them in with trained military pilots simply because "his BS meter is on point".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was amazed at how quickly he took over the conversation to shut it down. To reference his experiences with these guests from his old show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe someone got to him. He's scared of something.

       He has had a new studio for months. Took over a year to build. And no I don't. Google will be your friend here. I watch his podcasts regularly and even the guests are like "holy fuck this place is insanity"

       It wasn't completed back in October either if I remember correctly. I haven't seen a tour of it but I know it has a fully operational membership sized gym, a regulated sized axe throwing range, some float tanks, and lots of floor space for grappling. He's recently added lots of crazy equipment to the gym. Follow him on FB and it shows updates often. It's still a pretty insane piece of property to do podcasts out of. But he's said he doesn't like leaving his property haha

       What's your point? For Hollywood this is nothing. Rob Dirdick(sp.) (c list celeb at best) had a similar warehouse. Who cares? You think the CIA is forcing him to deny conspiracy in exchange for a better work space? That's just silly bs. The media company he works for finances this and probably uses it to promote the show, produce other shows, and sublease for other projects.

       Actually Rob Dyrdek (actual spelling for the lazy commentors) founded Alien Workshop and was sponsored by DC for over 20 years. He does NOT own and did not build the Fantasy Factory building. Joe Rogan is 100% owner of his property.  Not any company. I legit never ever even said a thing about the fucking CIA, that is 100% all you. I didn't say "hay guyz jo rogaman is a CIA paid operative!!" But he has obviously made the transition to shill if you paid any attention to him. Did that mean some kind of big money pay out? Possibly. If you think Rogan being a D level TV star and a podcaster makes him rich enough to easily pay for such extravagance you are sadly mistaken. Even his weak contract commenting on the UFC barely ever anymore isn't worth dick all. I never claimed he didn't make more than Alex Jones.....where does that even come from? Does Alex Jones own a huge fucking warehouse filled with extravagant toys?

       I believe in aliens, but how is it possible that so many people have seen them, many times in broad daylight, over a period of so many years, yet no one has ever recorded a conclusive video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the number of sightings you’d expect there to be hundreds, if not thousands, of such videos.

       It's confusing, to say the least. And for that matter, what makes people think UFOs need to have bright lights coming from their exhaust, or to be visible at all? These aliens traveled
       <em>
        faster than light
       </em>
       but they couldn't figure out how to stop it coming from their exhaust or bouncing off their ship?

       If they did come, it's unlikely they are anything like the organisms that evolved on earth, for the reasons you explained. So it's safe to say they aren't murderous savages like most of humanity, which means they're either benevolent, indifferent, or absent. Although, it is possible they're just as bad as humanity but are more sneaky than us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are harvesting our souls or something, they probably wouldn't want to alert us to their presence or technology since that would put us one step closer to resisting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. I think it's possible they've come, but I have a hard time imagining why a civilization capable of FTL travel would want or need anything we have on our little rock. Even if they did want to harvest our souls, it should be trivial for them to abduct a few thousand of us to seed their cloning facilities at which point they'd have no real reason to keep visiting somewhere presumably so far away.
      </p>
      <p>
       My money is on indifference, given the vastness of the universe and the magnitude of time, but absence is a distinct possibility.

       id hope theyd be some kind of post organic beings, downloaded consciousnesses into synthetic bodies impervious to aging
      </p>
      <p>
       satisfying intellectual curiosity makes absolute sense, with a starfleet style directive to not interfere. perhaps wishful thinking. but this is how i would spend an eternal life, traveling to distance planets, exploring how evolution has taken place in different solar systems and planets and ecosystems, time being completely irrelevant with some sort of infinite energy source and a body and conciousness that does not degrade or that can be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       that or as soon as an organism gets intelligent enough to create things like nuclear weapons it inevitably uses them on 'itself' (other tribes) and wipes out life, leaving evolution to start all over again and repeat the cycle for billions of years on end until the local sun's expiration date.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: thinking about it more, i think you are right. if they have invented FTL travel(necessary for anything close to what we'd understand as organic life) they wouldnt need anything we have, so the risk of viking style pillaging seems lower. if they needed it they couldnt make it, if they could make it they wouldnt need it

       I would do the same, although I have to wonder if they would be closer to what we’d consider organic than what we would consider synthetic. It seems like the only reason we view “synthetic” as we do is because of our own limitations with respect to manufacturing. You can bet if we were capable of engineering nanoscale structures on a significant level that our “machinery” would appear more organic than mechanical. As it stands, there’s a limit to how precisely we can engineer artificial structures, so we end up with machines with distinguishable individual pieces. Something like DNA though is capable of handling quite a bit of information, and organic structures are able to affect movement at minuscule scales - for example bacteria. DNA is efficient, self-replicating, and self-evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine their mechanical structure is probably closer to what we’d call organic than synthetic, even if it is deliberately engineered. Maybe they live at the microscopic scale and only grow larger when they need to smash something like us as we would smash a bug. Would probably make FTL travel more feasible, at least.

       He had a theory, like all of us do right - Because it would be very short sighted and downright arrogant to believe out own theories, with no HARD evidence, are 100% true.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had a theory that the moon landings were a hoax. He did reseaech, then came to his own conclusion that in fact, man has landed on the moon. He has explained this multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the sign of a TRUE truth seeker. One who is willing to entertain all sides, and research and then isn't afraid to either go against mainstream opinion or more importantly, isn't afraid to admit they have changed their own views due to evidence or research they have found.

       My beliefs are always challenged. I'm not saying I am 100% sure man landed on the moon or I'm 100% sure we didn't. With evidence I've researched, I beleive we did.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Joe, I don't know. For this particular CT he's been fairly transparent as to why and how his opinion changed. Fair enough, he may have changed in his general demeanor, in your opinion, however the moon landing thing was a poor analogy to use to demonstrate this change imo, when he has been so open about how he changed his view.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, imo, I've noticed he has become far more conservative then he used to be. Just imo.

       If you listen now he is not only more conservative but he actually has an agenda to shut down a lot of stuff people are questioning. Personally I don't k ow the guy so this is all based upon his public persona. All I am saying is there has been a big shift. I do t envy the guy at all hat's off to him.

       Yeah, I think you can understand Joe Rogan a little better if you realize 10-20 years ago he was a newly rich person, who got a little bit of information on how Hollywood and the world worked, and he was smoking a bunch of weed and DMT, and watching 6 hour grainy conspiracy documentaries about the moon landing with Doug Stanhope (who I saw giving him shit for this.) Of course Joe talked about this to anyone who would listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he's older, wiser, more mature. He still sees that shit is going on around there, but he's a bit embarrassed about his younger self. Imagine if you managed to build a following around talking about some of the first conspiracy stuff you were exposed to?

       I like to call them UAPs.  My mom and I saw an unidentified aerial phenomena when we were hanging up laundry in the California desert. I dunno what was inside though.

       Hey friend, I was curious if you could give me some information on how the object looked like to you when you encountered them? I'm interested because I saw something last week-ish which I am still trying to comprehend in my mind as to what it actually was. I'll try and explain my own experience and it would be interesting to see if yours was similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was staying over my at parents place and whenever I do I'm forced to smoke outside. Not really a big deal for me because I love going outside during nighttime and do some casual star gazing. Now when I looked up I saw these 4 bright light's which seemed to move in formation, sadly they were only visible for about 20 seconds because quickly after I spotted it (them?) it disappeared behind the clouds. I wrote down a couple of features of the event in order to make sense of it:
      </p>
      <p>
       4 (In)dependant light sources.
Either faster than or at lower altitude then regular planes. 
At the very least flying above the cloud deck.
They didn't break formation while in flight.
The lights were a continuous transmission not blinking like regular airliners.
I didn't have any audio data because I was listening to music at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really baffled my mind though was that a couple days later having trouble getting to sleep and browsing random youtube videos I came across a thumbnail which had 4 really similar looking lights in it. I'll add a screencap + link to the youtube channel itself so you can actually see what I meant. "My" four lights were in pretty much a straight line though, perhaps a slight curve but not as dramatic as in the picture below. *(note it only shows the image in the screencap, the video itself doesn't actually contain the image so no reason to actually watch it if you don't want to.)

      <p>
       I think you can already see in the link where I made the screencap from so i'll just add a link to his video feed for the lazy.

      <p>
       If anyone has any idea what It could've been please enlighten me, I mean I don't really understand why ET's would need flashlights on their crafts, and I figured it could have had something to do with refraction but that would still leave me with 1 object trying to illuminate my city from a significant distance.

       No one goes from Apollo moon landing denial to belief/defense of the Apollo program; it simply doesn't work like that. It would be like learning algebra then forgetting how to add.

       He also has such classic and airtight arguments against Flat Earth Theory such as "it's fucking curved," "you can see that shit," and "everyone would have to be lying."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the company he brings on his show to help him in his gatekeeping assignments: people like Lawrence Krauss and Black Science Man, icons of atheistic Big Bang-ism. This should tell you all you know.

       There are so many people who have given so much testimony of their experiences in witnessing unidentified flying objects.  It shows manifest contempt for the sincerity and integrity of others to disregard what they have to say about what they have seen, one and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes little imagination to comprehend that the technology and science existing in the world in the early 21st century would be utterly incomprehensible - even alien - to someone who lived in the 17th or even 18th century.  One must wonder how much technological and scientific change lies ahead of us as we look forward a mere 3 or 4 centuries.  The world will no doubt change so as to be quite unrecognizable in this regard.  I say this because once technology and science have taken hold on a planet all the rules for life on that planet undergo a fundamental change, and very quickly, too.  It is, in the grand scheme of things, an instant change and the future no longer looks very much like the past.  The future is now completely unpredictable once technology and science enter the picture.  We who grasp and accept this must readily acknowledge that literally anything is possible.  It hasn't even been a hundred years yet that Edwin Hubble discovered that there are other galaxies!  It is absurd that anyone should conclude that there is no such thing as an unidentified flying object, especially since there are so many testimonies to the contrary.

       I think he wants to impress the mainstream intellectuals he has on the show. He's been embarrassed of his older shows where he is a conspiracy theorist and was very open minded (he was trying to copy Jesse Ventura).

       Joe is Mr. Contradiction and just talks out of his ass. His moods change because he is high all the time. His shadow self comes out occasionally, like when he yelled at Steven Crowder over weed.
      </p>
