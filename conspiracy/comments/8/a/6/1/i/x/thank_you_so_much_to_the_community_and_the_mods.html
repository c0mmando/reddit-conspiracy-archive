    <div class="md"><p>Funny that you say that because I seldom got along with my teachers in school lol :P</p>

<p>I&#39;m sucking up to the &quot;teachers&quot; here because I think this is the best sub on Reddit? Look at my comment history- there&#39;s months of comments to back up why I would say that. No need to suck up- I was driven off of r/politics after the convention. I saw r/wikileaks get co-opted in October of &#39;16, I saw r/pizzagate shut down. And I found my way here- it&#39;s the only place left on Reddit to discuss many things, and to discuss them with people of all different views.</p>

<p>You have a funny way of looking at stuff. And I have no reason to &quot;suck up&quot; to anyone here lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To each their own. Just stating my opinion. Although I agree with you that I have a funny way of looking at stuff.  I primarily just say anything that provokes a new line of thinking, seldom do I truly state my true intentions, or uncover my true beliefs. I use reddit for a entirely different reason than most, mainly to read others thoughts, and when I comment it is only to further my own entertainment. I&#39;m sure 99% of the users that come across me hate me, but I&#39;m not here to please and passify. On that note, I was only joking, your post just strikes me as odd. Again, I only comment to prvoke information, and now I understand your reasons. Sorry to be that way, just how I go about my reddit life </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the mods do a very good job at only banning based on behavior and not opinions, all sides are and have always been welcome so long as they can conduct in civil discourse within condescending or mocking the person of the other side of the debate. </p>

<p>All of this despite what TMoR and Friendsâ„¢ would attempt to lead you to believe, they simply can&#39;t help themselves when it comes to being outright douchebags and then start crying censorship when their degenerousy is not tolerated.</p>

<p>*Notice how a thread full of positivity is already 60% within 25 minutes, they don&#39;t like when you condone those they harrass (ie. promoters of open and honest rational discussion based on facts and not feelings.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I just wish people could be positive sometimes. This world is so negative and people are so sad and lonely. It&#39;s good to just be grateful sometimes. Like recoveringgrace made a joke once. It was pretty funny. It&#39;s nice having a place to be and feel positive. I think those that feel negative about it, I hope they can feel better.
