        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently learned of this sub and have a story with a question.  </p>

<p>I deliver house building material and occasionally I pick up specialty material from niche-businesses, and there is a warehouse I have picked up attic access doors from a few times and the encounters are increasingly odd. </p>

<p>Within the past year, I have been to this medium-sized warehouse a handfull of times and each time there are different people there, with a very low staff.  I mean less than five people in a big building, and its a big, mostly empty, open room that is more than 30m by 20m.</p>

<p>Around 6 months ago, I was there to pick up some attic doors and there was a large tube in the warehouse.  The tube was roughly 3m diameter and 10m long.  There was a mechanic working on the big plastic tube and I asked him what it was and what it was for.  He said he was working on a prototype for Elon Musk that is a carrier supported by magnets that make a carriage float by +/-. </p>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;ve never seen the same person twice there and today I went there to pick up more attic doors and it was 2:30pm and all the doors to the business were locked.  In the large parking lot there was an old man cleaning out the front seats of a newer jeep that was coated in mud.  I asked him if he knew if the business was open, he said yes and that he would be right back.  </p>

<p>I watched him walk around the other sided of the building and walk in through an unlocked door.  When he returned, he was accompanied by an Air Force Colonel in a flight suit.  I am prior Air Force and recognized his outfit quickly.  The gentleman said to drive to the other side of the building to a certain garage door and there would be my material. </p>

<p>I did as he said and was greeted by a different old man and recieved my material.  No problem, right?</p>

<p>I know this is not much information, thats because I don&#39;t have much to go off of, but this place is fucking weird as shit and I don&#39;t know what to think.  My friend told me about this sub and thought I might get some help.</p>

<p>So, any opinions on what this warehouse is?</p>

<p>TL;DR  ...new here. I go to a weird warehouse that may be into futuristic technology....but idk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shared warehouse space is a big thing.</p>

<p>Someone HUGE like the military owns a warehouse.<br/>
They rent out space as needed to smaller companys to pack/ship/recieve stuff.    </p>

<p>Literally 100&#39;s of companys might be operating out of one building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was actually secret govt stuff.<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t have gotten on the property without a background check etc.  </p>

<p>Or even a defense contractor. Just being called to raytheon to repair an ac unit was interesting.  Full anal probe almost.  lol</p>

<p>It probably isn&#39;t govt owned.  But shared warehouses are a big thing especially in port cities or those near intl/shipping airports.<br/>
Either of those apply to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  In the history of warfare, everything is based off intelligence.   The better the information, the better you can plan.    With over 2,200 satellites in orbit, it&#39;s not unreasonable to assume that most countries are under constant view.<br/>
If you want to mask your military (and capabilities) from their view, underground is the only way to go.  I include secret underground transportation systems.  Some folks call this a conspiracy but it actually make perfect sense.  If it was my call, I would develop a secret underground transportation system as well.</p>

I think,  its a men in black retirement home, and elon musk donated his prototype because puzzles and bingo ain&#39;t gonna cut it keeping those old guys entertained, and the coronel was in full flight suit because he was about to helmet up and take a trip in the tube! Solved, your welcome.</p>

<p>If Musk is involved, I&#39;d say it has to do with his Boring Company, and the &#39;carriage&#39; you describe may be a maglev train carriage prototype. </p>

<p>OK, you&#39;re still sort of &#39;out that way&#39;, relatively speaking. Colorado is allegedly honeycombed with all kinds of underground bases and tunnels. I&#39;d say it&#39;s joint R&amp;D and deployment with Musk and USAF. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not all that uncommon with the shut-down of so many major industries to find some of the larger warehouses they or their original suppliers once occupied being repurposed and shared by multiple small companies and budding enterprises because they have easy access and plenty of storage space that is relatively cheap to rent or lease on a long or short term basis. </p>

<p>Those individual companies may also have offices elsewhere or simply an owner/salesman that communicates incoming shipments and outgoing orders to a few watchmen/warehousemen in either their own the warehouse owner&#39;s employ who will receive and ship those as required. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s light and irregular work retirees often make the best and most reliable ones to do that on an occasional basis. I&#39;ve encountered such circumstances numerous times myself when I did some part time work auditing the physical inventories of all kinds of companies including some on a shoestring just like that which were also reasonably profitable endeavours.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s that potential explanation to possibly take the some of the weirdness out of this situation. </p>

<p>The rest might also be explained by someone tackling a prototype on spec that could be out on tender to numerous individuals to see what they can come up with and the promise of it either being bought for some serious money or future royalties paid if it&#39;s considered to be worth it. </p>

<p>The world also isn&#39;t short of the of the odd, eccentric, and independent inventor looking to hit the bigtime with a better mouse-trap that they already have a buyer in mind for who can&#39;t possibly refuse it, once it&#39;s complete, or so they think. </p>

<p>As for the colonel in his flight suit, they do make excellent work wear for other activities besides the ones they are issued for and the colonel, if he was one, may have had a part-time business or some involvement with one he was briefly attending to or lending a hand in on his own time at that location and as a tenant would know of the others he shared space with and could re-direct our OP to another dock they were now using.</p>

<p>Those are all the reasonable explanations I would have to check and rule out and depending on what kind of responses and reactions I got making some simple enquires to see about possibly renting some space in the place maybe from the attic door warehouseman next time I met one to see whether or something more suspicious was possibly taking place in an innocuous and innocent way to satisfy my own curiosity about it. </p>
