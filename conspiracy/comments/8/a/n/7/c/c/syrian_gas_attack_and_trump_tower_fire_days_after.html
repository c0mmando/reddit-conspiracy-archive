       Wow it's hard to be much more out in the open than that. I'm not a trump fan by any means, but anyone else here think these could be related?

       The CNN report reeks of fakery as well. Random footage, "white helmets", corespondent in "Damascus" (lol ya right, he's in front of a green screen, he could be anywhere), the way the reporter at the beginning is overselling it, the state dept quote about Syrian gov gassing it's own citizens, the mandatory mention of Russia at the end. This is just a video production.

       I really hope people see how absurd of an action this would be for Assad or the Russians to do. In CNN's propaganda piece about Trump pulling out of Russia they argued that Trump announcing he wanted to pull out soon will allow them to just wait until we leave. It's a pretty big leap from there to blaming Assad. I'm interested to see how this plays out.

       Of get off it. The left complains about fox news all day everyday. The only fucking Republican TV station on television. They're the problem, says the left. Nevermind the other 75 channels brainwashing you to HATE. Hate fox. Hate their viewers. Hate ANYONE that identifies as a Republican. Hate anyone that doesn't note down and worship lefty television. Ffs the right gets ONE CHANNEL and dems screen that one channel is the root of all evil.

       Fox is the USA’s largest TV station and they, along with a huge chunk of their audience, have the audacity to bitch and moan about mainstream media, despite The Right has been exposed manipulating Local news as well. Then you have the flood of a thousand serious Right-Wing political pundits and their sheep astroturfing social media. Keep crying about how oppressed you are so you can victimize your victimhood while Conservatives make thousands of videos whining about Leftist.

       I live in Georgia, most of my friends and family are Republican. I was a Republican myself for 10 years before the party got radicalized and started worshipping idiots like Sarah Palin, becoming increasingly toxic, and serving the interest to the Elite.

       Move straw man. Are you going to educate me in why it is 100 channels, 99 of them are far alt left, the other is the one and only channel for conservatives? Oh I get it. That ONE CHANNEL is the problem and should be shut down. Ah

       Because people on the Far-Right whine all the time that anyone who isn’t Far-Right is a Communist, Marxist, SJW, and ect. You said they should be shut down, not me. Funny your first thought of action to news you don’t like is to shut it down XD. I see you didn’t count the hundreds of Right-Wing Sinclair channels. You can’t have anything hurting your weak narrative.

       You keep sidestepping my question. Take your straw man elsewhere. I deal with clown on twitter all day trying to change the subject.

      <p>
       100 channels on cable, 99 of them are FAR LEFT. 99 channels spew the same narrative day in and day out. But fox is the problem for giving you a different perspective from the way you're trained to think. The game is tilted and you're being brainwashed

       Just like you immediately ignore the Sinclair Broadcasting group forcing Right-Wing 'must-runs' on hundreds of local news stations across the country. Or the 99 Far-Right Social media political organizations and personalities spewing primarily Far-Right political propaganda and astroturfing everyday. You can keep whining about how Centrist viewpoints are all too Far-Left, doesn't make it true m8. You can do better than that. Nice try tho ;)

       The more that people do false flags the more that they can sell the narrative that Assad and Putin ado all kinds of random stupidly maniacal acts and that they are just incompetent villains or that at least their underling are.  That seems to work pretty dang well even though its less effective every year.

       Just thought I would include it since the reports came out within hours of each other. Seems like a way to send a message, and possibly relevant. But of course I'm not saying that it means there is for sure a connection. That's why I wanted to start a discussion to see if anyone knew more like how the fire started or how they could be related or something

       Of course if some of the stories about a lack of fire alarms and one of Trump's lawyers having to text residents to notify them to evacuate are true, this fire just may further prove that everything produced by Trump is just a gold-plated turd.

       Yes, because there is a secret society out to overthrow Trump. He is a hero to all, and what appears to be incompetence is really failed attempts by tptb to overthrow him. You are so very right.

       Someone doesn't want the US to leave. Trump says he want out and literally two days later a gas attack happens? Why would Assad, who is winning in Syria and doesn't need to gas anyone because he knows it would hurt him, gas people two days after Trump says that the US is getting out?

       Well, usually when a govt gassed people, it is with logic and reasoning that they have determined that doing so would benefit them in some way. But in this case, there is no benefit to who they are accusing. Assad, who has a long history of mental stability, predictable and had a strong history of upholding religious freedom in his country, really does not seem to be the likely culprit with these gas attacks. Assad just is not a wildcard type person.

       Try telling that to R/Politics. They are in their calling it another Holocaust and calling for war with Russia and assad. They cant even fathom the idea that rebels would kidnap or corral civilians in a tunnel and gas them so they can create more sympathy from Western powers and get them to attack assad and help their islamist regime change.  The fact is that Assad is winning his war against the rebels. Trump is backing out of Syria and there is no logical reason for the Syrian military or supporters to do this. When the rebels who have been proven to fabricate atrocities time and time again have every reason to do this to get western intervention and support in their Islamic revolution.

       I understand the workd is crazy and people dont nake rational decisions. But Lets be real. There's tons if attention on chemical weapons bc of the UK false flag. Why would assad and russia use chemical weapons now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like the two are related. The one in tge UK set the tone of the discussion and this swings the hammer

       he said they would pull out. the same day the US has started to send more troops and equipment in. they never stopped building the bases they have been working on. its just lip service or they will pull people out of range of direct retaliation before going all in.

       You realize majority of the bases and buildings don't even belong to us or once we're done we sell it off to the host country? Therefore, building would continue regardless. The laborers have already been paid, the materials are there, and generally, third country nationals are the laborers. So carry on with what's been paid for and sell it off...
      </p>
      <p>
       No saying I agree or disagree with the overall statement. Just saying them continuing to build, proves nothing.

       Jews killing children for sport with sniper rifles and caught on video bragging about kills was actually starting to be seen by normies.  Had to ratchet up the news cycles and give them something to focus on while that gets forgotten.  Also keeps US in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Entire thing makes no sense for Assad, just like last time they faked a gas attack when Trump wasn't palying ball in Syria.   ISIS on ropes/defeated in both cases, control being established after years fighting for his people, "oh, I know, I'll gas them now!".   It sounds so much more evil when you gas them, too, when more effective ways to mass murder.   It's like the last hospital, which is a name of a hospital, is trotted out as being destroyed and media spins it as the very last hospital in Syria was destroyed and they are in peril with no hospitals for anyone or with the babies pulled out of incubators, a lie used in past atrocity propaganda.   Fuckign white hats and lies and media knows it and still run the story nonstop.

       Trump broadcasts that the United States is pulling out (which he said he would never announce) and then a 'chemical attack' just as war monger Bolton is taking over the NSA. Now the policy can shift to "well we were
       <strong>
        going
       </strong>
       to pull out but
       <strong>
        now
       </strong>
       we have
       <strong>
        no choice
       </strong>
       but to stay and then
       <strong>
        discover Iran is involved somehow
       </strong>
       so we can bring them into the fray which is what Bolton really wants.

       This makes me sick. I’m so tired of the lies from our govt and media about these attacks. Unless Assad has suddenly become a totally different person, and is also suicidal now, he is not gassing his own people. Our govt is well aware of this.

       I don't think Assad would take the risk of this chemical attack, when they are already winning the war. Why would they bomb to involve Americans back to their land, when Trump already said three days ago that he is going to bring the military back? Seems like some vested interest staged this attack, to drag back US to this war and US media is back on their war mongering status. The same pattern we have seen in the past. Last time, Obama missed that opportunity and now this time, I am pretty sure, Trump is going to take it and the missile attacks are soon going to start. It would be interesting to see Iran and Russian response now after all this incident has taken place. The game has just begun!!!!

       Just like you immediately ignore the Sinclair Broadcasting group forcing Right-Wing 'must-runs' on hundreds of local news stations across the country. Or the 99 Far-Right Social media political organizations and personalities spewing primarily Far-Right political propaganda and astroturfing everyday. You can keep whining about how Centrist viewpoints are all too Far-Left, doesn't make it true m8. You can do better than that. Nice try tho ;)

       You realize majority of the bases and buildings don't even belong to us or once we're done we sell it off to the host country? Therefore, building would continue regardless. The laborers have already been paid, the materials are there, and generally, third country nationals are the laborers. So carry on with what's been paid for and sell it off...
      </p>
      <p>
       No saying I agree or disagree with the overall statement. Just saying them continuing to build, proves nothing.
