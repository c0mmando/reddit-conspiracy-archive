       Now, Trump has stated he wishes to withdraw, and 48 hours later, another gas attack happens. This comes just ONE DAY after Russian news service TASS reported that US "coalition partners" Al Nusra Front and Free Syrian Army, were planning a Chlorine Gas attack upon civilians, so as to blame the Assad government and trigger a massive US attack. Keep in mind that the rebels have been discovered with chemical weapons before, especially after liberating East Ghouta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has made it crystal clear they will shoot down US Missiles, then sink the US Navy ships that launch them. This Chlorine gas attack is the exact incident necessary to spark an immediate US strike upon Syria, which will trigger an immediate Russia strike upon US forces, which will trigger an immediate war between the US and Russia. Not good!

       MOSCOW, April 6. /TASS/. Jabhat al-Nusra (a group outlawed in Russia) and the Free Syrian Army are planning chemical attacks with the use of chlorine in areas under their control, including Daraa’s district of Al-Balad, the chief of Russia’s center for the reconciliation of conflicting parties in Syria, Major-General Yuri Yevtushenko, said on Friday.

       Last year's attack was on April 4th..it is still very fishy...but not surprising..Jaysh Al Islam has conducted Chicago weapons attacks before...it's been documented by the UN...

      <p>
       Everyone understands how desperate they are to rain in Douma...

       So, hopefully the media won't be able to push the "Assad gassed his own people" narrative very far....but they will try...

       I believe there were a few Syrian casualties...I would have to double check.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, overall...yes, very little damage..airfield was operational within 24 - 36 hours...what alot of people aren't aware of...alot of the cruise missiles were either destroyed or missed their target completely...so, that played into it as well.

       Some wonder if they were programmed to miss.

       I'm predicting now that they will say the "barrel bomb" landed in a kitchen when it exploded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect they made a bomb out of a refrigerator...
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how these guys operate...I believe they even posted pics on twitter of the truck that had the chemical weapons hidden in it...and the refrigerator...I've said it before..wherever those motorcycle gangs go...chlorine gas attacks follow.

       I have to go by the samples taken, the report filed by the OPCW said it was Sarin or a Sarin-like substance. I realize chain of custody was not followed,  (OPCW didn't take samples from site, nor did they ever visit site) I've read the full OPCW report...I've read the full JIM report.

       I'm more concerned with the strawman narrative they build with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to refute the video proof by pointing to the official reports. This means the user will lose the argument in the public sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not mean they don't have a valid reason for questioning if it was actually Sarin by observing how the attack was responded to...and pointing out the complete lack of proper protective clothing...
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end...they will lose the debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I believe it's wiser to bring up the inconsistencies within the reports themselves...as these will be the proofs leaned upon to support the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I took the time to read the full reports...more than once.

        This comes just ONE DAY after Russian news service TASS reported that US "coalition partners" Al Nusra Front and Free Syrian Army, were planning a Chlorine Gas attack upon civilians, so as to blame the Assad government and trigger a massive US attack.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since is /conspiracy... Wikipedia says TASS is owned by the Russian government so how reliable is their reporting? Maybe they make a fake report that the US side is going to do a gas attack, then do a gas attack themselves, then point to the earlier report and say, see they attacked just like we said they were going to.

       If the people in the region believe that the chemical attack was carried out by the US, then the attack helps Russia. Russia wants the US out of Syria and wants to assert itself as the new regional hegemon. If people in the region think that the US is behind the attack, they will be more likely to welcome the Russians.

       In other words, "who benefits" goes both ways. "Who benefits" is piss poor "analysis."
      </p>
      <p>
       In a criminal case, contrary to what we see on TV, "who benefits" doesn't lead to a conviction. It takes a proven intention and a proven act.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Who benefits" is nothing but a rule of thumb to line up hypothetical suspects.

       Why use chemical weapons when war is going smoothly in assads favor, besides they could still use tos1a balzingsun system, which is as deadly and no one will bet an eye. It will smoke them out of their rat holes

       For the record Trump only bombed Syrian airbase as a negotiating tactic with the Chinese president. Which was why it was where it was, and limited. The tactic worked as the meeting was a success.

       When did Russia "make it crystal clear" they would sink US Navy ships?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Russians really did report ahead of time that the US was going to launch a chemical attack, then it makes you wonder if the Russians are the ones who carried out the attack in an attempt to blame it on the US. Russia is trying to replace the US as the hegemon in the region -- has for a very long time.

        March 20: Syria’s Eastern Ghouta militants prepare chemical attack provocation, Russian MoD tipped off
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Militants holed up in Eastern Ghouta are preparing to stage a “false flag” attack to accuse the Syrian government forces of using chemical weapons against civilians, Russia’s Defense Ministry said, citing a tip from a local.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday, the Russian Reconciliation Center received a phone call from one of the residents of the al-Wanar quarter of Eastern Ghouta, who warned of possible preparations for a “provocation” with the use of chemical agents. According to the tip-off, Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra)
        <strong>
         terrorists have placed “hermetically sealed containers,” which could contain poisonous substances, next to a self-engineered turbine on one of the roofs in the Damascus suburb.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         “The terrorists, according to [the caller], could use those preparations to spray chemical agents in residential areas, which will lead to a large number of casualties among civilians,”
        </strong>
        Major-General Yuri Yevtushenko announced on Monday.
        <strong>
         “The mass poisoning of civilians will be used to accuse the government troops of the use of chemical weapons against peaceful citizens.”
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not the first time Moscow has raised concerns about possible provocations using chemical agents in Syria.
        <strong>
         Russia believes that such an attack will be widely covered in the Western media and may ultimately be used as a pretext by the US-led coalition to launch strikes against Syrian government forces.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Washington repeatedly warned that it would conduct more air strikes against Syrian forces if chemical weapons are used in the country.
        <strong>
         French President Emmanuel Macron also promised to “strike” Syria if any evidence emerges that chemical weapons were used against civilians.
        </strong>

       You don't play chess do you. That is an absolutely ludicrous strategy, the end game completely blowing up in Syria and Russia's face. Figuratively, and

       It was obvious then as it is now that the "rebels" are attacking the areas they hold in order to keep the USA involved. It's the "Kuwaiti incubators" hoax all over again, except it's not fake, it's all too real as they not just lying about it they're actually DOING it...
