       This is her Instagram which is now private after Q started talking about her, regardless of your opinion on Q she is weird and her connections are weird
      </p>
      <p>
       The main post being discussed is the security feed which is pretty spooky I will say.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly I want to bring up the Pic with Eminem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been suspicious of him for awhile, his new music is just wrong and artificial, and looking back no one can reach the highest echelons of fame and fortune without selling their soul in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the picture of this woman with Eminem she points out that she was 16 years old, not much of stretch to guess that she slept with Eminem and gave Interscope or whoever the proof therefore making Eminem a permanent lapdog who would be thrown in jail for statutory rape if he ever went off the rails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also apparently she hangs out with Bill Clinton

       His music was always artificial.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a rapper for who being white was enough, who had to bleached his hair and release pop songs like "Hi, My Name Is" from day one to sell records.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was manufactured from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to make me laugh when he would be tearing in to Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera and NSYNC for being garbage pop when he was exactly the same if not worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       A manufactured pop star "dissing" other manufactured pop stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       His music got a lot worse when his main ghost writer was murdered over a game of billiards.

       Indeed, elites of the music industry im sure were aware people were catching on o the artificiality of mainstream pop, so they designed the perfect mainstream rapper to appeal to their more "disenfranchised" fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I agree he was always artificial, but on the surface he doesn't seem that way to his target fanbase

       Nice gate-keeping.

       Just an fyi though, we aren't talking about rap, we are talking about a manufactured pop star.

      <p>
       My interpretation of the phrase "goes hard" is that it is a positive leaning thought terminating cliche, much like the term "hater" is/was used as a negative leaning thought terminating cliche used to dismiss without consideration anyone who critiqued a rapper.

       indeed.   There is still hip hop out there if youre really looking.   but yes that album was awesome .  However I saw Kweli recently in concert and was quiet disappointed.    He spit zero verses, only sang his choruses.  Stopped his portion of the show temporarily so he could step off stage and get a drink.  And did maybe 20 mins.  Also talked shit on The Roots for "taking a day job."  Dude fell way the fuck off in my opinion.

       Many people consider Rap God to be an exceptional rap song because of the quantity and quality of internal, slant, &amp; multi-syllabic rhyme schemes, its cadence, and the speed/fluidity with which Eminem raps it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no doubt it has pop appeal, but in terms of rapping, it's impressive because of the structure of the song, which covers a variety of topics on top of its impressive rhyming/flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say any amateur can write the lyrical miracle rap shit is true, but taken within the musical context of this song, the writing takes on a new meaning, as most amateur rappers have difficulty combining the density of rhymes with sensical meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this all very easily by sitting down with a printed sheet of the lyrics and a couple of markers/highlighters and marking out the rhymes/assonance that Em uses.

      <p>
       Many people believe lots of things that I disagree with, Rap God being an exceptional song is just one of those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The song starts out like this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I get it, genes/jeans... thats the word play here. It's gahbage (*Bigg K air)
      </p>
      <p>
       He then quickly moves on to outdated references with
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then later he says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah, those made up words sure do rhyme very well with those random sounds he made.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one line in the track that I like though
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's dope, but a few lines latter and he's saying this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That just... doesn't work. There is is a song called Alcohol of Fame but's a huge stretch to suggest he is referencing that and even if he is... you can't be inducted in to a song so the wordplay still doesn't make sense, and that's the thing with wordplay, it has to make sense 2,3,4 or 5 ways. If it doesn't make sense in multiple ways it's not wordplay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Towards the end of the second verse he rhymes "looking boy" with "looking boy" eight times.  I know you're probably going to say it's the word before that that rhymes and he changes that each time (gay, face, place, say, day, say (again)), but that shits weak.

       Maybe if someone is young or they haven't had a lot of exposure to rap I can understand them being really impressed by this song but as a fan of the genre for 20+ years, for me, there was nothing in this song that hasn't been done better before. Busta Rhymes and Twista were spitting faster 10-15 years ago than Eminem did on Rap God and they were doing more often and with a lot more substance.

       I dont think you're giving him enough credit. He admits to selling himself to "the devil" in his music. He also has raw talent and skill. He was also straight up saying fuck bush and promoting anarchy in Mosh. His pop stuff is what "radio"(using it in the way Kanye did, the music gatekeepers) wants, and they get it, but he also put raw lyrics into his other songs that go deeper.

       I have never ever liked Eminem. Even when I was a kid and all my friends were into him, I just saw how fake and staged he was. None of my friends would hear a bad word said about him. They were celebrating how he was tearing up Detroit, how they felt sorry for him for his bitch ex girlfriend and how he should have never been sent to prison. (bear in mind we are English, not American...)
      </p>
      <p>
       All of it is fake as fuck and IMO it has ruined what rap was. I admit I have never been a fan of rap, but even I can tell how it has gone from tough lessons and hardship to glorifying bitches and hos.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's amazing is that rap is the only 'social group' that I know of that hasn't had to change their lyrics, social views or language. The whole idea of pop-rap being that the viewpoint of men should be "shoot niggers, fuck bitches" with homophobic undertones to boot. I wonder why they haven't had to clean up their act...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...is it because, just like Eminem, it's just an act?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I liked Eminem, I would now dislike him for the same reasons I now dislike southpark; they preach about doing whatever you want In life, fuck everybody who tries to silence you or stop you. Now in the golden years of their careers, built upon years of success of telling everybody to do what they want, they're now telling everybody to be the people who they themselves originally hated/took the piss out of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, to finish this rant off, notice (EVEN ON THIS FORUM!) How much stick you get for slagging off Eminem.

       I am old enough to remember when metal was at it's heyday in the early 80's - and all the backlash over lyrics, etc. I think tptb knew that metal artists and listeners are pretty smart cookies so they had to turn to the budding rap scene to build their subversion on. Because who's going to have the balls to criticize or
       <em>
        gasp
       </em>
       stifle the creative voice of the black people (especially after the social engineering in college about how terrible white people are)? And here we are.

       You were lucky to see Metal in its' heyday. What I wouldn't give to see Cliff Burton ripping it up on Bass.

       I remember watching some old court room footage of the PMRC (?) trying to silence (I think alice cooper?), but all of the members of the PRMC expected this 'devil-worshipping' angry man to be stupid. Unfortunately for them and fortunately for us, Metal/rock stars are some of the most educated entertainers in the world.

       His new album is the worst shit ever. I've been a lifelong fan but this shit is definitely a deal breaker. Almost unlistenable.  I've lost all respect for him after this steaming pile of shit.

       Indeed, elites of the music industry im sure were aware people were catching on o the artificiality of mainstream pop, so they designed the perfect mainstream rapper to appeal to their more "disenfranchised" fans.
