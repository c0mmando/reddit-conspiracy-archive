<p>Congratulations <a href="/u/Oof_too_Humid">/u/Oof_too_Humid</a>. Your post is the highest voted post on radiofrequency radiation ever on Reddit. I often search for radiation posts in other subs to comment and crosspost. Almost all are downvoted to zero. There are bots downvoting posts on radiofrequency even in my sub <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. </p>

Get some indica. Smoke several hits a day from it on usually dank indica and tell me that shit won&#39;t force you to organize your life and build up your memory recall skills. How long for and how frequent do you smoke? As far as flower goes the gravity bong is another level from anything except vaping. Stronger imo albeit harsher </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a physics teacher, an ex nuclear physicist no less, who was adamant about the fact that wireless technology uses micro and radio waves, which are a lower frequency than visible light. Since they carry lower energy, they are less harmful than visible light. X rays and gamma rays are so dangerous because they are much higher frequency than visible light, which is why they are so dangerous. So to my knowledge, fortunately cell phone radiation isn’t dangerous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that&#39;s fair, but the energy levels we&#39;re dealing with when it comes to phones are unlikely to cause any concern on that front. A warm breeze will do more to change the temperature of our body than a phone ever will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s certainly true, but there is a specific concern about 4G cell phone bands overlapping with the resonant frequency of water, which is 2.45 GHz. The principle behind resonant frequencies is that energy is pumped into the system and stored with very little damping between cycles. In my opinion, it would be a very bad idea to continuously operate any radio device near 2.45 GHz, however the 4G band goes up to 2.5 GHz. </p>

they operate! Unfortunately, ionizing radiation isn&#39;t the only harmful property....I think even lower frequencies can cause biological heating affects (damaging proteins and some shit).
It&#39;s probably even deeper than that, but just what I currently know.
My advice: reduce exposure whenever possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is nonsense. The frequency is independent of the power.</p>

<p>Or are you telling me that Earth&#39;s magnetic field (0.033 Hz) is just as powerful as a Wireless Router (1-5Ghz).</p>

<p>Obviously not, there is a unit called magnetic strenght (Tesla) and one for electric strength (V/m).</p>

<p>The frequency is a totally independent unit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s literally in the math and physics. Magnetic fields affect things in completely different ways than electric fields do, by the way. And neither of those things are electromagnetic radiation, which is what light is, and how wireless communication is done. Power is energy over time, and energy carried by a wave is proportional to frequency. You can read it in any physics textbook.</p>

<p>The frequencies you are talking about are of different types and concentration. Anyway, according to Wikipedia, the magnetic field of the earth resonates at 2kHz. And things like routers are oscillating circuits and not magnets. Point being, neither of those things are radiation. In the case of light, frequency does indicate energy level by definition</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, back to the frequency issue.  </p>

<p>5g is at 15GHz. 4g at 2.6GHz.  </p>

<p>This means that 5g will cause more body heating than 4g (let&#39;s say 15/2.5 = 30x faster heating.  I forget, it&#39;s at least proportional.)   However, you can carry more data at 5g, so you aren&#39;t required to transmit as long (30x less!) for the same information, which will reduce total heating.  </p>

<p>For the same information, it becomes nix.  5g, will, however, be absorbed by your surroundings more, and won&#39;t penetrate walls as much. If you want to penetrate walls more, you have to increase the power.</p>

<p>5g is a microwave in your pocket.  The exact limitations and results are yet to be seen, but the limitations are strictly controlled by US and EU law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you are trying to say, but the danger is not the frequency per se. </p>

<p>The danger is the additional power draw from the new feaures that bandwidth requires. Simply put the increased bandwidth is just to carry more data in less time.</p>

<p>But the power required to modulate and transmit the data is the radiation source.</p>

<p>You can literally have gamma rays with tiny power and it would be harmless, or have extremely powerful magnets on tiny frequency and be dangerous.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the frequency that matters but the power radiation per square meter.</p>

<p>They clearly don&#39;t cause major health problems, which may sound like I contradict myself above.  They can increase your rate of tumor development.  The magic pill is simply placing them further away from your body more often -- even a foot makes a huge difference.  Use headphones to talk if you are on the phone a lot, if you can, to create a larger separation between you and the phone.  Otherwise you may find your ear to get warm.  This was more true in older phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I am just taking about any earpiece,earbut, whatever it&#39;s called.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a magnet, that vibrates, that is how sounds are made. All speakers are magnets.</p>

<p>The power in the audio jack is about 20mW according to this:
* <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/36495">https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/36495</a></p>

<p>According to this, the average phone call is about 800mW, the call itself [PDF]:

<p>So work out the numbers from there and keep in mind that the distance counts too. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a measuring device to check it, but I am sure there are papers on it somewhere.</p>

<p>I bet the headphone will emit more radiation since it&#39;s magnetic, despite it&#39;s lower power, since magnetic waves penetrate everything except special metals like mumetal:

<p>No. The faraday bag or pouch only blocks the electric component, the magnetic component goes through everything.</p>

<p>The catch is that the magnetic component has a rapidly decreasing power the farther you go away.</p>

<p>Like with a fridge magnet, the power of it is almost nonexistant after a few centimeters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True story:</p>

<p>In college I had a cell phone made by a company that no longer makes cell phones and I forget what it was called. But the actual cell phone itself had a rubber membrane around the bottoms and around the sides. At a certain point the rubber membrane came off of the phone and shortly after that I started to notice my head hurting whenever I talked on the phone. I noticed the pain even more whenever I completely removed the membrane during phone calls. To further my claims I passed my phone around to my college roommates to see if it had the same effects. And IT DID. I don’t know much about radiation from cell phones except that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought a small end/ radiation detector ( benetech gm3120) as one of my kids has a magnetic shunt in her head. I wanted to check for unsafe levels of radiation and EMF, well boy was I surprised our IPhones emitted a burst of very higher radiation every 5-10 seconds this level made the meter flash red and beep along with the end &amp; radiation numbers, end was over 900!! , this burst came from the upper side by the speaker, to be fair nothing was detected approx 18&quot; from the phone.also our laptops, TV, and last but not least the cable box which emitted a constant dangerous reading, even when turned off.
These electronic firms , manufacturers know this   but who cares?? Their making their $$$
How many have suffered some illnesses or even death that were caused by, but not attributed to these everyday killers
That meter was like $40. On A???n check it out for yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Magnetic radiation has a mugh higher penetration rate </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Higher penetration means less absorption, so less frying of your brain.  Neutrinos from the sun are perfect examples of this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the electric fields that cause heating.  They usually accompany magnetic fields.</p>
