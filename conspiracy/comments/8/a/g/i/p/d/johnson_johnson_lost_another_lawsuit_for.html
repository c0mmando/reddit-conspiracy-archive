<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2018/04/06/couple-suing-johnson-johnson-over-talcum-powder-wins-37-million-judgment.amp.html">http://www.foxnews.com/health/2018/04/06/couple-suing-johnson-johnson-over-talcum-powder-wins-37-million-judgment.amp.html</a></p>

<p>This article details that Johnson &amp; Johnson may have known about the asbestos content of their talc products since the 70&#39;s:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-johnson-johnson-talc-asbestos-warning-20170922-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-johnson-johnson-talc-asbestos-warning-20170922-story.html</a></p>

<p>This article details another lawsuit Johnson &amp; Johnson lost for allegedly giving a woman ovarian cancer:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/08/21/jury-awards-417-m-lawsuit-linking-talcum-powder-cancer/587731001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2017/08/21/jury-awards-417-m-lawsuit-linking-talcum-powder-cancer/587731001/</a></p>

<p>It seems the above lawsuit as well as another one have both been overturned:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/23/health/johnson-and-johnson-talcum-powder-trial-verdict-overturned/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/23/health/johnson-and-johnson-talcum-powder-trial-verdict-overturned/index.html</a></p>

<p>This article details a class action lawsuit filed against Johnson &amp; Johnson on behalf of 4,800 woman for similar reasons:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/business/johnson-and-johnson-baby-talcum-powder-lawsuits.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/business/johnson-and-johnson-baby-talcum-powder-lawsuits.html</a></p>

<p>This post was put together rather hastily. It&#39;s late and I just wanted to get it up because this pertains to Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder as well afaik. Only had time to skim the linked articles as well as a few others but there are many more if anyone wants to search around. I ran a quick search of this sub for any similar posts and came up with nothing. I don&#39;t mind if anyone wants to repost some or all of this in other subs as your own post. Don&#39;t care about the karma, just get the word out. These stories have a habit of being buried, overshadowed by more sensational headlines or just lost to the memory hole. I ran several searches for articles trying to ascertain if there are appropriate warning labels on Johnson &amp; Johnson products and it seems that there are not. I also ran multipe image searches of Johnson &amp; Johnson talc product warning labels and again I cannot find anything indicating that thier products may cause cancer. There seems to be nothing more than the most cursory warnings against inhalation and rash. The ingredient lists make no mention of the fact their talc may contain asbestos either. So apparently Johnson &amp; Johnson still isn&#39;t required to put an appropriate warning label on their talc products that they may cause cancer despite losing several big lawsuits already for doing just that.</p>

<p>The CNN article I linked states the following:</p>

<p>&quot;Some talc-based powders carry a warning label that mentions the possible risk of ovarian cancer after frequent application in the female genital area. Several talc-based powders, including J&amp;J&#39;s products, do not.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact there is no mandatory warning industry wide for talcum products and that it seems Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn&#39;t have the moral integrity to do it on their own despite having already lost several lawsuits and that they are in the process of getting sued by literally thousands of people while other manufacturers voluntarily put an appropriate warning label on their own talc products without it being a legal requirement is enough to to consider it a conspiracy as far as I&#39;m concerned.  </p>

<p>This applies to Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder products as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i cant tell if this is a serious comment or not. </p>

<p>i work in Construction and work in humid conditions and dont need talc. </p>

<p>i dont know why you would. your body sweat is a natural lubrication and IMO is unnecessary to use talc. </p>

<p>you&#39;re exposed to plenty of dangerous dusts, chemicals and the sun, why would you want to risk <em>voluntary exposure</em> to something that may cause you health problems in the future? </p>

<p>I use respirators, i wear long sleeve HI-VIS shirts &amp; pants, and i use polarized safety glasses.  </p>

<p>sure its uncomfortable, but hacking a lung up in a couple of decades in front of your kids/grandkids is a lot worse, wouldnt you say? </p>
