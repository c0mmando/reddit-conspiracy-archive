    <div class="md"><p>Last year, my local radio station had a &quot;general of the club of rome&quot; on - or some such larp title they enjoy - he said &quot;a confluence of factors such as war, disease, resource scarcity and public unrest will lead to a 90% decline in the North American population within 5 years&quot;</p>

<p>By his logic, we have less than 4.</p>

<p>Which I definitely see as likely.</p>

Payday loan, car equity lone, pawn your wife&#39;s shit? Where does it begin, and where does it end? This slow collapse must have been what it was like in the slow declining Roman Empire. Too many distractions and it was impossible to see the <em>outlines of the collapse</em>. But now we have TV, the greatest mindfucker next to reddit. Check your cortisol levels, you&#39;re being pumped dry by a paranoid ruling class... end is near.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I fear they can keep the system going for quite a while yet, and things can get much worse. Why would here be an end? 3 reasons that I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Those in control decide enough is enough.</li>
<li>The workers of the world unite and start a rebellion en masse.</li>
<li>Jesus returns and destroys them all at Armageddon.</li>
</ol>

<p>Number 1 ain’t gonna happen. Number 2 ain’t gonna happen any time soon and will not succeed if it does. Number 3 has been expected and prophesied since the beginning of time. Many don’t believe in it at all. I think it’s the only hope we have, but have no clue as to when anything might happen.</p>

<p>Hope that wasn’t too depressing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world has been in far worse shape than it&#39;s presently in during countless other times in history and it&#39;s important to realize and keep that in mind. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to bear in mind that the same kind of people who were responsible for those calamitous and chaotic historical periods that saw a tremendous loss of human lives are no different from those attempting to push the world into yet another series of chaotic and dangerous times trying to obtain what they&#39;ve consistently failed to obtain up until now and still haven&#39;t recognised that it&#39;s a dream that is and always was doomed to failure. </p>

<p>Like any dream, in order for it to become a reality more human beings must share and want it to be real than don&#39;t and they are, as they have always been, a very small minority that feel themselves to be so far above and superior to the rest of humanity that&#39;s simply never going to happen. </p>

<p>Now you may think that the rest of humanity doesn&#39;t have a common dream or purpose that is far more powerful and that is constantly becoming a reality for a majority of them on an ongoing basis every day, but they do. </p>

<p>That dream is a very ordinary one that is motivated by all of the simple pleasures that come with quite simply being a normal, sane, and well-adjusted human being and having the few basic necessities that make it possible for them to be and stay one.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t the ones that cause any problems. The are the ones that prevent and will always put an end to the problems that those few invariably cause in the pursuit of their utterly selfish dreams of having more than they&#39;ll ever need no matter how much they already have and even if they had everything there is to possibly have and be the sole owners of from their own short sighted and stilted view, it still wouldn&#39;t be enough. A truth that completely eludes them but is only too well known from any normal, sane and well-adjusted human perspective.</p>

<p>They exist because we allow them to and because we have better things to do with our own individual lives to make them better without imposing on anyone else and a greater respect for all humans including the rather poor specimens and examples that they happen to be. We aren&#39;t and are never going to be successful by their definition because we have no desire nor any reason to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they are hoping for the best, but planning for the worst.</p>

<p>Best case is that the system continues to function for a long time with the people happily docile and happily slaves feeding the machine.</p>

<p>In that scenario why would they need to do anything drastic?</p>

<p>In an event where the people wake up they would simply impose slavery by force rather than with an illusion of freedom. They would implement plan b, or c, d, or e. They are well diversified and prepared for many scenarios at this point.</p>

<p>They are smart.</p>
