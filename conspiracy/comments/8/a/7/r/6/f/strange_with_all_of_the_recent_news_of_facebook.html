       Based on you comment I gruelingly listened to Katy Perry's latest album; "Witness".
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised to find out that the majority of the tracks on the album have been wrote with lyrics that denounce the current form of the US government. As well as some worldly ideologies that are stirring up problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like this: If a critical thinker listens to her album, that person might do some net searching on issues they heard about in her album. Non critical thinkers, well...

       Notice he gave no mention of witness, but PRISM, which is the name of the program that Snowden blew the whistle on. The album PRISM followed shortly after.

       That being said Witness is a much better album, but is pointless in the context of this discussion.

       After the Florida shooting, they rolled out a new PROMISE Program, 'promise to end gun violence' or some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conveniently whitewashed the controversy over the original Promise Program that let high school students in Florida off major crimes just to reduce crime reporting numbers and get more fed funding. the same program that prevented kruz from being arrested 40 times before the shooting.

       Yeah, I agree with this. It's just very unlikely that someone who actual lives the life he raps about could ever pass the background test to become C.O.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly everyone I know (myself included) had a criminal record before they were even adults. Guns, drugs, ect.... If you really grew up selling dope or gang banging there's almost no chance you have a clean criminal record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure we pay C.Os to break the law and bring in our phones, drugs and whatever else but I don't think those people are actually up 3 days straight selling dope in the projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, Rick Ross (the rapper) and mostly all of these rapper are actors.

       Because the religion they believe in demands that they drop hints to the public, absolves them of their sin when committing these heinous acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is the huge number of 9/11 references in pop culture before it happened.

       I'd tell you to google it, but the point of this is it prevents you from doing so.
      </p>

       Google:
      </p>
      <p>
       Prism Snowden NSA
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Google:
      </p>
      <p>
       Prism
      </p>
      <p>
       See how deep in it is before you get to stuff about the NSA. Also, take note of whether those webpages (Katy Perry stuff) would have existed before or after the PRISM revelations.

       Very clever because people have been recently searching "invasion of privacy". She also recently posted a video weeks ago ranting about paying taxes and not knowing what she was paying for which is interesting. I'd really like to read a thread about her and how she made it so big so fast. Every one of her songs is catchy and hypnotizing. Someone please start a Cardi B conspiracy thread or direct me to one!

       I think she had the right personality and showed characteristics of someone who is willing to do anything for fame. That's what they look for. She was a stripper, meaning to them that she's willing to sell herself (her soul) for money and fame.  Then she was on a vh1 reality show and she was The Bitch.  After getting kinda famous for that she instantly blew up with Bodak Yellow. I saw Instagram live videos of her on the verge of tears shortly after blowing up talking about how much she hated the fame. I think she very very quickly figured it out, but for her it's over. She got sucked in and now she's the Queen of Pop. Dethroning Dicki Massaj

       Look into The Woman in Red and the Queen of Pop.  There's always one of them, and whatever award show it is that separates the old from the new, they're always wearing red and trading positions.

       First it was Beyonce, Rihanna, Taylor, Katy Perry, Nicki, and now Cardi.  It seems almost each generation is getting raunchier and raunchier.

       I don't necessarily think cardi is stupid. She's just "about that life". Where she came from and the life she has lived so far... That's how people talk in her lifestyle. She's actually really funny and I feel like humor is a good indicator of someone's intelligence.

       Of course it is. I've been saying this for awhile. It's part of a new censorship technique. In the age of the internet, you can't remove information. You can only bury it in unrelated information or smear it with disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       One current trick is to control the "mainstream" and "truther" narrative from the beginning. When you see the mainstream news and conspiracy sites pushing different narratives of the same event, but both sides are pushing equally hard around a single narrative? Well likely there's a third narrative they don't want you to hear.

       Yeah, it's been happening for awhile. All good SciFi is about the present. Huxley and Orwell were writing about how they saw their own time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orwell's 1984 came about in 1948, given the way he saw information it's obvious he was talking about the present manipulation.

       Same thing with Noel Gallagher's new album

        Who Built the Moon

       <em>
        Who Built The Moon

       .
       <br/>
       Why did they do it?
       <br/>
       Because lots of people heard about the book through Graham Hancock and lots of videos and posts

       Lol, that's my inner thigh, and if you don't think that's funny, then I dunno man. I'm not about shitting on art, I just wouldn't consider those artists actual artists.  They're performers at best.  They can sing, maybe play instruments, dance sexy, but they're not artists. Look at Brittney Spears, where literally all her hits are ghost written by Max Martin or Dr Luke or someone.  They don't MAKE the art, they PERFORM the... "Art".

       Must be easy to think that performances can’t be art when your brain is so fried from designer drugs and nanoparticles from DYI tattoos shredding your blood-brain barrier.

       Holy shit, man.  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about  how these people you're claiming are artists who have control over their "art" are just performers.  Performance is art, sure, but when you claim the song and dance is your art, when really you're just doing what someone else created, you're not an artist.  A computer can take any instructions you give it and make beauty.  The computer is not the artist, the technician controlling the computer is the artist.  Mainstream performers are puppets, not artists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't do drugs other than smoke weed, and I use tattoo ink and sanitized tattoo needles... Why are you making this about something completely unrelated to the topic?  Do you feel like you lost the argument and this is how you can "win" over me?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just came here to tell you why I think mainstream artists are a sham, but you're making this a personal attack.  I'm not gonna continue cause it's not worth it.  Nothing is being gained here.  Peace out, dude.

       Attributing Britney Spears' lyrics to "her" is incorrect.  Someone wrote those and she sang them.  Is she the "artist" here?  I don't think so.  Look at my analogy below about a computer.  Think of CGI. We can make beautiful images with a computer. It sings the notes we play and dances the keyframes we give it, but it's not an artist, it is the mechanism of the art creating the art.  To claim these mainstream artists as artists, I believe, is the same as calling a computer an artist.

       She is an icon, she is adored by fans. If you're trying to make the term artist as broad as possible, fine. Count her an artist because by Merriam Webster's definition, "one who performs and practices an imagined art" she is an artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to say is that she IS image. She is PART of the art.  The true artists were the people behind the scenes, hey handlers who created and currated her image.  Britney "young crazy and cutting her hair" was just her trying to finally take control back.  She was nothing but their puppet and she knew it.
      </p>

       I think claiming that pop stars are artists is just a Psy Op so no one questions the work.  If it turned out Gerber RR Martin didn't write the Game if Thrones series and it was entirely a ghost writer, he was just there face of the Brand, wouldn't you think people would call him out for that? Why do we think pop stars are somehow any different? Go on Wikipedia for yourself, you'll see every pop song has 5 writers, maybe 2 producers and rarely in the creative process any mention of the artist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muppes are not artists. They are creations of others.  Pop stars are no different, they're just using real people instead of literal puppets so your believe it.

       If you look up regular pictures of Cardi B she is actually pretty ugly. Her face is jacked up. Personal insult aside, society has placed the pussy on the pedestal (again) and we have an actual stripper releasing a rap album that the masses will eat up. I used to be a hip-hop head until I realized how fucking stupid it was.

       It's about how hip hop used to be a soulful genre that spoke of real issues and real life. Then some white guys came along, realized they could get rich whole appropriating and twisting a culture that wasn't there or theirs.  They basically created the popularized gangster image to suck in unsuspecting black youth into a life of drugs and crime.  Making them easier to manipulate and land in profitable private prisons considering they're only following their idols.

       "Coming up dope with the uzi." Shut the fuck up Migos, you don't sell drugs and you probably don't even have guns.  It's all lies meant to create a false image of "cool." You gotta do x,y and z to be cool, but those things are all illegal, like selling drugs and shooting people.  The messages of these songs are intentionally rotten.

       its possible we're looking at this the wrong way.  I think it is a lot more likely that Cardi B realized what was a popular search term and made that her album name so that it would get more publicity. not sure but its possible.

       This well represents my complaint on the internet in general.  I look up something, and instead get dozens of mashup articles about it, instead of the actual search item, requiring me to wade through more bs.  Of course, this doesn't represent a conspiracy in my mind, just people taking advantage of SEO, in hopes that digital will return dollars.  Sites with the best SEO, take advantage of 100's of thousands of users.  Hint, hint.

       Your right, you won’t be flooded with a rap video. It’s an entire album, and it’s not the album that is doing the flooding, but all the articles about the album.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying that this IS whats going on, simply trying to explain the mechanics that he is referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is absolutely how Google works.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no “Invasion of Privacy” album and you ONLY google “Invasion of Privacy” you’ll get articles about that subject, but you’ll get better subjects if you are more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW say there IS an album called “Invasion of Privacy” and you search “Invasion of Privacy” looking for that topic, the first few pages will be nothing but articles about the new album released by one of the most popular celebrities on earth ATM. Most people will only go about 2 pages back and give up or do a better search, both kinds of people exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you search “Invasion of Privacy Through Electronic Devices” You will get the results that you’re looking for instead of the rap album results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because YOU wouldn't be distracted does not mean for one second that other wouldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is definitely how Google works, and if you still disagree with the method then thats alright, but I am done explaining it. &lt;3

       That's funny because I just searched it and you are right! Technically it was on the first "page" but I had to scroll to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was working on the assumption that Google knew me well enough to know that I don't want this teeny bopper garbage, but I guess it's being promoted in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I stand corrected. However, I would say the overarching problem is that more people actually care about this garbage music than care about real invasions of privacy. Google is part of that, but so are shitty parents, underpaid teachers, corporate apologists, etc.

       You are absolutely right. In no way is this one singular aspect the whole of the problem, it is just one of the more easily provable facets of it. It has to be looked at from many angles to full comprehend for sure.

       Promotion is a sickeningly powerful tool.

       O.K. I was going to leave this place for good, because there is mostly outright batsh*t crazy stuff on here. But, lolecko has made a very astute observation so I think I will just check back every now and then for rare posts such as this.

       This happens with a lot of stuff. Most of the times the reason is just more SEO type BS to improve visibility because they're going after terms or current events type things as they get more hits. (Agreeing with others that mentioned this already. Any shmoe can find various hit tracker analytics in order to see what searches are currently popular, and then try to ride the wave.) Just another marketing-wank approach that's being used, because it works to some extent despite the fact it pisses a lot of people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now it just takes a lot more work to get a better SNR with operators and reg-expression type stuff when searching. (I've had this happen with more mundane things too, do one search - then can't find the damn thing I'm looking for a month later because trash has filled up the new search results.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wish that sites that can associate searches with users would at least make it a little worthwhile on the user end and allow people to ban things from their search results. (Hey Google and Bing, are you listening?)

       Great point! I wondered briefly to why her album would be called that and came up with nothing. She's a former stripper who is constantly on Instagram, does not seem like the type to care about her privacy.

       Look into The Woman in Red and the Queen of Pop.  There's always one of them, and whatever award show it is that separates the old from the new, they're always wearing red and trading positions.
