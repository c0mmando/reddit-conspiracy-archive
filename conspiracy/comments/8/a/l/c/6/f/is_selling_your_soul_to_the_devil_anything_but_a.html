<p><strong>Selling Your Soul to the Devil</strong></p>

<p>Most dismiss “selling your soul to the devil” as a simple, even cliché’ metaphor, perhaps indicating a person sold out for money or power. However, there may be more to this phrase than one would think, and this post is meant to explore the possibility that people really can sell their souls to the devil. This is meant to be more of a “fun” conspiracy post vs. anything too serious, but I challenge you to open your mind to the possibility that, yes, there are darker forces, which may disguise themselves in the pleasures of this world. Further, I caution that this post has Christian undertones, but it really is impossible to talk about Satan without talking about Christ. So, as I said, read with an open mind, and I am always open to hearing your thoughts! : )</p>

<p><strong>The Master Musician</strong></p>

<p>“Selling your soul” is often associated with musicians, but why? The bible does indicate that Satan (previously Lucifer) was, in fact, a musician, which you can learn more about <a href="http://www.learnthebible.org/satan-the-musician.html">here</a>. As the article notes, “Now, when Satan fell in rebellion against God, he did not lose the natural abilities that God had given him. Therefore, he kept the tabrets and the pipes. But now, he did not use them to bring glory to the Lord but to turn God&#39;s creatures against their Creator. His expertise is seen in the powerful influence he welds today in music. He knows his music and he hates the Lord. This is a dangerous combination.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this may all seem far-fetched to you, but is there a reason that “rock and roll” is associated with the devil? Is it all just in jest, or is there something darker here?</p>

<p>After all, many musicians have claimed to literally sell their soul to the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Sympathy for the Devil</strong></p>

<p>It is important to note the occult view of Lucifer versus the Christian view of Lucifer. In Christianity, Lucifer fell from Heaven and became Satan. Satan is the bad guy in Christianity. However, in the occult, Lucifer is seen as one of many morning stars, a symbol of enlightenment,[27] independence, and human progression, and is often used interchangeably with similar figures from a range of ancient beliefs, such as the Greek titan Prometheus or the Jewish Talmudic figure Lilith.” Luciferianism is said to be all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism">worshipping oneself and enlightenment</a>.</p>

<p>I caution those reading, however, not to fall into this trap, as Satan is the <a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Satan,-As-Deceiver">master deceiver</a>, and he can disguise himself as a <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">being of light</a>, which is exactly why people may fall for the trap of selling their soul in the first place. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8%3A36&amp;amp;version=KJV">Still, what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his soul</a>?</p>

<p>According to Christianity, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+4%3A4&amp;amp;version=NLT">Satan is the God of this world</a>, but not the God of this universe. Satan even tempted Jesus with the kingdoms of the world <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A1-11&amp;amp;version=NKJV">and their glory</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus, clearly, did not accept. However, that is how Satan operates. If people want money, power, and/or fame (or other worldly pleasures), what better way than to ask Satan for some help?</p>

<p><strong>Origins and Speculation</strong></p>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun, and speculation about “selling your soul” goes back far into history, and it is encompassed in literature, history, and pop culture. For the focus of this post, though, I wanted to focus on mostly music, and why and how Satan uses music to influence the masses. We will go into that later.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Paganini">Niccolo’ Paganini</a>, a violinist, is said to have sold his soul to the devil in the 1700s. There is no way to prove this claim, but his music was so good, <a href="http://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/11/05/niccolo-paganini-the-violin-virtuoso-was-so-good-that-people-thought-he-sold-his-soul-to-the-devil/">people thought he must have sold his soul</a>. </p>

<p>In the 1900s, there seemed to be more “proof” of selling your soul to the devil, as music transformed. Robert Johnson was a blue artist who is said to <a href="https://rolfpotts.com/robert-johnson-sold-his-soul-to-the-devil-in-rosedale-mississippi/">sold his soul in Mississippi</a>. His famous song “Traveling Riverside Blues” is apparently about this deal with the devil, and this song was later covered by Led Zeppelin. </p>

<p>The problem is, this is all just speculation, and as we know, many write songs figuratively, but not literally. Still, what I find eerie is that there are artists who have openly claimed to have sold their souls.</p>

<p><strong>In their own words</strong></p>

<p>There have been a tremendous amount of artists who have claimed to “literally” sell their souls. In this section, I want to compose a compilation that does not require you to watch a 3 hour long YouTube video with really annoying music (there are a lot of them), and I want to  save you some time. </p>

<p><em>Bob Dylan</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YiqZvM1Pyo">It goes back to the destiny thing…,I made a bargain with it…to get where I am now.</a>. Bob Dylan claims he made a bargain with the “chief commander” on this Earth and a world we cannot see.</p>

<p><em>Katy Perry</em>: Katy says she wanted to be like Amy Grant, but that did not work out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKquBixWL24">so, she sold her soul to the devil</a>. At about 50 seconds.</p>

<p><em>Kanye West</em>: Kayne tells his audience that he sold his soul to the devil, and he knows it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYx_YXLuoHg">a crappy deal</a>. Again, is this really just a metaphor?</p>

<p><em>Lil Uzi Vert</em>: He is an American hip hop artists who claims to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdThWQKXvzk">sold his soul for his fans</a></p>

<p><em>Jack Black</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byzF3ZkGVUg&amp;amp;t=23s">In this interview</a> Jack Black alludes to Elvis selling his soul, and ‘jokingly’ admits to selling his soul (after about a 1:00).</p>

<p><em>Roseanne</em>: Though she is a comedian, she sounds pretty serious about her anecdote of selling her soul. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zifb066ys6M">In this interview</a>, she talks about selling her soul because she wants to get famous no matter what. Again, is she really just joking? She claims to have a whole chapter on this in one of her books.</p>

<p><em>Snooki</em>: Remember her? She is not a musician, but she had no problem admitting she sold her soul. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjyAOq341U">At about 1:30</a>, she says she sold her soul to get on Jersey Shore. I do want to know that she is not a musician, but it is still interesting nonetheless. </p>

<p><strong>What is Satanism?</strong></p>

<p>Now, when most think of Satanism, they think of devil worship, and many claim, “Modern Satanism is just about doing what makes you happy!” But they are being deceived. True Satanism is about worship of oneself. True Satanism goes against God’s qualities. You do not have to be doing strange rituals or sacrifices to be a Satanist (though it is preferred). Rather, you may possess some of these qualities. I want to warn that I am generalizing for this post, but all of these qualities go against the Bible. </p>

<p>• Worship of oneself. Today, the world says that we, ourselves, shall be worshipped and can become Gods! The opposite? <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A2&amp;amp;version=ESV">Proverbs 27:2</a></p>

<p>• Promiscuity. Today, more than ever, the world says we should have sex with anyone and everyone. The opposite? <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a></p>

<p>• Do what you want as long as it makes you happy! The modern world tells us that “nothing is really wrong” as long as we are happy. The bible says <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12%3A13-14&amp;amp;version=ESV">otherwise</a>. Life is about following God.</p>

<p>• Lying. Today, most have no problem putting up a façade for social media or otherwise. However, God <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-22.htm">detests lying</a>. By the way, our culture has allowed little “white” lies. But why?</p>

<p>• Do not worship anything but God. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A3-5&amp;amp;version=KJV">God warns not to have any Gods before him</a>. Note, that anything can become a God if it is valued. Money? Sex? Drugs? You get my point, I think. </p>

<p>The point here is that “Satanism” is the opposite of Christianity. It may not necessarily mean “ritual sacrifice”, but it certainly means selfishness. One does not even have to label themselves a Satanist to be a Satanist. Labels are not important. It is our actions and beliefs, after all.</p>

<p>If we go by the definition that Satanism is the opposite of Christianity, that modern music itself is certainly Satanic.</p>

<p><strong>Decade by Decade</strong></p>

<p>While many musicians have been mentioned in this post, I wanted to generalize the Satanic music industry by decade. </p>

<p>50s – Elvis defines this decade. You might want to watch this entire documentary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M813ZdDK4kE">see how even Elvis thought, he himself, was Christ</a>. </p>

<p>60s – “Peace and Love”? Where to start? There is a theory that the entire 60s “counterculture” was just a <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/2014/06/Was-Sixties-Golden-Age-of-Rock.html">psyop</a></p>

<p>70s – Let’s call this the transition stage. Here, the commercialization of music started (though I understand it happened before). The beginning of music television <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video#1974%E2%80%931980:_Beginnings_of_music_television">started in the 1970s</a> after all.</p>

<p>80s – The 1980s took an interesting turn, and this is where you saw music influence like never before. You started to see huge celebrities like Michael Jackson do commercials for big corporations like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Md5lPyuvsk">Pepsi</a>. While this happened to some extent before, it was taken to a whole new level. “The Pepsi Generation”.</p>

<p>90s – This is my favorite topic, and I just wrote an entire post about Kurt Cobain and grunge if you are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/89vhjt/kurt_cobain_an_alternative_conspiracy_not_about/">interested</a>. Before, everyone just wanted to have fun, but now, apathy and depression ruled the sound waves. I mean, would a generation that depressed ever fight back?</p>

<p>Early 2000s – This is what I grew up with, and I do not even know much because I did not like the music much. All I can say is that “sex” ruled the airwaves, which virtually every song being about sex. Can my proof be that I grew up in this generation?</p>

<p>Modern Music –  What complete shit, as <a href="https://mic.com/articles/107896/scientists-finally-prove-why-pop-music-all-sounds-the-same#.6avpMLS8W">pop music sounds exactly the same</a>. This song about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOubzHCUt48">dying young</a> exemplifies the era. Really, it is cool to <em>die young</em>?
So, what does this all mean?</p>

<p><strong>Sound as Weapon</strong>*</p>

<p>Music (or sound) can be used as a weapon against the masses. I am emphasizing “pop music” in this post, and the question is, does any of this music emphasize “good qualities?” Have a lot of sex, do a lot of drugs, and all that matters is “fun” is the emphasis of almost all pop music from the 50s and on. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">Do what thou wilt, so to speak</a>.</p>

<p>Even the songs about “love” are mostly superficial, and there are musicians who seemed to have make a few political statements (but what was their agenda?) The point is that modern pop music seems to emphasize Satanic qualities, which is ultimately, the focus of oneself.</p>

<p><strong>Let us go deeper.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/sonic-weapons-explained-can-sound-be-used-cause-physical-harm-826558">Sound can be used as a weapon</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-listening-to-music-lifts-or-reinforces-mood-051713">And music certainly influences your mood and emotions</a>.</p>

<p>There is even a theory about how listening to music in <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/12/21/heres-why-you-should-convert-your-music-to-432hz/">432 Hz is ideal</a> is ideal Decide for yourself on this one.</p>

<p>It is said that even the universe <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn5092-universe-started-with-hiss-not-bang/">started with sound</a>, or according to the Bible <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1&amp;amp;version=KJV">the word</a></p>

<p>No matter what you believe, the point is that sound, and music (combinations of sound) influences us deeply.</p>

<p>Let us focus on pop music though, which is what influences the masses. Have you ever heard a pop song about having a family or helping others? Have you ever heard a pop song about humbling oneself or giving away one’s possessions? Have you ever heard a pop song that tells one to be unselfish? Likely not. Most popular music is based on the “self” and any music about love is often superficial. </p>

<p>The problem is that this is what children grow up with. How do I know? I was one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Come on, now</strong></p>

<p>Many reading this will scoff. This is all a joke, right? I mean, “the devil” is preserved for overprotective parents who just cannot understand what music is about, right?</p>

<ul>
<li>Please allow me to introduce myself
I&#39;m a man of wealth and taste
I&#39;ve been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man&#39;s soul to waste
And I was &#39;round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate*
-Sympathy for the Devil – The Rolling Stones</li>
</ul>

<p>Look, overprotective parents always exist, but there are some creepy headlines regarding the influence of music:</p>

<p><em>Teen Suicide</em>: Ozzy Osbourne may deny it, <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/an-ozzy-osbourne-fan-commits-suicide">but a teen committed suicide over his music</a></p>

<p><em>Chester Bennington</em>: <a href="http://www.alternativenation.net/teen-imitated-chester-benningtons-suicide-listening-linkin-park-horrifying/">Here is an article about a teen who copied his suicide</a></p>

<p><em>Impacting Kids</em>: <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/under-the-influence-ofmusic/">This entire articles shows how music deeply impacts kids, for better or for worse</a>.</p>

<p>The point is that pop music has a huge impact on those who like it.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Can one sell his or her soul to the devil? That is up to you decide.
If they can, music seems the way to do so. Satan seems to be the master musician, and if he wanted to influence people, music would be the perfect way to do that. Again, what are the common themes in popular music? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/">92 percent of songs today are about sex</a>.</p>

<p>Music has been taken over, or controlled. I am not condemning music, for I could not write a post like this if I did love music myself.</p>

<p>However, my concern is popular music and how it influences the masses.</p>

<p>Finally, going back to the title of this post, many give up their lives for music. Let us end with some quotes:</p>

<p><em>“If you sell your soul to the Devil, you get more grain.”- Drake</em></p>

<p><em>I’ve sold myself to the Devil- <a href="https://www.quora.com/Did-John-Lennon-really-say-I-sold-my-soul-to-the-devil">John Lennon – decide if it is literal</a></em></p>

<p><em>“Because God loves us, but the devil takes an interest.”― Jennifer Donnelly, Revolution</em></p>

<p><em>Don’t think of Satan as a harmless cartoon character with a red suit and a pitchfork. He is very clever and powerful, and his unchanging purpose is to defeat God’s plans at every turn – including His plans for your life.—  Billy Graham, The Journey</em></p>

<p><em>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”— Genesis 3:1 (NIV)</em></p>

<p>Did God really say, Be a good person? 😉 Did he really???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you sell your soul I&#39;m so lonely and depressed...?</p>

<p>Everydays exactly the same for me. I feel like i have no hope, no worthwhile goals, no purpose. I attend a community college even though i have no idea what i want to do in life. i spend most of my time by my self on my computer...or working out. I have dreamed everyday of what it would be like to have a significant other. Someone i could care about , spend time with and talk to.i feel like it would be the only thing that could bring happiness to my life.. I know i am good looking because i get complimented a lot by people i consider acquaintances, more then friends. But i know i will never find someone like that because i am shy by nature and am incapable of flirting and on top of that besides for the few girls in class there is no other place to meet girls. Also i don&#39;t see any change in my life in sight.... i&#39;m so miserable all the time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Matthew, Mark, and Luke all describe that after Jesus was baptized, Jesus went into the desert to meditate and fast.  There, the Devil tempted Jesus to work for him instead of God.  He offered Jesus several different worldly pleasures.  Jesus rejected Satan and then went on and began his ministry.  </p>

<p>The earliest known example of someone selling their soul to the devil in literature is Theophilus, written by Eutychianus of Adana in the 6th Century.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s several folklore tales with the same theme that pop up, however, they all eventually coalesce around Faust who may have lived in the late 1400&#39;s.  The truth is we&#39;re not absolutely sure.  Historians give better than 50/50 odds that there was an historical Faust, but don&#39;t rule out the possibility that he&#39;s entirely a legend.  That being said, all sorts of legends about Faust selling his soul to the devil began popping up in the 1500&#39;s.  The most famous surviving versions of the tale are English play &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot;, by Christopher Marlowe, first performed in the late 1500&#39;s, or the German play &quot;Faust&quot; by Johann von Goethe, from the late 1700&#39;s.  Both plays were incredibly popular during their time and are still widely read today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, just a few disparate thoughts.</p>

<p>I often wonder if the concept of &quot;selling ones soul&quot; isn&#39;t a mix of both metaphor and Reality. As AC/DC says &quot;It&#39;s a long way to the top if you wanna rock and roll&quot;. This goes for basically any positions of power or influence in life- there are always sacrifices. A family, a dream, your own psyche. Everything has a price, especially success. I don&#39;t think one needs to necessarily participate in any ritual, or even utter the words that they want to &quot;sell their soul&quot;. I think this can be done from actions alone. Whether this selling is done to an entity such as Lucifer or to Society or the &quot;world&quot; in general is up to the individual to decide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is said that even the universe started with sound, or according to the Bible the word</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know you quote John 1:1 here but I think that you might also be interested in going straight to the Greek.</p>

<p>1)Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος. 2)οὗτος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν. 3)πάντα δι&#39; αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν. </p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with (the) God, and God was the Word. He (the Word) was in the beginning with (the) God. All through Him (the Word) was made, and absent him nothing was made&quot;</p>

<p>On a final note, and as I have often said before, I believe that music is magick, and it has a deep psychological significance for human beings. It has always been a part of who and what we are, and because of this it possesses great power. I also believe that there is still good music being made today- it just doesn&#39;t get any airtime. You have to <em>seek</em> the good things, they don&#39;t tend to just fall into your lap.</p>

<p>The power to make us feel emotions.  Songs that make us feel depressed, hated and angry are simply weapons that can be used on us at pretty much any time.  I believe it was the great Bart Simpson who said, &quot;making teenagers depressed is like shooting fish in a barrel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The snake wasn&#39;t evil it was good, how is keeping Humanity in a cage good? I&#39;ve heard a lot of desciptions of what the snake represents but never heard your version. The best description I have found is that it represents knowlege which everyone agrees with, even the Biblical canon. My supporting argument for this is the relationship between the arguably oldest Egyption god Thoth god of the moon and wisdom, who is credited with the creation of writing. Hermies the Greek god of commerce, trade, and trickery also, his trickery is sometimes used to benifit Humanity; those two being combined and given the name Hermes Termistegus god of wisdom and alchemy. When the Romans and church at the Councl of Nicea created the canon version of the Bible they had the writings that contradicted their version destroyed and the Gnostics killed to prevent dissenting opinion over their newly found way of oppresion and indoctrination. </p>

<p>If intrested their is a free online library of the original unedited translations, gospels not included such as The Gospel Of Judas, Gnostic works, Hermetic texts and much more.</p>

<p>It’s funny you link that. I had a dream months back involving a goat with the name Judas (he would hiss when saying the name. Will never forget).

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. One has to either be indoctrinated towards the belief in god or seek it out voluntarily based on circumstance etc, to not do so implies a lack where there is a space for that belief. </p>

<p>Eg. Grow up in a completely non-religious family, never attend church, have no contact with scripture - you simply live your life with no predisposition towards an imaginary friend that you talk to at night or on Sundays.</p>

<p>I get your point; my counterpoint is that your view would only apply in a situation where someone has actively chosen atheism instead of just growing up without any such spiritual or theological input or head warping. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope because saying outright that there isn&#39;t anything out there is a strict belief whether you grew up with or sought out atheism. The way to go about it is to not have any predisposition because there is always a maybe and a possibility and there are definitely things that we can&#39;t comprehend even in science. There are many more mysteries and we&#39;ve not even scratched the surface on what the universe really is so to me atheism is a belief just as ridiculous as a religion because both are going out of their way to say it&#39;s definitely this way or it&#39;s definitely that, it&#39;s foolish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to argue for or against atheism, I&#39;m saying that your statement that it is a belief system is incorrect both semantically and factually. That statement implies an awareness of spiritual thought and belief which not all atheists have. That is my point: atheism is the LACK of this belief, not a belief in and of itself until someone has gone through the entire drawn-out process of deciding there is no evidence for god and THEN defining themselves as atheist. This is an important distinction before any discussion of the further points you&#39;ve raised, most of which I agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is awesome, op. Jesus was an alright dude, imo. I look to his words to guide my philosophically, although i try to remind myself that all words are the actual testimony of someone else, there is no book of jesus, unfortunately. </p>

<p>in my research, i have found similarities between the older religions and the tale of jesus. the older religions, primarily hinduism, and the grecian tales, speak of multiple Gods, or as i like to think of them, demi-gods. even zeus, who considered himself Top God, was born, or &quot;created&quot; by other &quot;Gods.&quot; i believe the Christian God is a modern interpretation of this same archetype. 
so if Lucifer is akin to Prometheus, who is the parallel to OT God? </p>

<p>i do not doubt the power of these beings. I doubt their being worthy to serve. OT was fine with slaughter, slavery, rape, incest... provided it was in his name. not the kind of entity i want to pledge loyalty to. Satan, is just as ridiculous. His actions are petulant, and while i appreciate the &quot;illumination&quot; of hidden knowledge, i don&#39;t draw the same conclusions from the texts as him. I do not believe that I AM ALL, nor could I even fathom the idea of convincing myself that I AM SUPREME. it&#39;s anti life. it&#39;s anti love. it&#39;s anti GOD.</p>

<p>a TRUE GOD is beyond the jealousy, beyond EGO, a TRUE GOD would actually practices what he preaches, so imo, he cant be the OT God. OT God usurped the knowledge for himself. </p>

<p>the music that you speak of, 432, affects us on a physiological level. it raises our frequency, helps blood flow and neural connectivity. it also is relative to the golden ratio. the golden ratio, the beginning of it all. the sound. the name of GOD. the name of GOD can be uttered, they just never wanted US to have a direct connect. thus, Jesus, Lucifer, Odin, Allah, Shiva, Kali, Baal... they took the knowledge, enforced their codes upon us and then insist we worship them. </p>

<p>TRUE GOD is beyond the pettiness... remember the last scene in MIB? the aliens with the marble worlds? Like that, but much less cute and whimsical.</p>

<p>this is my interpretation, i&#39;m probably wrong on some.. i&#39;m open to new information, but so far... i&#39;m a monotheist, in an universal organism kinda way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hebrew language has no passives verbs. Everywhere it say God did this and God did that is actually God allowing it to happen. If you study it enough you will realize that Satan is the one doing all these things and God allows it to happen because he has no choice. For example It says in Exodus that God hardened pharaoh heart but in the same context is also says that pharaoh hardened his own heart. Also in another story God had a demon volunteer to be a lying spirit to someone because they refused to listen to the truth. The entire old testament is about Jesus coming to break the curse of the old covenant. There is no possible way that the bible was written by man. It would be impossible. </p>

I do believe IT doesn&#39;t enforce IT&#39;s will, bc it would be blasphemy. Yet, I also believe that Satan doesn&#39;t enforce his will. As souls, we have choice. We have pieces of both forces within us. It is up to us, to choose. </p>

<p>As to your last point, a verse that has tremendous implication... Jeremiah 8:8. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan does enforce his will. His will is to steal kill and destroy. He gains access to peoples lives through God&#39;s judgement and God has no choice but to let certain things happen. (read the book of Job) Job did not have the gospel and was ignorant to many things that we have knowledge of today. Job is one of the oldest books in the bible and even through the mist of his suffering Job says this....</p>

<p>Job 9:1-3: &quot;Then Job answered and said, I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? If he will contend with Him, he cannot answer Him one of a thousand.&quot; He said, &quot;I can&#39;t answer one out of every thousand questions God asks me. He&#39;s God! I&#39;m a man.&quot;</p>

<p>And then in verse thirty-two he longs for an answer; he says, &quot;For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, and we should come together in judgment. Neither is there any mediator between us, that might lay his hand upon us both.&quot;</p>

<p>So here we have Job prophesying Jesus Christ. Someone he needed and did not have like we do today. Jesus was God and Man. Exactly what Job wanted. This is the old testament and this is just one of the many prophesies of Jesus throughout the old testament which all based on the coming savior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe it is possible to enter into an actual binding contract with the devil or demons, although in some cases the existence of these contracts may be believed by those who agree to them. Rather, I think demons are granted authority over us according to how much we allow them to influence us and incentivize us, and there is no need that we would sign any formal agreement, because we already grant them license so long as we allow ourselves within their spheres of power in any way.</p>

<p>in this sense, I believe that when people talk about selling their souls, they are often speaking both figuratively and literally at the same time, likely not understanding the full implications of what they are speaking. That is: they speak of selling their soul to a literal devil as a euphemism for their having made moral sacrifices, not realizing that these moral sacrifices have had the effect of placing them in a progressively greater bondage to the literal devil in real life.</p>

<p>other instances of people claiming to have sold their souls may be explained by their having undergone the initiation rituals of whatever mystery schools, perhaps even doing so with the belief that they are making a formal commitment spiritually. In reality, these commitments do not exist: Jesus Christ is completely able and willing to forgive and save any person, no matter how deeply he has involved himself with dark powers and no matter what previous commitments he has made, so long as the person truly receives Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>thanks for the post OP, and thanks for your labor among the conspiracy crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say that you did a good job synthesizing all the points and having some level of coherence in your post.  I&#39;m not trying to shit on you here, you seem interested in writing so hopefully you can reach a positive outcome from some critique. you say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we go by the definition that Satanism is the opposite of Christianity, that modern music itself is certainly Satanic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but then right afterwards contradict yourself </p>

<blockquote>
<p>60s – “Peace and Love”? Where to start? There is a theory that the entire 60s “counterculture” was just a psyop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>by describing the 60s music as &quot;peace and love&quot;, which pushes Christianity if anything.  the possibility of it being a psyop is a way to make it infallible;  it falls into the classic conspiracy line of thinking that no matter what it can support the claim because you can say &quot;oh they did that on purpose to try and discredit the idea of their existence&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>70s – Let’s call this the transition stage. Here, the commercialization of music started (though I understand it happened before). The beginning of music television started in the 1970s
after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>not real sure what you mean by the commercialization of music just started and how it ties into your argument.  and you&#39;re incorrect, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video">MTV began in 1981</a> because around that time music videos started becoming popular.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>80s – The 1980s took an interesting turn, and this is where you saw music influence like never before. You started to see huge celebrities like Michael Jackson do commercials for big corporations like Pepsi
. While this happened to some extent before, it was taken to a whole new level. “The Pepsi Generation”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>very vague and general description that doesn&#39;t really describe much. companies have always used celebrities in advertisements, and michael jackson was a huge celebrity.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard anyone describe the 80s as &quot;the pepsi generation&quot; outside of pepsi, but I guess their advertising obviously is doing its job!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>90s – This is my favorite topic, and I just wrote an entire post about Kurt Cobain and grunge if you are interested. Before, everyone just wanted to have fun, but now, apathy and depression ruled the sound waves. I mean, would a generation that depressed ever fight back?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>punk/grunge to me is the genre most in line with the idea of satanism, and the story of its development could see lots of parallels with the satan in music theory.  but at this point it feels like no matter what the genre is, it can relate somehow to satanism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Early 2000s – This is what I grew up with, and I do not even know much because I did not like the music much. All I can say is that “sex” ruled the airwaves, which virtually every song being about sex. Can my proof be that I grew up in this generation?</p>

<p>really there&#39;s no point in you even including this as all it says is your personal opinion on it.  </p>

<p>Modern Music – What complete shit, as pop music sounds exactly the same. This song about dying young
exemplifies the era. Really, it is cool to die young? So, what does this all mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is where it really fell off, when you&#39;re trying to write a post such as this one you should avoid this kind of thing like the plague.  we&#39;re not reading the post to see what your thoughts are about modern music, we&#39;re reading it to entertain the ideas of complex and hidden operations behind society and how they impact it.  that&#39;s why I decided to start reading your post because it seemed initially to be thought out, and you did a good job loosely tying ideas together but this last part discredited the entire thing and made me lose interest entirely.</p>

<p>Historically, that type of a commitment, whenever it&#39;s taken, is considered to be unbreakable one with any attempts to undo, void, or dishonour it bringing a fate too horrible to contemplate upon the heads of any that try. A belief that is as old as the practice itself. </p>

<p>If you are considering joining a group, grove, coven, or magical order, which requires a blood oath, you&#39;re advised to not take that requirement lightly.

    <div class="md"><p>Well..</p>

<p>If you really boil it down, the occult secret societies all pretty much worship Lucifer. I do believe that Satan is a different entity than Lucifer.</p>

<p>If you believe in Abrahamic theology, you must also believe in the authenticity of Enoch (not II or III). Thus, you have the Watchers or the Fallen, Satan, and Lucifer. </p>

<p>If you go further into it, Left hand path magicianry worships Satan as one entity, Lucifer as the other. Additionally, look into the Gospel of Thomas. It essentially is verified as authentic, and because it is simply not Catholic canon, it doesn&#39;t make it &#39;not&#39; Holy. </p>

<p>It goes over the truth on the Garden. In the book of Enoch, it was said that the garden was frequented by animals and humans alike, in which they all spoke one language. In the Gospel of Thomas, it was said that the serpent was sent to Eve from the very beginning by Christ himself, and if God is indeed all knowing like it says in the beginning of the book of John, this would make sense. </p>

<p>All in all, I think Satan is the prince of this world, as it is often said. Lucifer is a different fallen entity, and all of the bad spirits on this world belong to the Fallen/Watchers; not included others from other worlds/dimensions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A final point concerning Thomas is preserved for us in the Fourth Gospel, which presents him as a witness of the Risen One in the subsequent event of the miraculous catch in the Sea of Tiberias (cf. Jn 21:2ff.).</p>

<p>On that occasion, Thomas is even mentioned immediately after Simon Peter: an evident sign of the considerable importance that he enjoyed in the context of the early Christian communities.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Acts and the Gospel of Thomas, both apocryphal works but in any case important for the study of Christian origins, were written in his name.&quot; - The Pope</p>

<p>When the Catholic church, who&#39;s authority is NOT ABOVE GOD&#39;S, picks and chooses what is considered &#39;canon&#39; in its own &#39;customized bible&#39;.. that should tell you something..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Catholic Church is head of the mystery Babylon religion.  I&#39;m a King James Bible believer.  Catholics hate that Bible for a reason.  They tried to assassinate King James via the Gunpowder plot for a reason.  So no, I don&#39;t believe the Catholic church or any other tradition of men.  Only the pages of the King James Bible.  &quot;Church&quot; isn&#39;t even a building in the Bible, it&#39;s just anytime saved believers are together wherever they may be.  So much has been perverted by &quot;Churches&quot; of all types.</p>

<p>If you study the King James Bible you will find the contradictions with Enoch.  It plagiarized the Bible and was pushed by the mainstream media run by Lucifer himself.  Believe it if you want, it does have some truth such as closer to realistic cosmology than what the world believes but it isn&#39;t inspired.</p>

<p>King James Bible</p>

<p>Okay, I HAVE studied the King James bible.. which is based off of the Vatican Latin Vulgate. I&#39;m glad you said the Vatican is bad, as their Latin Vulgate is blasphemy all together. There is NO REASON why the gospels/torah should have ever been written in Latin, as the apostles wrote in Greek, Jews wrote in Aramaic, Hebrew, Paleo Hebrew.</p>

<p>If you think the KJV is some sort of &#39;divine inspiration&#39;, you&#39;re not wrong, but you&#39;re only half right. There is SO MANY purposeful mistranslation in KJV, it&#39;s laughable. Read the book &#39;The Asher Codex&#39;.. don&#39;t take my word for it, take actual PhD level doctors who are trying to call bullshit on the &#39;KJV/monarchy bible&#39;.</p>

<p>And if you really want to go &#39;elitists&#39; with the KJV, at least use the 1611 KJV instead. If anything, you should only use the Tyndale Bible, not the Latin Vulgate bible. </p>

<p>You really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. You want truth?</p>

<p>Use the following only: Torah-Aleppo Codex. Gospels-Strong&#39;s Greek translation. </p>

<p>There is doctored mistranslations in the bible you read.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with you. Close your mind fully and you become unaware of truth.</p>

Hinduism has an incredible lap over with Christianity and if you belive in some conspiracy therories Jesus was an exiled Egyptian prince with his sister mary who spent time growing up in India learning from the sages there then returing to The Land Of Caina and teach them what they had learned. </p>

<p>Most would describe the Egyptian mystery schools as the occult which is an accurate discription, is most likely the basis and root of the Christian religion. I can&#39;t fit the whole thing into this post however I can link the the most comprhensive thing I have read about it which is

<p>Read the book that originated the Method acting and you&#39;ll be amazed with how blatant it is.</p>

<p>Robin Williams spoke about it openly before, that he&#39;s overtaken when doing standup comedy by another being. A lot of musicians today say that they become possessed when performing, but people just write it off as a metaphor. Some even adopt new names.</p>

<p>I remember Jack Nickleson said when he first heard about Heath Ledger&#39;s death &quot;I warned him&quot;. Heath Ledger&#39;s own pre-role ritual was something sick.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a simple answer, but my posts always get downvoted to hell and ridiculed when I say it. The devil is real. He&#39;s more sinister and twisted than most people can imagine. A genius too. He has everyone convinced that either A. he&#39;s not real or B. he&#39;s on their side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just responding to the title (because you sort of ramble on in your post and touch a lot of different topics) it’s easiest to say, well yeah, it’s a just metaphor. </p>

<p>In the music/Hollywood industry context you’ve sort of framed it in that’s probably how it’s most easily understood. I definitely believe that the people who claim to have sold their souls specifically have had some profound experiences with the occult/supernatural. Probably involving powerful rituals meant to simulate such and experience as “selling ones soul” in order to “initiate” them into whatever cult they are joining. As reward for membership they receive fame, power, wealth, influence, etc.</p>

<p>But on a more basic level I think we all have experiences of “selling” ourselves for personal gain. For example when you kill an animal for it’s fur you are essentially making a sacrifice for your own personal gain—e.g. warmth and protection from the elements in exchange for the pain, suffering, and death of another creature. In this way it’s more of a progression than one singular damning experience. You may not be gaining anything we would see today as particularly “magical” or desirable because it’s not out of the ordinary, but if you really want to get into it then yeah—you get what you give, and the bigger the reward the bigger the sacrifice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. One has to either be indoctrinated towards the belief in god or seek it out voluntarily based on circumstance etc, to not do so implies a lack where there is a space for that belief. </p>

<p>Eg. Grow up in a completely non-religious family, never attend church, have no contact with scripture - you simply live your life with no predisposition towards an imaginary friend that you talk to at night or on Sundays.</p>

<p>I get your point; my counterpoint is that your view would only apply in a situation where someone has actively chosen atheism instead of just growing up without any such spiritual or theological input or head warping. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hebrew language has no passives verbs. Everywhere it say God did this and God did that is actually God allowing it to happen. If you study it enough you will realize that Satan is the one doing all these things and God allows it to happen because he has no choice. For example It says in Exodus that God hardened pharaoh heart but in the same context is also says that pharaoh hardened his own heart. Also in another story God had a demon volunteer to be a lying spirit to someone because they refused to listen to the truth. The entire old testament is about Jesus coming to break the curse of the old covenant. There is no possible way that the bible was written by man. It would be impossible. </p>
