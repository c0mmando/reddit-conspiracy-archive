       We are conspiracy theorists. Though I won't say that there isn't right-wing conspiracy, this sub is dedicated to top tier conspiracy.

       Sure.. you guys care about promoting Anti-Trump, anti-Christian, anti-Conservative agenda posts... but if you don't know that Liberal/Republican are controlled by Masons, NWO, Jewish Elite, Rothschild, then you're part of the problem.

       If the part about being an angry alcoholic is True, I would hope you are working on that- or on at least working on whatever goes on in your head to make the alcohol draw out the anger. When I get drunk I talk about history and politics and shitpost on Reddit lol.

       What do you mean by political affinity? Anyone who has any beliefs about society has some sort of political affinity. There's nothing wrong with that- what's wrong is getting bogged down in the horse race and the us vs. them mentality. What's wrong is voting for someone just because they have an R or D next to their name. What's wrong is thinking that someone is mentally ill or subhuman because they have different political leanings. It's impossible to be apolitical without sacrificing the future of yourself and your country to others who would care more.

       It's ok to believe in a frame work of Left or Right- meaning that you subscribe to ideals or end games that would line up with those ideologies, roughly. It's bad to blindly follow any politician, especially considering that most politicians in the US today are Neolib/Neocon Corporatists. People shouldn't vote for someone just because they have an R or D next to their name, and they shouldn't trust what the Corporate Propaganda Media has to say about almost anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also important to remember that we're all People, and Citizens of this country. And that just because someone holds different political beliefs doesn't mean that they are "mentally ill" or "deranged". That's what it means to fall into the trap- when you start believing that anyone who doesn't subscribe to your ideology is somehow lesser. It's important to remember that we all have different views and opinions on things- and that that is Ok! It's also important to remember that most people don't fit into perfect little boxes. As a personal example- I am someone who would be considered on the Left, yet I am also a gun Rights advocate.

       Patriot Act, Anti-terrorism/national security FISA warrants, gun control.. shit's getting bad.

       They used to see it and everyone used to go after the President around here. For some reason, Trump is different and there's a large group of conspiracy theorists who don't want to go after him for any of the stuff he's doing that is completely in line with what previous presidents have done.

       This is a false logic. We all knew that Presidents were puppets. It's just that Trump is the most renegade, wild card puppet there is. You got to be kidding me if you think Obama had worse PR than Trump.

       I mean shit.. Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize for being black. He's bombed the most people since Bush and Trump combined.

       used to question the president, now many here bend over backwards to defend him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may be promoting himself as a "renegade, wild card" but as you said he's definitely still a puppet. I think most of us here understand that, what's strange is how many go out of their way to defend him.

       You have to fit in a box, because people are lazy and everything has become politically charged.  It's easier to label someone red/blue than take a look at what they have to say, and discuss it.  I fucking hate it.

       Yeah I guess its just too much for people to be able to comprehend someone that makes their decisions on what they believe based off more than a d or r. Party loyalty vs voting for individuals is one of the biggest things wrong with our politics. And single issue voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       And suppression of other voices. I used to be more libertarian until I decided corporations cant be trusted to do the right things like not poison people. Just because I decided regulation is needed and a free market economy isnt necessarily the best doesnt mean I also have to start wanting to take guns or that I need to support certain candidates.

       I totally agree with you, but on the same side sometimes it’s hard not judge people who are still falling for this partisan crap. I’ve been called a liberal as well as a Trumpster nazi apologist etc and I’m an anti government realist type in reality. I’m not for any of these people, they’re all crooks and cheats. Trying to explain to these narrow minded individuals that the latest political scandal isnt as important as what isn’t being publicized is like beating your head against a wall though.

       This is a false logic. We all knew that Presidents were puppets. It's just that Trump is the most renegade, wild card puppet there is. You got to be kidding me if you think Obama had worse PR than Trump.
