<p>Also I should mention that we aren&#39;t talking about trumped up charges, these are real crimes and it doesn&#39;t seem anyone is denying that. So is the idea that Mueller is conducting a witch hunt against Trump by uncovering real crimes committed by the members of his team?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p><strong>Papadopoulos</strong>: Back in April 2016, Papadopoulos got a tip from a foreign professor he understood to have Russian government connections that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” He then proceeded to have extensive contacts with the professor and a Russian woman, during which he tried to plan a Trump campaign trip to Russia.</p>

<p><strong>Flynn</strong>: In December 2016, during the transition, Flynn spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that President Barack Obama had just placed on Russia, and about a planned United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we want to say these things were &quot;not a crime&quot; then okay, but it sure sounds like collusion between team Trump and Russia, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the transition, no it wasn&#39;t. And even if it was, the fact remains that Russia allegedly helped Trump get elected and Trump&#39;s administration has been kind to Russia, perhaps because they helped him get elected?</p>

<p>And let&#39;s put Flynn and even Papadopoulos aside for a moment to consider the fact that there have been over 100 charges related to Mueller&#39;s investigation, and many of them have stuck.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about convicted criminals, many of whom are connected with Russia in one way or another, belonging to an administration that has been unusually friendly toward Russia. Is it so strange to think that maybe Mueller&#39;s investigation will find something?</p>

<p>Also it wasn&#39;t part of his job during the transition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was his job. Every administration does the same after an election. The only thing he did wrong was start early then lie about it. And they don&#39;t just contact Russia lol, many countries get a call. And what are these charges? If anything proved actual collusion, trump would have been removed from power. Manaforts crimes preceeded the election by years. Is it a surprise when they did for dirt they find stuff? In any case he was fired from the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>This historical fact leads me to believe, that we were hijacked (most likely after the Civil War) as a country to become the military wing of the Tri-Sovereign States. The evidence for this, can be seen in the Military Industrial Complex in the US. </p>
