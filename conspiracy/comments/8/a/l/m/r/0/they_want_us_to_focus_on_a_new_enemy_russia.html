       Whether it's in film or television, the bad guys were always Russian. So we become programmed to always thinking that they are our enemy. Who stands to benefit from all of oru attention being focused on Russia? Why were so many people so accepting of Russia using a nerve agent to poison people? This is just some Cold War fear mongering. Thoughts?

       Get the Plebs riled up on the "other" and you can steal their livelihood and country right under their noses. It's alarming how ignorant some people are- I've actually seen people calling for nuclear war! Talking about turning Russia into a "smoking crater"...it's madness. And it's exactly what they want.

       Completely agree, 90% of the anti-Trump content posted to this sub is tabloid nonsense and anything actually critical of Trump as an acting President is more or less buried by the same deflectors.

       People are only defending Russia because of the implication that Trump is somehow connected to them so they can't be the bad guys because Trump can't be connected to the bad guys.

       Well, I didn't vote for Trump (or HRC for that matter) and I still don't think Russian collusion is a thing. I keep my criticisms of Trump grounded in his foreign and domestic policy and oligarch cabinet picks.

       What do you figure all the arrests indictments, and plea deals with people connected to Trump are about? Is it all a big witch hunt where Mueller found a bunch of real crimes but even though most of Trump's team is guilty, he himself is innocent?

       What about Pinedo, Papadopoulos, and Flynn weren't all of the charges brought against them related to the Russian government and didn't many of these crimes take place around the time of the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I should mention that we aren't talking about trumped up charges, these are real crimes and it doesn't seem anyone is denying that. So is the idea that Mueller is conducting a witch hunt against Trump by uncovering real crimes committed by the members of his team?

       Flynn did nothing illegal other than lying to the fbi about the non crime of starting his job early. That's basically it. They have nothing that connects the Russian government to the Trump campaign or even proving election interference.

       With regards to Flynn, speaking to the Russian ambassador was part of his job. It's only a crime if you have swallowed so much cold war propaganda that you are conditioned to think even talking to Russians is a felony.

       During the transition, no it wasn't. And even if it was, the fact remains that Russia allegedly helped Trump get elected and Trump's administration has been kind to Russia, perhaps because they helped him get elected?
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's put Flynn and even Papadopoulos aside for a moment to consider the fact that there have been over 100 charges related to Mueller's investigation, and many of them have stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about convicted criminals, many of whom are connected with Russia in one way or another, belonging to an administration that has been unusually friendly toward Russia. Is it so strange to think that maybe Mueller's investigation will find something?

       Also it wasn't part of his job during the transition.

       It was his job. Every administration does the same after an election. The only thing he did wrong was start early then lie about it. And they don't just contact Russia lol, many countries get a call. And what are these charges? If anything proved actual collusion, trump would have been removed from power. Manaforts crimes preceeded the election by years. Is it a surprise when they did for dirt they find stuff? In any case he was fired from the Trump campaign.

       If anything proved no collusion, or proved a witch hunt, the investigation would have been stopped.

       I'm not saying there's conclusive evidence in the public for the collusion accusations, but there does appear to be an investigation, and it does appear to be progressing.

       Flynn took millions of dollars to advocate for foreign governments, failed to report any of it, and engaged in a plan to kidnap a foreign national on American soil for money. See the way this works is you confess to a lower crime in exchange for leniency. That doesn't mean the other crimes never happened. That's just how ignorant hacks spin it.

       No. That's how cooperation works. See, in the Untied States the justice system is slightly more nuanced than sending someone to the gulag or spiking their drink. Keep at it and they'll let you watch some movies to up your game.

       Right okay. Meanwhile I'll wait on the edge of my seat for this smoking gun evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russian government. I keep hearing it'll be any day now, instead mueller seems to embarrassing himself by indicting Russians for posting memes on Facebook, or indicting people for crimes that are nothing to do with the election. But i guess you have to keep the circus on the road.

       The US needs warring boogeymen. It's literally a part of US culture and identity. We have only seen about 20 years of peace time since our creation, so that means we've been at war for the last 220 some years. Think about that, for a second.

       This historical fact leads me to believe, that we were hijacked (most likely after the Civil War) as a country to become the military wing of the Tri-Sovereign States. The evidence for this, can be seen in the Military Industrial Complex in the US.

       The other bad part about this is that it's forcing the other side to blindly support and ignore any bad things Russia does. So now we've divided like teams in a sports game and neither side is willing to critically look at issues.

       I don't know what to make of all of the Russia shit. I believe quite a bit of it has to do with Trump being elected and the cognizant dissonance that followed. But I don't think that's the only variable in the equation. There's the pipeline. I believe that's where Syria comes into play here. And on an even more conspiratorial note, Putin kicked out the Rothchilds a few summers ago. It's clear to me and any other skeptic, that the west is aligned against the former Soviet Union. For many reasons.

       Trump just gifted Syria to Putin. So is Trump in on it? Are you saying that Trump is also setting up Russia to be the enemy by pretending to be beholden to them, or is it just a bizarre cosmic coincidence that Trump seems to put Russian interests over American interests?
