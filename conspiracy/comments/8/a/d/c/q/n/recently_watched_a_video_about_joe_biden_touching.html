    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s just the simple fact that for the vast majority of citizens, if the MSM doesn&#39;t say it, then it&#39;s just not true. As long as their &quot;team&quot; be it MSNBC, Fox, CNN, ABC, NYT, WaPo, LAT or anyone of the others say it, then it is legit and believable. If not, well then surely it must be a lie, because why would our <em>Free</em> Press lie?</p>

<p>Back in the 80s during the Franklin Credit Union scandal the court psychologist said she believed these child victims were telling the truth, and that these things were so horrendous it would take the average person <em>two to three years</em> to even accept these things could be happening. It will take time, it&#39;s human nature. </p>

<p>We don’t need proof. What Proof? </p>

<p>“Oh here’s a video of him putting his hands on children in front of hundreds of people and camera crews.”</p>

<p>The fuck outta here with this. Same damn “proof” every time. But somehow Joe Biden’s name gets dragged through the mud by users bringing up pizzagate, pedo shit, and now Trump’s comments.</p>

<p>A 2020 run must be terrifying to Donald’s legion of goofs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was simply asking why most peoples actions get brushed under the rug, nd the Donald Trump thing I was just pointing out that something as simple as lewd comments equated to him being called basically a rapist.</p>

<p>The way that Joe Biden was touching people was rather inappropriate and I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t seen the video or you wouldnt be asking but also the way he worded things and was pulling them towards them against their will. Now if you disagree then thats fine I was more just wanting to hear others points on these things. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I’ve seen the video plenty. First time I saw it I ate up the narrative. “Biden acting inappropriate with children”. Then as I stuck around I’ve noticed the same vid keeps getting spammed and the narrative has shifted to smear him as a pedo and associate him with PG. </p>

<p>Now I watch the video and I see an older man that deals with many people on the daily and is trying to be charming. He really hasn’t done anything wrong in the videos.</p>

<p>Hell, there’s a video of him and Sessions that got twisted with people championing him for protecting his kin from him. That’s one interpretation... but to me it looks like he’s brushing something off her dress and doesn’t realize Biden is near until they meet eyes.</p>
