<p>1) Someone said the word pizza in an email.</p>

<p>2) Some unnamed person in 4chan said that was code for child sex.</p>

<p>3) There is a pizza place in an urban setting that features urban art.</p>

<p>4) Customers posted photos of their children on a social networking page of a family friendly restaurant.</p>

<p>That’s kinda what it seems like to me. We keep hearing about these emails, and such a big deal has been and is constantly being made about them that it’s starting to seem like we’d be looking at a different picture had they not been hacked and leaked.</p>

<p>You also have to wonder if similar emails were leaked and not released by WikiLeaks, perhaps because of some political bias exhibited by the group.</p>

<p>Has anything pro-democrat ever come out of WikiLeaks since 2016? Has anything anti-Trump? Is there any nuance at all or is it the case that this whole scandal appears to be consciously designed to serve a political purpose?</p>

Because if I didn’t say that, but you claim I did without evidence, that’s a disinformation method known as a “lie.” Is that one on your list?</p>

<p>Are you going to ignore getting called out for misreading my question and getting before / after mixed up? I never said people didn’t go to jail for it. I just asked if there any cases of people going to jail for it before - again, <em>before</em> - the Pizzagate theory rose to prominence in 2016. For reasons I can’t explain, you responded to that request by giving me links to people going to jail for it in 2017.</p>

<p>What proofs have I demanded that are impossible to provide? What proof have I ignored? You haven’t provided any proof at all for my request of evidence that someone using the term Cheese Pizza was arrested <em>before</em> Pizzagate came into prominence in 2016. You giving me links to 2017 stories of people using cheese pizza as a codeword doesn’t work, because that’s not relevant to my request, as it obviously falls <em>after</em> the timeframe I asked about.</p>

<p>That’s like if I asked you if you have any sugar I could use for a cake I’m baking, you giving me mushrooms, my telling you I wanted sugar and not mushrooms, and you telling me that I’ve made an impossible request because I didn’t take your mushrooms instead of the sugar that I originally requested.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any proof that &quot;cheese pizza&#39; began to be used in 2016. I&#39;ll give you one more comment to provide it, and then I will accept that you have no basis for the claim that it was invented after Pizzagate.</p>

<p>Yeah, you just need to actually deal with the evidence that has been presented and find sources for all of your ridiculous coincidence theories. Or did you think <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">Alice in Wonderland logic</a> was going to work here?</p>

<p>Your example is from 2017. Have you got any evidence that this was a known code word from before the conspiracy was invented?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is a little girl tied to a ping pong table &quot;urban art&quot; or is it the kind of thing sick fucks put on their instagram?</p>

<p>Option A: it is a fake account, used to make up lies about Alefantis.</p>

<p>Option B: it is a real account, and the pictures and comments are jokes made in poor things taste.</p>

<p>Option C: it is a real account, and for absolutely no reason, Alefantis has chosen the most public manner to display all evidence of his super secret society head quarters and sexual abuse crimes to the public.</p>

<p>You are probably an intelligent person... one of these options is absurd beyond belief. Can you guess which one?</p>

<p>Why are multiple accounts using this exact same talking point in the same thread? Is this a brigade or someone using alts, or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said, &quot;Direct proof is given that people are paid to lie about pizzagate&quot;, but your link didn&#39;t demonstrate that at all.  The suggestion that they <em>lie about pizzagate</em> also implies that there are lies to be told about pizzagate, but I&#39;m not exactly sure what lies you&#39;re talking about, since pizzagate still doesn&#39;t have a single victim or any real evidence to support it.</p>

<p>now if pizzagate isnt about comet ping pong and is about human trafficking in general i have no issue with that. but then maybe pizzagate is a stupid name, because it has nothing to do with comet ping pong</p>

<p>I just remember not personally being convinced that she was connected, and feeling that most of the MSM was claiming that because it was easier to paint us as nuts that way (&quot;conspiracy nutters think Hillary eats babies for breakfast, hahaha aren&#39;t they stupid?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I agree that the evidence is not conclusive. Certainly not in court.</p>

<p>My hesitance to write it off comes from stuff like Jeffery Epstein, a convicted child molester, having an airplane specifically used for pedo parties (called the  “Lolita Express”), that Bill Clinton rode on 26 times - specifically dismissing the secret service. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html">That&#39;s not fake news.</a></p>

<p>Trump called Epstein a &quot;terrific guy&quot;, and also went to his parties. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/04/jeffrey-epstein-trump-lawsuit-sex-trafficking-237983">That&#39;s not fake news.</a></p>

<p>Of course, neither of this stuff is conclusive proof that either Trump or Clinton are pedos, so I don&#39;t believe it with 100% certainty, but I at least highly suspect it.</p>

<p>So from their, if the Clintons (and Trump!) were associating closely with slimy creeps like Epstein, who owns an <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/">island (literally called &quot;Orgy Island&quot; apparently) used for underage sex parties</a>, which has weird <a href="https://i.redd.it/2vugqypz4bvx.png">temple like thingies</a> on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/18%C2%B017&#x27;53.5%22N+64%C2%B049&#x27;41.6%22W/@18.2982189,-64.8369818,3638m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d18.2981985!4d-64.8282274">it,</a> would I be surprised to find out that more of their elite associates were also pedo weirdos?

    <div class="md"><p>James Alefantis himself was deemed one of the 50 most powerful people of Washington D.CPNG by GQ magazine.
He was the romantic partnerof David Brock. David Brock is the Chief of Media Matters, a major instrument of the Democratic Party. Brock is also the founder of Correct the Record, a Super PAC that supported the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is seen with Tony Podesta here andhere. An email from Alefantis to Tony Podesta, which Tony Podesta forwarded to John Podesta had an attached file which was an image of Hillary’s Logo with a pizza slice in it, above a Comet logo. Alefantis also made desserts for a Clinton campaign event. (Notice another photo with Alefantis and Tony Podesta together, and that Alefantis visited the White House on at least five occasions.) Clinton personally thanked Alefantis for cooking for one of her fundraisers. Comet received payments of over $20k from American Bridge 21st Century PAC, a primary funder of which is billionaire Clinton-backer George Soros. Payments can be seen here, here, and here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt Pizzagate is real, but I don&#39;t doubt high-level pedo rings are absolutely real.</p>

<p>The reason I think Pizzagate is false is because I believe the right was fed up with David Brock and they wanted to destroy him. I think they were having a tough time going after him, so they went after the closest thing to him. To do this, they went after his boyfriend James Alefantis and pretty much destroyed him with these allegations. This in turn was extremely damaging to David Brock and he was devastated that his boyfriend was involved and this put a massive amount of stress on his own personal life and theor relationship.</p>

<p>I think it was incredibly effective, but I just think it was the Right hitting back by using the same dirty tactics that left use. I am not a left wing shill if you have problems with my comment, but this was just my conclusion. </p>

<p>Yes, that was great PR for him.  Gains sympathy, destroys computer evidence and derails further investigation.  </p>

<p>However, your original point was that typing &quot;chickenlover&quot; was his only link to pedophilia, and was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenhawk_(gay_slang/">invented for pizzagate</a>/).  Neither of which are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How come all the &quot;pizzagate researchers&quot; have these tenous webs of connection as fact but gloss over Trump, Epstein, and Clinton being buddies? </p>

<p>Partisan bullshit, that&#39;s why. </p>

<p>Lets examine the facts. </p>

<p>Alefantis has a goddaughter, he takes a lot of pictures with her, none of which are that weird honestly. The big if here is the phrase chickenlover, which I cannot find any source of before 2016. </p>

<p>There are what appear to be pedophillic symbols on businesses NEAR Comet, but how are they responsible for that?<br/>
   He and his instagram friends made a few dark jokes about the cooler, I&#39;ve made worse with my friends. </p>

<p>The shit against the Podestas is a lot more worrying and not defending them or Clintons. </p>

<p>So if Comet isn&#39;t part of it, why is it called pizzagate? It kinda feels like gaybashing more than anything.</p>
