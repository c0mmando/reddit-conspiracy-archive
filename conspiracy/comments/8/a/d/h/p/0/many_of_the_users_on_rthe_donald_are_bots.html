    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, the main property of Trump rhetoric that makes it ripe for botting is also likely the one that makes botting unlikely to be the culprit. Memeing is a core tenet of Trump rhetoric, and is a practice that lends itself to repetition and common forms. This is intentional, and you can see how well it’s working by trying to find an instance where someone who’s bought into the narrative changes their mind when faced with new evidence. This occurrence is exceedingly rare, likely because it isn’t really about evidence.</p>

<p>It isn’t something people seem to buy into because they believe the evidence and agree with the stance. They buy in because the evidence agrees with what they already believe, and the veracity of the evidence is often overlooked.</p>

<p>The phenomenon can be readily observed by perusing <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> or even parts of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It isn’t about the objective truth, it’s all one big campaign rally for Donald Trump. They state as much on t_d, but this seems to apply to the culture in general as well.</p>

<p>This is not to say everyone who supports Trump has bought into the meme. There are plenty of folks who simply agree with his policies or his stated vision for America. You are unlikely, however, to see these people fully participating in the memeing and rhetoric. Usually when you see someone repeating the meme a few times, you will find that they participate fully and very rarely go against the quintessential narrative.</p>

<p>There are some folks skeptical of Al Gore&#39;s get rich quick scheme. The models have consistently been wrong. Pretty sure the ice caps were supposed to be gone by 2016, and I really doubt they&#39;re still here because people bought enough Prius&#39;.</p>

<p>Beep boop beep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, could be. Does seem a little hollow, doesn&#39;t it? That whole suite of subs - <a href="/r/DrainTheSwamp">/r/DrainTheSwamp</a>, <a href="/r/HillaryForPrison">/r/HillaryForPrison</a>, <a href="/r/RandomActsofTrump">/r/RandomActsofTrump</a>, r/The_Congress, I&#39;m sure there are others. Check those new queues - lots of posts, barely any comments, almost no actual conversation beyond cliches and catechisms. Lots of &#39;can I go home now&#39; posts, those rote two-sentence replies to OP with no opinion or new information or really anything that might explain why the poster was compelled to say anything at all.</p>

<p>And now and then, the telltale sign of a plant out of their depth - where they can&#39;t even begin to comprehend the worldview they&#39;re supposed to be portraying, so they just invert their own team&#39;s talking points. This sort of thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>upvoted for two reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Agree wholeheartedly.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I can&#39;t unsee Trump wearing a ushanka in the thumbnail. RUSSIAN COLLUSION :D hahaha!</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a reply to a meme with the theme of &#39;trump is saving america&#39;. </p>

<p>The reply to that, by the way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HAHAHA I see it too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8a88u0/mrpresident/">whole thread</a> is worth a look, it&#39;s the one OP posted in. That&#39;s some Home Alone-tier puppetry.</p>

<p>Not sure what&#39;s happened. Could be related to the sudden breeze we can feel in here, with our 2,718 free thinkers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! It&#39;s eerie. Has it been like that for long? I mean it was alive at some point, I remember it. Not alive in a good way, like in an overcrowded pub toilet sort of way, but at least alive.</p>

<p>Christ, imagine being the last real trump fan to leave. It would be like if you were in an overcrowded pub toilet talking to someone, then you looked up and they were a mannequin. Then you looked round and they were all mannequins. Then you ran out down the stairs and it was mannequins everywhere, all blank faces and sideways arms, and one of them says &#39;HAHAHA I see it too&#39; and you&#39;re freaking out, then you run outside into a tramp with eyes like dinnerplates and he says &#39;trump&#39;s got kinetic space guns and the pope is satan&#39; and you say &#39;fuck thank god, another human&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked at your account and it appears that you&#39;ve made 2 low effort comments on The_Donald, and no one responded to them.  And now you&#39;ve come here to cry about it.  Why?</p>
