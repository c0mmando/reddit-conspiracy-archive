        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Elevated blood sugar develops only after your pancreas is permanently damaged, but a simple blood test could let you know whether it is working too hard long before permanent damage occurs. High blood pressure and increased abdominal fat (like a spare tire or beer belly) are two common signs that should alert your doctor to start testing fasting insulin levels. Unfortunately nobody gets rich from telling you to eat right and exercise, so they never run that test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>40 years ago my grandfather had a kidney disease that required dialysis.  My mom had to drive him 20 miles round trip for treatment. Today, one out of four shopping centers near me have a dialysis clinic tenant, and four blocks a way, on a secondary street at best, a freestanding dialysis clinic just went up.  Many of these patients are diabetics. </p>

<p>There is far too much money in selling personal glucose meters, testing strips, Metformin, and insulin to consider educating people on how to stop the disease.  Once people have to eat more carbs to stay awake from insulin they graduate to heart disease or kidney failure.  After that home health care with walkers, bed rails, nurses, and catheters.</p>

<p>One thing I will say, however, is that every time I have blood drawn for anything they do test for blood glucose.  I am not sure it is the test that is the problem.  I suspect that it is the false sense of security provided by the initial prescription of a glucose control drug, followed by little if any practical dietary advice, that leads to the problem.  People are set up to fail, and fail they do.  I don&#39;t want to make excuses for people but I think if someone explained to patients with initial signs of insulin resistance that the food pyramid is a lie paid for by the sugar lobby it may save a few lives and a few billion dollars a year. </p>

<p>The history of corn subsidies (as they exist now) as I recall is mostly political -- it was to permanently depress prices so it wouldn&#39;t be a pain in Nixons ass anymore. At this point theY serve little but to enrich Monsanto and other buyers of cheap corn to produce cheap garbage. Even the farmers get fucked </p>

<p>Its honestly kind of funny you think millions of americans dont know to eat less carbs because of a giant conspiracy. Its because they are fat and wont stop eating and smoking and drinking. Its that simple. </p>

<p>Theres no need for a giant conspiracy of every doctor ever, every pharma company ever, every insurance provider ever, etc to explain whats easily explained by people being fat, lazy, and stubborn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re intentionally misleading. Of course your diabetes doesn&#39;t magically go away once you lose the fat. Obesity caused your type 2 diabetes. The vast majority of people with diabetes are fat. </p>

<p>Two of the biggest risk factors in contracting type 2 diabetes are lack of physical activity and obesity. Individuals with a normal BMI that do end up with type 2 diabetes are rare and I would argue a western diet probably played a part.</p>

<p>I mean, doctors have been pushing eating right and exercising for literal decades. The only thing this test tells you is hey - you should <em>really be</em> eating right and exercising, before permanent damage is done. </p>

<p>It would be negative for doctors to start testing most people. People already don&#39;t eat right and exercise, even though they know the dangers. Although some people might start doing it if they were told they were pre-diabetic, there are lots who still wouldn&#39;t - and those who took the test and didn&#39;t get a bad result would see that as justification for their negative (eating badly and not exercising) behaviors, and would be less likely to eat right and/or excercise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually education changes behavior which is why pharma uses the lunch and learn model to influence doctors prescribing habits. It absolutely works and the numbers confirm it. Unfortunately educating patients will reduce patients reliance on docs as the source of their “cure” so it is not typically done. The business model is based on the logical fallacy of the docs “appeal to authority” trust the doc he is the expert. Of course docs don’t have time to educate a patient that would change the patients behavior and reduce the need for the treatment and reduce profits. Only the stakeholders who stand to make money get the education. </p>

<p>Stop there. People are constantly educated to eat right and exercise. If they don&#39;t do it, there&#39;s only so much blame that can be put on the doctors or pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>I&#39;m usually the first person to call out the pharmaceutical companies for the bullshit they do (including the type of behavior you&#39;re describing), but when it comes to basic things that can have a massive effect on one&#39;s health - basic things that are SO OFTEN SAID AND SHOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF - patients do have some responsibility. If they perpetually ignore all doctors&#39; advice, some of that blame lies on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delay I took a break. Pharma uses a practice called lunch and learn because it is PROVEN to change a physicians prescribing habits. Many people still think that healthy diet equals margarine, or they think skim milk is a healthy option. In fact, in the 50’s and 60’s people ate white bread, and all sorts of processed foods yet they maintained healthier levels of weight. Something is going on with our food supply. Life expectancy has actually gone down. People are obese at levels never seen before. Hospitals and docs are investing in larger beds, stretchers, chairs. It’s bad. To simply say it’s personal habit is not enough. Food is not the only thing that makes you fat. In fact hormone imbalance can make you fat despite a healthy diet. Liver disfunction can also make a person obese. There is a lot more to this what has changed since the 60’s? GMOs? Steroids? Estrogens? High fructose corn syrup, antibiotics, trans fats, heavy metals? 
What should worry you most is that doctors are not asking these questions, they are not raising the alarm and looking for the cause. Instead they are cashing in on treating the endless diseases that obesity causes. There are no profits in curing patients. This is a well known fact in the medical community. I know first hand. However don’t take my word for it. Just look at the investment outlook: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/</a></p>

<p>But telling someone to &quot;eat less carbs&quot; and &quot;eat better&quot; is completely insufficient to actually help them.  People need real guidance, not just 2 sentences.  The problem is, very few doctors have any real idea exactly how to eat to reverse diabetes.  It&#39;s not simple, you have to read labels, and you have to eat very carefully.  For example, eating out at restaurants takes a great deal of care and teaching.</p>

<p>Telling someone to &quot;eat less carbs&quot; is a sick twisted joke when carbs form the bulk of every meal and every snack for a person&#39;s entire life.  How the fuck are they supposed to eat?  They need TEACHING and 2 sentences doesn&#39;t cut it.</p>

I have also noticed my local supermarkets do not carry as many sugar free products as they used to. My grandmother had diabetes and 15 years ago I can say things were different. They used diet a lot more to control the insulin. Today according to Mayo Clinic, sugar is not off limits and oacassionaly indulging is fine even healthy.

 However metformin was not used before, around 15 years ago.

In fact I can say the lunch and learn pharma marketing efforts are established on the proven premise that education changes behavior. This is proven in pharma and their numbers corroborate it. So the lack of patient education in diet and diabetes is an issue. </p>

<p>The two are not exclusive. A 100g apple has mere <a href="https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1809/2">10g of sugars</a> and is about 85% water. If a person is going from gulping down Fig Newtons by the sleeve to crunching apples by the box, the latter is much better and satiates eventually due to dietary fiber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ketosis... fasting... you really have no idea what you are talking about.  Meat based diets are the healthiest.  The problem is that the market is full of diseased, frankenstein meat from tortured animals.  Dairy and eggs are similar stories.  There is a vast difference in nutritional quality between meat from standard industrialized food production and meat from pastured animals eating their natural diet.  Lumping all meat together and then concluding that all meat is bad for you is the current propaganda strategy of the vegan camp.  Don&#39;t spread their deceit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what the ketosis state is? Your response leads me to believe you don&#39;t. Meat, no matter the origin, is still high in cholesterol. This is all basic nutrition, there are literally hundreds of studies linking cholesterol and heart disease, the keto diet is a current Reddit circle jerk to convince extremely fat people they can still eat meat and cheese and lose weight and be healthy when only the former is true. Funny how so many conspiracy theorists can understand 911 truths but know nothing about the food they put in their mouths. Cognitive dissonance is strong here too. And vegan propaganda? What? </p>

So much misinfo on this board and the health care industry is salivating. There is only one diet proven to reverse heart disease and diabetes and thats a plant based diet. Not keto.

<p>The conspiracy would be at the level of what is recommended to doctors and nutritionists. The committees in the US that drew up dietary recommendations in the 1950s and &#39;60s were heavily influenced by research funded by the Sugar Research Foundation. They buried research implicating sugar and funded research to blame fats. High cholesterol was successfully linked with heart disease, but until recently no one investigated the link between artificially lowered cholesterol and all cause mortality. It was like having a marketing department direct medical research, and then using that research to guide national policy. (Sorry for the tangent.)</p>

<p>Even today the soft drink industry is funding research to blame metabolic syndrome on lack of exercise. Exercise <em>can</em> fix the problem created by sugary drinks, but we still need to warn people that sugary drinks can cause metabolic syndrome. (Two tangents. I&#39;m gonna shut up now.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re quite right, most Trumpites have some false equivalents regarding socialism.</p>

<p>Socialism is about removing the hierarchies of class and power in society.  Government is one of those hierarchies.  Using government to actually provide services upholds the bourgeoisie and power hierarchy that socialism seeks to destroy.  Using government to provide social services ....</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s actually closer to fascism.  Mussolini was originally a socialist, who decided to throw away the class warfare part of socialism (which is the core identity of socialist theory) and work to achieve the end goals of socialism -- including the providing of necessary services like health care -- using government.</p>

<p>Of course we have democratic socialists, which is sortof a brand of fascism that dispenses with the fascist &quot;One Leader, One Party&quot; idea and attempts to use democratic processes to achieve some of the functional end goals of socialism (again, throwing away the class warfare aspect of socialism along the way, which is the core identity).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found, anecdotally, that Americans seem to not understand that socialism is a scale. Giving a homeless dude or a charity money, is socialism. Providing government subsidised medical care is socialism.</p>

<p>Obviously one end of the socialism scale is state-subsidised income or fully community owner production. </p>

<p>Democratic socialism, which is what I was referring to, is party-controlled socialism, with bug government overseeing provision of quality of life in exchange for higher taxes/productivity from its citizens.</p>

<p>This is what I truly believe is the best way forward for societies. I believe big government is more trustworthy than corporations. It&#39;s not a popular view in a conspira y subreddit obviously, and governments corrupt easily. However, capitalism has proven that profit is master and quality of life is a far distant consideration. </p>

<p>I am indeed American.  Not only am I American, I&#39;m one of those damnable Trump voters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously one end of the socialism scale is state-subsidised income or fully community owner production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That scale is the grand scale of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right.&quot;  I suggest reading Mussolini&#39;s Doctrine of Fascism.  It is tedious and obnoxious and full of classic Italian delusions of grandeur, but it does lay out some very interesting and important points.</p>

<p>First is that fascism is a chimera.  It can look like anything and everything.  There are only a few key points that must be observed in order for it to be fascism.  One is that government must be supreme in all matters, without limit, without boundaries.  Human rights, even, are allowed, so long as the government has the ability to terminate them if necessary.</p>

<p>This use of government to achieve goals is what makes fascism &quot;right wing.&quot;  Nazi Germany had public health care, welfare, and many social programs.  These individual features of an economy DO NOT make a country &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right.&quot;  This is a great and terrible mistake that many people make, both in America and around the world.</p>

<p>The difference between &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; is <em>who is doing the work.</em>  Remember the origin of the term &quot;left&quot; as a political label?  From the ending days of the French aristocracy, when the anarchists sat to the left of the throne.  The conservatives, who wished to maintain government autocratic power, sat to the right.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Socialism is a left-wing philosophy because it seeks to destroy all hierarchies including government.</p></li>
<li><p>Fascism is a right-wing philosophy because it uses government.</p></li>
<li><p>National socialism is a right-wing philosophy because it uses government (even though many of things it tried to do such as national health care and so on might seem very left-wing-ish).</p></li>
<li><p>Democratic socialism is a right-wing philosophy because it uses government (democratically-elected government is still government) to achieve its goals.</p></li>
<li><p>In America, both political parties are staggeringly right-wing.  There is no functioning left-wing party with any serious political influence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m enjoying the conversation, too.  Hope you don&#39;t mind chatting with a fucking Trumpster.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, a total of 41 type 2 diabetic patients randomly were assigned to ginger or placebo groups (22 in ginger group and 19 in control group), received 2 g/day of ginger powder supplement or lactose as placebo for 12 weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whole foods plant based diet is a gimmick to promote veganism and reduce animal food consumption.  Veganism/vegetarianism can be useful short term for detoxification, but they are not nourishing and will lead to problems if followed long term.  All the people raising sustainability issues with animal foods are presenting biased information that is premised on all the meat coming from industrial agriculture.  They are half right in that this meat can be unhealthy, but they ignore the naturally raised livestock and sustainable farming that involves animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a treatment for chronic disease, a vegan diet composed of whole foods is an excellent.  Many people find it to be more effective than pharmaceuticals for certain diseases.  Certainly the case for T2 diabetes.</p>

<p>These diets are quite nourishing and promote health over a long period of time.  As people age, a small amount of high-quality meat may be helpful to supplement protein, but in general a plant-based diet is one of the biggest things anyone can do to increase longevity and health.</p>

<p>Individual people may have other requirements.  But WFPB diets are a great starting place for just about everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long term vegans have all sorts of problems if they don&#39;t supplement their diet.  Supplements come with their own bag of issues.  WFPB was made up by special interests.  Eliminating things from SAD helps the people who go to WFPB initially, but they degenerate and develop chronic diseases if they continue long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t even have to wait months when it comes to diabetes. </p>

<p><em>Typical</em> results to expect on low fat whole foods vegan diet are insulin cut in half after a few days, and off all insulin within a week. For type I, insulin requirements are reduced. </p>

<p>Potent enough that it is borderline dangerous to do without medical supervision. </p>

<p>And unlike keto diets, the condition is actually cured, as in the body&#39;s ability to process sugar is restored. Keto takes away the problematic input (ie sugar) but does not fix the broken machinery. And really only makes it worse, considering the role of fat in insulin resistance and the incredibly high insulinogenic nature of meat (*as high as white sugar).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wouldnt call this a conspiracy but a side effect of the profit motivated health care industry</p>

<p>there is profit in curing diseases and making products</p>

<p>the profit in a healthy lifestyle is diffused across numerous quality food producers/gyms/lifestyle activities.</p>

<p>fact is the market will follow the profit. look whats happened to the internet: everything motivated by clicks even though quality of content is on average completely terrible</p>

<p>without a profit motive for healthcare things would look vastly different. the focus would be on lifestyle and preventative medicine. but selling vegetables doesnt keep pfizer in business</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re still eating processed foods, stop. Switch to whole foods. Move away from any sort of sodas or flavored drinks and towards (gasp) water.</p>

<p>Start moving to a raw, organic plant-based diet. It won&#39;t happen all at once. Maybe go fruit-only until noon. Maybe cut out all beef. Whatever works for you, but get on that path as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Exercise can start easy. Just start making it a habit. Maybe go for a walk in the morning/evening. Join a yoga gym. Need need to get hardcore -- indeed that can be counter-productive. Just get moving. You have to move for your immune system to work properly. And sweat. Your skin is your 3rd kidney.</p>
