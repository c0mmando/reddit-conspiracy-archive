       One of the big critiques of groups like this is that every major (sometimes minor) event is a conspiracy, false flag, or turns the frogs gay. So I'd like to know from you guys, what are some serious events that you believe happened simply as they say they happened? What isn't a conspiracy?

       Everything is a conspiracy. Look at your own daily life and the simplest of examples. If you are a man, and your wife/girlfriend goes out with her 'friends' and she comes home really late and you ask her why she was late, she'll give you an answer. it's up to you to believe her story. If you don't, what's that called? Conspiracy theory. Because she conspired to give you a story that might not be the truth. If you find out some shady things, then you start questioning her story, correct? That's a conspiracy theory for ya. The term 'conspiracy theory' tends to be received as this 'obscure thing that only crazy people are interested in' when it's a literal fact in all our daily lives. It's called 'trusting your instinct, not believing an official narrative when there is information suggesting otherwise'.

       You realize Atrazine and gay frogs are a very real thing right? It may have been sensationalized a bit by COINTELPRO agent Alex Jones, but it's very real stuff that you shouldn't be downplaying. Just about everything is quite literally a conspiracy; every major story you see on the news is being pushed for a reason. All of the stories you don't hear about are the real stories. Everything you see cut and ready on the news is pushed by TPTB. Every single mass shooting has a thousand fishy details behind it. I wish that wasn't the case. Every time there's a mass shooting I try to rationalize the event and try to dissect it from a non-conspiracy type of viewpoint, but nope, always reports of 2-3 shooters, dressed in full black, blatant crisis actors, etc. The world is a stage. This is not only an information war, but what I believe to be a spiritual war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean think about it
       <a href="/u/HesburghLibrarian">
        /u/HesburghLibrarian
       </a>
       . Think about all of the wars, all of the shit in our food, our water, the air. Think about the HUGE reduction in sperm count in men. Think about the sudden normalization of transgenders. Kids on anti-depressants, anxiety medication, kids taking hormones at age 3. I mean things are really screwed up, and if you can't see that people behind the curtain are running things on this planet, then I don't know what to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hardly any serious event that has happened, has simply "happened". Every major past event that I look up now has a conspiracy attached to it, and for good reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at war, and I'm not entirely sure the beings that we're up against are human. I think David Icke may be onto something, and one day soon we may just wish we believed him sooner.

       I gotta admit. That day when a user posted some proof about the gay frogs thing, since that day I hesitate before I discount any crazy theory (well, almost). What that taught me is that there’s probably substance to most claims made with some amount of research and substance to it, but the theories are often not presented in the most consumable way.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, I still maintain that those two dudes that claimed Jesus had reincarnated into some random dude from Sudan or millennial from Florida? Nah, man. They nuts.

       I don't doubt that shit in our food/water/air has massive effects on the population. Do you believe that all of those effects are intentional and planned? Genuinely curious, thanks for your comment.

       Sadly, the longer you spend analyzing these trends, and the more digging you do into why they're being done, the more you are convinced everything is intentional and planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hardest part for me was getting past the fact that there was a group of humans that could be capable of doing all this without screwing it up, as humans are wont to do. But I now understand they have some extra help, and a few nefarious tricks up their sleeves.

       Here's the other side of that coin though, it doesn't have to he intentional or planned to be a conspiracy. If they knew that these things were happening and looked the other way because it was more profitable for them, that's just as much a conspiracy. There doesn't always have to be a grand master plan. Sometimes its just greed and apathy.

       Barack Obama was born in Hawai'i. For the most simple reason, that if somehow "Joe Q. Random Internet guy" somehow knows that he was born in Kenya, yet Hillary, McCain, and Romney some how didn't care enough to use this bit of info to disqualify their competition. I'm thinking it's not true.

       It seems highly unlikely that the moon landings were fake. Or that the Earth is flat. What convinced me beyond doubt was the space footage of the 60's vs what Hollywood was doing. No comparison.

       This isn’t a group that believes everything is a conspiracy. It’s just a place where the news can be examined through a “conspiracy” lens. It’s not in the interest of a ruling class of Jews and eugenicists to tell us gentile serfs the truth about everything.

       Many conspiracy theorists list a few indicators that point to a false flag/manufactured event, so it would follow if those features aren't present for an event, then it was likely a real/unscripted event.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if an event is real, that doesn't stop the news from adding their bias to the story; only so much can be relayed through an article and every news agency has their preferred angles, narratives, and perspectives from which they write.

       The problem is that EVERYTHING IS a conspiracy to someone.  We don't all believe everything here, we each have our own mess.  But that being said if you take half a million people you're going to find that at least one of them considers something a conspiracy.  Nothing is sacred here;  Race, gender, nationality, orientation, age, politics and anything else you can imagine are expressly open to criticism.  Any attempt by anyone to create a protected class which we aren't allowed to examine under the microscope of suspicion should be swiftly thrown overboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how this place used to be, if you were interested in a specific Conspiracy you upvoted it and discussed it, if you weren't interested in one you just ignored it.  Now we have a situation (which I believe is artificial) where people insist on burying things they don't like.  Or they bury things that are stealing the spotlight from their own mess.

       I know you're making light of the notion of conspiracy theories in general, and that's fine you have every right to. However, next time something happens to you, or you experience something that makes you unhappy look into what is behind it. If you or someone you care for gets an illness, look into why it has occurred. If you experience some sort of financial hardship, look into why it has occurred. Do your own research and keep questioning until you find a satisfactory answer. Conspiracy theories are some sub bread of people that have trust issues. It's just ordinary people who have done their own research and found that what they are being told isn't the truth.

       When they get shutdown by the ever growing police state for not having a permit, it certainly becomes a conspiracy.

       That people are selfish assholes quite often.

       Also the reason conspiracies happen. And by that I mean "real conspiracies", because I know many people are so brainwashed that they believe the word conspiracy alone means "crazy theory" rather than a type of crime. You can thank CIA for that, they popularized the term "conspiracy theorist" to take the heat off JFK murder theories from citizens.

       Its like Kevin Bacon. You could probably tie most things to some type of "conspiracy" if you wanted to. That doesnt mean close to everyone is involved. This all takes place in the real world. The little people are just doing their jobs and may not even know money is being laundered, or shady shit goes down after hours, or a conglomorate uses financial influence to pass laws that benefit it. There a little billions of things that are not themselves tied to conspiracy but you could play the connection game if you wanted to.
