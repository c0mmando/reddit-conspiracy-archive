<p>Top, past year: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mj1MyF3.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/Mj1MyF3.jpg</a></p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s easy to lose track of the bigger picture when browsing primarily by new and looking only at new content. If someone was new to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and they wanted to get a feel for what the sub is about, they might look at old posts.</p>

<p>While looking through the top and most controversial posts for the past year, I noticed a clear bias taking shape even on the first page of results.</p>

<p>Within the first page of most controversial posts in the past year, there are 16 which I would categorize as pro-Trump based on the post titles, and 4 which I would consider anti-Trump.</p>

<p>Within the first page of the top posts in the past year, there are 3 which I would categorize as pro-Trump, and 1 which I would categorize as anti-Trump.</p>

<p>These numbers seem a bit off to me. This is the conspiracy forum, and I would have expected to see more conspiracies about our latest President. It would appear that some effort is being taken to &quot;quickly bury&quot; anti-Trump posts, so that while there may appear to be a bunch of them to someone who browses every day in new, the lasting impression left by the sub is decidedly pro-Trump, and more importantly it is decidedly not anti-Trump.</p>

<p>It would appear there is a slight shilling problem here, but I don&#39;t think Shareblue are the culprits.</p>

<p>Trump is the first president in a long, long time that hasn&#39;t started a new war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just that it&#39;s strange for there to be so little in the way of keeping the President on his toes around here lately</p>

<p>Name anything bad he&#39;s done and I&#39;ll give you another president who set precedent for it.  He&#39;s a standard Republican who has only enacted standard Republican policy.  &quot;Oh my God but Twitter&quot; does not affect the average American in their daily life.  The vast majority of Americans are never going to go abroad to <em>meet</em> those countries who &quot;hate Americans&quot; (they don&#39;t have any stronger opinions on Americans than Americans have on them).</p>

<p>It&#39;s all media hype.  Stop holding the president to a higher standard than the other 43 and then flipping out when he acts like the rest of them acted.  The president is a distraction from the military industrial complex and this current one just happens to really work on you.</p>

<p>reversal of the protections Obama put into place</p>

<p>...do you just not understand that Republicans platform almost exclusively on deregulation and smaller government?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or his orders to hastily advance construction on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Republican party is run by the energy sector, the Democrats are run by the banks.  Didn&#39;t we go to war over a pipeline like... Two years ago?  And invade Libya over oil?  And go to war in the middle east every few years since the early 90s over oil...?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or his ban on international abortion counseling?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nixon fought tooth and nail against abortion, but then Roe v Wade happened under his administration.  Like <em>name</em> a republican president and he&#39;s fought against abortion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership</p>

<p>Lincoln was anti-slavery too.</p>

<p>When you browse the sub over a longer period of time, you are left with the impression that all of the conspiracies around Trump are bogus. If there are any anti-Trump conspiracies, and I mean real conspiracies not just MSM crap, they are being suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most pro-Trump stuff that is even somewhat possible is in the news already, the only difference being that it&#39;s on Fox instead of CNN.</p>

<p>But how about his stance on Mexicans, his stance on Muslims, his refusal to disclose his tax returns, his refusal to divest himself from a controlling interest in his companies, his treatment of women, his connections with the mob, his deceptive business practices like Trump University, and the fact that all of his voters either don&#39;t care about or actually support these things.</p>

<p>Out of the first pages of the top and most controversial in the past year, I believe one of these things shows up once. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly understand what you are saying. But... he is such a popular enemy to have that you have whole think tanks  detected to finding anything that he has ever done wrong in any aspect of his life. If things were going to shit, he wouldn’t have as much support, but for the majority of people, life is better now then 2 years ago, and the left has no counter to that. </p>

<p>Because much of media is left leaning, it feels like the vast majority is against trump. Which is problematic for democrats because Americans like an underdog. And it is fuckin strange that the party that has the presidency, and the majority in the house and senate, is still the underdog party. I feel your pain. </p>

<p>This is my theory regarding our current politics. The majority of the country wants prosperity. After 8 year of a democrat run country, they didn’t see what they wanted to see. They are now focusing on the positive with Trump and are starting to see a change for the better. The more the left screams that the world is ending, the more the country sees that it isn’t. It may, but it hasn’t and probably won’t. </p>

<p>I want our country to be better today then it was yesterday, i am starting to think that for the majority, it is getting better.  +/-</p>

Embezzling campaign funds to relatives and personal businesses at inflated prices to pocket more money.  On, and on.</p>

<p>But the media (and the rest of the intelligence and political establishment) is obsessed with the <em>muh russha</em> narrative, to the point of absurdity.  Why would that be, when there&#39;s so much more substantial evidence to pick from?</p>

<p>Take a look at the comments of most posts here, there are plenty of anti-Trump comments. Take a look at new for a few days, there are plenty of them. So why didn’t any of them make it to the top in the past year? It’s like they are being suppressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#39;RESOURCE BURN.&#39; By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#39;drive in the wedge.&#39; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>

<p>something negative about democrats does not equal pro-trump. </p>

<p>thats not helping your case bro. i dont visit T_D and am not interested in what are democrat or republican talking points. those do not equal pro or con Trump. </p>

<p>your post cries &quot;poor democrats arent getting a fair shake&quot;, and whilst i am in agreement that the posts are slanted toward pro-Trump, you gotta remember, the democrips raped the American Dream for 8 years straight, then offered a massively corrupt piece of shit as a candidate who pushed out a shoe-in bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>Well, after Hillarys (and Bills) shady past became better known, she still thought she could beat an obvious Corrupt idiot like Trump. she was wrong. </p>

<p>both the Democrips &amp; Rebloodlican gangs should be hung from the nearest tree till they are dead. </p>

<p>this little pity party you have going on in here makes me sick. All you two party idiots make me sick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not implying you are pro-Trump or that you’re even American. I’m stating that there seem to be a bunch of pro-Trump posts visible on the sub over the long term, and very few anti-Trump posts.</p>

<p>I agree that both parties are messed up, and I don’t like the democrats much either. If I had my way, all of the anti-Democrat posts would still be here, but there would also be conspiracies about the president on a conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>That’s what I found strange, the lack of any really anti-Trump conspiracies. It’s strange because you often see them on New, but so few of them are making it to the longer timeframe lists.</p>

<p>I’m sorry if I was unclear about any of that, and I can see how my post could be taken as pro-Democrat, but let me assure you I’m right there with you in hating the two-party corrupt system in modern day America.</p>

<p>I just think conspiracies about the President would be discussed here, and they are, but why aren’t any of them sticking around on the longer timeframe views? My theory is that they’re being suppressed, maybe by Russians or maybe by T_D, or even some other group.  I don’t know, but I do know it doesn’t feel organic to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey you used my colored trump face schema! Thanks for the thought out response.</p>

<p>Regarding the NN posts, are you saying anti-NN is anti-Trump, or pro-NN is anti-Trump? Wasn&#39;t it under Trump that Pai did away with NN? I know Obama appointed him to the FCC but Trump appointed him as director.</p>

<p>Also I should explain some of my inclusions and exclusions. I figured there&#39;s a narrative where people are welcome to badmouth Kushner, Sessions, Tillerson, and anyone else in Trump&#39;s administration besides the man himself.</p>

<p>I can probably revisit my assessment of the most controversial posts, but I think my assessment of the top posts is fairly accurate. It&#39;s a bit of a stretch to say that anything anti-NN is anti-Trump. Or is it? I&#39;m still a bit confused about that and would appreciate your explanation of it.</p>

<p>Are there any specific inclusions to the pro-Trump category I made that you disagree with?</p>

<p>There should be way more anti-Trump posts on controversial in the past year. It’s not organic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figured it would be something like that, which is why it’s weird that there aren’t more in controversial. On most days you can check top 24 hours and see a few of them, but none of them made it to 1 year and even 1 month tends more toward the ratios I showed in the screenshots.</p>

<p>Check top/controversial past day/week/month/year and you’ll see what I mean. I’m thinking it has to be some way they are exploiting the controversial algorithm to keep them off the first few pages of controversial. Either that, or the posts are being removed, but I don’t know how I’d check for that. Or the people making these posts could be getting banned, which means eventually there are less people making them, and I don’t know how you’d check for that either.</p>
