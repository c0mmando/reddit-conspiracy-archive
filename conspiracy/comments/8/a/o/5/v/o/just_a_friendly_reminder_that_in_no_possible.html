    <div class="md"><p>This is what the people who follow the offical story believe:</p>

<p>&quot;On the morning of April 4th, 2017, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, on the verge of a military victory against the terrorist insurgency in his country and on the eve of peace talks that would secure his position as president, decided to use chemical weapons <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/18/statement-president-completion-mv-cape-ray-destruction-syria-s-declared-">he didn’t have</a> against a target of no military significance in front of as many cameras as possible to cross the one red line that would insure his own government’s downfall.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. Being able to be exposed to truth side by side with media lies or spin side by side (or government lies whatever) can cause a cascading effect on future narratives. </p>

<p>There may be only 10000 (dont know real numvers using for example) people that believe the government lied about say the Kennedy assassination. Then you get those 10k plus anotger 10k from the next lie. Eventually we have say 10 million after 911. </p>

<p>That just keeps cascading as more and more people question things.</p>

<p>Then they go back and look at past events which cements tgeir thoughts on current ones.</p>

<p>Then you have it all right here in one sub for easy finding and referencing in future discussions.</p>

<p>For me 911 always looked odd. Then a friend introduced me to haarp. Combining it with mkultra, and other admitted things, it becomes much more fishy. And then you have something like Vegas.</p>

<p>But thays why its a long game. Eventually something will happen that will make someone question it. Then when you have a pattern of fishy outcomes you end up with a two like Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes make them think. Then when they say something right you provide positive reinforce ment and words of encouragement. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how I changed my then girlfriend (now fiance) from making fun of me for saying 911 official atory is a lie. Provide evidence let them come to their own conclusions. Reinforce the right ones. Dont onsult over wrong ones provide a new way to think about it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t join the military and tell the same thing to friends and family. If we don&#39;t have brainwashed people willingly selling themselves to these institutions maybe we wouldn&#39;t have the issue of our military butting itself into every conflict. We can blame the politicians - but ultimately they are not the ones committing the atrocities. Same thing for every country.</p>

<p>Now you will discount any evidence that doesn&#39;t fit your conclusion. You will string things together to build a narrative you deem plausible to support the conclusion you started with.</p>

<p>If, and when evidence comes out, I certainly won&#39;t automatically discount it.  It will be met with a healthy dose of skepticism, but not discounted.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really uncertain how you ascertained my stance came from an emotional response.  We have a vampiric, bloated defense (this is an inversion, it&#39;s been offensive for decades) department/MIC seemingly aching to enter yet another conflict, I believe.  Perhaps you don&#39;t agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try a game theory approach.</p>

<p>The Syrian government wants to maximize its payout in the war. We can therefore assume that the decisions made by Syria in the war will either improve Syria&#39;s payout or that Syria believes its decisions will improve its payout. </p>

<p>What would the payout from using sanctioned chemical weaponry be? Such an attack does not improve the Syrian government&#39;s payout to justify such an attack. Attacking non-military targets does not help the war effort, using chemical weapons would invite foreign intervention against the government despite the government being on the winning side, and the result of using chemical weapons can easily be achieved by conventional munitions.</p>

<p>For Syria to have done what is being alleged, it needs to believe that the military benefits of using chemical weapons outweighs the risk of international intervention against the government. </p>

<p>Now examine the rebel position. They want to maximize their payout. They are also losing pretty badly. What is the rebel payout from accusing the government of using sanctioned chemical weapons? If their accusations are believed by the international community, then there will be an increased likelihood of international intervention against the Syrian government which would greatly help the rebels. If the accusations aren&#39;t believed, they&#39;re already on the losing side and face death/incarceration/exile.</p>

<p>Actor A is motivated to accuse actor B of doing something actor B isn&#39;t motivated to do.</p>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony">Nayirah testimony</a> was shown to be a total fake with PR company Hill &amp; Knowlton involved, they still exist as a company. Could someone maybe be working in the middle east using state secrets?</p>

<p>The BBC helped <a href="https://bbcpanoramasavingsyriaschildren.wordpress.com/">fake a panorama episode</a>, if the war is really so bad, why fake a whole incident?</p>

<p>People <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/06/03/remembering-iraq/">forget that they were part of the lies</a>- 54% of people were in favour, yet 12 years later only 37% of people remember thinking it was wrong. 
17% of people are lying to themselves! The lesson we need to learn is that we have been lied to in the past by intelligence services working with the media, why would it be any different this time?</p>

<p>As others have said, most are so deep into these lies, stick to Socratic methods, ask them, why don&#39;t we hear anything on the news about non-chemical attacks?  Why are people going home from the safety of Lebanon, Turkey or Europe to head back to Syria?
Why don&#39;t we hear a single interview from a Syrian civilian but have children being paraded instead?</p>

<p>Why would a rescue organisation lie about its funding? Why hasn&#39;t Israel bombed the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Golan-ISIS-threat-looms-large-over-Israel-and-Syrian-rebels-515888">fundamental jihadi terrorists</a> on their border? (They clearly are ideological opposites.)

    <div class="md"><p>if you stick to credible sources, sound reasoning and what seems most likely to be the truth, hopefully it shines through.</p>

<p>I hate disinformation campaigns, I&#39;m a cycling, vegan, zerowaster, who&#39;s friends who work with state secrets so I&#39;ve seen loads of it.</p>

<p>My advice is think critically, what emotions are invoked.
Study propaganda properly, not just YouTube videos.
Read some books on Soviet disinformation and their recent strategy, then some Chomsky and MediaLens.
When in doubt, assume nepotism (never work at a place where they share surnames, it&#39;s a bad idea) and you&#39;ll find it, especially in the UK.</p>

<p>A great book to read is &quot;Superforecasters&quot;, many techniques of making predictions and tracking thinking. Essential to being an engaged citizen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue is I find what I find to be credible sources until they&#39;re not.  I tend to stay on the fence about things only because I don&#39;t know.  Whenever there are clearly two sides to a debate/discussion I get skepticle.  Why is there only 2 sides?  People get upset with me and tell me I need to learn to thoknk critically yet they&#39;re the ones accepting what they&#39;ve been told.  Some conspiracy theorists do that as well.  They&#39;ll default to the conspiracy no matter what.  That&#39;s not always the answer either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to know.  Even with credible sources you are relying on a third party to tell you.  Mist of the time you don&#39;t know that source personally so not only are you relying on a third party but it&#39;s a third party you don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not attacking you or telling you you&#39;re wrong.  I&#39;m just stating my troubles and that I&#39;ve become skepticle of even &quot;credible sources&quot; whether they are conspiracy oriented or not.</p>

<p>Take flat earth for a minute.  I do not believe the Earth is flat.  However, I understand that people are questioning the official narrative.   I understand where Flat Eathers ate coming from.  The flaw, though, comes from them not questioning the people they&#39;re getting their information from.  I don&#39;t trust NASA But I don&#39;t trust the guy on YouTube telling me the Earth is flat  because he&#39;s zooming in on a boat from the beach yelling into the microphone that &quot;there&#39;s no curve&quot;.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is one of the few things I was able to prove to myself personally that it isn&#39;t real so that&#39;s why I believe it to be false.</p>

<p>One last thing, I&#39;ve come to realize that everything has to be questioned.  The official narrative, the unofficial narrative, and even the conspiracy theory.  One last thing, the things I believe feel are the absolute truth are the thikngs I should be questioning the most. </p>

<p>Anyway, definitely interested to read your writeup when you are finished with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what I&#39;m telling you is that RTs reliability is no better or worse than any other source. It&#39;s ALL propagandized today.</p>

<p>In today&#39;s media you must think for yourself and take in information from every source and use your own critical thinking skills to decipher what is real and what is not. </p>

<p>You can think of it like looking thru old school 3D glasses. If you only look thru red... Or only look through blue... U see things 2-dimensionally. But looking through both colors at once, you see in a third dimension.</p>

<p>With CNN for instance, you&#39;re dealing with the influence of the State Department (for instance CNNs chief Syria correspondent is married to the former State Department spokesman James Rubin), CIA (project mockingbird), Isreal lobby and it&#39;s corporate parent Time Warner. Time itself was created by a Skull and Bones member. </p>

<p>So you have clear biases and agendas there (and everywhere) and clear biases and agendas in the funding and ownership of RT.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re still stuck on individual sources, and not thinking for yourself with all the information you can gather from all sources, you&#39;re not getting the full, 3-dimensional image.</p>

<p>Clear enough for you?</p>

<p>Either they knew Assad was going to use chemical weapons against their own people (FOR NO RATIONAL REASON WHATSOEVER) and Lavrov tried to preemptively shift the blame, or then they really did have intel about rebels staging a false flag... Being honest with you, I&#39;m not a tinfoil hat or anything and try to stay away from conspiracies, but I&#39;m just not seeing a single plausible reason why Assad would do this... Literally the only reasonable explanation would be &quot;But Assad is THE DEVIL and wants to kill children!!!!&quot;, but that&#39;s exactly the narrative the US has created to justify wars against &quot;tyrants&quot; like Assad, Gaddafi and Hussein. </p>

<p>Listen carefully.</p>

<p>The article has a TIMESTAMP.</p>

<p>Open the article, and look at the TIMESTAMP.</p>

<p>Do you see it? Good. </p>

<p>Now, read the timestamp (if you can read).</p>

<p>It says &quot;March 2018.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about that for the moment.</p>

<p>You might not know, but the month March comes BEFORE the month April.</p>

<p>So, this article was published BEFORE the chemical attack happened.</p>

<p>The article also PREDICTED that a false-flag chemical attack would happen, exactly when and where the chemical attack did, in fact, happen.</p>

<p>It is this PREDICTION by Russian intelligence that matters.</p>

<p>That is, they WARNED that this would happen.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what source this is. What matters is, it predicted exactly what would happen, in advance, with a specificity that is very suggestive and therefore unlikely to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>I daresay you would not be in the gene pool today, if we stopped putting warning labels on things. Devolution in action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. The Russian government was literally planning on gassing Douma a month before (also before the ceasefires, so they must have had a time machine to know the military situation in the future), just because they&#39;re evil monsters intent on killing babies. Not like the Russian government couldn&#39;t send in a special forces team to clear out the last holdouts, without creating an international incident. Pretty interesting Assad gasses Douma just after major ceasefires let rebels leave the area. Guess he just wanted one last gas, for old times&#39; sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fucking ridiculous...</p>

<p>You really think the Russians are stupid enough to believe they can launch a chemical attack after warning of a false flag because western governments and their controlled media will believe them?</p>

<p>The Russians have nothing to gain from using chemical weapons in Syria... nothing at all. Especially not a limited release that only manages to kill a some civilians. It will not lead to a military victory by itself, and it certainly risks provoking US action against the Syrian government.</p>

<p>The rebels on the other hand have much to gain from killing civilians and blaming it on the Syrian government.</p>

<p>Qui Bono?</p>

The information  you are repeating is factually inaccurate. Please take a moment and look at these &quot;Facebook ads&quot; that were supposedly powerful enough to sway an election in which certain parties were spending hundreds of millions of dollars. If any of that was true, the people responsible would be among the most valued in any advertising firm on the planet. Less than 100k to swing an American presidential election? </p>

<p>But it seems like you simply want to ignore that part.</p>

<p>April 2017 article, basically explaining exactly why Assad would ever use chemical weapons, citing experts from the region. “There is no military necessity.” “It thumbs his nose at the West which is extremely popular with his supporters” “it terrifies opponents who see the international community is powerless to enforce their redline.” This makes even more sense right after the US declares it’s pulling out. Not only is the OP’s statement not an argument because it doesn’t contain any evidence, it also doesn’t make ontological sense. Assad has to rule the region after the war, if the war is practically over that’s what all his decision making would be about. But this sub is a Russian State Media apparatus so what are you gonna do, these comments will be removed like all the ones calling out the novachok analysis stickied post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you went with the warmonger paper of note covering the attack that they tried and failed to pin on Assad?  What, nothing available from WaPo?  Ah, it&#39;s terrible that Assad would feed the neocon&#39;s clamoring that we have to remove him, they sadly noted.  It&#39;s like he&#39;s just giving them the justification they need to sell the war to the public!  And lathe only thing propping up Assad is Russia, which, of course, claimed that he gave up his chemical weapons.  So Assad would be humiliating his ally and lifeline on the international stage, in order to... what?  What did he gain?  The only people that did gain were Assad&#39;s opponents, who promoted the hell out of the attack.  Trump had to launch a missile strike just to shut the idiots up.  Of course, later the investigation failed to show it was Assad, because it wasn&#39;t, because he had nothing to gain.  A chemical attack on the scale of these false flags gives Assad no advantage, but if the propaganda push builds enough momentum, it could lead to the overthrow of his government.  Doesn&#39;t seem like a good tradeoff for a man who is walking a tightrope, with foreign troops illegally occupying his country and itching to take him out.  The reasons given for why he would use chemical weapons are as retarded as the rationale for turning Libya into a terrorist playground and waging the dumbest war of the century in Iraq.  Wow, the same assholes want to destroy Syria too!  Maybe they&#39;re right this time!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is fucking hilarious. You realize that was 50 years ago right?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go over just a few examples on their being state-run propaganda.</p>

<p>1) William Pepper, the lawyer who uncovered the plot behind MLK&#39;s assassination, is completely barred from the NYT. They still stick to the official story. <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/mlk/">Corbett Report episode here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJEc9vDwf8c&amp;amp;t=1316s">full interview here.</a></p>

<p>2) <a href="https://www.alternet.org/media/noam-chomsky-reads-new-york-times-explains-why-paper-record-pure-propaganda">Noam Chomsky reads the NYT and explains its newspeak and talking points.</a></p>

<p>3) <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/new-york-times-great-paper-great-propaganda-organ/5308591">More examples in history of blatant propaganda spread by the NYT</a></p>

<p>4) Let&#39;s not forget <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/11/30/the-cia-and-the-press-when-the-washington-post-ran-the-cias-propaganda-network/">Operation Mockingbird.</a></p>

<p>That literally just scratches the surface. They&#39;ve also run plenty of pieces for the Council on Foreign Relations, and many examples can be found in James Perloff&#39;s <em>Shadows of Power</em>. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Neocons&quot; isn&#39;t a buzzword, not sure where you&#39;re getting that from. I somewhat agree with the rest of this sentence, but there is PLENTY of context and history to support this being a false flag.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yet the majority of Syrians support Assad in this war. Do they all have Stockholm syndrome? And &quot;experts,&quot; haha. Most of whom are tied to the White Helmets or report to Western NGOs. There is so much disinformation in this war - more than any in history - yet here you are, taking in the word of these &quot;experts&quot; with no skepticism while pointing fingers at everyone else.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed. So that makes it all the more ironic that you have bought into the mainstream narratives rather than the good work done by independent journalists who have actually been in Syria. Eva Bartlett and Vanessa Beely being examples.</p>

<p>What Neocons are in power? None in Europe. American congress, maybe? I&#39;d say they&#39;re more oligarchical libertarian types nowadays. Whose a neocon in the government? McCain? Persona non grata in his party. Neocon doesn&#39;t mean &quot;Western Politician.&quot; Bush killed the movement and good riddance and I hope we do the same thing with the oligarchs and the ethnonationalists. What you call context I call supposition. Of course there&#39;s history to support governments being sheisty. There&#39;s a lot <em>more</em> to say it&#39;s the Russia/Syria side. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m the one arguing against superlative stances. This sub is convinced that anything that makes Russia/Assad/(Trump) look better must be right. I&#39;m deeply skeptical of totalitarian states like Russia and Assad. Eva Bartlett and Vanessa Beely are RT journalists. Real independents like Udden get kicked out. Beely and Bartlett pose for instagram pics with Assad and rail against Western lies on RT. I don&#39;t understand why you want to trust totalitarian media to the point of dismissing western media because a dozen times in the past century a western media source has shown biased language. The sensible thing is to not trust any of it. The next most sensible thing is to believe the freer societies with the better track records, particularly when they have consensus.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, regurgitating Russian narratives is supporting Russian propaganda. Where&#39;s the conspiracy that China was responsible to stoke conflict? This sub is repeatedly, reliably, 100% the RT alternative to the mainstream western narrative. It&#39;s not skepticism at all it&#39;s contrarianism at best and active sabotage of truthseeking at worst because that&#39;s what endless supposition does and that&#39;s exactly what governments want when they use propaganda.</p>

<p>Where are you getting those numbers from, other than your bias? I do not get very much info from RT myself, but I have watched segments like Cross Talk which are actually very balanced. They&#39;ve also had journalists like Chris Hedges, the two journalists I mentioned above (I&#39;ll get to that), and even people like James Corbett from the alternate media. Of course the main programming has a bias towards Russia.</p>

<p>I can respect the need to wait for evidence. However, like I said, the two outcomes are <em>not</em> equal in plausibility, which is what you are asserting. To actually make this distinction you HAVE to factor in the context - these events can&#39;t be scrutinized in a vacuum. We already have 2 other gas attacks which have been disproved. What are the chances that this one is too, considering the similar circumstances?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m the one arguing against superlative stances. This sub is convinced that anything that makes Russia/Assad/(Trump) look better must be right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strawman, and absolutely not true: the positions you are talking about just have more evidence to support them. </p>

<p>It also just so happens the West is the aggressor in Syria and is completely in the wrong here - of course people are going to support the other side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. Eva Bartlett and Vanessa Beely are RT journalists. Real independents like Udden get kicked out. Beely and Bartlett pose for instagram pics with Assad and rail against Western lies on RT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright, this is not just incorrect, it is <em>disgustingly</em> wrong. They&#39;ve written op-eds for RT and Eva has a blog there. They aren&#39;t on the Russian payroll, and I can tell you haven&#39;t even given any of their work any real scrutiny.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t understand why you want to trust totalitarian media to the point of dismissing western media because a dozen times in the past century a western media source has shown biased language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another strawman. Many of the sources that talk about Western propaganda aren&#39;t Russian. Are Seymour Hersh, John Pilger, and Robert Parry all Russian Agents?</p>

<p>I also gave you an explicit example in Bana Alabed that is <em>not</em> just &quot;biased language&quot; (that is also a gross underestimation of Newspeak&#39;s influence; refer to &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; by Chomsky for starters), so that statement is wrong as well. </p>

<p>So when you say this,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not skepticism at all it&#39;s contrarianism at best and active sabotage of truthseeking at worst because that&#39;s what endless supposition does and that&#39;s exactly what governments want when they use propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to point out that you rely on logical fallacies and general lack of knowledge on the subjects to form your skepticism, which is completely contrary to what it is about. Corbett&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aw1oyqSKH0">Reclaiming Skepticism</a> is a really good watch on this.</p>

<p>In any case, thanks for the thought out response.</p>

<p>Aimless supposition is the friend of the propagandist. There&#39;s plenty of waterholding arguments that say Assad could have done it. This narrative exists because Russia wants it to and it&#39;s repeated because it lets contrarian people say &quot;see? I&#39;m out ahead of this misdeed!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Americans allow another phony propaganda campaign to convince them to support another retarded regime change, things are truly hopeless.</p>

<p>Who takes in Syrian refugees at their own expense? Who is pulling out of Syria? Who has no political will to engage in another middle eastern conflict? How much time have you spent studying Syria and the Syrian conflict? Unnuanced explanations like your wild conjecture is rarely right. I did a paper on the collapse of the Syrian economy in law school, I have to say the NYT explanation rings true. Assad rules through police state tactics, posturing and propaganda. It&#39;s a barbarous regime. Sure, maybe it was a false flag. But we don&#39;t know that. Why do we want to jump to certainty that the dictator is innocent? That&#39;s not skepticism it&#39;s contrarianism.</p>

<p>Really?  So your narrative exists because the people pushing for regime change want it to, according to your logic.</p>

<p>Where did I get my Russian talking points?  For some reason I can only read thousands of articles about how we need to overthrow the horrible dictator Assad.  I drew my conclusions from anti-Assad articles and the fact that I have seen identical campaigns twice before.  If Russia didn&#39;t step in, we would have overthrown Assad already, and Syria would be another terrorist hellhole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Who spent billions to fund extremists in Syria?  Who let thousands of tanker trucks run Isis oil under our air cover every day, supplying them with hundreds of millions of dollars?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is pulling out of Syria?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does a chemical attack help us do that?  It just gave a huge boost to the insane contingent that wants us to stay indefinitely and overthrow Assad.  If we can leave, their cause is lost. Surprise!  A chemical attack just gave them new hope!  Assad is being  extremely helpful to his enemies, don&#39;t you think?  Assad seems to be more cold and calculating than moronic and impulsive.  If he staged this attack, which accomplished nothing tactically, he just have a lifeline to the people who want him dead and put the brakes on US withdrawal.  Just like with Saddam, and with gaddafi, to buy this propaganda you need to believe that assad&#39;s family, which has clung to power for decades in the face of powerful opposition, was suddenly motivated to act against their own interests and play perfectly into the hands of those that want to destroy them. </p>

<p>I will just go with the assumption that the insane group represented by people like John McCain are lying yet again.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re right this time.  Assad is an evil dictator?  He had his country stable enough to allow religious freedom to many different groups, and to absorb a million refugees from our liberation of Iraq.  We have a mishmash of Sunni extremist groups waiting to fight over Syria&#39;s corpse if Assad falls.  Turkey will just fully invade and destroy the Kurds.  How anyone can support regime change after Libya and Iraq?  It&#39;s disgusting.  I wish we could give everyone who wants to overthrow the Syrian government a gun andairdrop all those sick fucks right onto a battlefield.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose I agree with you, that posts should be more constructive and detailed. But the thing is that on Reddit as a whole, fewer and fewer people are casting doubt on official political narratives. Throwing a short &quot;think of it this way&quot; post on Reddit might trigger people to be skeptical about what they hear and how they think about news. People do visit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and people do visit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, so it&#39;s good to have that diversity of opinion.</p>

<p>And you are right, this is only an opinion. But we can&#39;t know for certain what is true at all, and we might never be able to know. All we have our opinions. And we can only deal in probabilities. Something is usually considered &quot;certain&quot; when the probability is exceptionally high. I realize I wrote &quot;in no possible universe&quot;, but this shouldn&#39;t be taken literally -- such phrases are used colloquially to emphasize doubt instead of certainty. </p>

<p>This post isn&#39;t made to add knowledge for the poweruser of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or for the person who habitually mulls over current events, but to emphasize how bizarre the official narrative (or rather official <em>sentiment</em>) is. It&#39;s certainly possible that Assad used poison gas, but it seems highly unlikely, and strong convictions require strong evidence.</p>

Once again using chemical weapons to promote regime change just happens to be the most retarded agenda, so I&#39;m against it.  I really don&#39;t care how shitty people think Assad is.  He is not a great leader, but he ran the country well enough to allow religious freedom for many groups, and was able to absorb 1 million refugees from our Iraq disaster.  Even with billions in aid from the Sunni extremist coalition, the rebels could never even capture Aleppo, because the Syrian people don&#39;t want to be ruled by Sunni extremists.  Even with all the billions in support, the rebels failed, because they are vastly worse than Assad.</p>

<p>We have proven several times that forced regime change is an insanely bad idea, for the US and for the country getting fucked.  The scumbags that promoted regime change in the past are clamoring for action again, and anyone who supports them either wants misery for the Syrian people, wants to hurt the US, or is a fan of Sunni extremists.  Because those are the guaranteed results of overthrowing yet another secular middle eastern government.  To try this yet again is pure insanity.</p>

<p>But yes, these insignificant chemical attacks stand to benefit the rebel effort vastly more than Assad. Neocons, for lack of a better label, use them to justify our war effort.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that Assad doesn&#39;t want us there.  It doesn&#39;t make sense for Assad to give us justification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you just read the headline?  No one says the UK did it. That&#39;s how a lot of these propaganda articles work, as they realize most people just skim the headline.  There was a BBC survey that showed 82% of Syrians thought Isis was created by the US.  The most common head line  was a variation of &quot;1 in 5 Syrians think Isis is OK&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Konashenkov said that “powerful pressure from London was exerted on representatives of the so-called White Helmets to quickly stage the premeditated provocation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the UK is using this attack as an excuse to join with the US in attacking Assad.  And Assad almost had won!  And trump wanted to leave Syria!  Then Assad pulled them back in?  He has been very savvy up to this point, it seems odd that he would do something that could only benefit his enemies and might topple his government.  </p>

<p>Not to mention the coalition partners immediately jumped on the attack as an excuse for them to attack Assad, before any investigation, despite the fact that previous chemical attacks could not be pinned on Assad, and despite the fact that Russia had earned the rebels were planning a false flag attack.  This is all so blatantly obvious.  I realize there are Sunni extremists out there who enjoyed our success in Libya, turning possibly Africa&#39;s most prosperous country into a failed state with slave markets and extremists running rampant. They want  for Syria too.  What&#39;s your motivation for wanting to destroy Syria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And then the Syrian people will be given up to be raped, murdered and enslaved by extremists.  What&#39;s wrong with you?  It would be a million times easier and cheaper to cooperate with the peace process and transition Assad out of power.  Not to mention we could avoid the unspeakable evils being committed against the Syrian people.  We could have let Saddam move to Switzerland with a few billion and saved the Iraqi people, saved thousands of our troops, and saved a trillion dollars.  It&#39;s sickening that the psychopaths who need these countries destroyed can find millions of small, twisted minds like your own.  Go to Syria and help the terrorists, if that&#39;s what you think is right. If you remove Assad and Russia, the Kurds are screwed as well.  Turkey can only do what they are doing now because of our coalition.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To know more on our current bout of &quot;Sudden Onset Russophobia&quot; we have to go back in time to the day Russia unexpectedly intervened in the so-called Syrian Civil War: October 1, 2015. This is when Anti-Russian rhetoric specifically in the CIA started to ramp up. It spread to other intelligence agencies by the same characters who gave us Saddam&#39;s WMD&#39;s, namely so-called Neoconservatives who have always been necessarily Anti-Russian and Pro-Israel. Given that the press is de facto Pro-Israel they willingly proliferated Anti-Russian Op-Eds and Articles, at first going against Russian actions in Crimea and finding an opportunity with the Rio Olympics games where revelations of Russian doping led to uncharacteristically strident calls of a blanket ban of the Russian team. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, whenever Russia does something the US or Israel doesn&#39;t like, sanctions are pushed in Congress to punitize Russia and they&#39;re most always written, lobbied for and passed by the same characters who mirror the Neocons in political alignment in regards to American Foreign Policy in the Middle East. The Story of Russian Doping in the Rio Olympics didn&#39;t gain much traction as many saw it as sour grapes about the failure of the US-Israeli proxy war in Syria. The Anti-Russian people needed something more compelling. Enter Trump, &#39;Russian Hackers&quot; and &quot;Collusion.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Testimony from victims of the conflict in Syria suggests rebels have used the nerve agent, sarin, a leading member of a UN commission of inquiry has said. Carla Del Ponte told Swiss TV that there were &quot;strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof&quot;. Ms Del Ponte did not rule out the possibility that government forces might also have used chemical weapons. Later, the commission stressed that it had &quot;not reached conclusive findings&quot; as to their use by any parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ignoring the second part of the claim... &quot;It doesn&#39;t make sense&quot; is not being said in a vacuum... it is being said with the implicit idea that it makes far more sense for this attack to have been carried out by the Syrian opposition. The &quot;rebels&quot; have the most to gain from this attack.</p>

<p>But it seems like you simply want to ignore that part.</p>

<p>Means: &quot;rebels&quot; have been caught using poison gas before.</p>

<p>Motive: &quot;rebels&quot; want the US to save them from the Syrian government and its Russian ally.</p>

<p>Opportunity: The killed civilians are in a &quot;rebel&quot; controlled area so they can control what the world learns about the attack.</p>

<p>Qui Bono? Not Assad. Not Putin. The rebels.</p>

<p>The circumstantial evidence points directly at the rebels.</p>

<p>I hate disinformation campaigns, I&#39;m a cycling, vegan, zerowaster, who&#39;s friends who work with state secrets so I&#39;ve seen loads of it.</p>

<p>My advice is think critically, what emotions are invoked.
Study propaganda properly, not just YouTube videos.
Read some books on Soviet disinformation and their recent strategy, then some Chomsky and MediaLens.
When in doubt, assume nepotism (never work at a place where they share surnames, it&#39;s a bad idea) and you&#39;ll find it, especially in the UK.</p>

<p>A great book to read is &quot;Superforecasters&quot;, many techniques of making predictions and tracking thinking. Essential to being an engaged citizen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. The Russian government was literally planning on gassing Douma a month before (also before the ceasefires, so they must have had a time machine to know the military situation in the future), just because they&#39;re evil monsters intent on killing babies. Not like the Russian government couldn&#39;t send in a special forces team to clear out the last holdouts, without creating an international incident. Pretty interesting Assad gasses Douma just after major ceasefires let rebels leave the area. Guess he just wanted one last gas, for old times&#39; sake.</p>
