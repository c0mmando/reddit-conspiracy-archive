        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">21</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Glagaire.html">Glagaire</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8amk7l/150_dead_in_syria_gas_attack_rescuers_say/">thread currently trending</a> about the most Syria gas attack and I can&#39;t really tell if its populated by people with a serious deficiency in critical and analytical thought or whether its a deliberate attempt to control the narrative. However, after reading more comments than I ever want to repeat I have to assume this is a coordinated effort.</p>

<p>Looking at whats indisputably clear about the situation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There appears to have been a gas attack targeting civilians in Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>If true, it constitutes a war crime.</p></li>
<li><p>There has been no investigation and no evidence exists to assign responsibility.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a great many tangents this could take in terms of discussing who was responsible for past gas attacks in Syria, suffice to say there was a massive effort by Western governments to link them to the Syrian government and thus provide legitimation for greater direct intervention.</p>

<p>Given this there are a few extra points that are very clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Syrian Government was very clearly winning the military conflict by a wide-margin.</p></li>
<li><p>Even the US is very clear in admitting the Syrian Government is not fighting against &#39;rebels&#39; but against IS and Al Qaeda offshoots.</p></li>
<li><p>These latter groups are equally open about their willingness to target civilians and have no qualms about slaughtering women and children. Whether the Syrian Government can be accused of similar crimes is a matter of debate, with the terrorist groups it is established fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite this, the Syrian Government has repeatedly, and very recently, offered ceasefires that allowed these same terrorist fighters (and their families) to leave areas in which they were surrounded and almost certain to be overrun.</p></li>
<li><p>The Syrian Government would have nothing at all to gain from using gas in the manner of the recent attack. It would generate no strategic military benefits, it would turn the civilian population against the government (bear in mind, the majority of the Syrian people, even the ones who dislike Assad, support the government as a far better alternative to power falling into the hands of the terrorist groups, most of whom came form outside Syria), and most importantly it might allow Western States to take military action that would be the only factor capable of changing the course of the conflict in a way that would benefit the terrorist groups.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, the terrorist groups have every reason to carry out such attacks. Their ideology justifies any sacrifice as long as it furthers their cause and they have displayed a wanton disregard for any form of human life. They have long had access (through both Turkey and early seized Syrian Army stockpiles) to chemical weapons. And, they now have only months if not weeks left before their entire war in Syria grinds to a halt.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Despite the above, the thread originally linked is dominated by comments that do three specific things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Condemn Assad and the Syrian government for the attacks (with many suggesting it demands a strong military response).</p></li>
<li><p>Calling out an imaginary Russian bot campaign they say is promoting pro-Assad propaganda DESPITE the fact that the thread is clearly overflowing with exactly the opposite type of voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Denigrating (by means of Poisoning the Well, Ad Hominem and Appeals to Ridicule) a wide variety of alternative news sites and sources. For example, claiming that sites which have supported 9/11 Truth, or are in any way pro-Russia are automatically discredited and incapable of providing relevant information.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The reason I&#39;m posting this is that the thread in question is one of the most glaring, and frankly depressing, examples I&#39;ve seen of people taking a mainstream narrative and attempting to preemptively crush any and all dissenting views.</p>

<p>My one hope is that the majority of voices in that thread are deliberately attempting this attempt at framing the narrative. Because the alternative, that they represent the actual opinions of members of the voting public whose otherwise neutral viewpoints have been so easily swayed by propaganda of the most crude and blunt form, is unbelievably disheartening in regard to the viability of modern democracies and the ability of alternative news to helps promote a better understanding of the complexities of modern war and the dangers involved in mainstream media efforts to reduce these issues to puppet-shows populated with morally black (Assad, Putin) and white (&#39;rebel activists&#39;, the White Helmets) characters.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more depressing to me is this. Not one major news outlet or publication is going to ask the logical question...&quot;why would Assad do this now, what does he benefit? Days after Trump talks about pulling troops out of Syria...days after finally securing eastern Ghouta...</p>

<p>But they aren&#39;t going to ask it. We know they aren&#39;t. That seriously depresses me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post should be reposted in every sub that is in anyway relevant and upvoted to the top. My heart goes out to the poor Syrian people caught up in this evil act. The question always has to be, who gains most? 
    As stated in the above post, Assad has nothing to gain by this attack. The news of snipers and tanks shooting killing and injuring hundreds of unarmed protesters in Palestine is now pushed down the news cycle. The resistance through mass peaceful protest is the one thing that Israel has no answer to. There is overwhelming evidence that Israel along with Saudi Arabia and the US is funding and controlling IS forces in Syria. 
<a href="https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/11/04/the-united-states-israel-and-saudi-arabia-created-and-funded-isis/">https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/11/04/the-united-states-israel-and-saudi-arabia-created-and-funded-isis/</a> 
      This gas attack takes the spotlight away from the slaughter of protesters in Palestine and helps ramp up support for further escalation of the violence in Syria.  Israel and its allies clearly put zero value on the life of a Palestinian,Syrian. The western forces who are losing this war now have the excuse to redouble their efforts.<br/>
       The only glimmer of hope is that more and more people are starting to question these attacks. Even with the power of MSM and the censoring of channels on platforms like YouTube and post manipulation on Reddit etc  people are still getting the info and asking the questions that need to be asked. 
         Let’s hope that the their desperate attempts to control the narrative can be thwarted by people like the OP who can set out clear question for people to critically analyse the information that is being force fed to them  and come to their own conclusions. OP keep up the good work. </p>

<p>We have to use factual information and arguments to justify our position..that article does not do that imo.</p>

<p>Russia is the sole reason Syria is not a failed state like Libya. Their goal is a STABLE MIDDLE EAST because it is a vital trade route with rich amounts of oil and other resources. The reason Israel is so hell bent on destroying the current Syrian regime is so they can  break the state up via ethnic lines and capture its resources, such as the Golan Heights which is absolutely teeming with oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The British established the White Helmets and provided the uniforms as a psychological propaganda construct for regime change in Syria. The US is on the record as contributing over $27 million in funding, plus conducting numerous first person meetings with their terrorist leadership. US State Department spokesperson mark Toner admitted this to AP reporter Matt Lee in July 2016. For the FSA (which is comprised of terrorist groups - Ahrar al-Sham, Jabat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, ISIS, plus dozens of other groups) the US has supplied hundreds of millions in funding and weapons. The overall reason for this is to use them as a regime tool. ISIS is used as an excuse to stay in the country and destabilize it. Hence the reason ISIS was allowed to grow and not actually start being destroyed until August 2015 when Russia entered the war. The terrorists are used as an excuse to be there when in actuality the real reason is geopolitical hegemony against Russia, expansion of the greater Israel project, control of oil pipeline and fields, expansion of Israel&#39;s illegally obtained Golan Heights territory for Genie Energy (global elitists), taking away Russia&#39;s warm water port at Tartus, establishing a Wahabi terror state that is easily controlled by Saudi Arabia, etc. </p>

<p>The BBC recently recently reported that the western coalition aided ISIS&#39;s escape from Raqqa. That report is here: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I figured the 2 key reasons for the involvement of the US was:
1- Destabilization of the region which allows them to secure the petrodollar, thus benefiting the US economy and ultimately the central bankers.
2- Greater Israel.</p>

<p>The Saudi&#39;s funding ISIS could also be tied back into the fact that the US wants the petrodollar to reign supreme, it does this by ensuring point 1 is achieved, right?</p>

<p>Semi-related, but if the USA is trying to &quot;1 up&quot; Russia, why did Russia help Trump get elected, who has, in the past hour stated his intentions of involvement in Syria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia never helped Trump get elected. Trump was chosen by Kissinger and the Zionists. All is inversion, deception, projection. A mass psyop. The Zionists simply chose Trump over Clinton because he  better serves their agenda. Kissinger has stated that Trump&#39;s unpredictable behavior and the fact that he is contentious better serves their goals. Divide and conquer. Hegelian Dialectic. All is a show. Russia are the good guys in WW3. To see the real Trump simply check out his speech at AIPAC in March 2016.</p>

<p>Multiple videos revealing such are here: </p>

<p>Beyond The Divisive Agenda – Defining Donald Trump As A Tool of The Zionist-Elite And Why He Was Really Placed In Power To Wage War on Iran</p>

<p>Like Obama, Trump lied to his base in order to carry out his role and make the election look legit. Now he is undermining his base after the last year of media orchestrated anti-Russia smoke and mirrors. The entire apparatus is now realigning itself to its real purpose which always was to keep the public in the dark, expand the Empire and control the duped masses to keep the global elite on top. The coming AI and mass surveillance state is the biggest threat to the American people. The global elite will not go quietly into that good night. In this sense, Russia is an ally of the American people and the only solid power that stands in the way of this coming dystopian future. And it is coming. It is plain to see for those with eyes wide open. </p>

So it seems they either A. knew about it and were trying to deflect in advance B. were not aware that it was actually Assad planning the attack or C. It was actually a false flag attack to frame Assad. A is a pretty scary thing to think about if they were really evil enough to know a war crime was being committed and actively put out this info to deflect. B and C seem more likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Footage from previous attacks - at least 2013 if I remember right - was authentic. You just can not fake that. Of course that time it was somewhat unclear who was behind it and what substance was used.</p>

<p>This latest one is very different. <em>I am not saying the attack did not happen and for sure I don&#39;t want to see any crueler footage or more suffering for better evidence</em>. Still, that said, the latest attack seems to cause less symptoms. In footage victims - mainly children - are afraid and shocked and they are cleaned with running water. Victims  can breath, they have at least some color in their faces and they are responsive.</p>

<p>It could be that the substance used was not the same, less concentrated or the footage was filmed closer to outer the perimeter of targeted area.</p>

<p>I must say it was shocking to see that one kid, who was showered and kept face down as one of the helpers was strongly patting kids back - obviously trying to open airways. When the kid was turned face up, it was a relief to see kid was alive and not in totally bad condition.</p>

<p>Another shock was this: later in evening news the same clip was ran again. This time they did not show the kid was turned around, leaving an impression she/he was lifeless or just barely alive.</p>

<p>Editing is always a tool. The message is always a designed result of deliberate action of inclusion and exclusion. This time the exclusion was so obvious that I personally think <em>bad journalism</em> took happened. One part of truth was left out. The message was now different. Very different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sry for not responding earlier.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen that footage since. It just was not included to initial news content. My respond? Of course: it is horrifying. At the same time it is more of an evidence about the attack than a video where ppl is a) really contaminating victims and/or b) pouring cold water onto kids and forcing chemicals to their mouths. Both options, collectively and bilaterally, resulting to similarly graphic content... I am not being cynical here. Just saying that the same footage can be seen different ways and this of course leads to yes-no-what-whatnot debates.</p>

<p>Still, my point is about <em>truthful</em> journalism. Footage showing <em>surviving</em> victims should not be edited the way it gives an impression of dying or already dead victims.</p>

<p>Similar situation arose just today as BBC&#39;s news reporter-producer Riam Dalati allegedly tweeted proof (or an observation) on the staged photos from the scene. Link to u/calapula&#39;s post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8bp8l6/stunning_evidence_from_bbc_journalist_exposing/">here.</a></p>

<p>I am not denying what happened. I said that in earlier post already. Dalati did not deny the attack. These are just observations about how actual footage or scene is afterwards modified in order to provide impressions and effects that originally did not exist.</p>

<p>All sides seem to use &quot;old tricks&quot; to emphasize their politically motivated views. But these bad tricks being so noticeable, one can only ask &quot;why, what&#39;s the benefit?&quot;.</p>

<p>One last thing: It must be difficult - <em>but not totally impossible</em> - to bind any crisis area footage undeniably to a certain moment of time. A <em>good</em> old trick of showing a front page of a newspaper would be one. Quoting something what let&#39;s say Putin and/or Trump publicly said last week would be another good way too to provide proof <em>when</em> the footage was recorded. They are not living in total isolation even though crisis area connections to &quot;world outside&quot; may be challenging.</p>

<p>Evidence of <em>when</em> would be appreciated, collecting it should be one of the most important tasks in addition to actual or physical record of events, and it should be stated as clearly and promptly as possible (cam timestamp obviously <em>not</em> complying to this).</p>

<p>OPCW team is about to enter the scene to investigate the event. I personally wait with high level of interest the outcome - or who is the first one trying to mess up their assignment. All remarkable parties of this case incl. Syria, US and Russia are members of OPCW.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting points. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DahtAigXUAErfTj.jpg:large">This picture, if genuine is cause for concern</a>, as the girl most definitely hasn&#39;t fallen into that pose. There&#39;s a reason you have to drag an unconscious person into the recovery position to get them to stay on their side.</p>

<p>I suspect he deleted the tweet as others have said, because he works for the BBC who would be quick to fire him if they found out, furthermore there is a lot of Russian news denying that anything even happened, which could make him look suspect.</p>

<p>I agree with you entirely that editing footage to create deception is malicious and undermines the truth.</p>

<p>My only counter-point about the timing of that video is that it is such &quot;emotive&quot; footage, that it is a gem for a propaganda piece. If the event happened a few months ago, I imagine it would have been used already.</p>

<p>Same here dude, we the stakes are high on this one. A potential conflict with Russia if evidence is found and proven. No thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ Bob. Do you know what the words &quot;LITERALLY THE NEXT LINE IN THE ARTICLE.&quot; Means?</p>

<p>Here is the part I quoted to start...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michel and Herbeck say McVeigh claims he had no idea there was a day-care center in the building. According to them, McVeigh said, <strong>&quot;I recognized beforehand that someone might be … bringing their kid to work. However, if I had known there was an entire day-care center, it might have given me pause to switch targets. That&#39;s a large amount of collateral damage.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Jim Denny, whose two children were injured, insists the day-care center was visible. &quot;You could see that day-care center from the street, from the sidewalk,&quot; he says. &quot;You could see cribs. You could see drawings in the windows.&quot;</p>

<p>And Dr. John Smith, a psychiatrist who evaluated McVeigh for the defense, says McVeigh had seen a crib inside the building from afar. Smith also says that McVeigh chose the Murrah Building because it was fairly isolated, and &quot;he wanted to minimize death away from the Federal Building … He didn&#39;t want to kill any more civilians than was necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, Smith says, McVeigh had first seriously considered targeting the Federal Building in Phoenix, but &quot;he decided that there were too many buildings around it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;LITERALLY&quot; the next line says NOTHING about Public Relations Nightmare.</p>

<p>You are delusional, illiterate, or a liar.</p>

<p>This is beyond fishy. It reminds me of the USS Maine, no one had a motive to destroy it. While we are almost sure it was an accident, you have to put yourself there at the time and ask ‘who would benefit from this?’ [yeah, the US Maine was almost certainly <em>not</em> an accident]</p>

<p>Assad using chemical weapons now makes no sense. Trump just declared he would be trying to get the troops out, then all of a sudden Assad gives him not only a concrete reason to stay, but to ramp up activity? This stinks. I’m no conspiracy theorist, but there is something wrong here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll state up front that I think OP is on point with his three indisputable points: namely that we know a gas attack happened, and we don’t know for sure who did it. I see a lot of people asking what motive Assad could possibly have to use chemical weapons, and then frequently that question is answered with great vigor and authority that “Assad is winning the war, he has no motive to use chemical weapons and risk international intervention. Case closed.”  I’m not convinced that this reasoning is very well thought through. </p>

<p>There are a variety of possible explanations for Assad’s actions. I think two of them are the most likely: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>He did it to scare the population into submission. I know a lot of people think that using chemical weapons is no way to win “hearts and minds” but Assad isn’t under the impression that after seven years of brutal sectarian conflict he will be able to regain widespread adoration. His best hope for regaining control over the entire country is by scaring the population into submission. His best hope is an iron fist. </p></li>
<li><p>He did it because he can. He’s calling America’s bluff (again). He called it successfully after Obama’s incredibly stupid red line comment. He even called it under Trump and all Trump did was send over a couple Tomahawks. Sure those caused some destruction, but those missiles didn’t change the trajectory of the war. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I really don’t know who is responsible for the gas attacks, and it’s possible that rebel groups set this up as a false flag to goad the West into firing back on Assad. But there is also a potentially valid explanation for Assad’s actions and we don’t have enough information to conclusively decide that he had no possible motivation to do this. </p>

<p>I’m open to other ideas and further discussion, I basically just wanted to say that I am not at all convinced by the “Assad had no motive!!11!!” line of reasoning. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s this logic that makes no sense. This is the perfect time for Assad to use a gas attack because plenty of people (like this whole subreddit) will come out and say that it couldn&#39;t have been him because it makes no sense to do it now. You&#39;re giving people a free pass with the shallowest level of logic ever. </p>

<p>He&#39;s never going to salvage his reputation in the west.  Ever.  So, his clear path is to cozy up to the Russians, who are a lesser world power, but the only one capable of checking the west&#39;s hegemony.</p>

<p>Russia doesn&#39;t want to fight a straight up war with the U.S., however, if it can use Syria to undermine U.S. global leadership, that&#39;s to its benefit.  It&#39;s also to Russia&#39;s benefit to drag the U.S. into a war with a Syria that it arms and supplies, similar to what the U.S. did to the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>But they don&#39;t really have to drag us into a war when our deep state has been wanting and instigating war for years now.  </p>

<p>The hawks want Assad gone.  They don&#39;t care if someone is using chemical weapons or cluster bombs.  They just want Assad out.  </p>

<p>Still seems more likely it is a deep state thin rather than Russia.  Look at the Novichok bs going on at the same time.  The British authorities won&#39;t even release the evidence, they just automatically blame Russia.  This propaganda is part of a pattern of unsubstantiated demonization of Russia.  </p>

<p>deep state does not want out of Syria and they control a lot of people around him.</p>

<p>I was not omplying that he was puppet at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not really - a puppet is someone who is willingly doing the biddings of his master.</p>

<p>He is more of in a position of &quot;my hands are tied&quot; guy </p>

<p>meaning for example - Trump is not interested in war in Syria but he is interested in Wall.</p>

<p>But when he speaks about that - people around him imply to him in certain way that he will never get funding for the wall (he needs votes for that) if he does not approve war.</p>

<p>So if you are in that position you are constantly pressured to make deals you dont want to make, if you want to do anything at all.</p>

<p>(&quot;we will not vote for this if you do not approve that&quot; kind of a thing)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are good points. I&#39;m just going to respond to number 4.</p>

<p>In general you never want to 1. Fully surround someone or 2. Not allow retreat.</p>

<p>This is something geberals learned long long ago. Men who are convinced they will die fight harder then men who have an escape. They will take more of your army with them. Morale is a huge thing for combat. Its more effective to let a group retreat then try to completely destroy them.</p>

<p>Thats literally how we took baghdad in 23 days. We beat their army in engagement after engagement but didnt decimate them. Plus the rest of tge country&#39;s milotary will become more modivated over the complete destruction. </p>

<p>Sure these are terrorists, but the milotary campaign still fhnctions under normal military strategies </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because even after the US pulls out, Assad will have to win the civil war and govern Syria. Using chemical weapons shows that he&#39;s ruthless and even willing to violate international law to do it, and no one will step up to stop him. </p>

<p>Russia lays out a narrative &quot;oh when our enemies die it&#39;s just a false flag -- they&#39;re killing themselves to drum up support&quot; that is just enough of a smokescreen to work with people on certain subreddits. Meanwhile the rebels on the ground, who are getting gassed, receive the message loud and clear: &quot;we&#39;ll kill you with impunity and no one can stop us.&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be downvoted to oblivion, but that&#39;s the alternative interpretation, and what I personally believe is going on. This subreddit seems pretty certain that Assad and Putin can tell no lies, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s is my nurture and indoctrination to want to trust the US Government but your post doesn&#39;t help me. </p>

<p>Do you really believe there&#39;s any doubt Assad will respond ruthlessly?  Your first premise doesn&#39;t hold very firm. 
Secondly, if the US, oil kingdoms, Israel and their allies cease support for the FSA, ISIS, and the al-Nusra front dissipates do you really think they&#39;ll continue the civil war? This premise is shaky at best. </p>

<p>The only actual wild card for the Assad seems to be the Kurds, but my sense is that Israel, the US, and even the Iraqis could make a deal to keep that faction from causing ongoing conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I have posted in another thread, the socratic method and the use of credible news sources is enough circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>They have sustained the world&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/five-reasons-to-be-absolutely-certain-that-the-establishment-is-lying-about-syria-46402a4c7888">biggest propaganda campaign of all time</a>.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we hear anything on the news about non-chemical attacks? 
Why are people going home from the safety of Lebanon, Turkey or Europe to head back to Syria?
Why don&#39;t we hear a single interview from a Syrian civilian but have children being paraded instead?</p>

<p>Why would a rescue organisation lie about its funding?
Why hasn&#39;t Israel bombed the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Golan-ISIS-threat-looms-large-over-Israel-and-Syrian-rebels-515888">fundamental jihadi terrorists</a> on their border? (They clearly are ideological opposites.)</p>

<p>Why is it secret meetings to get aid to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/07/priti-patel-wanted-to-send-aid-money-to-israeli-army-no-10-confirms">Israeli military to give to Syria</a>?</p>

<p>Israel even admits to working with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priti-patel-israel-golan-heights-al-nusra-syria-sunni-shia-muslims-dfid-international-aid-a8046356.html">known Islamic terror groups</a> at their border. They&#39;re treating fighters, and why the UK is sending them Aid?</p>

<p>Every war has war propaganda, in <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2016-10-02/fake-news-and-false-flags-how-the-pentagon-paid-a-british-pr-firm-500m-for-top-secret-iraq-propaganda">Iraq $500 million was spent</a> with Bell Pottinger which included making fake news reports and even making fake al Qaeda propaganda films.</p>

<p>Are you aware that the US funded a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/middleeast/cia-syria-rebel-arm-train-trump.html">$1 billion &quot;secret&quot; CIA training programme</a> in Syria (as reported on in the NYT). </p>

<p>Why would they spend $1 billion on arms and not spend a single dollar on making fake propaganda to go alongside it?
Whey teach them to use guns but offer no training in how to use a film camera?</p>

<p>Odds are this is yet another killing of children used by a group called the White Helmets (Al-Nusra with white helmets on), which [we&#39;ve help fund](21stcenturywire.com/2017/12/02/white-helmets-local-councils-uk-fco-financing-terrorism-syria-taxpayer-funds/). You have to remember that this kind of relationship is meant to be top-secet given it implies our liberal governments are willing to outsource barbaric acts.</p>

<p>Very few, if any in the corporate media covers it as they&#39;re part of the deception.
Given Trump bans people that insult him, imagine if a news organisation accused officials directly of funding terror propaganda.
Does that not explain maybe why there is silence on this?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump Threatens Putin, &quot;Animal Assad&quot; Over Syrian &quot;Chemical Attack&quot;; Russia Warns Of &quot;Grave&quot; Response If US Launches Strike</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The deep state want WE THE PEOPLE upset with Russia for getting in our way. Putin looks like a bad man right now because he won&#39;t let Trump take Assad out after &quot;gassing his own people&quot;.</p>

<p>Remember North Korea? Remember when they were the baddies? Well the CIA Nazi&#39;s/deepstate had a stronghold there. Trump and NK worked together to liberate NK from the deep state. This is why peace is happening. Denuclearization.</p>

<p>Assad is under the same stronghold. Putin is fighting the NWO. Trump is fighting the NWO. In the news it has to look like Trump is gnashing his teeth to get into Syria and take Assad out. If Clinton had won, we’d be looking at Giddafi 2.0. Putin has to appear to get in the way of Trump. It’s theater.</p>

<p>The media is trying to manipulate the masses. The deaths are real because the Luciferian elite are currently celebrating the season of sacrifice. </p>

<p>I have a feeling that most of the threads about this event are filled with paid shills, but then again, I also believe that a lot of people are led to believe that Assad or Putin&#39;s Russia is at fault because of previous events. We can all agree that their regimes aren&#39;t the best thing in the world, but it&#39;s really fucking ignorant to automatically assume someone is at fault without even checking out what happened.</p>

<p>People who spend at least 30 minutes researching the topic in question could realize that it&#39;s a blatant false flag, and we have a good portion of the internet filled with people who paid attention to Syria since day 1 of the revolution.</p>

Using WMD isn&#39;t like a simple application of Round Up on the weeds growing in the cracks of your driveway.  It generates worldwide outrage and jeopardizes Assad&#39;s situation.
Assad has been slowly winning against this regime change that became deadly serious during the Obama Administrations amateur hour Statesmanship.  It was the Russian showing up on scene who started running circles around us, who cleaned up the Chemical weapons that Assad possessed...

    <div class="md"><p>What strategic benefit did it have to kill protesters, including torturing children to death? Why do dictators commit horrible acts at all? If you can&#39;t answer that, you aren&#39;t considering what&#39;s important. Answer that and you have answered your question.</p>

<p>Both Putin and Assad are dictators. So why do dictators use horrible, oppressive techniques like killing innocent protesters and torturing and murder? What&#39;s the point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy sucks isn&#39;t really a response. Dictators use fear, killing and torture to keep their populace in line. They don&#39;t respect free speech. So again, the answer to your question is &quot;because that&#39;s what dictators do&quot;. </p>

<p>And yes, most nations are better served by democracy. Look around the world for a few minutes. A cursory look at migration statistics will tell you this. Or quality of life index. Or nearly any measure you can think of. I fucking hate Trump. But he isn&#39;t a dictator.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  But this went off on a rabbit trail.  I wasn&#39;t asking why would Assad use Chemicals.
Assad is winning his Civil War.  Why jeopardize his situation with a chemical weapon attack?
He has been more effective with dropping 55 gallon barrel bombs without the world wide political blowback.
The Cheeto Head just last week said we would be pulling out of Syria.  Guess we aren&#39;t going anywhere now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On one side you have the Syrian Arab Army who is steam-rolling the Ghouta region and offering amnesties to various opposition factions left and right just so that they don&#39;t have to fight through densely populated urban areas. (and to save on their already limited manpower)</p>

<p>On the other side you have both moderate (Factions that have a real revolution as their core value) and radical (Factions that have wahabasim and other far-right ideas that have nothing to do with traditional islam as their core values) opposition groups.</p>

<p>Can you guess which kind of opposition group stayed and which group accepted the amnesty plan and moved to Idlib? (another pocket in Syria) </p>

<p>The moderates knew they lost the moment the SAA breached the frontline and created even more enclaves in Ghouta. They moved to another part of Syria along with their families, with some of them even choosing to join the SAA. On the other hand the radical opposition groups that have connections with Al-Qaeda and various other terror-groups have decided to stay, forcing thousands of civilians to stay trapped alongside them.</p>

<p>Now what&#39;s my point you ask? 40 tons, that&#39;s the amount of chemical weapons left behind in Ghouta by the radical opposition groups in Syria. And there weren&#39;t just weapons in there, you had processing plants as well for making them.</p>

<p>Now, why would I not believe that those kinds of militants would use chemical weapons on their own people? The same militants that hide their ammo and weapons in mosques and hospitals while hiding behind human shields. This isn&#39;t some crazy $200 million Hollywood movie, real people are involved in this war and as much as the media likes to paint Assad as some bloodlusting war criminal/dictator, he isn&#39;t dumb nor crazy enough to gas his own people when he is already winning. You really think that he would risk further sanctions and even an attack by the west just so that he could clear the last area standing with only a couple thousand militants inside?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t address what I said. The notion that because Assad said it would happen means he wouldn&#39;t do it doesn&#39;t make much sense. That&#39;s not a point. If anything, it points to a plan to use them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>40 tons, that&#39;s the amount of chemical weapons left behind in Ghouta by the radical opposition groups in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to who? I find that claim dubious. That&#39;s an insane stockpile. Its hard to make that much. Its hard to hide that much. Its hard to transport that much. Where is that claim coming from? What&#39;s the source?</p>

<p>Why do dictators use obscene tactics in the first place? That Assad and his father have a long history of doing so is powerful evidence that it isn&#39;t out of bounds. The better question is why wouldn&#39;t he? He faced nearly no consequences when accused previously. Its like asking why a bully would bully when people might judge them for it. <em>Its what they do.</em></p>

Ghaddafi’s involvement in international terrorism, the support and financing and safe harbouring of Illich Ramirez Sanchez also known as Carlos the Jackal during the 70’s helped plan the opec hostage crisis in Vienna as well as many a terrorist actions in Paris and Europe.  Since he coordinated the multiple attempted bombing and rocket attacks against israeli el al airliners and just his generally anti Israeli stance he had a huge target on his back.</p>

<p>And since the US, Canada , Britain etc governments are just israeli pawns,it was obvious why Libya happened. Oil financed Ghaddafi’s gold dinar </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally just saw this.  There are many documentaries on the subject, but basically in a nutshell:
Gaddafi didn&#39;t like how the west treated the Arab world.  He wanted to prove to the world that Libia was first of all a place for peace, a place for progress, a place where his people would absolutely be safe from harm.  </p>

<p>And so it was for quite a while.  He was a dictator, he wasn&#39;t perfect, he wasn&#39;t even good.  But he gave 10 weeks off to couples on maternity leave (couples, not just the wife), he gave $25k for married couples, another $25k to people having a child, $25k to any student wanting to attend college.  He had massive amounts of vacation time for any working person per year.  He realized that the problem they had was the issue of capitalism; so to solve it, he was working closely with China on a new gold-backed currency not necessarily to replace the dollar; but to be a contender.</p>

<p>Again, he was a dictator; this wasn&#39;t a perfect situation. He did terrible things in his past.  And magically, the moment he went gold-backed, we bomb him.</p>

<p>Any time a country even thinks about being actually independent, the governments of the world rip them to shreds.</p>

<p>We go through very quick cycles of Banana Republic over and over.  And he was just trying to break free of the bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a shame. I&#39;ve read accounts in the past of America sabotaging countries which try to implement a currency that goes against the US dollar. Now I may be misconstruing information here but I think the reason why they do it is so they control the currency of the world. OK that was obvious, rather so there is no threat to the implementation of centralised Rothschild&#39;s banks in every country on Earth (I think there are three or so countries without one, that&#39;s it). Anyway forgive me for my ignorance here as I&#39;m really not too savvy with money (despite it being the single most influential, corrupt and powerful tool on this planet...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You started with some facts and then smoothly drifted into unfounded hypothesis disguised as fact, most notably at point #5. </p>

<p>everything from #5 on is personal opinion and speculation that is no more likely to be right than the people you condemn, and once you get the last paragraph you go off the deep end in assuming that there is no possible way this is not a conspiracy and there is no possible way Assad used chemical weapons.</p>

<p>I was with you when your post started out skeptical, but I&#39;m not following you into delusion land. You are saying that there is zero doubt this is a false flag type of conspiracy. I&#39;m not even saying you&#39;re wrong, except for the part about being absolutely sure of it. That&#39;s batshit insane to believe your own opinions to the level where all who disagree are brainwashed. Fuck that shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude this is amazing.</p>

<p>Something I always find intriguing is how people in this and other communities that are supposedly built on the ideals of critical thought/assume nothing, question everything are still so quick to jump on what very clearly seems to be blatant propaganda/gaslighting. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to have watched a 9/11 documentary and then suddenly think you understand the inner workings of an Elite Cabal &amp; another to truly question and breakdown every slice of information in the way you have in this post. Would give gold if i could.</p>

<p>Personally, I wholeheartedly agree that this is just another WMD type story to further military presence as there has been nothing to reflect that need coming out of syria for some time. I wouldn&#39;t even be suprised if it was carried out by the west, or the terrorist groups were armed by the west to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe somebody, cough cough Israel is not ready to have the USA pull out before the entire Mideast has been totally demolished. I swear I don&#39;t mean that in any anti-Semitic way but they have absolutely the most to gain from all this shit. I also think they did 911 and it has already been proven that they shot the shit out of the USS Liberty back in the sixties and once again got away with it. I never used to believe this kind of shit and after 911 I was obsessed with them killing that bastard Bin Laden. But one day while looking it all over I watched Tower 7 go down for no damn reason. Then I heard that Jewish owner talking about pulling it. Then the dancing Israelis. I don&#39;t want to think that they did it, I have always thought they were sopposed to be the chosen people of God, I always thought that they were our staunchest ally, but now I think they are brutal and I don&#39;t think they give a damn about who they kill if it means a big land grab. Like I say I don&#39;t want to think this but to me it kind of all adds up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Extremely predictable. I told my sister just five or six days ago.. &quot;Suspect a major false flag attack soon.&quot; This, by no accounts is major, nor is it rationalizing war with Iran, which is what I was speaking to her about. But, perhaps war with Iran is not the immediate goal. Perhaps &quot;grave consequences&quot; in Syria is enough. Trump wants Assad to be &quot;history&quot; and blames Obama for not murdering him like he did Gaddafi. Perhaps, now, Trump will be that &quot;hero&quot; who crosses Obama&#39;s line in the Sand. War....</p>

<p>And, to Trump, and his supporters.. &quot;Assad is an animal&quot; he says? What does that make Trump? Trump has become a devil amongst men, and among animals. He&#39;s given up all remnants left of his humanity, sold his soul, and is now lesser than even the dirt beneath Assad&#39;s beastly feet.</p>

<p>We&#39;re entering horrific times of continued White genocide by distraction of non-White genocide all by the hands of these purely evil Elitists and their (((handlers))). I will begin to hope every day Trump is destroyed in one way or another and Washington is shaken just enough to give some time to someone, anyone, who may be doing any good to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no actual evidence that Assad has ever used chemical weapons -- just unverified claims made by Islamic extremists (sorry, &quot;moderate rebels&quot; and a few State Dept.-sponsored NGOs). Here&#39;s what US Defense Secretary James Mattis said back in February: </p>

<p>The U.S. has no evidence to confirm reports from aid groups and others that the Syrian government has used the deadly chemical sarin on its citizens, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday.</p>

<p>“We have other reports from the battlefield from people who claim it’s been used,” Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. “We do not have evidence of it.”</p>

<p>He said he was not rebutting the reports.</p>

<p>“We’re looking for evidence of it, since clearly we are dealing with the Assad regime that has used denial and deceit to hide their outlaw actions,” Mattis said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technique #2 - &#39;CONSENSUS CRACKING&#39;</p>

<p>A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com">www.abovetopsecret.com</a>) is &#39;consensus cracking.&#39; To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger &#39;evidence&#39; or disinformation in your favour is slowly &#39;seeded in.&#39; Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then &#39;abort&#39; the consensus cracking by initiating a &#39;forum slide.&#39;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the &#39;play dumb&#39; rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exi</li>
<li>Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such &#39;arguable rumors&#39;. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a &#39;wild rumor&#39; from a &#39;bunch of kids on the Internet&#39; which can have no basis in fact.1</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Technique #6 - &#39;GAINING FULL CONTROL&#39;</p>

<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with the fact that there is much info that has been commented in a way which is comfortable for the political situation. And still there is much info which has not been.</p>

<p>Not sure if there is something written about the Post True term. Some allegations are being communicated via one of mass media, based on some &quot;close-to-government&quot; sources, which would have never been revieled. Later this info is being taken by other mass media and proposed as a confirmation of previously stated allegations. Later politicians take these &quot;free media&quot; statements and telling everybody that they do have information from &quot;some&quot; sources.</p>

<p>From this moment everything is confirmed and proved.</p>

<p>Example: media says, we know that Assad is arranging a chemical attack. There is no confirmation of it.</p>

<p>Assad say that they do not want to do it and they do not need to do it. </p>

<p>In some time other media state that they have sources that Assad is planning chemical attack.</p>

<p>In some time politicians say that they have information that there is chemical attack is being planned and they have discent source.</p>

<p>Chemical attack happening (if it is a real chemical attack). No clear evidence of whom was the organizer and executor of this attack.</p>

<p>Politicians say: Look, we said that Assad was going to attack civilians. </p>

<p>Mass media say: Look, we have said you that Assad was planning to do it. </p>

<p>That is Post True. Enough for masses.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most probably nobody will never know the correct information or will know about it very late, like it was with Iraq war, which started from the allegations. And former prime minister confirmed that they lied. </p>

<p>The White Helmets are funded and directed by the US government. They may pretend to hide under the guise of being an NGO, yet they are nothing more than a ground unit for provoking conflicts in the middle-east. </p>

<p>War by proxy. The White Helmets bring a means of justification for invasion. Nothing more than fabricators of war.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do is get away from target areas (also target areas for nukes - this being strategic military posts, industrial areas than can be used to fabricate military surplus) as soon as you notice it will all commence. Then you wait for it to be over and hopefully survive.</p>

<p>So keep enough spare cash and a valid passport so you can fly yourself and your family out in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is getting sad. The world for the midst part knows this gas attack was one big scam.
You have the white helmets spraying kids down who have nothing wrong with them and the deception they are trying to achieve is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Like other comments have pointed out...why would Assad gas a city which had been liberated?</p>

<p>What would he been trying to achieve?
The only reason for the fake gas attack is Israel is shitting their pants knowing all the money they put in trying to topple the Assad regime has failed and the only way for them to save face is to make up some WMDs bullshit so the US can bail them out as usual because they can&#39;t do it themselves.
Israel won&#39;t be happy until all their fake boogiemen nations are turned to dust.</p>

<p>Look at what their doing in their own land..they are killing with no accountability and they have no shame in doing it.</p>

<p>Just think what Israel will do once all their fake enemies are gone...they will keep the course of believing all land is their own and will do the same thing over and over until they have what they want.
Zionism is a disease and these people are truly sick as they believe anyone who isn&#39;t them deserves to live like pigs.
They believe it&#39;s okay to rape, steal and pillage non Jews and they have to be stopped before they do any more damage to this world.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>90% of Americans are sheeple as it is. This is not new. The Ambivalence 90% of Americans have to the giant red white and blue dildo being stuck up their ass has been going on for 100 years. 
The only time is was even remotely challenged is when a lrge portion of the younger population was taking LSD. You how fast any mind altering drug has been shut down and you see what has been done with those that chose to &quot;take a walk on the other side.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Why are you going to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. Why are you taking them seriously? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you go to Worldnews, I assume you engage in debate; why have you not been banned? Are you shadow banned? They ban anyone that repeats arguments against the nocon, globalist, liberal narrative of the sub. 
It is as bad as, if not worse than <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. </p>

<p>I really, really, really hope Trump does not engage in conflict with Syria over this false flag bullshit. </p>

<p>Personally, this is a test for whether Trump is a puppet to his owners like all the dirt bag leaders in the govt. If he goes to war, the fucker is the same as the old boss.....another piece of shit, elite servant. </p>

<p>Personally, I am really sick of it all. </p>

<p>And 90% of Americans give no fucks. They may catch a few minutes of news on the TV or radio, but they give no fucks about it, or think at all about it. It&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, US citizens were more outraged about the inflation of a football than the total undermining of the democratic, voting process when the primaries were rigged. I mean, the moral fabric, the foundation of integrity our country is based on, was undermined to the point votes and support didn&#39;t matter.  Nothing happened about it, but you can punch me in the face without recourse if the football inflation bullshit didn&#39;t end up before the SCOTUS. </p>

<p>Welcome to the banana republic, where the highest payer gets his way, morals don&#39;t exist, and our SOS laughs becauser she had the leader of a foreign country killed over lies. </p>

<p>For instance:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8ca04z/pentagon_announces_2000_increase_in_russia_bots/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8ca04z/pentagon_announces_2000_increase_in_russia_bots/</a></p>

Unless you&#39;ve been asleep for 17 years, we&#39;ve all seen this song and dance over and over again.. each time, it becomes more and more played out and more unbelievable. The narrative hasn&#39;t changed, the baseless accusations continue, and without hesitation, we start attacking Syria toying with the idea of WW3 like a kid plays with matches. </p>

<p>As with any crime, you must ask yourself, if the person who did the crime wasn&#39;t completely insane (got to rule that out now a days), what was their motive. As you listed above, there is NO motive for Assad to do this.. NONE. There is however, plenty of motive for others I won&#39;t name to set something like this up.. </p>

<p>They know the vast majority of the US population is a bunch of mouth breathing boob tube watching morons so they get more and more bold with the bullshit thinking nobody is paying attention. &quot;Conspiracy Therorists&quot; are how they group ANYONE with dissent into an unfavorable category. Disagree with the official story? Conspiracy theorist. Think 9/11 was more complicated than we let on? Conspiracy theorist. Think JFK was shot by multiple shooters? OG Conspiracy Theorist.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got downvoted into oblivion for pointing out that the only evidence we have is from white helmets and that they have not only been proven to stage events in the past but they have connections to terrorist groups and may even be active terrorists themselves. I even provided links to evidence of this but was just dismissed as a conspiracy theorist. This was my comment: </p>

<p>Yeah but the evidence for that claim is pretty weak. The strongest evidence we&#39;ve seen has been the video from the white helmets. The white helmets that we contribute our taxes to but have no real idea of why. As you can see <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/652400/FOI_0749-17_letter.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>There&#39;s proof that the white helmets have faked footage before. Some of these pictures you will probably recognise from the news. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jadinho123/status/984918030017875968">https://mobile.twitter.com/jadinho123/status/984918030017875968</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick <a href="https://youtu.be/3HCFol7g-FU">video</a>  showing how good they are at it. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s <a href="https://youtu.be/3HCFol7g-FU">BoJo </a>  with the white helmets promising a non-profit organisation £65 million of our taxes.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s many more <a href="https://clarityofsignal.com/2017/02/27/massive-white-helmets-photo-cache-proves-hollywood-gave-oscar-to-terrorist-group/">pictures</a>  of them with their terrorist buddies and more. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we can seriously trust the word or videos of these people. I also want to remind everyone that we are literally funding terrorists under the Tories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The propaganda is very real and many people, whether paid actors or organic users that have come to believe said propaganda, have come to this sub to dispute the claims that Assad may have not used chemical weapons on his own people. They frequently cite the U.N.&#39;s official opinion on the matter as the definitive accounting of these events, but disregard the U.N.&#39;s own contradictory investigations that have suggested Syrian rebels used chemical weapons on Syrian civilians-not Assad. In fact it has been documented that Syrian rebels (terrorists, more on that later) have access to chemical weapons, the means to create chemical weapons, have used chemical weapons, and have been caught trying to use chemical weapons and make it look like Assad used them-of course those claims have been disputed, but so have the claims that Assad used chemical weapons. The government of Syria has nothing to gain and everything to lose by using chemical weapons. Seymour Hersh, Pulitzer prize winning journalist, maintains that Hillary Clinton approved of the transport of the requisite compounds for production of Sarin from Libya into Syria, for use by Syrian rebels, to frame Assad for using Sarin. Seymour is criticized for his over use of anonymous sources, yet his editor at <em>The New Yorker</em> has revealed that he is made aware of every source prior to publication, i.e. Seymour isn&#39;t just pulling sources out of his ass. He&#39;s putting his reputation on the line with his work and his claims. He&#39;s not an anonymous poster on 4chan with zero accountability and zero oversight for his work. Seymour is a critically acclaimed journalist, and he supports the Syrian rebel Sarin gas framing, and use narrative. It&#39;s hilarious that people actually implicitly trust U.N. reports and the U.S.&#39;s claims regarding Assad&#39;s chemical weapon use, when the conflict we (the U.S.) are supporting is being fought by actual terrorists. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Let&#39;s investigate. Tahrir al-Sham, one group of &quot;Syrian rebels&quot; is &quot;a Salafist jihadist organization fighting against Syrian government forces in the Syrian Civil War, with the aim of establishing an Islamic state in the country&quot; as per Wikipedia. We do not support them, although we did support Ahrar al-Sham, which is a very different group, you see Abhrar al-Sham is &quot;a coalition of multiple Islamist and Salafist units that coalesced into a single brigade, and later a division, in order to fight against the Syrian Government led by Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian Civil War&quot; and which &quot;...aims to create an Islamic state under Sharia law&quot;. Very different you see. Whereas Tahrir al-Sham is a coalition of such jihadist groups as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, also known as Al Nusra Front, or <strong>Al-Qaeda in Syria</strong> and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, Ahrar al-Sham is part of a coalition known as the Syrian Liberation Front, which constitutes both Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement. Wait a second...Tahrir al-Sham consists of leaders from Ahrar al-Sham and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham...some of Nour al-Din al Zenki defected to Tahrir al-Sham because it represented their more conservative views, but have since left and joined Ahrar al-Sham to form the Syrian Liberation Front? Wait and Ahrar al-Sham is now a part of the Levant Front which is part of the Free Syrian Army? I know the U.S. officially stopped supporting the Free Syrian Army, but the U.K. and Germany still supports them. How strange!</p>

<p><strong>HMMMMMMM</strong>. Sounds an <em>awful</em> lot like the pentagon is just supporting whoever doesn&#39;t associate with Al-Qaeda, but any other terrorists are <strong>JUST FINE</strong>.</p>

<p><em>scratches chin</em></p>

<p>but we don&#39;t support terrorists or anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is,  we have no idea what the military is or is not able to prove.   what would we possibly have to gain from a conflict with Assad and his Russian Butt buddies?   Trump would MUCH RATHER fire missiles on the DAESH rebels.  and our military is smart enough to look into the motivating factors on all sides and take them into consideration before launching an airstrike on the enemy of our enemy.     that is not to imply that we dont make mistakes.   but we can literally track the planes as they take off..  and drop the illegal ordinance.  and then return to base.   and we track it all  from low orbit.    the fact is we blew up some warplanes.  and some airfields.   because we want them to know that if they commit war crimes.  we will delete them from the surface of the planet.  period.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia never helped Trump get elected. Trump was chosen by Kissinger and the Zionists. All is inversion, deception, projection. A mass psyop. The Zionists simply chose Trump over Clinton because he  better serves their agenda. Kissinger has stated that Trump&#39;s unpredictable behavior and the fact that he is contentious better serves their goals. Divide and conquer. Hegelian Dialectic. All is a show. Russia are the good guys in WW3. To see the real Trump simply check out his speech at AIPAC in March 2016.</p>

<p>Beyond The Divisive Agenda – Defining Donald Trump As A Tool of The Zionist-Elite And Why He Was Really Placed In Power To Wage War on Iran</p>

<p>Like Obama, Trump lied to his base in order to carry out his role and make the election look legit. Now he is undermining his base after the last year of media orchestrated anti-Russia smoke and mirrors. The entire apparatus is now realigning itself to its real purpose which always was to keep the public in the dark, expand the Empire and control the duped masses to keep the global elite on top. The coming AI and mass surveillance state is the biggest threat to the American people. The global elite will not go quietly into that good night. In this sense, Russia is an ally of the American people and the only solid power that stands in the way of this coming dystopian future. And it is coming. It is plain to see for those with eyes wide open. </p>

<p>deep state does not want out of Syria and they control a lot of people around him.</p>

<p>I believe that Trump himself is genuinly interested in going stuff inside USA, like building things and building that wall he talks about all the time - I dont think that he is interested in foreign politics at all (he personally)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s is my nurture and indoctrination to want to trust the US Government but your post doesn&#39;t help me. </p>

<p>Do you really believe there&#39;s any doubt Assad will respond ruthlessly?  Your first premise doesn&#39;t hold very firm. 
Secondly, if the US, oil kingdoms, Israel and their allies cease support for the FSA, ISIS, and the al-Nusra front dissipates do you really think they&#39;ll continue the civil war? This premise is shaky at best. </p>

<p>The only actual wild card for the Assad seems to be the Kurds, but my sense is that Israel, the US, and even the Iraqis could make a deal to keep that faction from causing ongoing conflict.</p>
