       SS- It seems blatantly obvious that this family is out for Christian dominion over the entire world. Betsy can gut education while Eric can manipulate the military (I do understand that Eric is no longer heading up Blackwater). Also, the DeVos family created Amway which is a huge multi-level marketing company (pyramid scheme), which can be used to control and push their ideologies as well.

       That said these are just a few of the mega rich that are now in power. The swamp is now a lake. We have an ex mercenary trying to setup back channels to the Kremlin. We have two people, Scott Pruitt and Rick Perry, leading the very things they were trying to destroy.

       Then there are people here who bitch, rightfully, about Obama's drone strikes, but don't realize Trump was just pissed a drone operator waited for a terrorist to leave his family's house. Instead of just killing everyone.

       Lmao, the president of the US doesn't "just" do anything, he's the fucking president.  Presidents are not idiots.  Puppets, maybe.  But they are privy to unbelievable depths of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't need any help from DA EVIL JOOZE.

      <p>
       Additionally, idk why people are so buggin about the Jews.  Yeah some super rich Jews help run the world cabal.  So do very rich Christians (the Vatican) and Muslims (Mecca).
      </p>
      <p>
       ALL of the hyper-rich global elites work TOGETHER.  RELIGION IS NOTHING.  It is something that once had truth inside it, truth that has been squirreled away and shown only to those with the mark of esoteric knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you, some dude on the Internet, understand the intricacies of the rule of the globe?  Get a fucking clue man.  We're all part of their game.  There is no solution, as the game may only play out one way.  The elites are simply those who have been mandated as the DMs of that game.  If you destroy them or if you assist them, it matters not.  The ending will always be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no simple human tongues that describe God's plan, or even Gaia's plan.  The Jews, just like any people in power, simply play a role.  There are no Jews, Christians, Muslims, or anything on the other side.  There is only God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are as they shall be.  And how they shall be, by the way, is people like you getting tricked into thinking ANY thing that is nameable is responsible for rights or wrongs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe me: Trump, Obama, Bush, Putin, Xi Jinping, Andrea Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May--they are all batting for the same team.  They understand who this team is with varying degrees, depending on what is needed to convince them.  It suffices that they play the roles they have been given.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a long, long time, since the dawn of self-consciousness, there has been a deliberate strategy to create the next world.  This involves using a reward-pain system of joy and strife to guide the evolution of the next species,
       <em>
        Homo omnens

       I agree with the vast majority of what you're saying, but I don't agree the game can only play out in one way. The future and end of this story is in our hands. Yes we are on a path, but we can alter our course. We are on a script, but by being aware of the script we are changing it all the time. It is in our hands. Don't spread false pessimism with good information and make people feel hopeless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless I misunderstand you and you are trying to say that the end is always good. But even then, if we simply hope for a good turn of events, a positive, conscious future, we can be robbed of our proactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to trust that the future will work out, not only hope, but trust in ourselves, each other and life, trust, then follow that trust with action, proactively making this planet the paradise we all know it has the potential to be.

       Well I personally wouldn't say that's the case. I'd say there definitely is a karmic fate of sorts, but each and every one of us, as awareness has the ability to bypass and change that fate. Fate is a phenomenon that only takes into account events already unfolding in a closed system. Each and every one of us is the portal to the newness, to the infinite freshness, infinite potential. We are doorways to creativity. We are beings that go beyond the closed systen that we have created. That is why I would say that although there is fate, there is destiny, there is a script, but every time you are aware, every time you let go, every time you create, you choose differently,  you change and alter the script. Id even say that inherent chaos and creative wonder is built into this system, as the whole system is closed only from a manifested perspective. The unmanifested consciousness, the pure potential from which all events spring, is always there, everywhere, and always creating freshness and chaos (not necessarily in a negative way, a better word would be unpredictability) on every corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my perspective though. I meditated on the issues of destiny and free will a lot and these are my personal intuitive insights on the topic.

       Gotcha, I just got a hair-trigger for that type of stuff now ever since the deliberate co-opting of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       by the Trump* brigade.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my mind it is very clear that one of the goals of the 'alt-right' Trump stuff has been to totally destroy rational discourse on conspiracy forums.  I know of three big conspiracy forums which used to have a huge amount of free-thinking questioning: Godlike Productions, Above Top Secret, and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  Now what I see in all of them is about 75% 'Trump Train' bullshit, 20% anti-Trump bullshit, and 5% real shit, which is usually made to disappear by bots or shills.   I say one of the goals because the global elites are very good at killing hundreds of birds with one stone (e.g. 9/11)
      </p>
      <p>
       I was going to say "I don't know when people will wake up and realize that both sides are part of a ploy to keep people concerned with hating each other instead of trying to wrest back our souls from the elites" but the sad thing is that I believe even most of the HyperTrump Cocksucking Club and Demmy-wemmy Super Libtard Squad used to know this.  They have had their weaknesses and insecurities exploited; now the former group thinks that bitching about Jews on 4chan and believing ANYthing labeled a conspiracy theory, even those clearly seeded as disinformation, will change the system, and the latter group thinks that going to a
       <del>
        party
       </del>
       protest for one single fucking day and holding up signs made with petroleum-based Crayola crayons (owned by super cultural brainwasher Hallmark) bought from Michael's (owned by Bain Capital, Blackstone Group, etc) and whining out loud will change the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Not that I even really dislike Trump.  I love that he has made it impossible to ignore the farcical nature of the US political system, and I have to admit he makes me giggle.  I don't even think he is really right-wing.  He is more like a pair of dice, which is hilarious to watch.  Saturday Night Live shouldn't even try to make fun of him because he is a bundle of real life bizzaro humor that is in a basically untouchable realm.  I am not kidding, I think this shit is the best reality show I've ever seen.  What scares me a little bit is that he seems like the kind of guy who would not want to stop being president, and he has laid the psychocultural groundwork for a fascist state--destroying trust in the press (and not just in bullshit TV news etc, but all independent press besides those who like him and probably get kickbacks somehow, maybe in the form of policy changes,) talking about how we should try having a president-for-life like China just set in motion, creating a strong "us vs. them" mentality, wanting to build a giant wall around the country to keep people in, etc.  My schizo hunches tell me that he is already collaborating with various people in the government to stage a coup, likely by using the looming war with Russia to suspend the 2020 election or nullify its results.  2020 is an apocalyptic sounding year.

       It's not a "cultural world view," it's a theocracy that Christian Dominionists like Devos want to establish. Can you not see the difference?

       "The government is forcing me to respect other people's civil rights!" is not the same as "I want to force everyone to worship the same god in the same way I do." Again, can you not see that?

       Learning what words mean and how to do math, some history and science may very well be telling someone "how to think," but forcing unproven book religion upon school kids either as an equal alternative to science or instead of it is just plain "brainwashing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Let your religion stand on its own merits and not be subsidized by the school system.
      </p>
      <p>
       And stop complaining about "feels." If you didn't feel, you'd be dead.

       Let's go back. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't you start out complaining about "ideology"? Your book religion is the ideology. You're the ideologue. As an ideologue, you must project out your ideology to anyone who disagrees, calling them what you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       is essentially the opposite ideology: "athiesm."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am no athiest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful what you ask for. If you let religion into school, I will require that your religion is viewed in a context that shows the evidence versus the lack of evidence. When a complete picture is shown, people will be rushing to escape your religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's make a deal. You keep religion out of school, and school won't look at the actual evidence of it.

       No one should be forced into any religion. I remember the cries of "Sharia law!!" under Obama (not that that was actually happening). I imagine that you are trying to make a connection to the left "forcing" people into their ideology?

       Erik is probably the most dangerous Prince/Devos product. The man should be in prison, but instead he's flying around the globe trying to set up schemes for the Trump administration behind the scenes. A favorite guest of Bannon's Breitbart radio show before Bannon was pushed out, he was being pressed to run for the senate in Wyoming I believe.

       My father-in-law was an Amway distributor (very part time).  he never had a problem with their business model.  I’ve read a many critical articles about Amway and also watched a documentary on the company from back in the early ‘1990’s.   Based on this, I would say that the business model has changed favorably to the smaller distributor since then and Amway’s Multi-tiered distributor model is no different from  many other commission based sales models.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, from my own experience I would rate the products that I’ve used from Amway as being very high quality.   To say that Amway is a scam is inaccurate.

       Could you explain a little more with some examples? I understand both sides like to point fingers and the whole "leftist brainwashing" is a pretty common accusation by the right. Are you talking about acceptance of LGBTs? Or women's suffrage? The civil rights movement? Understandably there are some over zealous people but I feel that most of it is in retaliation to suppression. America has been very white male dominated for most of its existence (I'm not trying to pick a fight, just understand some of the hatred towards the left).

       America has been white male dominated because Europe, at the time of our founding, was white male dominated. It's not like it was some evil plan, it's just how things shook out racially across the world.

      <p>
       And note that I'm not talking about slavery. We absolutely imported black slaves. But we were white male dominated long before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the left pushing their religion (leftism has become religion), just look no further than college campus. They frequently shut down anyone who dares to speak out against them. Much like radical Christians do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or look at Twitter where there is an insatiable mob of leftists attacking anyone who dares to go against the narrative. Look at how they attack their livelihoods, going after sponsors and employers. Or how the left labels anyone who thinks different Nazis, just as the Christians used to label people a demon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we can talk about white privilege and how it's no different than original sin. But at least with original sin I can attone. There is no attonment in leftist ideology. Or we can talk about how the left frequently disowns anyone who goes against the grain.

       As far as college campuses go, I went to college in the southeast and I did not see what you are describing. Perhaps it is different now but I doubt that across the entire US every college campus is a leftist thought control project, regardless of what right wing media would report. In college a lot of different demographics and cultures get to meet, I can understand a need to emphasize acceptance but, again, I am sure there are extremes. I have moved to a pretty liberal area and the local university would probably be considered extreme but so what? Go to a different college or don't worry so much about it. You obviously have not been brainwashed and have been exposed to the "leftist religion" so what makes you so different than those college kids? Oh, they are all soft brained and easily manipulated but you aren't. I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Twitter and the people you named, I have no idea. I am not a person who seeks out and only listens to people that agree with me or who agrees with all I listen to and I very much doubt that there are very many like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think acceptance over control is important and I really don't care if you want to fuck men, women, or a combination of both. I don't want average citizens who pay taxes like myself to get fucked continually by either the government or private entities with shitty oversight. Most "lefties" are not bad people. We have to quit looking at the country as us and them.

       It is absolutely different now, and it's different on the coasts. Just look at Ben Shapiro, Milo, Jordan Peterson, Thomas Sowell, Dave Rubin, Christina Hoff Sommers, Steven Crowder, etc. It's an increasingly big problem. The leftists on campuses are no platforming any conservative voice that disagrees with them, all under the guise of "safety" and "diversity". Once again, just as the religious right used to ban athesim, the "religious" left is banning conservatism.

       I never used to term brainwashed. I think it's easy for young and malleable minds to get sucked into the idea of diversity and equality. It's easy to not look at it any deeper than that. It makes you feel good and morally right. It's easy to react emotionally to people who disagree with you, especially when the adults (faculty) are cheering you on and reacting in the same way.

       The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Now, that quote is a bit hyperbolic in this instance. I accept that. However, most 'leftists' don't bother to look any deeper than the surface. They don't even
       <em>
        see
       </em>
       what's going on around them. They don't see that they are being used by people for nefarious ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt most leftists are good people. I know a bunch, and they're brilliant people. What they are all, though, is uninformed about the radicals in their party and when brought to their attention, they typically deny they exist or downplay their significance. It's a soft support for their means and methods, and that's dangerous. They're just fighting for inclusiveness, after all.

       I don't either. But I also don't want a state that says it's okay to hate people based on their race or gender, or that people who weren't alive during slavery somehow have a duty to "make up for it" to people who weren't slaves. I don't want a state that says men who weren't alive in the 1800s somehow have to pay (not with physical money) for the sins of their fathers. I also don't want a state that says it's illegal to state basic biology (There are only two genders). I don't want a college that bans and no platforms people who do the same. I also don't want a state that compels speech (see Canada and their pronoun law).
      </p>
      <p>
       But we've digressed. You asked, essentially, how the left was just like a religion. I've answered how. If you are against religious national states, you should be against the current wave of progressives gaining state power. They're literally the puritan right, fighting the same fights but for different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The puritan right says sex is wrong and thus must be censored. The progressive left says objectifying women is wrong and thus sex must be censored. The puritan right says video games cause violence and thus must be censored. The progressive left says video games cause men to beat women and thus must be censored. I could go on, but you get the point (I hope).

       Ok, if you wanted to talk about the extreme left I could maybe understand some of the examples that you are giving. But once again you are making the assumption that other people cannot maintain a balanced opinion and will be lead to destruction. It is the same fallacy you made when talking about college students. A person can be liberal and not want television censored or video games censored. That person is not just a puppet of the ultra liberals or so inept that they will blindly follow the next extreme measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the "nefarious ends" that these extreme liberals want, do you think? I am genuinely unaware of the dangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you say "ban," do you mean illegal or publicly frowned upon in public spaces including publicly funded universities? Because there are plenty of private colleges all over the nation that set their own standards. Not just colleges either. But if a university is receiving public tax dollars they have to accept everyone and try to create a space where that person feels comfortable or law suits ensue which cost more taxpayer dollars. Perhaps some conservatives should consider suing?

       Yes, a person can be liberal and actually be liberal. That's why I never call them liberals. I call then leftists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what you think is the "extreme" left is becoming more and more mainstream. The Democratic presidential candidate said that it was women who were the real victims of war, not the dead men. Think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       These progressive ideas turn into rage. Telling people they are oppressed, that so and so race or gender hates them, that "the man" hates them.. these aren't good idrals to be pushing. They justify terrible actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nefarious ends are they create a segmented population that they can then rile up against each other, among other things.

       Well, when it is true then I can justify being upset. Racism in America is real. That's what this post is about. People on the right are trying to push oppressive agendas. It's easy to tell someone to lay down when it isn't you being subservient. "Why are all those minorities making so much noise?!"

       First off, justify the claim that it's the right pushing oppressive agendas. Can you name me on law designed to oppress minorities that was put forth by Republicans?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can name one from the democrats - gun control. Little known fact, MLK was denied a carry permit due to democrats gun control laws. Also, gun control laws don't get enforced in affluent white neighborhoods, they Target the inner city which is largely minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second off, racism will always exist. We'll never rid the world of it. That doesn't make it okay to call everyone you disagree with racist. That doesn't make it okay to no platform them at a public university. That doesn't make it okay to incorrectly label half of Americans as racist.

       Racism is evil, I agree. I just also believe it's evil to use the charge of racism as a bludgeon to stifle discussion and debate.

       Well, there were southern Democrats around the time of the civil rights movement and they were effectively what we think of today as republicans so I don't know if the time matches up exactly with MLK but I'd be suspicious.

       You're now talking about historical laws. Many of those have been changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-abortion laws are not racist, at all. They're not even sexist. I'm pro-choice but I fully understand people who aren't. Maybe you try a little understanding instead of demonization. Also, planned Parenthood was started as a way of controlling the black population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti-gay laws aren't racist, either. And they don't exist anymore. Hell, a private Christian bakery can't even opt out of baking a cake for a gay wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voter registration being anything is just laughable. The idea that minorities can't get the IDs to vote is what's racist. Maybe stop believing black people are too dumb to find the DMV ;)

       Nice “spin” on the voter id thing though. You totally got me! Do some research and try to be unbiased (if you can manage) and then tell me that voter I’d laws do not target minorities. Your last statement tells me about all I need to know, however.

       Telling ALL people they need IDs is not targeting a specific race. You'd have a point if the law said only minorities need to have an ID to vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not spin. Please explain how requiring an ID to vote is racist? Anybody can get a government ID, so long as they are a citizen. It's quite simple, actually. Just go to the DMV. Hell, most states even let you do it online! Buts that's racist because

       I asked for current laws and proposals, by the way. I could go through history and find many laws, passed by many politicians, that suppress many people. That doesn't mean they still do, or they still pass those types of laws. By your logic, the Democrats are still against the freeing of the slaves.

       It's not just about black people as you have stated so many times (bias leak?) but it is about poor people who tend to be minorities. Voting is a right whether you like it or not and every citizen has that right with or without an id. To force people to go to a DMV which could be miles away and give up a day of work to stand in lines which would be incredibly long because all of a sudden everyone needs an id is way more restricting to those of low income than to those who are well off. I am not below the poverty line but to take a day off work and go stand in line at a DMV which is thirty miles away would not be easy for me either and I have a car which some of these people do not. Not everyone lives in the city and our public transportation in this country is atrocious or nonexistent. It just so happens that these people who would have a harder time getting an id tend to vote Democrat as well. Now tell me that is not purposefully restrictive? And the "need" for these voter id laws are all based on the false claim that "illegals" are voting in our elections. No proof has been shown of that. The only person I recall participating in voter fraud last election was a Trump supporter who tried to vote more than once. So...yeah. And again, those were Southern Democrats that were against freeing slaves which are the equivalent of (and they became) Republicans later on. We went over this with your MLK statement. Do some research.

       Think about what you said, minorities are poor. How is that NOT a racist statement? Why assume all poor people are minorities? And I said black people because that's what the video referenced. If you read my other comments, I clearly said minorities. But nice shift there ;)

       Voting in our elections is a right for CITIZENS. If you cannot verify your citizenship you have no legal right to vote. And you shouldn't have that right. Our government is not open to input of non citizens. Canada, Norway, France, and Brazil (among many other nations) require proof of citizenship to vote. Are these nations racist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also,
       <a href="https://cces.gov.harvard.edu">
        this study
       </a>
       shows that anywhere between 8 and 15% of illegal immigrants voted in the 2008 election. When you say "non credible evidence" you're either lying or you've never actually looked into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of of they vote or not, though, non citizens have no right to vote. It is not illegal, racist, or wrong for a nation to verify only citizens vote.

      <p>
       And you know exactly what that Fox snark was about.

       I'd say "continuously" is a fucking reach considering you have linked to two things: one video with the title "How white liberals really view black voters" so we can be sure that is unbiased and the study you linked to is just a CCES Dataverse website which holds lots of information though I am unsure if what you are talking about is there.

       That Voter ID wikipedia article says absolutely nothing about them being racist. You need to prove that claim. The Alabama Abortion Law may or may not be racist. One article isn't enough for me and I don't have to time to really dig into it. But we should recognize that state laws are not the same as federal laws. Racism is never right, but it means far more if done at the federal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Roy Moore isn't a fucking law. I could point to Anthony Weiner as a stand up example of a Democrat but that wouldn't prove a fucking thing.

       Roy Moore is an example of a republican who, while seated as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, installed a monument of the Ten Commandments in front of a judicial building using tax payer dollars and then after being removed from office he returned to the bench and ordered judges to ignore the federal courts overturning of same sex marriage ban. I wasn’t even talking about his sexual misconduct which is why I assume you brought up Anthony Weiner.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I doubt you and I will be able to determine whether people have used abortion laws to suppress though I believe they have and there are plenty of articles to support it, whether you agree or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wikipedia article certainly does touch on reasons for voter id laws being overturned and cites discriminatory practices as the reason for the overturns. The first few introductory paragraphs also go into detail on the debate about the practice and states that the type of voter fraud that the laws are out to prevent is extremely rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just on cursory searches and without even digging very deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree about State’s rights but you also have to acknowledge that often times if it is done at a state level those same people would like for it to be done federally (same sex marriage as an example).

       Do you not get that having a male dominated society is an evil plan? Especially males of only one ethnic group.

       the evil plan. The thing you just mentioned, as if its existence were perfectly fine.

       It wasn't a fucking plan, though. The reason it shook out that was was largely out of need. Women did not make as good of hunters as men. Women weren't as strong and thus made bad warriors. Men were unable to breastfeed so they were terrible at raising a baby.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you call an evil plan is just too genders finding a way to survive and ensure their existence as a race. You're trying to sell this idea that men wanted nothing more than to keep women down. That men and women were constantly at war with each other. This is not correct and it's a trope that has done far more harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the racial thing, I was pretty clear - wen imported black slaves. It's undeniable. Some of that was done with evil intent, some of it was tradition. None of it was right. But that doesn't explain how people of different skin colors were born in different areas of the globe. Africa has largely benefited from black males, is that just as bad? How about China largely benefitting from Asian men?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this idea that we've only benefitted from men is the nice progressive way of downplaying women. As if women played no role in bringing us to where we are because the evil men held them down. Life tip - without a mother to birth you and give you a boob to suck on, you wouldn't be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last thing, as we've progressed beyond our old constraints (fomula, machinery to make manual labor easier, etc) we've also progressed towards parity of the genders.

       Babies aren't good at any of those things. We still give them rights, and don't treat them entirely as property anymore. Similar measures could have been taken with women's rights for thousands of years, but clearly patriarchal and misogynistic religions kept the rights entirely one-sided for a reason.

       Lol. "muh patriarchy". You're clearly not here in good faith. Let me let you in on a little secret: babies, and children, had very few rights. They still do, actually. They were sold off to marriage or forced to fight at the ripe old age of puberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were agressively protected though. Why do you think that is? I'd guess you'd say it's because all men have always hated all women, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is, in the old days those children would be running the show in 12 years. If they were treated the same as adults, they would die. And if there are no children, there is no more human race.

       Did I ever say they didn't exist? The answer is no. But people like you can't hear any sort of idea that is not "Yep, men have evilly plotted to keep women down since the dawn of time".
      </p>
      <p>
       I explained to you why the world shook out the way it did. Rather than fact check me, or do research on your own, you'd rather continue with this idea that men are evil and have plotted to keep women down forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not a helpful world view. You're not helping the problem with that attitude. The solution to breaking the tradition of old isn't to put the blame squarely on people who had no say those traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, my patriarchy called. It wants the draft laws to go away and only be applied to women now. Oh, it would also like the family courts to start granting the majority custody to men, make women pay child support, and force divorced wives to give their ex husbands thousands of dollars a month in alimony. It would also like women to take the CEO jobs and have them work 100 hours a week, constantly travel, and never be home for their husbands or kids. It's also sick of making men work dangerous jobs, so could we get women to do those jobs too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out men are pretty bad at creating a system designed solely to benefit them.

       Take a look at some of my other recent comments, and you'll swallow what you just said about my opinion of women. I've been a recipient of domestic abuse and childhood molestation at the hands of women, so there's no pro-female bias in me. What there is in me is lot of information about history and contemporary events. And that information leads me to conclude that we do still exist in a patriarchy, and that it is the result of conspiracy, not simply anatomical differences in men and women.

       Here's the thing - do we live in a patriarchy where men are conspiring to keep women down, or do we live in a world where the rich keep the poor down?

       That is, by definition, not a patriarchy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But not all men hold power, and women are not excluded from holding power, at least not in America. Do patriarchies exist across the world? Absolutely, especially in the middle east. But that is not America, and it hasn't been America for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof of this is, as they say, in the pudding. Who makes the decisions in your house hold? In a patriarchal society, the man's word is the last word. That's not my house, at all. My wife is absolutely the boss. Same with the house I grew up in -- my mother made all the major decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't disagree that the powerful 'conspire' (though I don't like that word here for various reasons) to keep the plebs down. I disagree with the notion that it's done with the intent of keeping specifically
       <em>
        women

       down.

       No, I was asking for some examples to back up your statement. As far as the examples that I gave they were all pretty hard fought and mostly opposed by conservative groups which identify as "the right". Take that to mean what you will. BTW you are doing kind a bad job at baiting and not really adding anything of substance. You could try to answer some of the questions people have asked you as there seem to be some folk who are interested in having a conversation while you are just trying to incite anger. But it might require you to actually sit and think out a logical answer instead of these knee jerk responses you have been spitting out.

       I thought the part about being "forced into an ideology" was way more important to consider than which side of the aisle was doing it. So I gave you an example of it. Why does it particularly matter which side is doing it, if we know it's happening.

       Funny you say this, as their version of Christianity is just about as extremist and totalitarian as the harshest versions of Islam. They also wish it to become the law of the land under strict theocracy, not too different than the Saudis or Iran.

       Since we aren't ruled by Sharia law, I didn't need to compare them. But I did live in the most Muslim-populated city in America for 5 years, went to school with lots of Muslims, dated one, worked for some - so it's likely that I have more experience than you in both religions.

       I mean, I guess if you've only ever gotten your information from the internet, you might think that. But I also look a these things called books and newspapers. I also participate in a lot of political activism, and like I said, I experienced some of the Christian dogma and being immersed in Islamic social groups for a long time. Those would be known as first-hand experiences.

       No I'm suggesting your life story just happens to be tailor made for this discussion, and that make you come off as a liar.

       It's not at all rare for people to go to Catholic school, and I can prove to you that I lived right across the street from Dearborn Michigan during the late 90s and early 2000s, when it was the most Muslim populated city in the US. I still have my pay stubs.

       People are more than welcome to share experiences, your story happens to conveniently fit. Let's assume you're telling the truth. Does that negate the heinous acts committed daily in the name of Islam? In which Christian nation's are gay people purged in the modern day? In which Christian nation are women stoned to death for being raped? In which Christian nation are women attacked with acid? I'm sorry the facts of the world are inconvenient to your cozy little world view, grow up.

       I never made an argument from relative privation about Islam being okay because Christianity is worse. I just said that I prefer to go after the biggest part of the problem. But if you were privy to the rest of my social media accounts, you'd see very clearly that I level only slightly less vitriol at Islam than I do at Christianity, because it's a nasty ideology too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe stop trying to look at everything with a polarized - this or that - point of view. It doesn't have to be one or the other. It can be both, and I can vary my criticism of each religion according to the impact I think it's having on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I have the most criticisms to level at Christianity. Does that make sense to you?

       While sharia is not prevalent now the only goal of Islam, ultimately, is to have all states under religious law; it states as much in the Quran. Human history shows us that some form of religion will be the foundation of our laws and customs.  Whether you're religious or not you will be affected by one religion having priority in a region over another. So again, a violent religion hell-bent on world domination, resulting in sharia law is what you are supporting. For me? I'd rather take the western ideology route even if I am not a Christian, because I respect women and enjoy freedoms not necessarily afforded in Muslim dominant regions.

       Yeah, how long has that been their goal though? Over a thousand years? How's that going? They still tend to occupy third-world nations, and they seem to get perpetually bombed by Christians, so who really has the dominant strategy for subjugating other people? That's right, it's Christianity winning that rat race.

       Oh please. Stop believing everything you read or watch from the conglomerate media. They do the same crap that we do here when we complain that Sharia Law has implemented in schools, when all that really happened was that the students went to a field trip to various religious sites, and the parents were given full notice to exclude their kids from the field trip.

       I have two questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) If Christianity is so much worse then you support Mohammed marrying Aisha at the age of 6 and having sex with her at 9 years old?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Do you condemn Humas for his genocidal actions in the name of Islam?
      </p>
      <p>
       For other people on this thread learn more about Islam:

       A lot of people who support Islam and don't practice the religion themselves NEED to read up on the teachings etc.

       You are very right. I suggest everyone look into Tree of Logic as she breaks down Islam (she used to be Muslim)

       noooo no no. We treat western countries differently. We destabilize them instead of bombing them. Sometimes we use the military. Sometimes we use the CIA. Sometimes we use economics.

      <p>
       And there's no shortage of evidence of people trying to establish ruling dynasties in this country. There's a reason we explicitly forbade titles of nobility in the constitution.

       Conspiracies and common knowledge are not mutually exclusive things. Mot people know about Bernie Madoff. That doesn't make what he did any less of a conspiracy.

       Then Eric created an army that was paid for by the entire country to replace soldiers in Iraq and A-stan while the political process pretended to make good on their word of getting out of the middle east.  Instead, they fueled the creation of the contractor world and an army unaccountable to the rule of law.  Sidestepping all or most legal requirements and standards that we place on our soldiers abroad.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyoqd0QDtSg">
        Remember this one?  Probably one of many, but justice was served only because this one got out in the open.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So a christian army of sorts that is largely outside the legal structure, the cost was much higher in dollars as contractors would routinely make 3 times as much as a regular soldier and the money would still come from your tax dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       A corporate army swapped out with the US army was still paid for by the people who were thinking it was all coming to an end when it wasn't.  It was the baby steps to something worse.

       There is misconception about these people and their religious affiliation. Christ like in mind, soul and actions comes with a perception of compassion, care and love. To say some of these people are nothing but criminals is the misconception. True to faith Christian, Jews or Muslim often(or as best they can) try to obey the doctrines of their faith. They are usually service to others, caring, compassionate and devoted to the upliftment of their fellow humans. The behavior these criminals exhibit are far from Christ like, they serve their own selfish nature. They put money and profits before everything and everyone all while pushing their own agenda. Call them what you want but the last thing they should be called is the fake psuedo religious mask they hide behind. The beginning of wisdom is calling something by its proper name.

       Much more so than the people who get thier news from comedians and think there is a gender for each of thier moods.  Those horrible Christians that run charities, pantries,  soup kitchens, shelters, and addiction programs while people like yourself post about how virtuous you are hoping others will like your post or give you a gold star.

       Conservative fundamentalist Christians have done
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       more harm to this country than good. They are the reason we have backward ass local laws telling gay people they're subhuman scum, they are the reason the Westboro Baptist Church exists, and they have
       <em>
        ZERO
       </em>
       place in influencing national politics on a federal level. And you, frankly, are opposed to the entire concept of this nation if you think we should co-opt Christian beliefs into our laws. This country literally exists because people didn't want the government to tell them what religion to practice or beliefs to hold.

       Someone who has large disposable income gives a tiny portion to a charity as a tax right off is much more noble than Deacon Dan who makes 30K a year and gives a thousand dollars a year and 16 hours a week actually helping people in need is horrible.  Good call there chief.

       You are virtue signalling now, tell me how much of your income do you give to the homeless shelter?  Are they worth sacrificing your internet?  How about that double latte, or your smart phone?  People like you are the biggest phonies because you screech about all these things, belittle those who actually do help, then demand the government do it in your stead so you can gloat about what a wonderful person you are reddit/facebag/twatter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never understand the stupidity of people like you,  do you understand the concept of how the right and left work?  The right is not proactive it's reactionary.  If you want to know why the right does something see what the left has done.  For example, if you want gays to be more accepted stop doing things like flogging each other with dildos at pride parades.  You have no right to tell people to stay out of privacy of your your bedroom when you drag your bedroom out into public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Westboro Baptist Baptist Church is a scam meant to make money through lawsuits against local municipalities.  For years they go out say outrageous things and either sue for not letting them speak, or for not protecting them if they get so much as touched.  They are a boogeyman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantify your assertion about Christians doing more harm.  They basically  started the most successful revolution in human history and built the most powerful nation in history in less than 250 years.  Please don't start the founding fathers were not christian nonsense your kind preaches as fact.  Their are 300 plus founding fathers and you can maybe surmise 2 were lapsed Christians and one was a nihilist who went crazy with drink.  Actually read thier thoughts instead of depending on some website to tell you what to think.  I can tell you that all of them thought that Christianity was essential to the stability of the republic.  Only moral people can be trusted with freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be that people could disagree politically and still be amiable, people like yourself killed that and are hundred times worse than any bible thumping fundie ranting about hell.  I would hope you get over your edgy daddy issues and get out of your echo chamber, it's what is poisoning this country.  I will pray for you, mostly because it will annoy you though.

       Although every Christian might not be a good person. The values of western civilization are based on the Judeo-Christian scriptures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people do like to hide behind the golden veil of Christianity to promote themselves as a good person, but overall, it's what built America to be the place it was and is now.

       Japan seems nice? I dunno. I think your argument sounds very much like the "America is the greatest nation in the world! I'd never live anywhere else!" argument. There are tons of great places to live all over the world. We aren't that special.

       So because some Christians have done bad things before you assume these two people have bad intent? When people say to me “Not everything is a conspiracy” it makes me sick but I’m pretty tempted to say it here. This post assumes too much and that’s all I’m saying.

       With Backwater's background and Erik Prince, I am sure that he has ill intent. With Betsy DeVos' statements about education and religion, I am sure that her intent is to promote her religious views in America by legislation and that is ill intent in my book. I am not antiChristian but I am against religion in government or religion dictating government. Just because someone wants a god to control their life does not mean I do.

       Wanting to establish gods kingdom through education =/= forcing Christianity down peoples throat. Trump admin liking princes idea about privatizing military presence is bad cuz blackwater mercenaries killed 14 innocent civilians once. Too much assumption. Maybe they are evil. I wouldn’t know because there is not nearly enough information to decide.

       When it comes to public schools then it may be forcing it down people's throats and she has expressed interest in closing down public schools and going to privatized or charter schools which, like Blackwater, would receive tax dollars but have little to no accountability to the tax payer. "Evil" may be a strong word but I do not think most people would want these people to succeed in their agenda if it is that.

       Yes, the Roman Empire may have used Christianity, but only after murdering a few hundred thousand.  If you knew your history, you'd know that the crusades were a

       You ignorance is breathtaking brother. The sanctity of human life is a cornerstone in Christianity. They ended the social accepted practices of pedophilia and homosexuality in the ancient world, help stop human sacrifice as the normal way of thanking the gods(your username). Stopped the gladiatorial matches. and Jesus teaching about "turning the other cheek" is not found in any philosophy or religion previous. The claim bout the crusades is just stupid, since true Christians have since the founding of the catholic church understood that the pope/vatican is :"Mystery, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth." and if you still want to play the muh muh "crusades" card , check this out : Encyclopedia of War , by Charles Philips &amp; Allan axelrod. It puts this into perspective for you. of all wars in human history, only 6.9% has been religious in origin. If you take Islam out only 3.2%. In the U.S TV evangelism is a coin-tel-pro propaganda arm of you government . You calling these false teachers, christian, is to me, as if I called snoop dog "straight-edge". Jesus puts down in very clear terms who he would call a follower of Christ. Luke 6:46 “And why call ye Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not the things which I say?". Christianity as taught by Jesus, allows no murder, no lying, no hypocrisy, no sexual immorality. Is these satanist claiming to be Christian like Prince &amp; DeVos following Christ? "Matthew 19:24 And again I say unto you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.”
In the information age ignorance is a choice. You guys better read up on some of the stuff you comment on. But I guess is not the reddit way to do things. The most important thing for anti-christians is to read the bible. Otherwise you'll just keep making fools of yourselves.  Proverbs 15:28 The heart of the righteous studieth how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.

       Na. You haven’t wasted your time.  And your not the only person telling me these things, sending me similar messages. I honestly enjoyed our silly back and forth and I hope all is well for you.  I just don’t believe what you believe, and I am being a jerk instead of honestly debating you.   Quoting scripture turns me off from intelligent debate though, so I wouldn’t know how to debate you.  Like I said, I hope your doing well and I appreciate the dialogue brother. Hail Satan!

       No worries. I honestly enjoyed our silly back and forth and I hope all is well for you too :) I don't mean to turn people away with scripture, but I can't help myself. I\m new in the faith, so to speak. and the little pieces of scripture that swirled around in my drugged up, nihilistic "the "they are to powerful to fight" conspiracy theory ridden mind, DID save my life from the brink of the void. Thanks to some things this seemingly irrelevant  character in this book said a long time ago, my son still have a dad. So my hope is that it will do the same for others. God bless you brother,

       If you read the Game of Thrones novels you come to a point where you realize everything that happens is a giant game of chess played between Little Finger and Varys.

       I know this is a corny/imperfect analogy, but it applies to post-industrial revolution society. There is a cabal of billionaires/political figures playing a giant game of chess, and the rest of us are pawns.

       Such bullshit. "You guys" this and "you guys" that. Easy to just blanket all people who don't agree with you, isn't it? Lazy, lazy, lazy. Believe it or not there are people who have been on this subreddit a long time who may disagree with you. Did I reference any of those sources you listed? No. Project, project, project. Deny, deny, deny. Your sourcebook is getting tired.

       "In God we trust" is on the dollar. "God" is in the Pledge of Allegiance which students say each day in the morning. Ten Commandments on government buildings has been continually debated. Christmas and Easter are on blast everywhere in the US. These are just off the top of my head.

       Your best evidence of current "culture propaganda" is text added to our currency 60+ yrs ago. And holidays that people celebrate, which is not forced. On top of that, they're normally celebrated because of the gifts and bringing families together, a lot of people who aren't even religious celebrate these.

       Seems to be a common tactic of yours to accuse people who you don't agree with of being "shills," "dumb," "idiots," or part of a larger group that you see as "invading". Perhaps you are the paid instigator?

       Why was that text added 60+ years ago? Because 60+ years ago the U.S. was completely different, and there probably was "christian propaganda" but there is definitely not now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that something that happened 60+ years ago that Betsy Davos is some part of some conspiracy of Christian Propaganda currently going in is hilarious.

      <p>
       I call people "shills" because they exist, and are paid to astroturf subreddits, online forums and social media. I called you specifically a shill because the idea that anyone could legitimately think that there is some "christian propaganda" today is absolutely insane.

       Most Freemasons are Christinans, George Bush has called the Iraq war a "crusade", how are Christians a positive influence exactly? Even Hitler was a Christian.  I'm not saying they're all a negative influence between calling them all a positive influence is asinine.

       Those people weren’t Christian or they didn’t follow Jesus. Gw bush used any and every excuse he had so we could invade Iraq.jesus Christ is and had always been a positive influence. The free masons aren’t Christian even if they think they are . Most Christians I meet are good people

       It's easy when you just dismiss any "bad" Christians as not Christian at all. Of course there won't be any bad Christians left!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of instances of the Catholic Church calling crusades against heretics, there's the reconquesta, there's the sack of Constantinople a Christian city (I won't even bring up the crusades against Palestine) , inter-denominational Christian wars have claimed millions. You can't just gloss over these facts to push your agenda.

       Hitler was a possessed pawn. 230 million Europeans died in those wars. People saying he was trying to save white people, orbsaybthey are dominant are dumb. His war led to the most European deaths in history probably.

       The first rule of membership is belief in a higher power (because those kind of people are easy to brainwash) and free masonry exists primarily in white Anglo Christian societies.

       You could make the same argument and say Oh, Islam is a positive influence, Al Qaeda is Anti-Muslim. It doesn't change the fact that Christians make up the membership of Freemasonry and Muslims make up the membership of Al Qaeda. Generalizing either religions as good or bad is pidgeonholing imo.

       You live in the fantasy. The is no such this as objectively good or evil. I'm afraid good and evil and morality as a whole are a subjective enterprise. Science is objective. Morality is not. I recommend you investigate the significant amount of literature dating back hundreds of years to the present regarding ethics and morality. Hume has some great stuff about this very topic. If you ever get the opportunity, I think you would greatly benefit from taking a course or two in ethics. I know I thoroughly enjoyed the ones I took (contemporary problems in moral philosophy was a great course for example).

       I'm not comparing them to terrorist jihadis. I'm not even talking about extremism. This thread is about unnecessary and cruel acts of war that the US commits, both with our federal army and the mercenary armies we hire. All our wars and drone strikes that murder innocents not only go un-denounced, but are oftenly widely supported by the bulk of Christians in this country. It's easy to say they are a positive influence because they preach peace and set up soup kitchens, but there are larger evils being fully endorsed by huge parts of our heavily Christian country

       What about the Christians that want to smash gay people's heads in with rocks?
      </p>
      <p>
       I love how the old testament book they quote, Leviticus, has a passage right before the whole "smash gays heads with rocks" about prohibiting  blood sacrifice to the God, Molek.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Lord said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death, I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I fail to see anything positive from this Bronze Age nonsense...the Old Testament at least. The whole "love everyone without exception" thing is pretty positive :D

       Yes but it’s called a reformation. Jesus didn’t invent a new religion, he reformed an existing one. No Christians I’ve ever met would say you ONLY read the New Testament. The New Testament is like what amendments are to the constitution

       You’re trying to argue that the Old Testament is only for Jews and not Christians. I am saying you’re wrong about that. Im saying that many(safe to say most) Christians read or at least believe in the Bible, which includes the Old Testament, whether you like it or not. Maybe in your super woke opinion they are not true Christians or whatever, but that’s your opinion and I’d wager that they’d disagree with you about not being true Christians. You think mike pence is a true Christian?

       Old Testament serves as a guide to understand the New Testament. If that makes sense. 
Again, if you are going to point out Leviticus then point out why Lesbians are not included in the bible yet are still persecuted by the same Christian zealots attacking gays?

       Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.

       I assure you I don’t condone the Old Testament, it has nothing to do with Christ so why is it Christian? Ya it’s not. I’ve gathered my philosophies from one author (not the Bible) Joel goldsmith. Look him up and read his words and you understand why Christ is truly our savior. And trust me it’s more involved than you think. Have a great weekend

       Replace the word "religion" with the word "spiritual" and maybe then I'd agree with you.

       I think it's silly not to be spiritual (looking at you atheists!) however I understand that some people have had different life experiences than me and reject organized religion due to their experiences.

       I was tricked into joining Amway when I was a college student. I was broke and saw an opportunity, but after attending one of their biggest convention in Dayton Ohio I saw the level of bullshit they were spreading. I told my upline (person who recruited me) that I quit. He quit after a year and became a ground instructor. Amway is a cunning business.

       Betsy DeVos believes that education reform can "advance God's Kingdom" and advocates for charter schools and the opening of private schools via financial assistance programs (which would not be subject to the same oversight or regulations as public schools because of funding to the students to pay for schools as opposed to direct dollars to the school). Basically her desire is to privatize schooling.

       Non-sense. Since the federal government starting taking control of the curriculum there is nothing the teachers' unions can do about it in public schools.
       <br/>
       They scrubbed 'God' from everything in public schools which means the lower-class and most of the middle-class now no longer has a choice but to send their kids to atheist school even if that's not what they wish.
       <br/>
       I'm an atheist but you are deliberately blind if you don't see the religion is really important to a lot of people and that drives a lot of what they are doing.

       It's Christian Reformed but with an incredibly staunch pro-Dutch leaning. For example, if you do not have the right last name (something that sounds straight from The Netherlands), don't expect to receive acceptance into church organizations. In general, members of the church are fairly educated and will put on a liberal, tolerant face. But they are actually judgier and more conservative than Christian Reformed people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Dutch Christian Reformed families educate their kids in separate schools. Grand Rapids schools on general already feel like Christian schools (probably Betsys ideal public school system). My Bio teacher (Dutch btw) told us all the time he didn't believe in evolution and that he was essentially a  Young Earth Creationist. Colleges and Universities in the area (that are largely funded by the DeVos family) Hope College, among others, perpetuate this exclusivity. I grew up hearing "if you aren't Dutch, you aren't much," because I looked Dutch so they thought I was in on it.

       And what? America was founded with Christian principles. I'm assuming from your command of the English language that you embrace many of these principles. What's the conspiracy; agenda? That's not conspiracy

       It was not founded on Christian beliefs. It was founded by masons who were all for seperation of church and state. One of the requirements of being a mason is to have a belief in a higher power, this is not exclusive to the Christian faith. They founded the United States as a secular state that allowed freedom of religion. The founding fathers did not push a single religious doctrine.

       That's the most recent talking point, but if you dig a bit you'll find that the Masonic belief in "G"od is Keter, although there are numerous God and gods along the descent into matter.
Tiferet is Christ in that Masonic cosmology and is the hidden hand etc of their lore. 
So "Christian" in the political sense? No. "Christian" like the dummies that voted Trump for political and social gain? No. 
But a Christian nation based on Grecian and Roman ideals of individuality and responsibility? Yes.

       I would rather see a Christian agenda in place rather than the liberal bullshit I have to put up with here in CA. With liberals actively dumbing down schools, giving kids sex change hormones and just the overall liberal snowflake insanity I welcome a more level headed group. Boohoo to this whole issue really, everyone is bought and paid for on both sides.

       You are talking about two different relationships and I don't think you can show me where an employer could not fire an employee who has refused to work during certain times, though. I know employers who accommodate their Muslim and Seventh Day Adventist employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other relationship is between a business with a contract with their state government to serve the, public.  It isn't a secret that you must serve all the public, not just, "your kind."

       I could have just gotten my High School Diploma yesterday and still be smart enough to know that Christian organizations are guilty of committing every act on your short list in one way or another. Do I need a source to say that the Catholic church has a bit of a history when it comes to sexualizing children? Huh? Are you going to sit here in r/conspiracy and deadass tell me, with your sparkly masters in history, that that isn't a thing that has happened and is currently happening within the walls of the Catholic organization?

       I don't believe many of the conspiracy theories here but I used to come for good, honest debate. I used to learn things that made me reconsider my beliefs. I used to teach skeptics things that they should consider when trying to find the truth of different events.
      </p>

       Then this sub turned into a pizzagate-loving, pro-Trump fuckfest.

       I'm really happy to see that this did well. I was not expecting it to though there are some angry posts and I have gotten some threatening private messages from u/florydorpal calling me a "Jew" and talking about a coming "purge" of jewish people and how "delicious" it will be. So those people you mentioned are still here.

       That's why teachers get paid so well! Because they are obviously in control! Get real. Go look at the conditions of public schools (especially in hard red states) and tell me how well republican christian values are working out for the teachers and the students. It is a fucking shame and embarrassing. And then people sit there and wonder why we are losing our lead in the world and want to lay blame everywhere but at their own feet.

       These people don't want you in their country if you aren't practicing their religion. They don't just want to succeed, they want those different from them to fail. Sure, they aren't strapping bombs to their chest and chopping off heads. Instead they take control of the government and quietly pull the rug out from under us. Dumb the next generation down, shut up those that aren't like-minded, brand dissenters as enemies of the state. It's blatantly obvious that these people are the biggest current threat to our Democracy, and a little less than half the country is cheering them on while this happens because "Fuck the other guy"

       Domination over the world? That's rich. Christians are persecuted in most of the world and even in America the largest search engine doesn't put an Easter doodle on their homepage. If Christian domination is their game, they  are losing to atheism, and then shortly after to Islam.

       You're right. Probably a poor assumption on my part.  But Christians are not persecuted most of the world over and atheism and islam are definitely not winning. Just do a quick Goog- you know what here:

       parts of the middle east and North Korea do not make most of the world. And while Christianity may eventually fall behind in numbers these two things do not mean that the DeVos and Prince families do not have desires to push their Christian agendas. They do and have stated as much and have positioned themselves to do as much with their money. Are you familiar with Blackwater? Are you familiar with the Council for National Policy, Focus on the Family, and the Family Research Council?

       It shouldn't.
And yet, it does. 
Also sorry for not seeing the world EXACTLY the way you want me too. That's an attitude I've only encountered in deeply religious people. What crede, what words would you like me to believe, friendo?

       Snicker. Christians control the US right now. What do you mean persecuted? You'll be persecuted once you're shot or hjng from street lamps. Disagreement with you is not persecution. How many witches did you burn today?

       Christians are on a decline worldwide. Atheism is what the kids are into, and by birthrates alone Islam is the coming thing. It takes a few websearches to find that out. "How many witches did you burn??" Assuming I was a Christian? My dude, you belong here in r/conspiracy.

       Let's go back. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't you start out complaining about "ideology"? Your book religion is the ideology. You're the ideologue. As an ideologue, you must project out your ideology to anyone who disagrees, calling them what you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       is essentially the opposite ideology: "athiesm."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am no athiest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be careful what you ask for. If you let religion into school, I will require that your religion is viewed in a context that shows the evidence versus the lack of evidence. When a complete picture is shown, people will be rushing to escape your religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's make a deal. You keep religion out of school, and school won't look at the actual evidence of it.

       America has been white male dominated because Europe, at the time of our founding, was white male dominated. It's not like it was some evil plan, it's just how things shook out racially across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And note that I'm not talking about slavery. We absolutely imported black slaves. But we were white male dominated long before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the left pushing their religion (leftism has become religion), just look no further than college campus. They frequently shut down anyone who dares to speak out against them. Much like radical Christians do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or look at Twitter where there is an insatiable mob of leftists attacking anyone who dares to go against the narrative. Look at how they attack their livelihoods, going after sponsors and employers. Or how the left labels anyone who thinks different Nazis, just as the Christians used to label people a demon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we can talk about white privilege and how it's no different than original sin. But at least with original sin I can attone. There is no attonment in leftist ideology. Or we can talk about how the left frequently disowns anyone who goes against the grain.

       Dave Rubin, Bill Mahr is a racist, Laci Green, Jordan Peterson. I could go on but you should get the point.

       Look to Florida for a very recent example. They just passed legislation which will force all schools to display the "In God we trust" motto on their buildings.

       That's forcing religion on people.

       I thought the part about being "forced into an ideology" was way more important to consider than which side of the aisle was doing it. So I gave you an example of it. Why does it particularly matter which side is doing it, if we know it's happening.

       Such bullshit. "You guys" this and "you guys" that. Easy to just blanket all people who don't agree with you, isn't it? Lazy, lazy, lazy. Believe it or not there are people who have been on this subreddit a long time who may disagree with you. Did I reference any of those sources you listed? No. Project, project, project. Deny, deny, deny. Your sourcebook is getting tired.

       The most dangerous religion at the moment is Islam. Christians are pushing sharia law? Who is "they" and please give me modern day examples of the extremism perpetuated by "they". I'm sorry you got your jimmies rustled by someone simply calling it like it is.

       No I'm suggesting your life story just happens to be tailor made for this discussion, and that make you come off as a liar. I don't expect you to understand because the same personality that feels the need to lie to make an argument more compelling, is the same personality that has very few logical trains of thought.

       Yeah, how long has that been their goal though? Over a thousand years? How's that going? They still tend to occupy third-world nations, and they seem to get perpetually bombed by Christians, so who really has the dominant strategy for subjugating other people? That's right, it's Christianity winning that rat race.

       I could have just gotten my High School Diploma yesterday and still be smart enough to know that Christian organizations are guilty of committing every act on your short list in one way or another. Do I need a source to say that the Catholic church has a bit of a history when it comes to sexualizing children? Huh? Are you going to sit here in r/conspiracy and deadass tell me, with your sparkly masters in history, that that isn't a thing that has happened and is currently happening within the walls of the Catholic organization?

       If the main thing that defines you is your open and constant speaking about the “god” you believe in. Get the fuck away from me please.   Add in evil shit they do and yeah fuck them all.   Especially the Jews for abusing their victim status by maximizing violence

        First off, justify the claim that it's the right pushing oppressive agendas. Can you name me on law designed to oppress minorities that was put forth by Republicans?

       That is what you said. I see nothing about "current" though we are not going back that far. Stop changing the goal posts.

       It's not just about black people as you have stated so many times (bias leak?) but it is about poor people who tend to be minorities. Voting is a right whether you like it or not and every citizen has that right with or without an id. To force people to go to a DMV which could be miles away and give up a day of work to stand in lines which would be incredibly long because all of a sudden everyone needs an id is way more restricting to those of low income than to those who are well off. I am not below the poverty line but to take a day off work and go stand in line at a DMV which is thirty miles away would not be easy for me either and I have a car which some of these people do not. Not everyone lives in the city and our public transportation in this country is atrocious or nonexistent. It just so happens that these people who would have a harder time getting an id tend to vote Democrat as well. Now tell me that is not purposefully restrictive? And the "need" for these voter id laws are all based on the false claim that "illegals" are voting in our elections. No proof has been shown of that. The only person I recall participating in voter fraud last election was a Trump supporter who tried to vote more than once. So...yeah. And again, those were Southern Democrats that were against freeing slaves which are the equivalent of (and they became) Republicans later on. We went over this with your MLK statement. Do some research.

       And what is that little Fox News thing at the bottom of your post?

       I'd say "continuously" is a fucking reach considering you have linked to two things: one video with the title "How white liberals really view black voters" so we can be sure that is unbiased and the study you linked to is just a CCES Dataverse website which holds lots of information though I am unsure if what you are talking about is there.

       I honestly do not understand the Fox News reference and didn't even realize it was snark, so...fail I guess? I'd still like to know though so if you want to explain I'd be ok with that.

       I stated that voting was a citizen's right. I didn't imply otherwise.

       You want sources? Ok, thought this stuff was common knowledge. Sorry about that.
