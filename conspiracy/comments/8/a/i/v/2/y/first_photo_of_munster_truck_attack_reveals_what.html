    <div class="md"><p>Conflating flat earth with his statement is ridiculous</p>

<p>I believe the Nice attack was fake. Look at ANY photo of the truck post-attack. The truck allegedly killed 78 and injured hundreds.</p>

<p>Not one drop of blood. Not one dent.</p>

<p>I’ve hit a deer with my pick-up. It FUCKED my truck up completely. And blood...a lot of blood.</p>

<p>Why is it so threatening to your consciousness to consider that the Nice attack was not what you believe it was ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a much closer photo</p>

<p>No blood no dents no damage other than police bullets. But 84 dead and hundreds injured ?</p>

<p>Now here is a photo of a truck that hit a deer. One deer.</p>

 This was one of the more understated photos. If you mow down a crowd of people, damage to said vehicle includes blood and dents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bullshit.  You are comparing to radically different things.  The photos show truck damage, go get me a bunch of pictures of trucks used in a mass killing and you might have a point.  I love that the bar keeps moving here, this is exactly what flat earth dummies do, ask for evidence then change the requirements or blow it off as fake.  There are pics of dead people readily available, there are pics of the damaged truck readily available, but now its not the &#39;right&#39; kind of damage because you saw a deer do something completely different.  Go outside and play in traffic lets see what kind of blood spatter you get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight... you literally believe that the Nce truck could kill 84 people and injure hundreds and sustain zero damage and have not a drop of blood on it ?</p>

<p>Because I didn’t move any bar. I compared a truck that caused a single fatality to a truck that allegedly caused 84. </p>

<p>Maybe this is a better comparison. George Weller plows into the Santa Monica Farmers Market, killing 10, injuring 63. Catastrophic damage to his vehicle. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/market-crash-driver-too-old/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/market-crash-driver-too-old/</a></p>

<p>Would there be catastrophic damage to a semi ? Who can say. Would there be SOME damage ? Only an idiot would deny it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire front cover of the truck is gone, its a cab forward flat front truck, there isn&#39;t space between the engine and components like a car where things compress and get crumpled in an accident.<br/>
This truck ran into trees not people and you still see the general shape remains the same.  Different shaped vehicles react different when shit hits them, I know fucking shocking.</p>

<p>Where is the blood in your photos? This was your smoking gun right.  Like omg maybe zoom lenses don&#39;t pick up details like that when photographers aren&#39;t able to get close and perfectly compose photos.  You act like someone owes you the extreme blood and gore here when this would be the easiest part to fake. Crazy how blood from far away just looks like dark liquid and easily blends into asphalt and other dark colored materials.  You&#39;ve seen examples of that now so I guess your argument won&#39;t include it anymore.</p>

<p>You said no damage to the truck there is significant damage to the truck.  You said no blood, and all that shows me is the photos aren&#39;t detailed enough just like yours.</p>

<p>Something not looking like how you picture it in your mind or how a movie depicts it isn&#39;t fucking evidence of a staged event.  This is exactly like flat earth bs, it doesn&#39;t make sense to you so it must be fake.  </p>

<p>you are comparing a pickup, to an actual truck with a road ranger/high-low range gearbox that is about 8 times the weight and a shitload more torque. </p>

<p>i drive these things and have hit deer, kangaroos, sheep etc and this damage is consistent with what has been reported. its all about the height of the vehicle vs the height of the humans/object/animals you hit. </p>

<p>ive also hit animals with my ute (you guys call them pickups) and at 80km/h (50 mph) theres not always a lot of blood, if any. just fur and damage. </p>

<p>the truck has lost its bumper/bullbar, theres blood spatter on it and plenty of body parts and blood and shit under the wheels &amp; undercarriage and everywhere else. </p>

<p>are we looking at the same photo? THERES SHITLOADS of dents, scratches, panels missing, bumper/bullbar missing. are you kidding me???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not claiming that nobody was hit. Why would you assume that?</p>

<p>I’m claiming that the entire thing was staged and made to look like a real car hitting innocent bystanders, when in fact it was just a set full of stuntmen and women.</p>

<p>Let me ask you this: if it was manufactured and none of the reported injuries were real, how would you know the difference? What clues might give it away?</p>

<p>Wait a minute... didn’t you <em>just</em> accuse me of having <em>my</em> mind made up?</p>

<p>Seems to me you may be projecting, my friend.</p>

<p>There are many making-of videos that show exactly how a shot like this would be staged. Combine multiple takes and CGI with a few suggestive photos and it paints a convincing narrative.</p>

<p>So my question is: why were there no injuries apparent after the car hit? Just people laying down, in some cases only as they realise the cameraperson has them in his field of view?</p>

<p>It’s suspicious as fuck. If you rewatch the various clips with an open mind and consider the possibility that it’s all fake, you’ll start to notice many anomalies. Then there’s the symbology...</p>

<p>The “edit” asterisk betrays you, sir.</p>

<p>That’s a fair point though. Why would <em>anyone</em> believe <em>anything</em> without evidence?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wat. Only a handful of people are struck, and struck lightly at that, if you rewatch the videos more closely.</p>

<p>Your claim that the hundred of people there, the first responders, hospitals, etc., all lie every time this happens is an extraordinary claim that you can&#39;t back up with anything but your imagination and open mind. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a conclusion that was arrived at by examining the evidence.</p>

<p>If there is evidence of fraud anywhere at this event  (and there is plenty) and the scene requires co-ordination (which it does) and there is evidence of directing (and there is) then it stands to reason that all the people in the scene are in on it.</p>

<p>Quite a few good clips here: </p>

<p>It was manufactured, the videos were done in multiple takes using multiple vehicles and possibly multiple locations. The photos are still frames that cannot be trusted to tell the truth. The “action” shots involve a tiny number of “ragdolls”, who we can assume are the professional stuntmen.</p>

<p>It’s all quite obvious when you rewatch the videos and keep an eye out for these anomalies. Fortunately others have done that for you and even gone to the trouble of highlighting them, see link in my previous reply.</p>

<p>The wide contrasting black strip straight down the middle of the hood. One moment it’s there, the next it’s gone. Check all the various shots and photos to see it appear, disappear, reappear. That alone was enough for me to prove at least two ‘perp’ cars were involved, which means the event was staged. The rest fell naturally into place after proving the car was a prop.</p>

<p>These hoax video commentators tend to exaggerate a bit, yes. Try not to let that sway what your own eyes see.</p>

<p>I see directors, and I see people responding to their directions. I did a couple of stints as a crowd extra when I was a student and this was exactly how we were directed, using signals from planted directors embedded in the group. Everyone is 1. looking at these individuals waving their arms, and then 2. doing as instructed by 3. total strangers 4. immediately following a car accident? Why is the crowd acting in such unison in such a chaotic environment? Is it because the crowd alll appointee these people as their leaders in the heat of the moment? Or is it because these people are directing their movements?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll need you to prove that too me. I just gooogled &quot;Charlottesville black car stripe&quot; and all of the pictures of the front of the car show it. Again, I think it&#39;s funny that you think these people could pull this event off with 99% of America believing it but they forgot to have a big black stripe on one car. </p>

<p>The crowd wasn&#39;t acting in unison... 7 people moving afternoon someone puts their hands up in a crowd isn&#39;t a crowd moving in unison. That&#39;s the universal signal for &quot;hey person I know, I&#39;m right here, I&#39;m fine!&quot;</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not wasting my time with this anymore. We aren&#39;t going to come to terms on this one. I&#39;m simply of the mind that your viewpoint on this is way too far out there with zero actual evidence. Hard evidence. Have a good one. </p>

<p>And I want a toilet made out of solid gold, but it’s just not in the cards now, is it?</p>

<p>Look for it and you will find it. The problem is this event happened last August. Since then, YouTube has scrubbed most of the compilation videos pointing out these glaring continuity errors and it’s increasingly hard to find alternative sources for them. The memory hole is real.</p>

<p>I’ve given you enough crumbs to look further if you wish, but I’m not about to spend time re-researching the event. I saw more than enough evidence at the time to conclude it was a hoax, like all other mass media division set pieces. If you don’t want to explore an alternative theory, that’s up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’ve demonstrated prejudice and preconceived ideas, instead of an open mind. Not a good start.</p>

<p>I spent days on Charlottesville when the evidence was abundant and easy to find, so don’t tell me you’re done after one day when most of the best material has since disappeared off the mainstream web. It just reveals laziness on your part.</p>

<p>Laziness breeds an entitlement to be spoonfed irrefutable truth in easily digestible portions, but such a quality of evidence for any conspiracy theory rarely exists... if it did, we wouldn’t need to discuss them because the truth would be self evident for all to see.</p>

<p>I gave you enough leads to follow up if <strong>you</strong> want to. If you don’t? I’m cool with that too... do what you want, believe whatever you like. No skin off my nose either way.</p>
