       Eminem sold his soul when he first released The Slim Shady LP under Dr. Dre's wing. It wasn't until his third album (The Eminem Show) that we began hearing him talk about it. In a track titled Say Goodbye Hollywood, he talks about leaving the rap game and ending his deal with the devil in order to raise his daughters properly. This plays a very important role in the theory, but before we discuss it further let me showcase some of the lines from this song. He raps "If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would, to end it for good and say goodbye to Hollywood" then followed by the lines "But now I'm a responsible father so not a lot of good I'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud".  These lines here show that if it wasn't for the existence of his daughter he would've definitely taken his own life by now to get out of the deal. Later on in the song he says "I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it...this is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick", he doesn't want to quit rapping but selling his soul ruined the experience for him. "I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is whack/This is more than I ever could've asked.../I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back/I just wanna leave this game with level head intact". Even though he knows that he has already sold his soul and will forever be a household name, he seems confident that he can get out of the deal.
      </p>

       He released another album, Encore, in 2004, before taking a huge hiatus until 2009. During this time period it is a known fact that he had overdosed and nearly died, which was his reason for taking such a long break. However, what if that never happened and it was just an excuse for his absence? What I believe really happened is that the higher ups in the industry, or whoever he sold his soul to, allowed him to take all those years off to live a normal life with his daughters, in return that after they have grown up he will have to become a puppet of the industry for the remainder of his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main reason for believing this is the song My Darling, released in 2009 on his comeback album after his hiatus. The song depicts a demon coming back to haunt Eminem and basically telling him that break time is over. Em tells the demon "I had you beat!" (he broke out of the deal with the devil) to which the demon responds "No, I was playing possom/Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom/I gave you enough time, your soul's mine/I'm taking it back..." Throughout the song the demon tries to persuade Em to bleach his hair again and get back on stage. After Em rebels against this, the demon threatens to call Dr. Dre. Em shrugs it off, saying he already talked to Dre about this, but to Em's surprise Dre shows up and sides with the demon, showing Dre's complicity in the occult aspect of the industry. At this point, Em tries to shoot himself and end it for good (callback to Say Goodbye Hollywood) but the gunshot to the head does nothing, as the demon explains "You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to/You sold your soul to me, need I remind you?/You remember that night you prayed to God you'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you/This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall". After these lines, we hear Em begin to sing along synonymously with the demon, showing that he has accepted his fate as an industry puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was after this album that Em became the industry puppet that he is today. This is not a political post, but the Eminem that was around back in his prime would not have made a diss track against Donald Trump. Em used to be completely anti-MSM, that's what he became famous for. But after returning from his hiatus, he has completely changed. He used to rap about how brainless and redundant pop singers are, now he works with them on almost every song.

       Selling your soul is a requirement to get big in Hollywood. Combine that with the recent ties to pedophilia and sex slavery in Hollywood and politics, and you realize that there's no "way out". Once they own you, they own you. If you try to get out, they let some of your dirt out and ruin your image.

       Most anyone, if not everyone, in positions of power, wealth, or prestige are most certainly complicit in this broken and evil paradigm. That includes "liberal" actors and social influencers as well as "conservative" bankers and titans of industry.

       I am well aware of Maria's gross, cannabalistic, low-vibrational "art." I am in complete agreement with the idea that our realm is infinitely more sinister and dark than we are led to believe with the Bread and Circuses shoved down our collective throats. My only point with what I wrote is that the "conservative" side of the societal illusion we still operate under is... well... illusory. Both "sides" still feed up to the same demiurge and we normal humans (i.e., livestock) are encouraged to find one side or another and swear our devotion and allegiance.

       Look at the top post on the front page right now.  I guess this whole "false left/right paradigm" thing doesn't apply when people are attacking the right, because I only ever see it when someone talks shit about the left.

       I see that post. I did not write it, nor did I read it, nor did I visit the comments section. Is there something you want me to do or say or opine about the DeVos family?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what I said in relation to the pedophiliac luciferian sickness that permeates Hollywood, DC, and even religious capitals (like the Vatican or Salt Lake) still stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attempting to raise my consciousness and a spiritual kundalini awakening pushed me to realize that the concept of Left and Right are illusory and are manufactured in order to keep peons like you and me sparring on a Subreddit while the rich and powerful continue their horrifying reign of human abuse and trafficking.

       Maybe it's the people who think Eminem sold his soul are the ones who sold their souls. After 9-11, Eminem bucked an oppressive system to criticize the current government -- the George W. Bush White House and the Republican Congress. He did this despite huge pressures on those who would dare to speak out about George W. Bush best exemplified in the Dixie Chicks "bash" and the immediate, total, and permanent disappearance of Dixie Chicks music from the newly formed radio conglomerates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, as is consistent with his dislike of those Republicans then, Eminem disparages your precious Donald Trump. Since the
       <em>
        policies
       </em>
       of Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Republicans generally are pretty much the same -- deregulation of industry, tax cuts for the wealthiest, massive government spying, military build up, etc., and even the percentage of the population supporting Republican Donald Trump being well in line with percentages that supported George W. Bush or Mitt Romney.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR NO, Eminem did not sell out. If you opposed George W. Bush and now support Donald Trump, you need a mirror. Maybe there, you'll find the sell out.

       I know is this sub loves the “Luciferian Cultist Elite” theory, and so do I.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s certainly a lot of shady stuff that sort of points to that possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       But couldn’t “selling your soul” be like a euphemism for selling it to
       <em>
        Hollywood
       </em>
       (the Devil)?
Like going all in, no looking back, your life as you know it will never be the same, and once you get to a certain point you literally can’t go back to a life before fame. This lifestyle takes you away from human nature, you are not experiencing what everyone else is, your soul is corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, obviously not everybody in Hollywood is a fetus eating rapist, but I think to obtain the level of success (however one defines it) you’d have to sell your soul to something. Material wealth does not make itself.

       Its your brain and nervous system. They can "map" anything using your brain. Feel sex... Mapped... Can't feel sex anymore. They cancmakebit tobwhere you can't evennread anymore. Control your eyeballs... Just like a puppet. Losing your soul isblosing the ability to feel anything through digital mapping on an atomic level. Just like a computer. They even change your veins... In not kidding you, itsbhappened to me. I was supposed tovbecome a singer but one ofbthese demons destroyed my chances. They do exist and I hear them daily. If Ibfeel good they'll trybto makebmebfeel bad using their mapping (can also cause pain on command, and can give you super orgasms etc...) they can make your whole body "cum"  like your a giant penis or something. That's only for their friends though.

       I mean if the demons were in control of your nervous system would they not just prevent you from "exposing" them? The nature of paranoia leads you to twist situations and circumstances to fit the plot your subconscious has created, you are not being mass downvoted by a legion of devil worshippers, you are being downvoted because the incoherency of your post. I truly hope you find peace of mind and I agree with the above poster that you may need to seek professional help.

       I think they want me to tell people about it. It's hard to explain it though because there is so much information. I'm not the only one who has told people stuff like this. Most can't because they serve someone. I don't think I serve anyone, I just have their little techno demon dogs all around me all day.

       What you described is electrical impulses controlling your cognitive functions, like blinking, feeling pain, making your fingers move, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesnt explain where thought originates.  Where your ''experience'' is stored, or how its stored.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it all had to do with electrical activity, then we could live forever by putting our brain in a jar, and having a machine that electrically interacts with the submerged brain.

       If they did, it would come across as a jumbled signal of thoughts, emotions, feelings, random color/light intensities, etc.  The way our brain processes the real world around us, we get a whole coherent picture, where every part of our body is being stimulated at once by the surrounding environment, and our thoughts and feelings match up with that, as well as what we see, hear, and smell...
      </p>
      <p>
       Electrifying a brain in certain regions would not produce a visual picture in our visual cortex, as well as make us feel like we're inside of a body, hearing, seeing, and smelling things around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may be able to recreate certain impulses individually, but at the current point in time, it would be impossible to successfully model even one single moment of reality as a coherent picture like we see in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is the technology not there, but our understanding of how the brain functions is nowhere near where it needs to be.  There are actual neuroscientists who believe consciousness is a product of electrical activity in the brain............thats not how consciousness works.

       That’s a great question! I don’t know if anyone
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       knows. “The spiritual or immaterial part of a human being or animal, regarded as immortal”, would be the definition. But I’ve heard a lot of different additions to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if your soul is immortal, and you make a pact with some outside entity for the benefit of this
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       body, lifetime, and worldly possessions, you’ve fucked up. Because your soul will continue once the vessel dies, and nobody really knows what’s gonna happen after that lol.

       Is this sarcasm?
I’m not saying this isn’t a possibility, but there is no way
       <em>
        everyone

       in the spotlight has “sold their soul”.

       I was thinking that as well but what about all the people in Hollywood that spoke about signing things in blood? About not being able to quit? Also the Freemason blood oaths? It really does all seem really occultic. Also Lady Gaga said some shit where she said a demon was following her and she couldn't sleep. And who did she have dinner with? Marina Ambramovic. Wtf? All types of freaky shit is involved with Hollywood and at this point I wouldn't be shocked if the devil was real.

       I really hope I’m not seeming dismissive, I’m not, I’m just trying to look at it from a neutral point of view.
Admittedly I haven’t heard of that, signing in blood.
Maybe another metaphor? I’ve heard it used before when you sign an extremely binding contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows what’s involved which that, you are basically ascending to a level of living that is unheard of for most of the world. If there really are puppeteers or dark forces pulling strings, I’m sure access to the ‘club’ is extremely strict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely a lot of strange pieces to this puzzle for sure.
I mean, I struggle with night terrors and insomnia, I’ve often seen (or though to have) things following me. Most often a shadow like serpent that nests above my bedroom door. But I attribute that to sleep deprivation (I’ve had many hallucinations due to no sleep lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised either. It would certainly make more sense to think the bad people in the world (some) are corrupted by forces beyond our capability. Rather than just truly evil and vile for no reason. I suppose a strong enough belief is just as effective as the real thing, though.
      </p>

       My favorite topic to discuss! I’ll have to look into the blood oaths!

       You don't seem dismissive and looking at it from a neutral point is a good thing. I always try to do that but with the amount of time I spent looking into this topic I feel like it's darker than just a euphemism.
      </p>
      <p>
       On YouTube (maybe not anymore) there was a long documentary with loads of clips from artists claiming they sold their souls/ signed contracts in blood. Lady Gaga, Bob Dylan, Jay-z, Beyoncé, Katy perry and MJ were in it along with a few others. It was pretty creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that if there's a secret club it would be strict. There's probably different levels to it like a hierarchy. 
For most it is hard to believe that humans can be so vile and evil for no reason. I feel like there's always usually a reason though. I feel like it always links back up to this corrupt system.

       No, fuck that. If you want out, you can get out. You won't like living the same lavish lifestyle because the money will enviably stop flowing in, but you'll be out. You won't be the star you used to be, but if you leave and go far away, you can be free. Being a huge star comes with a huge price, and anyone crying over that I have no remorse for

       Or you know hes trying to actually be serious but every word out of his mouth has to be "im rick james bitch" or "fuck your couch". The man has seen some dark shit, yet he could be standing on stage say this isnt a joke I shot a man to get my show and every major star is locked into their roles and when someone steps out of line they get destroyed.

       First off, the slim shady em would have definitely made a trump dis track, it just probably would have been funnier.  Secondly, no one is “selling their souls”, it’s just how record deals work.  Third, people grow and mature.  Em made his career ripping on pop culture, but that doesn’t mean that he isn’t allowed to change his sound or subject matter.  If he was still the same as his first album, people would be bitching that he never evolved.

       Exactly. To say that a grown man from the ages of 27 to now, like 40 or whatever, was never in control of his career or life decisions and was a puppet of a few music producers and industry executives is borderline insane... what did they write his rhymes too? Like give him a script? Lol, that was all him, all his words... lol

       They could have been best friends for all it matters, the man has no real policy other than dismantle the country and he's itching to get us to war at every opportunity. That's leagues away from "rich guy known for being rich".

       My interpretation of My Darling is that the demon is a personal one. It’s the one associated with fame that brings out the worst in Marshall because he becomes Slim Shady/Eminem
      </p>
      <p>
       His gimmick was a focal point of his early in his career. Quirky, drugged up white boy that obscenely raps about pop culture and tests censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Real slim shady” called attention to the gimmick and how labels and artists were trying to recreate the success he had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marshall started Shady records and made more than enough money to take the extended break from music.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he’s clearly outgrown the gimmick. The song is about his fame monster and those around him wanting him to return to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he truly was being used as an industry puppet I think they would have him return to the gimmick to milk the cash cow until there’s no more.

       This is what it is.  People want the old "ill take all the drugs, fuck your wife and tell a story about kidnapping and murder" Eminem back.  Exactly what you said, he has outgrown that.  It's no different than gangsta rappers that "made it."  Once they are rich, no longer living in poverty, they cant really rap and tell stories about it any longer.

       Besides the well stated general points about gimmickry and maturity discussion above, this whole idea seems ridiculous:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the Eminem that was around back in his prime would not have made a diss track against Donald Trump
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe it's the people who think Eminem sold his soul are the ones who sold their souls. After 9-11, Eminem bucked an oppressive system to criticize the current government -- the George W. Bush White House and the Republican Congress. He did this despite huge pressures on those who would dare to speak out about George W. Bush best exemplified in the Dixie Chicks "bash" and the immediate, total, and permanent disappearance of Dixie Chicks music from the newly formed radio conglomerates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, as is consistent with his dislike of those Republicans then, Eminem disparages precious Donald Trump. The
       <em>
        policies
       </em>
       of Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Republicans generally are pretty much the same -- deregulation of industry, tax cuts for the wealthiest, massive government spying, military build up, etc., and even the percentage of the population supporting Republican Donald Trump being well in line with percentages that supported George W. Bush or Mitt Romney.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR NO, Eminem did not sell out. If you opposed George W. Bush and now support Donald Trump, you need a mirror. Maybe there, you'll find the sell out.

       The picture of her with Eminem blew up in the past 24 hours. Long story short she has connections to the Elites who participate in satanic rituals. The Chandler/Eminem stuff is blowing up on Twitter. The Ray Chandler instagram was just made private.

       The other side of the coin about selling your soul to get big in Hollywood is once you get to that level of fame you cant un do it. The Eagles Hotel California is all about it.  Friends, family and society will now see and treat you differently, your life is forever altered.

       I think the devil is a construct and youve twisted what is one of the premeir examples of an artists best work being held hostage by his labels in an effort (blackmail) to make him more marketable.

       Eminem was fucked over by the 'rap game'/industry maybe worse than any other hip hop artist... and you blame the devil.

       As a fan of conspiracys, i do my best to try and add context when i have info on particular conspiracys. I only respond 2x per, make it obvious the second is last so they can finish (themselves) off with a bang, and it eases any responsibilities or spending too much time on say, providing evidence of labels asking certain artists to stop pretending to kill their families on very popular records as well as its relation to 4.5 years of missing/unpublished recordings during the height of an artists career... and you know, the devil. I do it for the readers of this sub.

       So are you saying it’s physically impossible to be both anti-msm and Anti-trump at the same time? I don’t understand how you think he would have never made a dis track against trump in his prime when he took numerous shots at W. Bush all throughout his prime? This whole “oh you don’t like trump, you must be sucking the MSM tit” is getting old.... believe it or not people can not like trump because he is just a shitty President, their opinion of msm is an entirely different issue and the two beliefs can coexist just fine..... I don’t like trump and I hate msm, it’s not hard to dislike both....
      </p>
      <p>
       it’s like saying everyone who didn’t like obama or Clinton must have be brainwashed by the far-right media..... that just doesn’t make sense and takes away the value of someone’s personal opinion by basically treating it like it couldn’t possibly be their own opinion..... I mean it’s basically the adult version of putting fingers in your ears and pretending you can’t hear them

       He was openly friends with Trump back in 2004. He was also anti establishment.  My point is, his entire view on the MSM shifted after 2009. For someone who was so bashed by the media as Eminem, you'd think he wouldn't give in to the lies the MSM spews about Trump being literally Hitler.

       Again your mixing his views of the media and his views of trump, why does he have to give into anything? Why can’t he be a normal human being with eyes and ears that can make opinions for himself? Why does his view of trump have to do anything with his view of msm? You keep linking these but it doesn’t make sense..... do you only like trump because the media doesn’t like him?
      </p>
      <p>
       And trump seems like he was great friends with Hillary before the campaign, does that mean they still like each other now? You’re argument is essentially that if you like someone in one role, than you can’t dislike them in another role? Have you ever had a co-worker that was cool prior to getting a leadership role, than you fucking hated them? But how could you change your opinion if you liked him as a coworker?

       I know this is a winless debate for both of us but trying to claim someone’s views aren’t authentic just because you don’t like them is a very weak argument and easy to see through, “anyone who doesn’t like trump can’t possibly feel that way on their own, it must be MSM brainwashing that makes them feel that way”...... it’s ignoring the fact that people can just authentically not like trump, it doesn’t have to be tied to MSM at all... the only reason they are being linked like this so often is just because it’s easier for the trump base to deny how bad this dumpster fire really is if they think no one actually dislikes the guy...

       This is an under explored conspiracy around these parts.
       <em>
        Something
       </em>
       happened to Eminem. Not only does he not act natural, he doesn't act and seem human sometimes. After his song and the video for "Most" came out, which alluded to the 9/11 conspiracy, he overdosed and was on hiatus for 5 years. Then he came back and was
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       different. As a huge fan for many years, all I can tell you is that it's a gut instinct thing. I'm wouldn't go all the way out on that limb without having all the facts, but there is just something that does not seem right about him and his whole situation. He has only been seen and/or photographed with his daughter
       <em>
        once
       </em>
       since 2009.

       You are making a mistake to assume that a religious person is only religious because they are indoctrinated into it. I found God on my own path after being atheist for 20+ years, I am not a slave to God, no one is. You have to look beyond the material realm to find Him.

       What reason do I have to "trick" myself into believing something? How does that work anyway. I can't trick myself into believing there are purple monkeys on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atheists are quite ignorant about why people are Christian. Faith is about putting yourself in God's hands, obeying God and seeking to be closer to God, not "leap of faith" to believe something with no evidence.

       What hypocrisy? Accepting Jesus (and the subsequent baptism with the Holy Spirit) is a transformative spiritual experience. It's not a material thing and can't be understood by material schools of thought, but that doesn't make it less real.

       I agree with your assessment.  Eminem would diss anyone or any group that was loved and adored.  He would have called out the PC culture, Muslims, gays, Obama, Trump, Clinton.  He has done this in pieces but not like in the past.

       This is a very good write-up. I was thinking of doing something similar about Jay-Z’s verse on Kanye West’s song Monster, as I believe it has similar occult undertones. I didn’t think it would be received very well here but maybe I was wrong.

       I think the Slim Shady LP and Marshall Mathews LP are amazing classics but after that Eminem begins to fall off. His next couple releases at least still sound similar but I'm of the opinion he was replaced with a clone/body double more recently. I know there are some pretty solid theories about this involving Avril Lavigne, I also believe Paul McCartney was replaced in 1965.

       Eminem was always an industry puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time he came out, gangster rap had exploded in mainstream culture. Something like 75% of NWA's records were bought by white kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eminem, like the Beastie Boys in the 80s, was a gateway for suburban white kids to feel ok about liking what is typically seen as 'black music'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr Dre isn't the devil, he's just a useful idiot who helped the major labels infiltrate and take over the underground rap scene. Behind him, Jimmy Iovine has always been the brains of their operation and above that is labels like Def Jam which is owned by Universal Music, which is owned by Vivendi, from France.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billionaires own the music industry. Between the late 80s and early 90s, they conspired to destroy or overtake the independent music industry. Old School 80s rap was socially conscious, politically active, and combined with other underground genres like punk rock &amp; metal, it would have been a force to reckon with, which is why it was subversively taken over.

       Music Industry. Emphasis on the Industry part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can make music. How you distribute it is the major thing. If you have no way to sell or market your music, you make no money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the late 70s, punk rock came out as a short lived trend. This inspired a bunch of kids to make their own music and distribute it themselves and start their own labels. The DIY independent music scene developed internationally as a result.

       Due to networking between small labels, bands, venues, promoters, independent record stores, and fans, it started growing and by the late 80s, became fairly popular. Top 40 music was fairly awful and independent music gave people an alternative to mainstream major label music.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Alternative' music was actually named because it's an alternative to mainstream music, not because of it's 'counter-culture' image. That was mostly just a label attached to indie bands after big box stores were allowed to sell independent music.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Parental Advisory warning labels were put on music albums, that whole thing was an industry scam to peddle 'smut' to kids, and to undermine the indie music scene by taking over distribution. Big box stores didn't sell indie music which was loaded with swears and violent imagery so the major labels couldn't distribute it unless they put the warning labels on the albums.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even got Jello Biafra, the lead singer of the Dead Kennedy's and owner of the Alternative Tentacles record label to go on Oprah defending them even though they were trying to muscle in on the stuff him and others had built.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since like 1992 the music industry has been pretty much owned by the big labels who just buy out any competition because they own all the modes of distribution and have more abilities to market their artists than any indie band could ever do on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, there's the internet but that's still a limited market. The majors have access to tv, radio, movies, billboards, internet, you name it. They can promote a bag of dicks and make it famous if they really wanted.

       Liberal left would be someone who agrees with everything I said first, but disagrees with everything I said last. There is definitely such a thing as the liberal left. It's when you've gone so far off the deep end you're literally brainwashed; so your last sentence was 100% right.

       You've put your finger on the problem. Ever since the rise of
       <em>
        Fox News
       </em>
       , everyone has a different understanding of the words -- so different, that we are not even communicating anymore. It's amazing how one little oligarch network can so effectively
       <em>
        brainwash
       </em>
       so many people. We did not speak in most of these terms before 1996. Sure, a few fringe reactionaries did, but they were widely dismissed (and for good reason, but that's a whole other commentary). Your understanding is as good I suppose (or more accurately as bad) as some of the others I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then we need to throw the language in the garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are, most likely, is called "moderate" -- and a strange one at that, as everything on your list that would not be liberal comes directly from recent Republican propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go back as far as the Ronald Reagan years for a better understanding of these words:
      </p>
      <p>
       Leftist -- communist or socialist entities like Daniel Ortega, Fidel Castro or the Sandanistas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rightist -- authoritarian powerful dictators like Idi Amin, Francisco Franco, or Adolf Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal -- those favoring government regulation and programs for people, and those tolerant of diverse ethnicities or religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservative -- those favoring large businesses and wealthy people, and those not tolerant of diversity.

       That's an absurdly powerful, ungrounded statement to make, and even a nonreligious person like myself should be able to recognize that. I agree with your premise, but your conclusion that "the devil isn't real," is non sequitur at best.*  Even if
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       forms of the devil actually do exist, your account does not take into consideration the existence of the concept of the Devil in the minds of, often influencial, men. Who's to say that Marshall Mathers doesn't honestly believe that he has sold his soul (or, moral and creative integrity) to the likes of Lucifer, Satan, Baal, Osiris/Isis, Moloch, and their respective church/es?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In case the reader questions my use of "non sequitur", Wikipedia *currently
       </em>
       defines/describes it by stating, "Often, in fact, 'non sequitur' is used when an irrelevancy is showing up in the conclusion. It is the act of introducing a neutral topic to divert attention away from the main topic of discussion."

       The devil is a metaphor for people in power.  That is who controls artists like Eminem.  The biblical paradigm of god x the devil is really just the goodness of man vs the darkness of man.  Seems like theres a lot more dark these days.

       You can just tell he's grasping on to his fame rn. I mean yeah, his thing was always questioning government, constant lines against Clinton and parents who allow their kids to watch violent movies then blame rappers for violence and drugs, etc. but he has completely flipped from claiming that him being white was holding him back. Now he claims that him being white has helped him. It does get pretty annoying when he goes from making fun of Vanilla Ice and Backstreet Boys and is now working with Ed Sheeran, Pink, and Beyonce (which honestly those songs are the best ones on this album). His holier than thou attitude is really annoying considering he said, "Fuck that take drugs, rape sluts, make fun of gay clubs, men who wear makeup, get aware wake up. Get a sense of humor." I will admit I like some of his newer songs. I may not agree with them but some of the lines are good and I still like that at least he's talking about raping people and kidnapping Ivanka Trump lol.
      </p>

       I still think he's actually gay tho

       I'm from Michigan. I loved it back in 2000 (Eminem). I hope he can start to see there's a bit bigger of a picture than politics. I think he really believes what he says. Not sure if the Devil is involved.

       On a side note, saw Kid Rock in Vegas recently and noticed a lot of devil horn gestures over his head. Love Kid Rock. Could just be a rock thing, or possibly a bit more. Hmmm..

       In this case, I have NO REMORSE for these people. They received their reward in full. Unless they repent and FULL COMMIT to a life in Christ, as in become someone who preaches, I might change my mind.

       Its from a movie called Da Hip Hop Witch. Basically, some guy with connections to the rap industry made a parody of The Blair Witch Project and got a bunch of rappers to make up random crap about how a witch molested them. I have it on DVD and it sucks.

       I hope you enjoy it, man! I used to seek out these type of movies too - this was the worst I ever found. It does make me laugh thinking back on some of the stuff in it, it's so ridiculous.

       Shit, why not? Seems plausible to me. They certainly do have a long history of using "art" to tell us the truth. I'm told it's part of how their "magic" works. Something about needing our consent for their spells to work against us, and that telling us what they're doing implies consent.

       100% disagree, to the point where I was laughing at this. He just grew, like all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in his case,  there's a bigger problem that followed, if he wants to stay relevant instead of fading into obscurity, because it means he's got to keep associating with people less and less mature than him. Teen/Rap angst is not very satisfying for those approaching the days of being senior citizens.

       Those songs definitely creep me out. Hollywood has made me feel torn between believing the devil exists or the industry is so messed up that it's a euphemism. With all the things I've been reading I believe it really is the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many artists spoke about this. Some even spoke about them signing a contract in their own blood. I believe once you sign over there really is no quitting and they're puppets from then on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also reading about how when people enter freemasonry they have to give a blood oath.

       The devil is all around you in the messed up stuff we do to each other. The rap world and other music and entertainment realms USE that messed up stuff to fuel further feelings of superiority and disconnection from each other. Him knowing deep down that we should love our neighbor, him even being near rap or any Hollywood stuff was a metaphorical selling of the soul. This man is enlightened enough to know he's hurt people in the past.

       Interesting theory, but I think the 'demon' represents his addictions to the fame, money, and drugs he has when he's in the rap game, versus the responsibilities of real life raising a daughter. Although it is sad seeing that Trump diss, and knowing the old slim shady is dead and buried.

       Honestly, I think he just got older and changed. He sort of surrounded himself with yes men and Hollywood types, had a drug addiction and just fell off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went back and listened to his earlier albums not long ago and they are classics, but how much of that is down to it being reminiscent of childhood and for many their first taste of hip hop I don't know. Now I kind of feel he is overrated and was just a stereotypical product of the 90's and OHMG SHOCKING stuff.

       I credit him with getting me into hip hop when I was a teen and have been heavily into hip hop since, but aside from going back to listen to his older stuff after Revival dropped as a comparison, I've literally never bumped his stuff by choice, especially like I would other classics and 90's era stuff. I think that's most telling for me personally.

       You can't sell your soul to the devil. Your soul belongs to God. The devil can certainly trick you into believing you've permenantly sold your soul to him, to distance you further from God, but it is deception. As long as you are alive, you can repent and Jesus will forgive you. There are only two unforgivable sins, taking the mark of the beast, or blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. "selling your soul to the devil" isn't on that list, though it can still be figuratively done.

       This made me laugh! Of all the pills and drugs he raps about, it’s TYLENOL, that he will use to evade the fucking devil. Between the mama issues and drug use and white boy pride, Eminem’s life seems ridiculous and I don’t feel bad for him in the least bit
