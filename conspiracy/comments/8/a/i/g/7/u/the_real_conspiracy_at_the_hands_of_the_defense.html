      <p>
       People say that "Defense" spending was reduced under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but that's not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        <em>
         rate of increase
        </em>
       </strong>
       was reduced, but "Defense" spending still increased, just at a slower rate of increase.  So instead of increasing from, say 10 to 12 dollars, it increased from 10 to 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Defense" spending was not
       <strong>
        reduced
       </strong>
       under Bill Clinton, and certainly not under President Obama who stoked and inflamed the Afghanistan War, pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq and sending them in droves to Afghanistan (but even Obama left 10,000 American troops in America's Iraq "embassy" which was really a large military compound).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama rekindled the Afghanistan War in a major way unfortunately.  He substituted the Afghanistan War for the Iraq War, but years later, of course, he even sent more troops into Iraq again to supposedly combat ISIS.  Obama certainly made for a better President than his challengers John McCain and Mitt Romney would have, but still Obama came up very short in protecting the American People from the "Defense" lobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton also did
       <strong>
        not reduce
       </strong>
       "defense" spending.  The best Bill Clinton did was keep "defense" spending the same from one year to the next -- in other words he didn't increase "defense" spending or lower it, but kept it at the same level for consecutive years, but I believe that happened only once or twice in his 8-year presidency.  Bill Clinton should be commended for being able to do even that, because the "Defense" companies and the CIA were incensed, extremely riled, majorly perturbed -- you saw that Clinton faced impeachment,
       <strong>
        and the real reason was not his involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For most other years, Clinton just reduced its rate of increase, but defense spending still increased, just at a slower rate of increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       In real dollars, you can say "Defense" spending was "lowered" for a couple years when Bill Clinton was able to keep it at the same level from one year to the next, but only because of the effect of inflation which was running about 5 percent a year then.  So in real, inflation-adjusted dollars you can say "Defense" spending saw a 5 percent decline when spending was kept at the exact same level for 2 or 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, unlike the bought-for Democrats and bought-for Republicans, the Green Party is calling for a 50 percent cut in so-called "Defense" spending.  And the Democrats and Republicans did everything they could to prohibit Doctor Jill Stein of the Green Party from participating in the televised debates in 2016 and 2012, just as they kept Ralph Nader out of the TV debates in 2000 and 2004 when the very-well-known Nader was running as a Green.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually cutting the "defense" budget is anathema to the Democratic and Republican
       <strong>
        <em>
         "Parties."
        </em>
       </strong>
       And Presidents know they will face impeachment if they try.  The "Defense" companies are having a decades-long
       <strong>
        <em>
         massive party
        </em>
       </strong>
       on our dime, on the strained backs of the American tax payer since the early 1950s.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all of American history, only Bill Clinton and President Andrew Johnson 130 years earlier have ever been impeached (Nixon came close, but resigned before impeachment proceedings would begin.)  The House's impeachment articles led to a trial in the Senate for Clinton where he was acquitted.  50 Senators voted to remove Clinton from office but 67 votes (a two-thirds majority) was needed for conviction and removal.

       Ah I remember when lying about a relationship was as salacious as it ever got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your evidence might be circumstantial but the constantly inflating defense budget is definitely being encouraged directly by those companies that benefit the most from weapon production.

       It's all about that "Project for a new American century." any politician that tries to tamper with the "world domination" budget gets character assassinated pretty quickly.

       Then it stands to reason a high proportion of politicians should have characters that are both (A) assassinatable (B) assassinated. But I don't think that's the case, is it?

       Let's take the senate. That's 100 politicians in office at any given time. Pick any point in time and name the ones who have characters that have been assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am arguing that mere character assassination cannot account for the phenomenon we see. An important correlate is my contention that Americans elect electable candidates. The campaigning cycle almost insures that IF they have "assassinatable" characters before election, they will usually get weeded out. This despite both money corruption and sex-scandals of any dimension. IF they are controlled by character assassination, and only a few actually get assassinated that way, we would have to assume that EITHER the majority are clean, because they clearly are not getting character assassinated, OR the majority are criminals and frauds who look out for each other to the extent of covering crimes (which could assassinate left and right) AND the majority of voters and party-members are likewise seriously deluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's a complicated line of reasoning, but it's meant in the way one might argue that Flat Earth cannot be true because a vast majority of astronomers have no interest in pretending. A vast number of politicians also appear to have no compelling interest in exposing themselves to potential penalties by leading "character assasinatable" lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hunch is something else, and it goes like this. New politicians that come into office receive a bunch of briefings. In these briefings they are told certain things that make them act the way they do - and what they are told is convincing without blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might be disappointed in my grand finale, but as a conspiracy theorist you shouldn't be. If we look closely at the actions of the political class for at least 20 and maybe 40-50 years, I'll just say this: whatever they are getting briefings on is UN-REPEATABLE. Our job is to repeat the things that MAYBE those briefings of otherwise clean politicians include. It also gives us a lot of freedom, not to know. If we knew for sure we would have to keep it to ourselves, or face quite considerably bad consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant-worthy retort - sometimes you get the whole 10 yards.

       Edit2: What about the obvious criminality of the Bush-Clinton regime? Glad you asked. Have you noticed that the inherent personal qualities of presidential candidates has descended since the days of Eisenhower and Kennedy? Nobody wants the job. We have to "pay" people to do it. Hint hint.

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/83ca6a/the_fbi_deliberately_misled_the_public_in_its/">
        post about the 2001 anthrax attacks
       </a>
       , that multiple members of PNAC showed foreknowledge of the anthrax attacks that happened a few weeks after 9/11. First the attacks were blamed on Al Qaeda and Iraq, but then tests showed the anthrax came from US labs, so the FBI publicly targeted "lone wolf" bioweapons workers. The first  "person of interest" to the FBI, Stephen Hatfill, turned out to be innocent and won 5.6The second, Bruce Ivins, "committed suicide" before he was formally charged. They shut the case for good, claiming Ivins was the anthrax killer, but his co-workers and anyone who has really looked at the case is skeptical. Even though officially, nobody had any knowledge that America might be hit with anthrax letter attacks until the first death on Oct 5th 2001, PNAC member James Woolsey had taken part in a June 2001 drill, Operation Dark Winter, whose

       It would be interesting to see a list of Presidents who have faced impeachment proceedings and compare that to a list of Presidents that have proposed budgets which reduce defense spending.

       Please do so. I believe Carter lowered defense budgets - the Vietnam war was over, etc. He was not impeached, and may indeed have been the last president who was unimpeachable.

       President Carter even tho he helped the Soviet Afghan conflict along, didn't do much for the mainstream MIC, hence the smears and the thing with the rabbit, no second term for Jimmy.

        A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...
       </p>
       <p>
        This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.

       I always found it crazy how opposed people are to removing a cent from the National Defense budget, as if the US would be invaded immediately if it's budget shrunk by 1%. Despite still outfunding the last 5 major military powers.

       So true. And ironically enough, there is no definitive, without a doubt, 100% assurance, that our military is even the 'best' show of force. What it boils down to, is that war, for a select few, is immensely profitable; The money generated through the Department of Defense, which, surely, closes in on $600 billion. (With Trumps pursuit of expanding military spending.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Wild. It truly is unimaginable, to think of getting the appropriate funding for cities/states. With the benefit of schools, hospitals, roadways, forms of acessible public  transportation, modernized technologies, telecommunications, water supply, electrical grids and so on. Instead, we get the absolute minimum to maintain complacency and ultimately, through tax payers eyes,  it seems we are slaves to major corporations.

       The impeachment thing is stretch. It’s the voters who demand this. It’s a losing strategy to run as a candidate easily portrayed as “weak” on national security. See also: running as a candidate who is “soft” on crime.

       Bro, did you just completely ignore the link I posted? It shows the history of defense spending by year. Spending did not decrease under Clinton. Spending did decrease under obama, for 3 if the 8 years he was president

       Personally, this sub needs more people with a working brain. People who don’t instantly accept or reject what they read. People who can do a simple google search and come back with information to add. Clearly you couldn’t do any of that, so you stoop to the lowest of low, insults. You think that helps you win your arguments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of calling op a dumbass, you should have presented counter arguments, with sources. You failed to do that so you’re no different than the OP you’re calling out.

       Now you're being rude.  Your statistics don't show that Bill Clinton reduced "defense" spending, even though I'm sure he wanted to.  The stats do show "defense" spending declining after Obama's 2011 "withdrawal" from Iraq (not a complete withdrawal because Obama left 10,000 U.S. troops in the Iraqi embassy compound, but that's better than the 160,000 or so that had been there years before).

       Well yeah, I am to stupid or dishonest people who spread bullshit either intentionally or just because they can't be bothered to do a simple Google search to verify easily verifiable fact and then wrote up a long ass post to pretend as if they know anything they wrote about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you just followed the Google link I gave you in the other post you would find out that it was reduced under Clinton and Carter as well. Or just look at that chart in the Wikipedia page, for fuck's sake.

       Once again you're amazingly rude.  I followed both links.  The one-tenth of one percent decline in 1996 ( .001 decline ) is almost certainly not a decline when you take into account the "defense" money that also was spent for "defense" in the
       <strong>
        Department of Energy
       </strong>
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       when you add in the interest paid on the debt that is Defense-related interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       As former
       <strong>
        Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
       </strong>
       Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has stated, you have to take into account all the following Departments when calculating total "Defense" spending each year:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) The Defense Department
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) defense-related spending in The Energy Department
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) defense-related spending in the Department of Homeland Security
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) Interest paid on the National Debt that is defense-related
      </p>
      <p>
       and several other departments like the Department of Veterans Affairs.

       Bill Clinton​ became president in Jan 1993. If you followed the Google link and looked at any of the results with defence spending that include those years or you just look at the graph in the Wikipedia page, you would find out it declined under him. But you're too busy trying to pretend to know something you have no clue about than actually go and find out the facts.

       ....all the more reason why Bill Clinton faced impeachment.  The "Defense" companies and CIA disapproved of Clinton's
       <strong>
        "peace dividend,"
       </strong>
       which was the money that became available for domestic spending when "Defense" budgets no longer rose by leaps and bounds each year.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know the
       <em>
        peace dividend
       </em>
       was extra money that suddenly became available
       <strong>
        <em>
         domestically
        </em>
       </strong>
       to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, build hospitals, improve schools and education, provide more funding for medical research, etc., etc. (in other words, money spent on
       <strong>
        <em>
         human needs,
        </em>
       </strong>
       instead of money devoted to destructive warfare and the prepartation for destructive warfare).  But no worries, after Bill Clinton left office, his successor President George W. Bush quickly remedied the situation.
