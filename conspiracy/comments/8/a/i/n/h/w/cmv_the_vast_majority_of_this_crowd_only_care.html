        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Also I want to make clear I have no interest in debating whether it exists or specifically by who, this is macro view of the subject, not a he said she said slapfight</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been coming to this board for three years, I&#39;ve been on Reddit for 7 years and 4chan for the same. I only say that to prove context to this belief.</p>

<p>While pedophilia is objectively one of the worst sins in humanity, no one refutes that, I believe this board and right-wingers have latched on to it because it typically implicates Hilary Clinton and perceived liberal entertainers. </p>

<p>Not only do I believe that, but for all these individuals who supposedly care so deeply, I don&#39;t see anybody tangibly doing anything about it. I&#39;ve seen a few alt-right marches and rallies in the UK and US but those were shams to make a bigger conservative point (anti Muslim mainly). For example there are quite a few members of the US House taking action (Rep Wagner) to directly combat sex trafficking, but yet I never see pro-action continued coverage or attention to causes that is not comingled with a bigger point (typically anti Hillary or Democrat). Even though I detest the posters and rules, I frequently window shop on t_d to have a full view of things and the same stands.</p>

<p>I am positive there are a few examples here and there, but this board has pizzagate/pedo posts fill up at least 1/4 of the board for the past 2 years (and I know the nature of this board isn&#39;t to promote solutions) but observing a large amount of right wing social media I wholly stand by this point. </p>

<p>I say this as someone who worked in a clinic years back in law school who had to deal with this stuff directly. Im in no way a white knight but its disgusting to me that this issue is used to score points and not even a sliver of people here promote causes or take an overt action to do anything outside of tarnish those who are politically opposite. So change my view that even a tenth of the energy and attention concocting theories and suspects and supposed evidence goes towards anything positive or to remedy and better the situation.</p>

<p>TL;Dr: The obsession with pedo rings is disgusting in that it&#39;s purely to further a political view of an objectively grotesque crime. The right puts so much energy in it for political points against the Democratic establishment and liberal media personalities.</p>

<p>And anybody who disagrees with the legitimacy of Pizzagate is immediately labeled a &quot;pedo defender&quot; to slander them. I should know, it was done to me yesterday. </p>

I know this because I saw the literature they were handing out and the message they made, and practically none of it was promoting individuals against sex trafficking or places to donate for organizations that are combating this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue pizzagate blew up so much,  because it actually crossed party lines, connects with many previous stories coming from both parties of scandals involving children being abused by the elite of the party. For real, one of the center points of pizzagate was the epstein connection, which implicated hillary/bill Clinton as well as donald trump, as passengers on epsteins pedo plane. NEITHER party is fit to serve IMO , but I&#39;m not American so that&#39;s for ya &#39; ll.  To decide, as a observer it just looks like unbridled chaos in your country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think pizzagate 100% is a valid theory. I&#39;m not in the least bit denying it could be true. However, its gone from emails released 18 months ago and thereafter uncovered interviews and pictures, to a rallying cry that only shows up to sling allegations and not actually mobilize to help anything. </p>

<p>At least the NRA and emilys list have concoted formulas to explain how well politicians support a cause and distribute that to individuals who care, there is no such thing and not even an inkling of interest in doing so. I rattled off a US rep in my original post who does work on the issue and that is something I know off hand because not only do I try and keep up with the developments of uncovering pedos, but I also want to proactively do something to reduce and eliminate victims. Its honestly gross to me to see so so many people who just want to score points and walk away from the topic when it comes to taking some type of action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, I don&#39;t care about connecting Pizzagate to any political view I may have, that&#39;s clearly not focusing on what is in front of us. What concerned me and keeps concerning me is that there are people who are sexually taking advantage of children and obviously are not being punished in any way.</p>

<p>The scandal broke a long time ago and our fellow conspiracy theorists (I really shouldn&#39;t even say conspiracy because at this point it&#39;s pretty damn factual but we are in r/conspiracy) are on the case 24/7 it seems but we still have a thread somewhere around here with a picture from James Alefantis&#39;s private instagram showing his followers requesting that he get back to pictures of children.</p>

<p>And talking about something being done, protests, walks, marches etc. can happen but the media is going to twist it so hard that the original purpose is going to be lost to the mass public tuning in. Think about if there&#39;s people marching the streets, the media is going to turn around and say it&#39;s a mass riot or something.</p>

<p>The best thing we can do is what we were doing which was spreading this all over the web, but I do admit that has been losing traction. I really don&#39;t think that was entirely our fault though as Twitter, Youtube, Facebook and even Google have been scrubbing everything that even hints at the truth. All I&#39;m saying is that if were to show America what&#39;s really been happening, it&#39;s going to take some kind of a civil war that we&#39;ve never seen before and to be honest I&#39;m not sure people are ready for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you. I replied to about 15 other replies and this is by far the most thoughtful one.</p>

<p>My whole point was that it is universally accepted that pedos are literally the worst &quot;humans&quot; on this earth. No one is denying that, I&#39;m not saying in the absence of Podesta these same people would suddenly not be against pedos. But to me its sick that people who would care either way put all the effort into connecting dots and spreading their theories and then absolutely no effort into doing anything about it. Like even texting 99770 to red cross to donate $5 I would consider something, but for all the chatter I see constantly, maybe 5% of time and effort is spent promoting anything to do with  helping past or future victims. </p>

<p>My bold text was to reinforce that I&#39;m not in the least bit saying anyone ever implicated is innocent, or that talking about it is only the result of partisanship. I literaly know first hand it happens, to this day I will never get the imagery and affect it has on someone out of my head, I&#39;m not trying to dissuade anyone anywhere from trying to hold perps accountable. </p>

<p>Sorry for that mini rant, but otherwise I wholly agree with you and appreciate your response. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing over which side has it worse. This has nothing to do with Liberals. Im not even implicitly endorsing them by making this point, this only has to do with one specific group of people on one specific issue. Go ahead and trash the left if you think that is going to trigger me, thats not my point in the least bit. Hand on the bible strike me dead, if any of this is true I pledge to volunteer whatever resources I have to help the victims. I&#39;m in no way trying to refute that its true, my point and post plainly state that the level of attention and time given to this topic is grossly out of line with that of solutions, causes, individuals who are working to help it. I 100% believe that those who bring the subject up are against pedos, but are they spending so much time and attention to it to score points and then forget about it when it comes to giving money, time, or even support to things helping it? I firmly believe so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yep. B-b-but he went to law school?? Doesn’t that make him smarter and naturally right about everything? Shooot.. If only I went to that march in the streets earlier this month. To make the big difference this country needs. More mindless chants and “Trump is Hitler” written on signs that I carry around to show how virtuous I am.</p>

<p>The problem a lot of right wingers have is they are probably afraid/ think marches and public show of force can only end up bad for them like Charlottesville.
Antifa will show up. The news will get their faces and threaten their workplaces with Nazi racism threats. And for what? So dumbass Republican leadership Mitch McConnel and Paul Ryan can ignore more of what the Conservative party wants? I think it’s quite foolish.. but at least the Democrats listen to the fringe Left. Democrat leadership has moved the party left while the Republicans ignore their voters and Trump for the most part.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying alt-right are the only ones who do wrong. I&#39;m not saying theyre inferior to SJW because they do this. I&#39;m not saying they only care because they can put a partisan spin on it. You&#39;re assuming all of those things and getting defensive as a result. I&#39;m saying for all the attention it gets, the amount of effort put in to helping or bettering the situation is insanely low. There are dozens of causes I could rattle off that left, right, and all else claim to care about and actively present solutions, causes, charities, and individuals who are working to fight the situation. This is not one of them. I rattled off the name of a US rep that I know off-hand to have sponsored a bill on trafficking. I&#39;m sure quite a few individuals involved deeply care about the situation, but there are still a large number who see it as a political point and that to me is disgusting. Liberals do it with race, christians do it with marriage, everyone does it, my point isnt that this is the only time it happens. </p>

<p>No one, ever, at any time, can make a straight faced defense for pedophilia, I&#39;m not either, nor am i saying the alt-right pizzagate folks would not be unquestionably against it if it was proven one of their heros did it. My point is its slung around as an allegation (much like liberals do by saying people are racist/bigoted) when they don&#39;t actually do it to help the victim, but to tarnish someone they dont like. </p>

<p>This is not partisan in that I&#39;m saying one side is better because this group peddles the pedophilia angle. I could go on and on about dozens of issues every major grouping of people do, but this post is specifically about one issue, not what others do or do not do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;m not in the least bit against anybody putting full effort into stopping, catching, and prosecuting those actually involved. I&#39;m saying that there is a weird element within this alleged group who claims to be concerned and involved <strong>purely</strong> because it caters to their beliefs of the other party. No doubt in my mind they would roundly condemn it and criticize it in the absence of partisanship, but the level of attention and talk it gets, I believe, is majorly boosted by the partisan element of who this plays out with in actuality. </p>

<p>Also, as a I repeatedly said, pedo is universaly considered perhaps the worst possible sin commited by a human, I&#39;m not saying in the absence of liberals being involved conservatives wouldnt care, I&#39;m saying the level of interest and verbosity on the subject crosses over from normal human empathy and morals to partisan schtick. ESPECIALLY in the absence of positives and causes and effort put to helping the situation. </p>

<p>What disgusts me is seeing a grossly disproportionate amount of attention, time, and chatter put towards allegations and even confirmed cases, but then not even 1% of that into helping out in any way. I see so many individuals post a new development linking (for example) podesta to some pedo, and then you get your typical remarks, but then those same people then fuck off afterwards. Not in the least bit trying to promote people, organizations, or politicians working against these sick fucks, not putting the same amount of focus into those on their team. Its just an upvote (twitter like), comment feigning deep disgust, and move on to a spicy meme. Lots of people are hypocritical shitheads, its not exclusive to this issue, but this is a topic that disgusts me to see be this way.</p>
