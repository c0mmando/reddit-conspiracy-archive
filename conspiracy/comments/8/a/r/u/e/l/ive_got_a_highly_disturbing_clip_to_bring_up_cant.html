       You can find the whole show on Comcast on demand, but clips are hard to find.  There was one on YouTube that didn't do it justice cuz it was cropped and edited for copyright and had commentary;

       This aired last Friday night. There was a segment right before where there was a fake call in to the show where a pizza shop owner was accosting will ferrel for a tip and will ferrel was like I didn't order one pizza I ordered 100. Then they were talking about babies and the guy on the phone goes "there's no babies in this pizza shop" and hangs up the phone. Clearly envoking pizzagate. Anyway I highly encourage you to watch this actual satanic ceremony on television. But never to watch the show again, as all this ritual was about is increasing their numbers.

       Like seriously this is sick shit under the guise of a joke, but there is no punchline. They cover him in turtles blood and throw dirt on him which in nature is mocking God as the turtle and bastardizind Adam as the clay figure. I'm not even a religious person, but I see the evil of this world practice the antithesis and it becomes clear to me to see they are trying to mock god. And that shit don't fly.

       If you watch the entire thing you would not be suggesting satire. Given ferrell's past in occult circles it is all the more telling.

        “Marina! What place do you see the occult having within contemporary art; can magick be made (not simply appropriated/ performed)? Thanks, K”
       </strong>
       *
“Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.”*

       Its comedy. Anyone that doesn't get the joke, is because the joke is about them. It is making fun of people that will believe absolutely anything. Specifically, this particular kind of humour may be considered what is known as anti-comedy (comedy where there is no punchline or obvious joke). There are plenty of REAL conspiracies. This is not one of them in my opinion.

       Well you need to look into the specifics of the ritual they are doing. Covering him in turtles blood and dirt is very symbolic. You can't say this is a joke and believe it.

       All those that hid the true knowledge of the universe and attempt to control those they consider lesser are evil. What your namesake did was evil. The capstone can only levitate because its being held up on the mass of the unknowing. If the people were to be enlightened there would be no extra magick bullshit and you would lose all your power and control and that frightens you. We the people demand equality. And you know we can't have that for your needs, therefor you and will and marina, and all you baby rapers "namesakes" are an enemy to the future and I'm enjoying watching you all fall.

       You didn't answer the question. You worship all these deities/entities that you believe have power. Yet what allowed these deities to exist in the first place? The same thing they are envious of and choose to combat, because they and you will never be as great.

       Yea I saw that. I also saw you mock the clayman cuz you're scared of a Christian God, which is even a little silly to me. Just because you rubbed blood and diarrhea on yourself you believe to be imbued with some sort ability to comprehend the spirit realm? I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, I'm generally intrigued on why you believe this water gives you anything other than a cold.

       Okay so check. You both know you weren't simply doing 'art'. I can tell you're trying to change your game up to claim you were joking the whole time now with your antiquing comment. Btw just like your stand up all I see here is another joke that didn't land.

       Now the call in from Tony who quickly hung up after saying "there are no babies here" were you attempting to intentionally make a call back to pizzagate?

       You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4+1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

       Think about it: Why would they send anyone over for damage control? If you really believe they are *Satanist" doing black magic rituals and have super powers, wouldn't they just put a spell on you, or whomever was trying to "out" them? Send some demons around to take care of business for them? Use magic to shut down the internet? No, because none of this real.

       First off yes, look at your account they would send some one over for damage control. You got his official reddit playing damage control. Clearly I've struck a nerve and couldn't be happier. Secondly their magick is not very good that's why they give up themselves for power. Dude, you're Probablly in nyc working for gethard right now?

       So if it’s all just a joke and he’s not in damage control, why did he delete his tweet with a link to the video breaking down all the symbolism? It was up for over 8 hours then deleted after being linked to this post.

       TruTV posted a clip of the episode today, and it's getting massive negative feedback. Almost all comments are talking about how it's occult and fucked up, and it's disliked at a high percentage.

       Fuck this prick. Can't believe he came into this thread trying to defend that garbage

       All those that hid the true knowledge of the universe and attempt to control those they consider lesser are evil. What your namesake did was evil. The capstone can only levitate because its being held up on the mass of the unknowing. If the people were to be enlightened there would be no extra magick bullshit and you would lose all your power and control and that frightens you. We the people demand equality. And you know we can't have that for your needs, therefor you and will and marina, and all you baby rapers "namesakes" are an enemy to the future and I'm enjoying watching you all fall.
