    <div class="md"><p>As an older dude, this kinda of post is so frustrating because the answer is YES.</p>

<p>Spare me the &#39;both sides&#39; stuff because one side of our shitty two party system has been OPENLY destroying government under the guise of &#39;small government&#39; since the 70s.  They saw the growth of government and unions and the middle class (post WWII) as an affront to the small government ideals the US adhered to off and on since the beginning.</p>

<p>This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast">Starve the Beast</a></p>

<p>So this current POTUS, adhering to this right wing mandate, has installed people in those agencies that have their entire lives tried to circumvent and destroy those agencies:</p>

<p>Scott Pruitt - EPA - climate change denier, hates regulations, pro-corporations</p>

<p>Rex Tillerson - SoS - Big oil advocate, cozy with Russia, tore up the state department</p>

<p>Steve Munchin - Treasury - Goldman Sachs banker, wall street proponent</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Betsy DeVos - Dept of Education - who continues the destruction of public schools by taking over and pushing vouchers, shitty charter schools, and reenergizing a christian bent in schools in an attempt to ring us back to the olden days.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Starve the beast is real.  The Mercers want it.  The DeVos (Amway) want it.  And it&#39;s underway.  So what you are seeing is a concerted effort to destroy what was once the model schools in the world.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Gilded Age II.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think that because there is a transgender child in a class that it is going to make other children that way? People are born the way they are  born. And there is absolutely nothing that can, or should be changed about it. A lot of the people in my family felt that way until my brother had a little boy, who by the age of 3, we all knew would be gay. It took him until the age of 19, after years of dating girls, acting straight, going to church and trying to suppress it, for him to come out. My entire family now realizes that there wasn&#39;t a thing that happened to him that made him that way, he was just born that way. And, that there is absolutely nothing wrong with him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. For example, we were mandated to protest for gun control instead of teaching our students. Think about that. Every high school in America was told to protest guns instead of learning. If people don&#39;t wake up to the fact that schools are an institution that brainwashes citizens into following directions without critically thinking, they&#39;re in for a big surprise one day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Schools are, and always have been, about indoctrination, discipline, and upholding the social order and hierarchy.  It doesn&#39;t matter if they are public schools or for-business schools, the methods themselves were created for that purpose.  Schooling for profit brings its own particular nastiness, and the explosion of charter schooling has been deliberate policy to line the pockets of businessmen and screw over the teachers&#39; unions.</p>

<p>If schooling were about learning, why would schools use a dysfunctional method for teaching literacy, then shunt kids who are failed into remedial classes where stupidity is enforced and their lives are ruined?  If I didn&#39;t learn to read on my own before I entered the school system, I never could have learned in that awful environment, and I don&#39;t know of anyone, regardless of where they were, who could.  Kids had to learn on their own time, the school sure as hell didn&#39;t teach shit.  They were really effective at beating kids into their assigned social roles, and perpetuating the social hierarchy; that was their function, and when you learn about where the education system came from it makes a lot more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is exactly why when the U.S. conservatives killed themselves a path to power (that assassination decade of the 60s), they also had to attack the schools in particular after Brown vs Board of Education, if they can&#39;t have school their way, there shall be no schools, </p>

<p>That is Betsy&#39;s DeVos&#39;s job.  Eliminate public supported education for all and change it to a system where tax money goes to the wealthier who then pay a premium for a charter school that will continue to receive tax money.  </p>

<p>We will go from public funded education for all to tax subsidized education for the rich white people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a systematic approach from the government so much as a symptom of another issue.  The source of this problem is lobbying.  Lobbyists have discovered how easy it is to control government at the state level.  Their influence has created state legislatures across the nation full of people they can manipulate.  They&#39;ll push economic policies that benefit the lobbying group over American education, and then as they fall deeper they&#39;ll start legislating what is taught to benefit them.  Old boring corruption doesn&#39;t make as good of a story as a New World Order villain, but leads to the same result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This really is an enlightening post. I&#39;ve had thoughts about this for years now, but I&#39;ve never seen anyome else actually put this concept into words. 
I often notice how much irrelevant stuff I&#39;m being told in school (I&#39;m in the last year of high school) and how little all of this has to do with the real world. It wasn&#39;t until I started doing my own research about politics, history and literature that I noticed how much stuff we aren&#39;t told. Let&#39;s be real, how many people are actually going to take the initiative to learn what caused Hitler to gain so much power that he convinced a whole nation to support his insane views? Not that much, but that&#39;s what benefits the ones currently in power. Carrying on with the example of Hitler, if we were taught what strategies he used to deprive so many people of their moral judgement, we would soon realise how similar they are to the current schooling system that were all legally obliged to go through..</p>
