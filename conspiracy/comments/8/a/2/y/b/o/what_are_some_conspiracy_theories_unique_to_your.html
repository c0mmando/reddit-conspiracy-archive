       And somehow I find it amusing that the most frequent routes happen to draw out a seated stick-man. It's like somebody doodled it, and then the planners went "why not?" (There's also a much fainter second stick person posed in a compromising position with the main one.)

       Conspiracy theories are the lifeblood of the average Pakistani. Partly because nobody here believes in anything the government does or says, which is a double-edged sword if you actually want to do something good as a government official. Also lots of people apparently believe that Malala is some kind of US/UK agent or plant.

       It’s more because of the sheer amount of media attention she’s gotten from both the US and UK. There’s probably nothing to it but Pakistanis are generally cognizant of the media games played by both whenever there’s an endgame to be had (obviously especially in terms of our geographical neighbours), and are often paranoid as a result.

       Not really “conspiracies” so much as mysteries from my hometown.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a large mansion type house in the middle of a large plot of land, probably an old farm. The gates are always closed and no one ever goes in or out. No property record exists of this place and there’s never any movement or lights on inside. Every year whoever owns it hosts a Halloween party and invites one girl from every school in the county and sometimes some outside the county. It’s usually a junior or senior  but rarely a sophomore, and the girls seemingly are picked at random. I’ve known people who go but no one ever talks about what goes on or what they see at the house.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other is this guy who is always around at the country bars. He’s a typical country guy, good looking, boots, etc. he’s an amazing dancer and usually has some slinky girl with him (rarely the same one though) and they impress with their wild swing style moves. He doesn’t talk to anyone and just stares at nothing when he walks around. He usually has a large entourage with him but no one knows who they are either. He seemingly appears and disappears without anyone seeing what car he comes or leaves in. Always gets VIP treatment everywhere. There’s 2 main country bars in that area so he’s at almost all the events at them, plus the concerts and festivals during the summer. Literally no one knows who this guy is, anything about him, where he’s from, anything about his group, nothing. He’s been around for at least 7 years (since I started going) but he looks the exact same so no one even knows how old he is.

       Haha he’s just a fun hometown mystery. Most of the people who go to these country bars in that area, you get to know people so for al these people to al realize we have no idea about him and stuff, especially since he intentionally draws so much attention to himself with the dancing, it’s both weird and funny

       You're telling me no drunk man or woman has ever gone to him and just asked "hey exxschuse me buh... who are you and why do you geh VIP-trrreatmenth?".

      <p>
       Not one angry drunk dude, not one flirty awkward interested woman or man? No one has ever talked to him or his crew?

      <p>
       Same with the people invited in the creepy Halloween-mansion? Where does the host get information on all the random girls? Why is it legal for a stranger to invite a bunch of underage girls to a party in a creepy mansion no one knows the owner of?

        Pensmore Mansion

       , said to be a secret hideout/safehouse for upper level government VIPs.  Officially it is a private residence and farm open for special events, corporate meetings, etc.

        Pensmore

       is designed to be self sufficient with solar and geo-thermal heat and sturdy enough to withstand an F-5 tornado with a basement bunker fallout shelter for refuge in the event of nuclear blast.

      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/us/19ozarks.html">
        The NY Times Article
       </a>
       includes a lovely (and rare) photo of the mansion under construction from the air.  The property is strictly off limits to the public and said to be heavily guarded.  Stories here circulate of men in riot gear or black suits shooing away curious Sunday drivers with rifles drawn or of drones following cars driving in the vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a pretty poorly kept secret that the Ozark Mountains are home to some pretty high level government retirees including retired generals and DoD or State Department employees.  It stands to reason, I suppose, that eventually one of them would build a super-mansion hideout in this very remote part of the country.  Pensmore probably isn't the only Illuminati/Deep State secret hideout in this part of the country.

       Philip Marshall, his two teenage kids, and their pet dog were all shot dead in their home in Forest Meadows in Muphys, CA. I don't live in Muphys, but I have family that does, and I know the area very well. The circumstances surrounding this are extremely strange. The sheriff says Philip had mental problems and was severely depressed after divorcing his wife. This is total bs, as Philip and his wife were starting a business together even after the divorce (by all accounts it was an amicable divorce). On top of that people who actually knew Philip says he would NEVER hurt his kids. Period. The guy loved his kids above everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you actually look up Philip Marshall and see the things he said regarding 9/11, given his experience as a pilot, things really start to seem more nefarious. It's especially creepy since Murphys really is a sleepy town hidden in the Sierra Nevadas - very peaceful and seemingly a great place to escape.

       I'm from Central Massachusetts and it's very Irish Catholic in this area.   Everyone has a Whitey Bulger story.   Everyone has an uncle who collaborated or funnled money to the IRA.  Sometimes those two types of stories intersect.  Alot of it is bullshit, alot of it is people telling the stories of other people self inserting for clout at the bar.  Interesting tho.

       I saw two submarines on the surface of the water in front of the marina in Port Moody British Columbia back on I believe it was March 22, 2015 at 7am.  I believe that they are kept in the large boat houses there to be used in a future false flag attack possibly to be blamed on Russia in order to drag us into war.  Also, I grew up in Port Coquitlam BC where the notorious serial killer Robert "Willie" Pickton was from.  He had a pig farm where he murdered 49 women and fed them to his pigs.  There is no way in hell that he worked alone but he was the only one implicated.  I have reason to believe that the police were involved etc.  Hell, I saw a floating shack one time beached down river from his farm that had multiple pairs of girls panties in it, handcuffs on the door, on the inside of the door it said 'die you're dead', there was a book about channeling spirits on the floor, garden sheers and other sharp things that could.be used as weapons like nails etc, tons of porno clippings carefully cut out into murals, and a dolls head that had a hole cut out at the mouth and a foam tube inserted apparently for jerking off with.  I took photos and reported it to the police, but the police woman who came to my house to talk with me took most of my photos (including doubles) and my negatives.....and I never heard about it again.....wasnt in the news or anythung and the shack quitly disappeared.  Also I have reason to believe that the town is chock full of Satanists.
