       One of the biggest mistakes we make is thinking that the past just repeats itself. But the past doesn't repeat,
      </p>
      <p>
       As the quote probably misattributed to Mark Twain says: "History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes."

       Beware of bad rhymes.

       No they didn't.  Gumshoe and beat pounding reporters did that.  Stop blaming everyone for what Trump's campaign did.
      </p>
      <p>
       FTR, I don't thing Trump knew anything (obviously he would firewall everything) but the rest more than likely tried to tip the election in their direction while more than likely laundering russian money. (

        everyone in the USA was laundering RUS money)

       he was being sarcastic.

       plus, "beat-pounding reporters" could very well imply corporate MSM, which in turn would be part of Corporate America, which therefore means you just affirmed 1-800's comment.

       I think that is just as dangerous as utopian socialist myopic zealots seizing power.  I totally agree with you.  Freedom exists where real power over yourself is held by yourself and as long as you don't infringe on others you are left alone.  Parents are for children, not for societies.

       The Vatican is the oldest Corporation and it has been ruling for hundreds of years. The 'Government' that you think is the US Government is really just a Corporation and has been for about 150 years now. Before that we were ruled by the Virginia Company who owned the Colonies.

       There are chips that go into your body. There is literally an electronic device the size of a thumb tack that people voluntarily put into their bodies, more specifically their

        hand
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's super fucked, but they claim that "the GPS setting isn't turned on unless we are given your permission to use it."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they've revealed that these chip implants that are actually
       <strong>
        in you
       </strong>
       have GPS tracking. And it's all in the name of convenience.

       No. No. No. Nixon was on our side. It really began in the 50s with the communist takeover of Hollywood. Once the media was controlled by them, they then legally installed their pets into our government. If they failed, see Kennedy and Nixon and Reagan and now Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been fed lies our entire lives. Such as Nixon being a villain. Truth is he was exposing the communist in Hollywood.

       When will people wake up to the fact that corporations exist as agents of the State?  Corporate charters can only be issued by governments.  Without governments, corporations cannot exist.  Ever since the first corporation was ever created, the purpose of these is to perform some act of governance or task in the world that the government (for whatever reason) is unwilling or unable to do.  And the stockholders are the ranks and untold countless ranks of minor nobility who profit from these actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because make no mistake, the purpose of Western government is to conquer and exploit.  That was the purpose of the Roman government -- whose symbol of the fasces we still carry proudly -- and it remains the purpose of government to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the power of government has been reigned in by a thousand chains, from the Magna Carta to the Common Law to jury nullification to the Bill of Rights and countless other checks and balances to control this voracious and malicious appetite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the State created corporations in order to fulfill this duty of exploitation.  These corporations are largely free from the chains with which we have bound the State.  There is no democratic process: only the nobility/stockholders have a voice.  There is no bill of rights to force corporations to honor and protect our human rights of speech and self-defense, because the "bill of rights" only applies to the State.  If we have a dispute, it is not settled by jury trial but rather private courts which are
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       State-chartered corporations.  Our prisons, our food, our water, our medicine, our sports, our education, literally every aspect of our lives has become infected by this pernicious State-chartered exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people wonder what is wrong.  Like a fish, you cannot see the water you swim in.

       "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.

       This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”

       Huxley was a very interesting man.  He delved very deeply into psychedelics, and in fact his wife (at his request) gave him a very high dosage of LSD as he was dying.  Which, for anyone who has tripped, is an odd thing to think about.

       If I remember correctly, his father was connected to the "elite" group of the time. Makes one wonder if his inspiration for the book wasn't purely creative, but possible outcomes for an alleged agenda. Not sure which way I lean on that.

       Yeah, it was either his brother or his father, I forget. In any case, his family was definitely in the eugenics circle. At least one of those links above talk about it. You're completely right about his book - almost all of the motifs are derived from the musings and ambitions of those "elite" circles, which makes his admission that many of these ideas have come to pass all the more frightening.

       Yes absolutely. We could argue that in 1984 the characters in it are still human. With the desire to fight for freedom. Which is what we see from Winston.
      </p>
      <p>
       In brave new world. People are no longer humans. The conditioning of humans is so advanced, they prefer the life under the regime. They see their golden cage as their civilization. Which is why no body from the regime wants freedom and Linda even when she went to the reservation she’s still craving to be controlled by the state. The only person sees that the world is fucked up is John the savage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1984, we see a state ruling the people with an iron fist. We see the state enslaving it’s citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       In brave new world, there’s no need for state to enslave the citizens. With the hedonistic lifestyle, brainwashing. The citizens enslave themselves. In this type of regime, because the citizens love it and have no idea they live under a totalitarian regime. There’s no revolution, it might last forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read brave new world, you will see a bunch of parallels with America and the one described in the state. (Orgy -&gt; hookups, tinder. Soma-&gt;weed, pills. anti-family. Anti-freedom of speech. Obsessed with profits, productivity etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But again I’m not sure if more people read brave new world we can prevent that from happening. What’s outlined in brave new world with the hedonistic lifestyle is very attractive. It exploits human nature of comfort, happiness, consumerism, and hedonism.

       Funny, how people are so busy working and juggling activities and worrying that they don't take the time to even read anymore. Not totally their own fault, it's partially an outcome of societal conditioning. I speak from personal experience, there was a few years of my life that I didn't pick up a book due to an "I ain't got time for this" mentality, and I like to read. This book could be a game changer for some, but because of the trap of a hedonistic lifestyle it isn't read.

       Books are wonderful things, but in terms of the impact they can have on society, the most important aspects of books are the ideas within them. The ideas within books are still widely transmitted throughout society. They're being transmitted right here, right now. They're being transmitted in thousands, if not millions of places on the internet, between people that have read those books, and people that have not, and that's just one of thousands of ways in which ideas are spread in our society. We have an abundance of information, true, but what we need to be wary of is not the diminishing prevalence of book reading in our society, but the institutions that have control over the flow of information in our society today. Humanity's present and future fate is neither A Brave New World, nor 1984. It certainly possesses characteristics of those dystopian worlds, but we're experiencing a different, perhaps even more terrifying situation. We live in Greece, 500 B.C. We appoint our own Oracles, and substitute approval and the efficiency of convenience for our own intelligent, independent thinking. We look more like The Borg than A Brave New World or 1984.

       Replace "feared" with "noticed about present day society." A good sci-fi author is writing about the present, and they were no exception. What you're seeing is the European (Orwell) vs American (Huxley) perception of WW2 and the post-WW2 order.

       Everyone expects a totalitarian regiem.  Personally I think your looking at the wrong war.  You should look more at the civil war.... Except today there is no North or sympathizers to oppose the unfair teatment of workers.  Indentured survitude is on our doorstep.

       The issue for me isn't that indentured servitude is utilized for those that have stepped out of bounds for our societal contract, but that it is utilized on those that don't.  The "war on drugs" (for example) may have started with good intentions, but now it is simply a way of forcing an unlucky minority into a slave type status that should be withheald (for a limited time) for those that hurt others... which includes the top 1% when it applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       An alternative concern is that corporate deregulations are slowly converting the public's independent dreams of self betterment into an expectation that we should further our countries economy by fulfilling the (arguably unrealistic) deadlines established by a superior.  Why?  "Because capitalism is the best!  If it wasn't supposed to be this way, the free market would correct it!"  So people willingly accept their position without challenging the narrative.  And thing progressively get worse.

       I refuse to believe that an entire government would initiate a plan without thinking it would be good for the nation (even if that "good" is misguided).  As for the slavery thing: thats not objective either way.  It's a matter of belief and your welcome to yours.

       You see, Nixon didn't think hippies and black people counted as part of "the nation", or at least not part of the kind he wanted.  He saw them as internal enemies and anti-American cultural agents.  How can you "refuse to believe" that when his own team openly admitted as much?  You have to be absurdly naive to think that every politician has ALL of our best interests in mind and not just personal interests or those of the party they belong to.

       And as far as slavery and punishment goes, the fact that the prison system is not meant for punishment it's not just my opinion, they call it the "department of corrections" for a reason.  It's ostensibly meant to reduce criminality through rehabilitation and not to exact punishment.

       While enforcing artificially popular ones. This is what political correctness/SJW movement is all about. Engineering a consensus about what gets tolerated/promoted and what is repressed and not tolerated.

       Totalitarianism has nothing to do with extreme right wing/left wing. It's all about intolerance and a willingness to demand (and enforce) conformity of thoughts and actions.

       We're on the lookout for Commies or Nazis or Racists. But the real threat isn't the ideology, it's the attitude of absolute moral/ideological superiority and the resulting expectation that everyone else should agree with you... or else.

        Inverted Totalitarianism

       . It was coined by political philosopher Sheldon Wolin in his 2004 book "Democracy Inc".
      </p>
      <p>
       "... inverted totalitarianism is described as a system where corporations have corrupted and subverted democracy and where economics trumps politics.[2][3][4][5] Every natural resource and living being is commodified and exploited to the point of collapse, as the citizenry is lulled and manipulated into surrendering their liberties and their participation in government through excess consumerism and sensationalism.[6][7]"

       That’s interesting.  I had a Political Ideology class in college (circa 1987) where “corporatism” was discussed briefly as an emerging ideology but I think we mostly focused on the structural element of mixing corporate style organizational structure with traditional governmental systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t remember it being portrayed quite this bleak, I think some examples of “good” outcomes were German trade unions and some larger employee owned corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I completely agree with the commodification and exploitation and the reduction of “value” to be purely in terms of market value and productivity.

       I don't think that it will be an enforced censorship by some evil corporation. I actually believe it will be people demanding censorship from their own governments.......oh....wait......that is already happening.

       History repeats itself in the sense that humans are evolving very slowly and we always end up making similar mistakes. It may not be like for like but common themes repeat themselves.

       Slavery has just evolved 
Wars are being fought but warfare has changed 
Censorship is rife but it won’t be burning books 
The elite are still abusing their power, just more sophistically

       if you're dealing with corporations directly, its voluntary.  You do not have to use them, and if you're capable, go make a company that doesn't do censoring and compete - enough injustice done by a company will sink them (see facebooks decline) - the idea being that as consumers we have much more control over a company than we do over the government (one gets our money voluntarily while the other takes our money at the point of a gun)
      </p>
      <p>
       now if you're saying that we will be censored by the govt (which is a separate issue), so long as we have the 1A, we should be able to deal with that via the legal system and win

       Just think of how social technology and platforms will be used during times of war.  They will know everything about you.  Are you sympathetic to one side or the other?  They will know.  They will even be able to tell of you are susceptible to being sympathetic to one side or the other.  It will give them the ability to arrest you before you have even done anything.  The next conventional war america gets into, that's exactly what they will do.  Use social media to arrest and detain people who have done nothing.

       A "corporation" is not some evil entity. It's a business. For $50, you can go make a corporation right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       A corporation is no different than any other group of people. Like a political party, or a social club, or a neighborhood. "Corporations" can only control the government in the same way that literally any other group of people can control the government.
