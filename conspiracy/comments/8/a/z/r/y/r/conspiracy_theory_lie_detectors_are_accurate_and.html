<p>The FBI was wondering why all their sources in Russia kept getting caught.  They tasked Hanssen with tracking down the mole, but he WAS the mole.  Really crazy story.  </p>

<p>Cops use those speed guns to determine if you&#39;re speeding and the readings are used in courts, despite the fact that they can never always be accurate.</p>

<p>There was an ex-cop who was an expert on administring these tests, but eventually realized it was all bunk science and that it&#39;s easy to learn how to pass the test. So he set up a business where he taught people how to pass lie detector tests. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-crazy-story-of-an-ex-cop-who-ran-a-website-that-taught-people-how-to-cheat-polygraphs-2015-5">He eventually became too dangerous to the lie detector industry, and eventually entrapped him and got him arrested.</a> </p>

<p>A so-called lie detector is a tool that police use in order to coerce you.  First, you shouldn&#39;t be talking to the police for any reason. They are not interested in finding information that points away from you.  They are only interested in gather information that points to you as the perpetrator.  They lie, they coerce, they intimidate, all to get you to give them evidence against you.  A lie-detector is no different.  It is a tool that police pretend is accurate and then come back and intimidate you with &quot;details&quot; about your results.   But, like I said, you shouldn&#39;t even be talking at all, let along while strapped to some bullshit machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly... the idea behind lie detector tests is for the police to be able to point at a machine and say &quot;it tells us you&#39;re lying&quot; in the hopes you will change your story.</p>

<p>Many people who are lying can be fooled into incriminating themselves simply by saying &quot;I don&#39;t believe you&quot;... they try to &#39;convince&#39; you, and in so doing expose the contradictions in their story.</p>
