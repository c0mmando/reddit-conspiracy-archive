       Haha!  There is the Book of Enoch, too, and the Nag Hammadi Library.  I have a bunch of links I have been going through.  It is interesting how much it changes ones perception of Genesis.  It does not say what most people believe it says.

       I don’t “believe” or “disbelieve” statements made by almost anyone, to be honest with you.  “Belief” is what one tends to rely upon when one doesn’t have any type of real understanding or logical rudder to steer them in the appropriate direction when coming to a perspective on any given subject or issue.  What I do is assess the statements that are made by any source in question against a rational strata of logical thinking and see how those statements weigh against what’s actually happening in the world that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, the information in the linked articles, specifically the one I commented on, talks about a particular mode of being - a perspective that one can have on the world, if you will - whose end result, as far as I can see, ultimately makes logical sense:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Humanity is a creature with much to learn.  The Earth is fraught with many traps, dangers, and misleading pathways that can easily lead one very much astray.  When assessing the world around you and your journey through the treacherous waters of life, try to manage “the middle way” - don’t allow yourself to get too high; don’t allow yourself to go too low.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This ultimate lesson imparted in The Hidden Hand Interview is one that I think is rather valuable and would do well to be focused upon by many individuals on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent of the particular and specific veracity or truth behind any individual statement made in the Interview, this ultimate lesson imparted from the information is, I feel, a sufficiently valuable one.

       Thank you for the great response.  Yes, the word "believe" is not very useful sometimes.  I would like to know, but the events described in these manuscripts happened a long time ago.  It is a fascinating subject, and it changes the meaning of Genesis completely around.  It seems like it was purposely mistranslated to hide the truth.

      <p>
       Do you mean Genesis was purposefully mistranslated to hide the truth, or the HH info was purposefully mistranslated to hide the truth.  If you meant the former, I certainly wouldn’t disagree with that in the least.  As a matter of fact, William Bramley’s important book “The Gods Of Eden” (
       <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">
        pdf here
       </a>
       ) goes into this very topic in
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       detail.  It’s an utterly fascinating read and I very much recommend going through it.

       I mean that Genesis was mistranslated to hide the truth.  I doubt that King James would sanction a Bible translation what warns of the Rulers and Authorities.

       Cool.  I will look at The Gods of Eden.  I am always looking for something new to read and watch.

       Oh absolutely.  Most definitely that too.  Reading through William Bramley’s book is all the more recommended now.

       Yup those are the ones, I still have the PDF about it.
I read it about once a year and it screws me up for a few days, but helps me center myself and delve inside for a bit. Regardless if it is true or not, their are still valid points, especially the part about concentrating on yourself, and that thats the real battle of our lives. I always knew that the real elites where not known to the common man, that the ones known were ultimately just fronts n not the real forces...... were you around at the time of it?

       Yes, sir.  That indeed is what the information can definitely tend to do.  It had the same effect on me when I first read it as well.

       Yep.  This guy gets it.  The real import of the information involves its exhortation to focus on one’s self, on one’s reactions to things, and on having as evolved and equanimous approach to the things around you as possible.

       The known “elites” are nothing more than “king rats” (see

        chapter 25 in this pdf here

       Thanks for the reply. I found the book online and have purchased it, look forward to the reading. Was also very interested in the writings of William Cooper..... a lot nailed him a nut etc.... like I said before I don't take anything I read or hear for certain, but I consider it and let my intuition guide me.... his stuff felt good. Were you around during the time that "revelations of an elite insider" actually happened on godlikepro? This thing is always a good read, 13 years later even....

       I have a physical copy as well.  It’s dense, and absolutely choc full of information - a very serious read.  I imagine it’ll be a while before you get it, read it, and are done with it (easily weeks I imagine), but if you remember, definitely come back here - or just pm me or whatever - and let me know what you think of it.  Would definitely like to know your thoughts on it after you’re done.

       That seems to be a right path to follow as far as I am concerned.  I do this as much as possible myself as well.  I let my intuition guide me along with as much analysis and critical thinking as I can muster on whatever given subject I’m looking into.

       It was 13 years ago?  Wow.  Yeah.  I saw it not too long before I posted the original thread I linked above.  That was maybe about 4 or 5 years ago.

       It seems perhaps that you’re allowing yourself to get stuck in a type of indoctrination (religious or otherwise) that causes you to be knee-jerkingly averse to going further and looking deeper into the meaning of what's presented here.  I say this because if you actually did look deeper, you would understand that independent of whether the source of the information is “luciferian” or whatever it might be, the fact of the matter is that the ultimate message that got communicated by the HH material actually
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       in fact a valid one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or would you instead reject the idea that it’s beneficial for a human being’s development to be equanimous in their approach to things in life simply because that ultimate message is being delivered by a source that makes you feel uncomfortable?

       Do not believe so, but to ask. I took it all with a grain of salt of course.... but valid points were made.... the real elites are not known to common man and that the real battle is within ourselves, to stop asking everyone else for 'your answers'
