       This site is fucking cancer now, has anyone noticed that every post will always be downvote brigaded after like the first 10 minutes. SJWs &amp; shils basically dominate any populated subreddit, they will use the downvotes to censor every single opinion that goes against the norm &amp; it will quickly devolved in a manufactured conversation. Example go on askreddit for example, sort by new &amp; give your honest opinion on any gender, politics or religion related post. Your comment will be most likely upvoted to the top at first, but downvoted to the bottom every single time as the hivemind takes over the entire post by downvote brigading nearly everyone. Resulting in a manufactured thread where essentially the same comments will be at the top, and everything that they don't want us to see is quickly downvoted to the bottom. Its like they are basically trying to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same is true on r/conspiracy, most of this subreddit seems to be full of shills. They don't even believe in conspiracy theories and have a sole purpose to basically downvote brigade any sensitive topic &amp; control the narrative by posting the same shilling comments that get somehow upvoted to the top every single time. 
And what's more is that the mods do absolutely nothing about this, even though shilling apparently is against one of this site's direct rules. What the fuck happened to Reddit, its like voat has now become what this place used to be. but not surprisingly any positive mention of voat will always be downvoted to hell.

       It’s crazy that you care more about winning this little battle than losing the war against the elites and our increasingly tyrannical government.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure, keep playing into their hand. They’ve done a brilliant job of making people like you think “she lost” whenever someone questions Trump. They’ve managed to convince you that any criticism of him must imply support for her, and that any criticism should be dismissed as “liberal whining”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result is that Trump is left entirely unchecked, because anyone who Tries to hold him accountable is just “continuing the constant attacks”. Even if he does something actually wrong and someone questions him on it, it doesn’t matter at this point because he has a huge base of supporters who will simply refuse to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’ll go so far as to make up excuses for why it must not be true, to attempt to misrepresent and discredit the criticism, to deflect with jokes, and sometimes to simply not listen at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think t_d is supposed to do? It’s supposed to make sure that anyone initiated into the delusion sees only a steady diet of information designed to confirm and maintain their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s now a sizable population of people who only believe right wing media, only browse t_d, and only interact with fellow devotees.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few of you leaked out to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a couple years ago and proceeded to try to move this sub away from an honest quest for the truth towards something more similar to t_d.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you pull the same crap here that everyone there does. You only believe right wing sources, you immediately disregard any other sources, you deflect with jokes, post misinformation which to you appears as legitimate, and generally attempt to corral the narrative to create another safe space here as there is in t_d. A place where anyone “initiated” (who spends most of their time on reddit and consumes most of their media from this sub) is protected from seeing views which are critical of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it’s failed miserably because there’s plenty of information which is critical of Trump and this sub doesn’t have the same moderation policies as t_d where dissenting opinions are simply removed outright.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn’t a secret either, t_d has been proven to engage in this sort of behavior in a number of subs. They toned it down after the admins took action when they were more overt about it before.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s the point of t_d, an advertisement for Trump and an attempt at controlling the narrative. Is it any surprise that people who bought into this care more about controlling the narrative than uncovering the truth?

       All of that wall of text and it's nothing but a nice, big, juicy strawman. Holy cow, well done. I haven't seen one of these before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire post boils down to accusing the people who talk about Hillary here of essentially supporting Trump by not discussing him, and/or being right wing nuts who come from t_d using right wing sources. I call absolute, complete
       <em>

      <p>
       By "not questioning Trump," I get the feeling like you're referring to anyone not completely swallowing this insane Russian hysteria bullshit that's been on the news 24/7, because that's a narrative that's been pushed around here before. But guess what? Many great outlets, journalists, politicians, and whistleblowers (Greenwald, Sibel Edmonds, Kevil Shipp, Ron Paul, James Corbett, Robert Parry, Whitney Webb, VIPS, etc.; notice none of these are "alt-right") who have been correct time and time again make good cases as to why all of that is bullshit. At the same time, they are vocal about Trump's choices, foreign and domestic. They were vocal about his missile strikes in Syria, his appointing Goldman Sachs, Zionists, Neocons, and the lowest of the low scumbags into his administration, his pathetic tax code, and so on. Is Trump and co. corrupt and probably involved in money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, etc? You fucking bet they are, along with the people doing the "investigating." Is Trump a Russian Manchurian Candidate, and did the Russians have any meaningful impact on the elections? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what's been muddying the waters? This Russia bullshit which continually distracts from those very topics as well as the illegal wars abroad and the ever expanding surveillance state. People who are praising
       <em>
        Mueller
       </em>
       , the piece of shit who covered for 9/11, the IRA scandal, approved illegal searches, and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, call everyone who doesn't subscribe to your delusions t_d'ers and Russian shills. You're unwittingly being the very useful idiot you accuse us of.

       I don’t think Trump is a manchurian candidate either, but it sure seems like he worked with Russia to improve his chances of winning.

      <p>
       We already know Russia had a hand in his victory. It remains to be seen whether Trump was an active participant or simply a beneficiary.

       Still no evidence for this, but the billions of free publicity from the MSM + Cambridge Analytica helping him sure probably helped.

       No, we don't. Lol what. The indictments are process crimes and financial corruption, which is, like I said, completely pervasive in the shadow government. Take Trump down, and they put in another proper crony. Solve nothing, but meanwhile you have a nice distraction from all of the policies I mentioned and the ability to smear anyone who goes against the Establishment a Russian troll.

       I was a huge Bernie supporter.  I voted Trump in the election because I could not believe there were people like you trying to spin this narrative.  It was like I was waking up from a dream and someone was poking me saying, "No that's not how it was".
      </p>
      <p>
       It was utterly surreal the amount of fucking mind control the DNC and Hillary tried to spin.  I will say it has been effective, but in a terrible way.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one in their right minds wanted to choose between Trump and Hillary.  It was like choosing between an STD and an abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We finally had an option to get out of this bullshit, and the DNC fucked that chance over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I will vote my conscience, and my conscience believes the DNC are fucking rats.

       I remember that being the exact opposite of what happened.  That might have been the case in some subs but in here people were fuming pissed.. Hillary's shitty tenure as Secretary of State was a regular topic in here even before we got so polarized, and saying that this sub is receptive to the idea of taking an "anti-establishment" dumb fuck over one who would rig a primary is an understatement.  In that short time before Brock's people showed up, most of the bernie people here were content on just watching the whole thing go up in flames.

       Bernie fans felt the change most acutely, esp since their political hangout got shut down and wiped off Reddit a mere day or so after the convention. That was a ballsy move because it made the subsequent Clinton astroturfing everywhere all the more obvious.

       Well shit, you basically arrived for the most obvious decline of the subreddit. This place used to ascertain a wide variety of theories with those disagreeing kindly bowing out of the discussion (rather than the present, where shills blatantly seem to agree with any and all conspiracies).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing that's changed is the real-time nature of conspiracies. Now, shit is unfolding in real time rather than dissecting past ones (like 911 or the JFK assassination). This leads to a lot of sloppiness, confusion, disagreement, but is overall a wonderful thing. We get front row seats to watching the illusion crumble. It's probably part of the whole collapsing timeline/time acceleration issue.

       Oh, time acceleration is an old theory that 2012 actually was the end of time, but not in the way we thought it to be. It's that time as a constricting barrier dissipates (ends), and as such, time seems to fly by. A lot of people have noticed this and have commented on it on subs like retconned. Collapsing timeline is the theory that quantum accelerators like CERN have wiped out various timelines and have merged everybody on the same timeline. This is why people experience "glitches in the matrix," specifically, mandela effects: you'll sometimes hear others say, "in my previous timeline, South America was directly under North America and not nearly so far east." The theory is that everyone is brought under one reality when previously there were many. This then requires reconciling the notion that many such multiverses exist in the first place.

       Just a few of the more fun but radical conspiracy theories out there.

       Redditing a long time and I would say from the boston bombings. They saw public capabilities, whether intented good or bad and BAM most big subs get heavily modded with strict posting rules.
Plus, following year, 2015 I think, wasnt there a lot of controversy with Alexia? (co founder?) Either data collecting or selling reddit out. I can't recall, but sure that is when people noticed biased and more political posts.

       2013 was a pretty big deal here, all around.  Aside from the Boston bombing thing, we had the death of Aaron Swartz, Snowden Leaks, Michael Hastings.. plus you had a world coming off of OWS and the Arab spring.  It was pretty clear then that the folks in charge needed to get a firm grip on the power of social media, but now.. After the election? Weather you think the results were good or bad, that did not go according to plan and now we've now got every single political and capitalist agency, think tank, and organisation trying to figure out how to get complete control over what we say for good.  It's bad now, but I have a feeling its going to get astronomically worse in the next year or two.  TPTB don't like getting caught off guard, and it's happened way too much this past decade.

       Fuck that PI rule. The ability to crowdsource investigations is incredibly powerful--case in point is the rapidity and speed the Wikileaks drops were dissected here and at the_D. Within a day, the most pertinent docs surfaced and were summarized among 3,000+ emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       The PI rule was just put in place to enshrine the narrative and prevent people from scratching too deeply under the surface.

       many many years ago. The_Donald was just when people noticed. It separated itself from the usual meaningless comment bickering into a movement and fully consolidated both sides, one exclusively to TD, the other, every other sub. If you go outside this sub, TD, or the Q larp subs, it's a very exclusive club. Wrongthink is not allowed

       No, they ban for negativity and attacking the president. Which is clearly stated in the rules, it's not an open forum and unlike most political subreddits, has never pretended to be. It's the Donald Trump fan club

       The sub exists to support the President.
If you do not support the president, you do not belong there.

       Ever since political campaigns began employing social media people to cover social media.  They realized it was super effective.  It has since spread to every company, PAC, and lobbying group.  If you have a narrative to push, then you have a social media group working to push that narrative, IMO.  The organic then becomes the inorganic. It's the price of getting too big.

       It is not just political. Companies control everything too. EA, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Sony, ect all have social media teams whose job is to promote stuff on places like
       <a href="/r/gaming">
        /r/gaming

       and make it look organic. Either they make it and promote it, or they find something someone has made and promote it.

       Not just gaming. Go to r/hailcorporate and see some obvious and not so obvious advertising. It's like "LOOK WHAT MY FRIEND DID" on r/pics and it's a huge product placement. But it can happen in niche subs like a vaporizer company in a smoking sub or a tool company in a car sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary ones are the political ideal ones because they pander ideas, not products, and it's more difficult to see whether they are shills. Usually a brand new accou t gives them away, but they are getting more sophisticated

       I’ve been “censored” on several subs for voicing my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/atheism, r/politics, r/music
      </p>
      <p>
       Censored meaning, I can only post a comment every 8 minutes so having a conversation is annoying so the end result is, I don’t bother commenting on those subs anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/pics outright banned me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My latest ban was on r/music on the post “Fyre Festival Promoter Billy McFarland Pleads Guilty to Fraud”
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the top comments was about Trump and I basically said, “Why do you have to bring politics into a music post?”
      </p>
      <p>
       I was immediately attacked and told that Trump is evil and has to be stopped. I was downvoted to shit and at least a half dozen SJW’ers attacked accusing me of being a Trumptard and a right winger (because I’m sick of hearing about Trump everywhere).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they checked my comment history and saw that I post in r/conspiracy so “No Wonder!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing you know, I’m censored.

       They're not censoring you dumbass. Reddit has a feature where if you get down voted too much you can only post once every x minutes. Mods do not possess the power to enact that on people's accounts. And I went back and read your post and you're lying lol typical trump supporter

       I don't know how to link directly to the comment but you can probably search for my username or check my history.

       Again, another dumbass calling me a Trump supporter. Check my entire history. It's pretty clear I am not, nor have I ever posted in the Donald.

       I miss being able to just watch a band or listen to a comedian or stupid pet tricks or interview a celebrity that isn’t virtue signaling. No politics.

       That site appears little better than 2 degrees more tolerable than TD (specifically the news subs). Maybe it's just the fact that their population is low and their most likely source of new users are those disenfranchised with other sites, such as reddit, but I'd be skeptical of finding balanced discussion there, at least for now.

       I don't know about that site or how it's moderated but when you have less moderation you get more political incorrectness, like the chans. Right now that's skewing pretty heavy 'right' or what's being called right at this moment.

       To be fair, I think the Chans are partly so damn politically incorrect because it serves as a barrier to entry (which is exactly what they want). The alternative to less moderation is spam and shills, and I think they chose the tradeoff of political incorrectness. I genuinely wonder how many Chan'ers are

       I like steemit's functionality. Imagine a platform with a feel like Twitter, except it's based on a public blockchain so it cannot be censored like Twitter can be. It's also pretty unique in that upvotes directly equal cryptocurrency, so all the unpaid labor we do on other sites writing posts and curating actually gets monetarily rewarded there. Popular posts from people with a lot of followers can make hundreds of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Seems like most upvotes are actually worth between $0.00 and $0.01 in USD, but because upvotes are weighted based on the user's investment in the currency, they can also be worth a lot more. The other day I left a comment that got up to being worth 35 dollars with just 5 votes, but I've been trying it out for about a month and that's only happened once. Most of my comments have earned less than one cent's worth, with a handful of outliers in the dime to quarter range. Still, I really like the idea of people being paid for contributing to the social media network, especially the serious contributors who create content for the platform.

       This is what gives me hope. There are tons of viable solutions waiting in the wings, when we all drop the belief that Reddit (and Facebook, and Google) are the be all, end all.

      <p>
       And yes, I recognize the hypocrisy of my statement since I am, in fact, posting here on Reddit.

       People re-posting garbage everyday and their selfies and weight loss transformations everyday ruined the whole Reddit experience for me, i used to love reading conspiracy everyday but everyone just argues with each other or posts shit we've all been reading for months no new interesting things. And like you said the shills are pure shit but there's alot of people who see right through them.

       Reddit is and has always been dominated by liberals. Most people just use downvotes as a "I don't agree button". Just because people don't agree with your right wing views on religion or immigration or whatever doesn't mean the conversation is manufactured.

       It sounds like you are blaming those who disagree with you as SJWs and Shills. It could be that you just have an unpopular opinion (not necessarily wrong).

       If SJWs and Shills dominate every major subreddit, does that mean that the majority of Reddit users are SJWs and Shills?

       It's Reddit's voting mechanism that's messed up – posts that get a couple downvotes in quick succession when they're fresh are buried, so a very small group can essentially hide content without breaking any site rules.

       I couldn’t say on that little information. If they make a good argument I may believe them. Again it is really just a red flag to me rather than absolute. That said, it would take a lot to convince me the CIA isn’t into a lot of shady shit.

       Because of how the work day works most Americans are behind a computer screen 8 hours a day vs having time to do other things on weekends. Traffic drops during the weekends pretty heavily but less popular views get more traction during those times.

       Look at the anti Alex Jones post on the top of this sub right now
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't support Alex Jones. I know he's full of shit A LOT but he has opened millions of peoples minds to the idea that things aren't always as they appear. He's gotten millions of people to look into conspiracies that they otherwise would've never known about. That's good enough for me, but the shills cant stand it because they hate how conspiracies usually go against their political ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet this sub all of a sudden hates him and his conspiracies? Oh and COINCIDENTALLY this anti-Jones post shows up at the same time YouTube censors Alex Jones by demonetizing his videos.

       It's like clockwork. I mostly see it with anti-trump and pro-left subs, but I'm sure it exists in right-wing subs too.

       <p>
        subreddit is some blue/leftist/antitrump rag with &lt;30k subs and a snappy name like r/esist
       </p>
       <p>
        post either has more upvotes than subscribers, or an extremely high upvote:subscriber ratio (typically well over 50%)

       I see it here mostly because the left likes to astroturf here. If 4chan had a karma system you'd be able to pull out the red shill posts just as easily.

       The entire internet is like this and has always been like this. Have you noticed lately how many people post topics just like this one, and then conveniently promote voat. It's just like a formula, really. I wonder which intelligence service/illuminati faction controls voat, because it's obviously different than the one controlling reddit.

       It's the wisdom/stupidity of the commons. More regular people who don't know much are on the site and upvoting/downvoting without thinking/reading much. Shilling also works to an extent but it can only influence the crowd's decision (people upvote upvoted stuff and vice versa) and it's most effective in the early stages of the comment. The bots/shills can't outnumber the humans on this site because each effective bot/shill needs a unique IP address at the very least. It's just silly to assume (and we all do it) that it was all just bots downvoting and upvoting stuff. It was only regular visitors who may have been influenced by bots. There's no such thing as "full of shills", it's just shills leading the blind and idiotic masses to vote the way they want.

       The worst is that prior to about August 2016, it was the most anti-Clinton subreddit. I'm not saying that people can't be anti-Trump
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       anti-Clinton, but the venn diagram would show that demographic to be such a small group that I cannot for one second believe that politics isn't astroturfed to the seventh circle of hell's inferno.

       It happened to me twice just in the last 6 months. First I had a post upvoted to +10 and then downvoted to -24, after which I had one upvoted to +6 and then downvoted to -3 . These patterns are really suspicious, and I couldn't find any other explanation for them.

       they've always censored the correct views because they are pushing the globalist agenda, the gender fluid bullshit being a major plank in the story. This is because the planet is being changed with all the toxic waste,plastic,fake food and nuclear meltdowns going on resulting in to use a phrase we can all understand it's turning the frogs gay. All these soy boys and women who look like men are a direct result of the poisoning of the people.

Nothing about the article is an analysis nor an opinion. I messaged the modmail about this and received no response. I then messaged about about 6 of the mods for them to reconsider the flair or at least an explanation of why it was flaired this way. I was responded by a moderator who banned me from r/news.

       Other users have already stated in this post that this sub changed pretty drastically during the 2016 election, I was here for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, since I've been here, right since just before the election, I've noticed in other subs what looks like a tradition of dropping a slick one-liner and having a whole string of meta, six-degrees of Kevin bacon, play on words type jokes that follow and have very little to do with any sort of critical discussion even on serious topics. It seems like a great way to slide the conversation without putting forth any contentions that could be be proven wrong later or pissing anybody off with controversial comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has it been like that forever in other subs?

       Puns and plays-on-words have always been revered on Reddit, but what's likely is that bot accounts are karma farming by each feeding tangential responses ("I did nazi that coming") to the dialogue. They all upvote each other and the initial impression is that "haha, so witty lol." In actuality it's just cheap karma grabbing by regurgitating previous comment trains.

       It's weird how regularly reposted memes with the exact same title every time they are submitted always smash 20k+ upvotes. Quite often it even looks like the exact same top comments being posted. I've had to double-take on post dates and times thinking "hours ago? But I've seen this all this at least twice in the last 6 months"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like there are pre-made submissions, with thousands of upvotes and comments being submitted on a rotation, makes me wonder if there's AI posting shit to prop up certain subreddits in the absence of organic content.

       It's a mix of bots and real but dipshit losers who want free karma and attention.  The hivemind here love to circlejerk everything to death but they all want to start the jerk and feel smart so there's a rush to the top of the jerk with the exact same comments.    That post before about that asian ladies face turning red had the same asian flushing syndrome replies over and over and they were still getting karma.  And this is common now people will rush to reply to the copy of that comment with a copy of highly upvoted comment that replied to it, in the same fucking thread.  Most of Reddit has become such mindless parroters that it's just fucking infuriating.  I mean it was bad enough when you knew exactly what would be at the top of a thread without even looking but now expect to see it multiple times.  It's a mix of bots and dumb asses, the bots control the narrative and the dumb asses gleefully parrot it everywhere.

       The worst is when new accounts would farm karma by finding the most upvoted post from years ago, post it, and then build their score to look credible. What ends up happening is seeing the same material get recycled over and over. It used to not bother me so much, but then uncovering the motives of it caused me to see it as unpalatable.

       Hardly anyone gives an honest opinion. Why? Upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say something that's true and you can get a ton of upvotes. But only if your answer creates the right "feel" in the mind of the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the truth isn't always pleasant. Sometimes it's painful, even bitter. Telling that kind of truth is guaranteed to get you a ton of downvotes because bad feelings don't get karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       One way of telling when you've done this? A good sign is when you get 20 or 30 downvotes but no reply to your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also lots of shills and bots. But the karma points system has a huge effect on actual human users. If you asked me why, I'd say it's all the social conditioning. You see a number go up and subconsciously react to it like it was a game score or money. Numbers up = good and numbers down = bad.

       It's pretty crazy if you think about it. They are astroturfing a majority of the internet to gaslight people into believing public opinion is what they want it to be instead of what it is. I don't know how anyone could be ok with that but I guess it goes back to certain shades of the political spectrum being absolutely convinced of the moral superiority of their position to the point where anything they have to do to attain it is OK.

       The problem is brilliant people driven by money come up with nefarious ways to sell astroturfing/automation/externalization of costs etc. to corporations that eat that shit up because of the cost advantages.

       If your definition of "shill" is "pizza-gate denier", then all of reddit is going to seem like it's nothing but shills. There are actually people who just don't agree with you. That doesn't make them shills.

       Again, define "shill". Like, a paid operative? Or is anyone who doesn't believe in pizzagate automatically a shill? There are 20 million people on this website - not all of us can be on the Soros payroll.

       That's a minority. The counterarguments are so stupid, devoid of thought and any sort of logic, that they must be shills. No normal human is that retarded, irrespective of IQ, education etc etc.

       They result to name calling and usually can't think outside of their stance on whatever is the status quo. I despise the sjws that think they are woke yet still can't understand their ideas are literally manufactured by corporations to keep people arguing rather than having educated debates. Makes it hard to comment on controversial subjects rationally.

       What is pretty bad too is how some mods control the speech by banning people for just disagreeing with them (some subs are worst then others but some very large subs do it)... I wish that some statistics were available for all to see (things like # of banned users per sub/mod, etc..)

       Reddit has always projected many views onto it citizen. Look at the amount of Pro US Police forces propaganda.
Insult the relationship with the USA and Saudi Arabia and you'll be downvoted in every major sub.
Heck, you even get downvoted here if you disagree and think that maybe not all school shooting are manufactured by the government to enforce gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       People fundamentally want to read what they agree with, we get a dopamine hit when we disagree and we collectively are able to ignore and suppress dissenting views.
Not every conspiracy theory should be agreed with at all, 90% of the stuff in here could be debunked by a 12-year-old if only OP took a step back and realised their own cognitive biases.
Many real and proven conspiracies that are actionable RIGHT NOW are ignored for tales of pure fantasy about x group you don't like.

       Well I can't speak for shills, which I'm sure exist in all facets (both major political groups, corporate interests, advertisers, etc) but as for SJWs you're just going to have to accept that Reddit is predominately, if not by a supermajority, a liberal place.  They will vote with their perspective and that includes, in part, people who discovered reddit during the election, and people who have discovered subreddits they normally wouldn't have noticed or cared about.

       Are you saying this is an organized effort? I think it's just people suck, and social media is just an echo chamber for sucky people. When social media didn't exist, there was a lot more effort involved in spreading ideas. That effort was a gatekeeper against sucky people that no longer exists.

       You can’t discuss politics on this site at all because you can’t objectively discuss the president. You will be downvotes for saying “Trump is planning on meeting with Kim Jong Un in May” because you didn’t use any negativity in your post. It’s crazy.

       It’s been taken over by political shills and corporations.  I see so many b.s ads for companies that get upvoted to the top of subs within hours and any negative comments buried with downvotes immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Whataburger employs a social media advertising agency called McGarrah Jesse.  They constantly spam Whataburger advertising all over any Texas related sub and they are always upvoted to the top within hours and all the comments read like advertisements.
