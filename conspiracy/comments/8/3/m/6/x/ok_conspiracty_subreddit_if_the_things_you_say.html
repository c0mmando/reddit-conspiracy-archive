       these people compile and interpret information that is freely available. if you want, check on the facts they offer.
it is in the nature of reporting that you trust the reporter to a certain extent. the times i tried to verify what jones said it was all accurate so i generally trust him now...

      <p>
       Jones and Icke both claim that the Illuminati have existed for long periods of time and operate today.  Unfortunately, the Illuminati was founded by Adam Weishaupt and was a short lived Enlightenment movement linked to freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones claims that Satanists are working towards a New World Order for the antichrist and all that garbage.  Satanists
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#Beliefs">
        don't even believe in Satan
       </a>
       , or any other deity for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Icke claims that the name
       <a href="http://bridgelove.www.50megs.com/bigsec-uk.html">
        Elizabeth comes from "El-Lizard-Birth", symbolizing that Queen Elizabeth was a reptilian

       .  Elizabeth
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/name/elizabeth">
        comes from Hebrew meaning "my God is an oath"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they make these claims totally rids them of any credibility whatsoever.  Now, they may say some things that are true, but if they go around saying this type of drivel, then they're only going to attract certain types of people, and certainly no one from mainstream society.

       Unless, as I point out in

       So I guess you agree, as most rational open-minded people do that there are some genuine conspiracies.  Barring of course Icke's lizard ramblings etc.

       You would be a supporter of Ron Paul's effort to audit the Federal Reserve, I assume.

       If I have an adversarial tone, it is certainly not intentional and I apologize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly have no doubt that there are genuine conspiracies.  For instance, if the official 9/11 report is correct, then that would be a conspiracy amongst the individuals who flew the planes into the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have most definitely been historic conspiracies within the US Government... in fact, we pay certain branches of the US Government to conspire for our interest, and sometimes they've conspired for their interest instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things are undoubtedly true, and in many cases the US Government has even admitted them.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are not the conspiracies I'm referring to.  I'm referring to "vast conspiracies" or several small conspiracies that have come together approaching that of a vast conspiracy.  The kind that are often brought up here on the conspiracy subreddit (often by reference to Alex Jones or David Icke).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the main point I'm trying to make here is that if there really are these types of conspiracies out there, why are the only sources of information related to them so incredibly... uh... ridiculous (i.e., the Satan/Reptilian stuff).  And why does this type of thing so thoroughly permeate this subreddit?  It becomes very difficult to find the signal within all of the noise.  Not to mention highly counterproductive in  trying to get people to see your side of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm asking that the conspiracy subreddit try to be more scientifically rigorous.  If this happened, I think that something useful could actually be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have been a supporter of Ron Paul for many years.

       a good idea, of course, in any endeavor to learn...the truth movement is filled with professionals from all areas of science, academia; scientists and researchers of significant, respected background...plus law enforcement, military, and others...and they, even with their rigorous, critical thinking, become marginalized and ridiculed--and worse,

       There are plenty of sources other than Alex Jones. The San Francisco Gate is a newspaper who reported on KBR building concentration camps in the United States, and naming specific government officials promoting this, in Feb 08. I don't regularly listen to Alex Jones but watched a video of his talking about marshal law in the US and knew exactly what he was talking about when he described specific things like NORTHCOM and Posse Comitatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of credible sources and public documents. Look at the recently released Bush memos which conspired to overthrow our government (the Constitution). Open your fucking eyes.

       How about Carroll Quigley's book, Tragedy and Hope? Quigley was Bill Clinton's mentor, and in his magnum opus he explains how the planet is really run, he used internal CFR documents for this. I suggest you start there. He explains the world is run through a network of round table groups at which influential people meet eachother and make policy decisions, this system grew out of the British Empire and was also implemented in the US, through the CFR. Because the major figures in the major parties are all members, nothing ever changes since the policies are discussed at these round table groups and they come to a consensus there, most of the debate you see is just political manoeuvring. When it comes to really important decisions, like invading Iraq, they're already made at Bilderberg. There are enough credible sources. The problem is people never come across them because they're send a Google Video documentary of a guy who claims to know how the world works holding a presentation. Yes, these people are often right and they make good points and it's good these video's are out there, but the downside is that a lot of people who receive these video's from their friends (rightly so) think "this is not a credible source".

       I'm glad you said this.  I realized that I have not said or indicated it, but I agree wholeheartedly!  Unfortunately it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have an impact on how the mainstream consumer sees them.  Ad hominem attacks work quite well on the national news stations...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no matter how true a claim they might make, it will
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       actually surface into the mass media.  Because they've essentially made so many ridiculous claims that it would take approximately three seconds to completely discredit anything they had to say.

       If you watch the Jones video about the Bohemian Grove, you can clearly see that the organization has some bizarre occult rituals (effigy burning before a giant stone owl) and that many of the world's most powerful people are provably members.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like docsavage96 pointed out, someone with Alex Jones' background will reduce "weird occult" to "Satanism" because that's the filter he was raised see through.  Obviously it has nothing to do with modern, Levay style Satanism which acknowledges no deity at all.  But in fact Jones says, more specifically, in that video that the model is actually Moloch or Baal, and so acknowledges that he did not mean modern Levay Satanism (which we all know is goofy and harmless).

       Uh... not at all.  I'm just not a 9/11 conspiracy theorist -- loose change completely neglects numerous facts.  Not to mention the sheer number of people that would be required to be involved and keep it secret.  It seems like to be a conspiracy believer you have to believe that large numbers of government people are capable of functioning very well towards a common goal.  Having some experience in government work I am highly skeptical of this even being possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       "silly ass little post"?  I'm asking a sincere question here.  I understand the viewpoint and in some cases it may not even be
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       far off (although I would tend to lean towards the explanation being ineptitude rather than well-functioning maliciousness), but inevitably you guys cite some wackball like David Icke who claims that shape-shifting reptilian aliens are running the country and that the name "Elizabeth" comes from "El Lizard Birth".  Granted, Alex Jones is certainly more reasonable than Icke, but his idea is that a bunch of Satanists took hold of the government through generations of secret societies and are working towards building the earth up for the antichrist.  I mean, come on!
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that I think you guys have some valid ideas, but you marginalize yourselves every time you present information like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless, that's the point...  Maybe Icke and Jones are actually part of the conspiracy and are mixing real information with wackjob crazy shit to make it all seem unbelievable to the mainstream masses.  This would actually go right along with the Jesuit idea (at least according to
       <em>
        Foucault's Pendulum
       </em>
       by Umberto Eco) of "if you fear something, create it, then you can minimize its damage."  Hmm... now
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       actually an interesting idea -- and I'm not even a conspiracy theorist.

       You made the post to be a dick in the first place you schmuck.  You came here to bust people's balls who know your relatives blew up the buildings.  It bothers you that they know that, so you get on here and act like a douche bag.  If all you wanted to do is learn about it, you'd just read all about it and learn how absurd the official story is because it's riveting stuff.  You're a wise ass, and you are actually... a little afraid of what so many completely normal people believe right now.

       Wow!  Uh... As I said, I'm not here for that reason; therefore, I'm not going to get involved in a petty flame war or name calling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been subscribed to this subreddit since it's inception and I do read things in here.  And I have read a lot of other things about conspiracy, some that was actually good.  I'm trying to learn more because everything has generally been so mixed in with the Satan/Alien/Reptilian stuff that it's like searching for a needle in a haystack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess this is sort of a call to action to be more rigorous and rational about things and not so emotionally attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, it seems that I'm failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As your focus seems to primarily be about 9/11 and Jews and not the vast conspiracies I'm referring to I'll bid you good day.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, btw, I'm an atheist of anglo descent -- not that it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, on second thought, I am intrigued as to why antisemitism would come into play.  Even if you believe in a conspiracy that includes Jews, it couldn't possibly include every Jewish person in existence, and would have to include numerous non-Jewish people as well. I also suspect, that many rationalist Jews would revolt against this type of conspiracy...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why would you specifically attack people based on their mother's religion/ethnicity rather than their involvement in the conspiracy you're referring to?

       Look into William Cooper's broadcast where he predicts 9/11 (it's called "William Cooper predicts 9/11" or something) on Youtube. At the end this idiot calls in blaming the Jews for everything and Cooper annihilates him.

       Here's a video of both Alex Jones and William Cooper discussing how it's not the Jews (or any other race or religion, for that matter):

       Furthermore, here's a video of William Cooper "exposing Alex Jones as scaremonger":

        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAgTFWglHrc&amp;amp;feature=related
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  The more I think about this, the less convinced I am about these 9/11 predictions having any weight.  As I recall, the pilot episode of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lone_Gunmen_(TV_Series)#9.2F11_Parallel">
        The Lone Gunmen
       </a>
       also discussed a similar plot.  This wasn't such a complex attack that no one had ever imagined it before.  The fact that these guys predicted it would be pinned on Osama bin Laden could have been based on the fact that he'd been in the news quite a bit as a terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, as I recall, back in the early 90s when the Patriot and Militia movements came to the forefront, they predicted a number of similar things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        false flag attacks
       </li>
       <li>
        concentration camps
       </li>
       <li>
        various New World Order ideas
       </li>
       <li>
        tracking of citizens through bar codes on VINs

       Thanks, doc.  I appreciate you taking the time to provide this info.  I think that we largely disagree on some key points though...  Here are my thoughts:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Yes.  Alex Jones is obsessed with a Satanic / Illuminati conspiracy.  That's exactly why I compared him to David Icke in the post title.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Ok, I believe that you're sincere in the last part of that, but why would you go and try to sound like a religious nutjob by referring to it as the "mark of the beast"?  When you do that it sounds like you're one of these guys that believes that a book written around 96 CE contains prophesy of literal events to come...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would a conspiracy try to go along with a prophecy like the "mark of the beast" which would only serve to freak out and piss off the HUGE percentage of the world population that are Christians?  If I were behind a grandiose conspiracy, I'd try to
       <em>
        avoid
       </em>
       pissing off something like a third of the world's population.

       It's a fun book, but unfortunately it was written by John Perkins... who also wrote such reputable and realistic books as:
       <em>
        Psychonavigation: Techniques for Travel Beyond Time
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Shapeshifting: Shamanic Techniques for Global and Personal Transformation
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, NSA doesn't actually do that sort of thing.  NSA is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA">
        tasked
       </a>
       with Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA).  If this were to have happened at all, it would have fallen under the purview of a the CIA, which is tasked with Human Intelligence (HUMINT), and what he's describing would be NOC type work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, numerous people have come forth with hard data showing that many of his claims are entirely fictional.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly the type of stuff that seems to make it more difficult to find any valid information.  Everything is so saturated with claims from people like Perkins and Jones that it's become nearly impossible to weed out anything remotely true...  Furthermore, these claims get repeated so much (despite readily available evidence that completely debunks them) that everyone starts believing them.  It really becomes the proverbial needle in a haystack.

       Wow, I feel like a dick.  I just realized that when you were saying "mark of the beast" you were quoting me when I was kinda making fun of that type of usage.  So, I take back that whole section...  I'm so used to hearing it used as an actual reference to Revelation that I reacted rather than to really try to listen to what you were saying.  So, I apologzie once again!

       Your confusion hinges on the world "credible."  It is assumed that because a news outlet is large and well known, that it is credible and telling the truth.  This is absolutely not the case.  Google Operation Mockingbird.  The CIA has been controlling the media since the 40s.  Carl Bernstein wrote extensively about this in the 70s and one CIA director said "the CIA owns everyone of any significance in the major media."
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that, most of what most people believe is not true.  We are told that many things are true that are simply not so.  Dig beneath the surface.  If you really want to know, you will find out.

       I understand why you assume that's my perspective but it's not.  I'm not calling big news outlets credible at all.  I'm saying that the primary people who get heard from around here are people like Alex Jones and David Icke who have a long documented history of spewing rubbish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure that there's plenty out there, it's just really hard to find when something like 90% of the posts here are links to infowars.com.  If the conspiracy subreddit really wanted to get things done and find things out it seems like the best approach would be to handle it like any scientific inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Don't take me wrong, Alex Jones is fun and entertaining, but the guy believes all sorts of wacked out shit and often reports hypotheses as fact.  Icke, of course, is just downright silly.)

       It's hard for me to believe that anyone who really wants to find things out is as helpless as you make yourself out to be.  It does take time, but it's not impossible.

      <p>
       You can start with my site,
       <a href="http://www.sheilacasey.com">
        http://www.sheilacasey.com
       </a>
       . Obviously I believe there is strong evidence for everything I've posted there. I've spent thousands of hours researching and cross-checking to reach the views I currently hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with you about Alex Jones.  Sure he is loud, but he is also incredibly well educated about facts the MSM keeps hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Winston Churchill said, "there is no such thing as public opinion.  Only published opinion."
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no way of knowing what the mass of humanity believes, other than what is filtered through our media.  But it's a loop-- since most people are afraid of holding an unpopular opinion, once the media has labeled a certain opinion as unpopular, few people will speak it out loud.  Hence the phenomenon of "closet truthers."

       I'm completely turned off by David Icke too, but some people have suggested that the alien bullshit is a cover, to somehow try to avoid assassination while spreading some truths to those who figure it out, or gone a little further to say that the whole reptile race thing is just a metaphor for Jews or Zionists.

       The issue is this, there are many reliable sources, they come out all the time. The facts are easy to see. But, as soon as they do come out they are automatically dumped into the conspiracy theory category and immediately disbelieved and discredited.

       Yes, this is exactly my point.  Unfortunately, mixing one piece of useful information in with 90 articles from infowars.com is exactly what is marginalizing anything that might actually be true.  At the end of the day, if these ideas were approached in a skeptical, rigorous, and scientific way a few things would happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Conspiracy theorists wouldn't be in a constant PR war just trying to not look like they're crazy.
       </li>
       <li>
        They wouldn't push away 99% of the population.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that the guys that are regurgitating stuff from Alex Jones, David Icke, and in a few cases the White Nationalist Movement are screwing over the entire idea of this subreddit, and everybody else seems to be upvoting away.  I mean, really, why is this thread voted at 2 points (10 up, 8 down at this time) vs
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/83kk5/video_emergency_broadcast_new_world_order_ahead/">
        this video
       </a>
       (at 36 upvotes and 4 downvotes) which merely repackages the same old stuff
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the way things are done around here change, then the results may change as well.   Since there have been approximately zero results it might be a good idea.

       I have to say I agree with you. You want a creditable conspiracy sub-reddit with creditable stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to say that although Alex Jones and infowars are often tossed aside as no credit conspiracies they do bring to the surface a lot of creditable reports on a daily basis regarding the topic. But Alex Jones can be quite over bearing.

       The barrier between bringing real true conspiracies to the surface to expose and irradiate them, lies in the fact that most people would rather not know. They're happy with there perception of reality and it's easier to say your just a crazy conspiracy theorist than to even look at the real evidence that's out there.

       Look at Nixon/Watergate though...  People
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want to know.  They just don't want to be associated with people that think the TV is watching them.

      <p>
       Maybe one thing we could do is change some of the terminology.  Since "conspiracy theorist" already means something between "conspiracy conjecturist" and "crazy bastard" it seems like it'd be hard to redefine it (see how well the old "hacker" vs. "cracker" thing worked).  So maybe something like "skeptical conspiracy investigator" or "conspiracy skeptic".
      </p>
      <p>
       On second thought, it probably shouldn't have the word "conspiracy" in it at all, due to mainstream dismissal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe just "skeptical investigator"?  Any ideas?  I tend to not be very good at naming things or giving titles to things...

       EDIT: I guess what I'm really looking for is quality, unbiased, non-politically-charged investigative journalism...  it's a shame that went extinct in the media.

       Hey, I'm new to conspiracy stuff and in the same viewpoint as you and Dave. I dislike the over the top-ness of Alex Jones and Icke. Especially with the fact that they are making more money than needed with their sheeple. Infowars.com has like 50 ads on the front page...lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the pdf was long as hell, but are you suyre about that article? What country do you live in? I guess not the US? Because here we have six or seven companies that own 90%+ of the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the USA, we have:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        GE - owns NBC Universal. Huge Movie Studio.
       </li>
       <li>
        News Corp - owns Fox, Dow Jones, WSJ, Myspace. Huge movie studio.
       </li>
       <li>
        CBS and Viacom - they own a ton of cable channels, CBS, Showtime, a ton of radio stations, Cnet, and a few other stuff.
       </li>
       <li>
        Disney - own ABC, and spews out all that bullshit Disney tween stars that ruin our children s minds. I won't be letting my kids watch that BS. Huge Movie studio, music too.
       </li>
       <li>
        Time Warner AOL - Lots of online properties, HBO, the whole CNN + a gazillion other cable channels, half of CW, a huge movie studio, maybe music?
       </li>
       <li>
        Sony - Huge in the movie and music business.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The only thing left is newspapers. Most will fold up and become tiny. The one or two remaining US papers will be bought up by conglomerates.

       agreed.  "Skeptical of the Official Message" .. or maybe you can say that in a catchier way.  "Off Message" ?

       I'm not sure I like this title...  Most conspiracy activists are already skeptical of the official message... to the extent that it seems like in their logic the fact that something was included in the official message is
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       of it not being true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean "skeptical" in the scientific sense:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like a scientist, a scientific skeptic attempts to evaluate claims based on verifiability and falsifiability rather than accepting claims on faith, anecdotes, or relying on unfalsifiable categories.
       </p>
       <p>

       I would like to add one thing about a "vast conspiracy" though. A vast conspiracy would not necessarily require that the lead conspirators be a huge group. It would only require that the leaders have a huge network of subordinates willing to accept orders hoping to please their bosses and move up in the ranks or possibly, in some cases, be under the threat of extortion or even violence. It would not even be necessary for most subordinates to know why they are doing what they are doing or what effect it might have. Basically it would be a top down hierarchical structure as is found in a military where only the generals know the big picture.

       either way...  Although, Icke has made it
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_humanoid#David_Icke">
        abundantly clear
       </a>
       that he's referring to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        7-foot (2.1 m) tall, blood-drinking reptilian humanoids from the star system Alpha Draconis are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy directed at humanity. The reptilians maintain their control through the generation of fear and negative emotion, which is food to these entities, by manufacturing conflicts, primarily wars. [Icke] contends that most of the world's leaders are in fact related to these reptilians. Icke's theories now have supporters in 47 countries and he frequently gives lectures to crowds of 2500 or more

My actual point was more along the lines of "I'm interested in what you have to say, please say it in a more clear way and without this Satan/Alien stuff."

       It's hard for me to believe that anyone who really wants to find things out is as helpless as you make yourself out to be.  It does take time, but it's not impossible.

       You can start with my site,
       <a href="http://www.sheilacasey.com">
        http://www.sheilacasey.com
       </a>
       . Obviously I believe there is strong evidence for everything I've posted there. I've spent thousands of hours researching and cross-checking to reach the views I currently hold.

       I disagree with you about Alex Jones.  Sure he is loud, but he is also incredibly well educated about facts the MSM keeps hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Winston Churchill said, "there is no such thing as public opinion.  Only published opinion."
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no way of knowing what the mass of humanity believes, other than what is filtered through our media.  But it's a loop-- since most people are afraid of holding an unpopular opinion, once the media has labeled a certain opinion as unpopular, few people will speak it out loud.  Hence the phenomenon of "closet truthers."

       I'm completely turned off by David Icke too, but some people have suggested that the alien bullshit is a cover, to somehow try to avoid assassination while spreading some truths to those who figure it out, or gone a little further to say that the whole reptile race thing is just a metaphor for Jews or Zionists.
