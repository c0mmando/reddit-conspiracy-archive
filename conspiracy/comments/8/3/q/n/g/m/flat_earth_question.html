I don&#39;t personally believe in it, and I&#39;m not here to shit on it either cause I don&#39;t really care that much honestly but my question is, if the earth is flat, why would that need to be covered up? For example, when people were posting the vid of the tesla floating around in space and it shows earth as being round, and people very quickly were stating it&#39;s fake. Just confused as to why nasa, the gov, etc. would be covering up somthing like the shape of the planet we live on? Not trying to start a war here just want to hear people&#39;s thoughts!</p>

<p>Lets go back  to before the 2016 election.   Random people were coming here because the MSM &quot;news&quot; was so obviously slanted that this was one of the few places balance maintained a foothold, and it was becoming obvious.</p>

<p>Paid shills started flooding this sub and intentionally spammed Flat Earth posts into the feed 5-6 times per hour.  This was an obvious attempt to discredit this sub with the constant floating of BULLSHIT to muddy the waters and detract from the valuable information found here. </p>

<p>Flat Earth is weaponized disinformation. I dont fucking tolerate it. No one here should. </p>

<p>This sub IS for free discussion of conspiracy theories,  but that doesnt mean we need to open the door and invite COINTELPRO to come in and shit on the living room floor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not vouching for one over the other.</p>

<p>The other <em>Camp</em> has a stationary, reasonably flat plane with no settled Map or Outer/Extra Land Shape. Dome or no dome is squabbled about as well. The Middle Earth is represented to a degree with the North Pole or also <em>outer reaches</em> beyond an Ice wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm, i guess you didnt read the wiki page :-)</p>

<p>anyway, it just so happens that both the earth and the satellite rotate at the same rate, in synchron, so the satellite is always above the same spot on the surface of the earth, somewhere along the equator, never drifting away. almost like they are chained together by an invisible tether.  so, since the satellite is always locked in the same position, the satellite dish will point at it day after day, after day without ever needing any adjustment...</p>

<p>it is actually funny, but if you look up in the sky you can see them with your naked eyes evey night when there are no clouds and you are away from light pollution.  sometimes there are five visible at the same time. i also saw the iss with my unaided eyes. boom boom boom.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t have to prove anything as there is no proof satellites are hovering in space. Rockets may go up but they come right back down and there is plenty of video evidence showing this.

    <div class="md"><p>it is really their pv panels that are visible to the naked eye, you can see their reflected  light gradually fading in and out as they move in and out of alignment between you and the sun as they traverse the sky. also you might engage in a bit of night time photography to further your knowledge about the world you live in: when you take long exposures of about half an hour or so from a tripod, you can tell the sateliites from the stars by the straight trajectories they make while the stars rotate around the celestial poles.</p>

<p>what do you think, between trusting my own eyes and the photos i took, and you, what will i pick?</p>

<p>i also took long exposure night time photos in the southern hemisphere and there is a celestial pole there as well, and guess what?  it is not the polaris. i could find and identify the polaris ever since i was a child btw.<br/>
this couldnt happen on a flat earth. hopefully you will grow out of this primitive belief eventually.</p>

The signals originate from the ground and then are bounced off the &quot;ionosphere&quot; to be received back on the ground.

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it like the movie Escape from New York.  You are locked up with all the rest of the cursed created beings who&#39;s ancestors or they directly used their free will to disobey God.  If you are born into a prison island because your parents did something wrong you are still born on prison island.  Prison island is run by the biggest, baddest created being of all that fell (Lucifer).  He doesn&#39;t want you to know the truth so he sets up the prison with a false reality to distract humanity from the truth.  Our job here is to realize why we are here and what needs to be done to escape.  God only wants to be worshiped by creations who choose to do so with their free will.  Not by robots that are forced to.</p>

<p>The answer to that is found in the King James Bible.  Jesus Christ is literally the door out:</p>

<p>Joh_10:9  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>

<p>All one needs to do to enter the door is repent of their current state and believe the Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>This means there is nothing you can do to save yourself.  You must trust in what Jesus Christ (God who came in the flesh) did for you already.  He was the final, perfect blood sacrifice to pay for all sin (the curse).</p>

<p>The real &quot;Big Bang&quot; happens at the end after Judgement.  God&#39;s kingdom will never stop expanding.  Saved people will be able to explore the universe in their glorified bodies.  Lucifer has everyone dreaming of this now while it is not possible and also using it to hide the greatest evidence of God&#39;s existence (his creation itself).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is Isaiah 53 perfectly describes Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Isa 52:13  Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. 
Isa 52:14  As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 
Isa 52:15  So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</p>

<p>He will sprinkle many nations.  A reference to the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice.  He also was exulted above everything.  In the future he will return as King of Kings, bring back the Kingdom of Heaven, and raise David to rule once again and Israel will have peace for eternity.</p>

<p>Isa 53:3  He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. </p>

<p>He was rejected and crucified by Israel&#39;s religious leaders at the time.</p>

<p>Isa 53:4  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 
Isa 53:5  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. </p>

<p>He suffered for us.  Carried our sorrows.  He took the chastisement that we deserve.  His stripes heal us.</p>

<p>Isa 53:6  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </p>

<p>All our sin was laid o him.</p>

<p>Isa 53:7  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p>

<p>He was the perfect lamb of God.  He didn&#39;t try to defend himself.  He is the final blood sacrifice for all sin.</p>

<p>Isa 53:9  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 
Isa 53:10  Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</p>

<p>He was innocent but sill took all our sin.  Again, more reference to  him being the sacrificial lamb.</p>

<p>Isa 53:11  He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. </p>

<p>Many are justified by him and not of themselves.</p>

<p>Isa 53:12  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

<p>More about his taking our sins.  He is the only intercessor between us and the Father.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in&quot; Is. 40:22
<strong>They focus on the use of the word &quot;circle&quot;.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. - Matthew 4:8
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth. - Daniel 4:11

<li><p>&quot;And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.&quot; - Joshua 10:13
**For the sun to appear to stop, then that means the Earth would have to stop spinning. That has... numerous issues. It&#39;s TECHNICALLY possible for the Flat Earth Sun to stop while not creating issues for people on the Flat Earth. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen the argument that flat earth is being covered up because if the earth was flat it would somehow make people turn to god.</p>

<p>Where in the bible does it say the earth is flat? Best I can find is mentions of “four corners of the earth”, but even then that’s not exactly proof, you could equally look at it as just a saying that means “the furthest part of the planet we know about”</p>

<p>I also don’t see why the earth being flat would turn anybody towards god. There’s plenty of people who believe in god now so why would the earth not being round make people care more about god?</p>

<p>To me the flat earth agenda is being pushed by NASA. Some of the footage looks awful (especially the ISS stuff). That’s not to say I believe NASA haven’t been to the moon or anything like that, just that some of the footage looks poor.</p>

<p>NASA released the footage and conflated people who question the footage with flat earth believers. Obviously once you do that the general public will dismiss any criticism of the footage as they won’t want to be lumped in with flat earthers.</p>

<p>Even if the NASA footage is 100% fake that doesn’t mean the earth is flat. The Greeks realised the earth was round thousands of years ago. Even if photographic proof doesn’t exist it doesn’t mean it’s not round</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the system exists to destroy the inherent purpose of what ist is to be human and free. As well as to keep people divided by race/country/anything imaginable</p>

<p>The ones who rule campaign to destroy anything and everything that says &quot;You, as a human, are significant.&quot;</p>

<p>They destroy God and religion, moving towards all people putting their faith into them, the gov, TPTB, what have you. Fits NWO agenda, faith in the gov is the same as religion.</p>

<p>They want you to think you are a random occurrence in an infinite universe with no significance whatsoever.</p>

<p>This belief can take away a mans purpose. It makes it more easily to say &quot;whatever, nothing matters any way&quot;  and use that as rationalization for almost anything. (drinking, smoking, not critical thinking, etc etc)</p>

<p>If the earth were flat, that would mean we are part of a system created for us, and that our decisions DO matter. It would also prove some sort of creator, whatever that may be, it also works perfectly in the simulation hypothesis.</p>

<p>Most of all, it would bring every human closer in that we would all be part of a special family, which regardless of anything we are. </p>

<p>We know there agenda is to divide, and kill one&#39;s purpose, it keeps the people docile and helpless and hopeless. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want people to have a purpose, they also need people to be divided.</p>

<p>That one of the big reasons they would lie about it.</p>

<p>It is rooted in spirituality which is why I believe a lot of creationists have gotten behind it, as well as why everyone else hates it so much.</p>

<p>I am just playing devil&#39;s advocate here so no need to flame. </p>

You&#39;re saying that all of this stuff you learned in school is proof and I&#39;m telling you that school indoctrinates concepts in your mind that aren&#39;t based in reality. They taught you the shape of the world and then taught you the math you should use to confirm that theory. That&#39;s not very scientific is it? We should teach the basic skills of math and reading and then let the kids come to conclusions on their own.

    <div class="md"><p>I learned math. The world has been measured by hand.</p>

<p>To not agree is to be ignorant of history and math stupid. </p>

<p>Can you replicate the math Eratosthenes used (even if he was wrong)?</p>

<p>Can you calculate the size of a sphere from one length and two angles?</p>

<p>I bet you you cant.</p>

<p>Wilfully ignorant or just a unlucky role of the genetic dice.</p>

<p>Do you have a single documented known mistake on a map?  Distances and altitudes would be different on a flat earth than they are on a sphere.</p>

<p>For instance the distance between say two distant cities on the ocean and the peak of Mount Everest. But trying to use Pythagorean math and Euclidean geometry you would notice an error. But if you use spherical algebra that error goes away. </p>

<p>You are basically coming to the table saying *arithmetic&quot; is a lie, without supplying an alternative.</p>

<p>Math isn&#39;t dogma. It is right or wrong.</p>

<p>So to deny this without any other math to replace it is just stupid. </p>

<p>Really really stupid. Knowingly so. Wilful ignorance. Like a warm blanket on a cold day some find comfort in being ignorant... somehow. </p>

<p>But I seriously doubt most flat earth proponents can even grasp this notion.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t understand doesn&#39;t make it wrong.</p>

<p>Formulate an alternative and we can talk. Denial is not debate. It is childish banter. You decide.</p>

<p>1) Why would the government and scientific establishment cover up the shape of the Earth? That is not knowable without more information, so all that you will get is speculation. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example that resurfaced recently on r/conspiracy.  <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/377870-CIAs-plan-to-retrieve-a-Soviet-submarine-from-the-ocean-floor-prospects-for-deep-sea-mining">https://www.sott.net/article/377870-CIAs-plan-to-retrieve-a-Soviet-submarine-from-the-ocean-floor-prospects-for-deep-sea-mining</a>   . If you had taken a look at the plans for deep sea mining and determined that it was bullshit, somebody may have asked you what motivation Howard Hughes and co. would have to fake such a thing. And you would probably never come up with the correct answer of &quot;to retrieve an exploded Russian submarine that wasn&#39;t publicized, but the US found out about because it has a network of underwater listening devices that were able to locate the explosion.&quot; </p>

<p>2) What motivation does NASA and Tesla have for faking space videos. Again it&#39;s speculative, but that one has a clear-cut obvious reason. Money, duh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen the argument that flat earth is being covered up because if the earth was flat it would somehow make people turn to god.</p>

<p>Where in the bible does it say the earth is flat? Best I can find is mentions of “four corners of the earth”, but even then that’s not exactly proof, you could equally look at it as just a saying that means “the furthest part of the planet we know about”</p>

<p>I also don’t see why the earth being flat would turn anybody towards god. There’s plenty of people who believe in god now so why would the earth not being round make people care more about god?</p>

<p>To me the flat earth agenda is being pushed by NASA. Some of the footage looks awful (especially the ISS stuff). That’s not to say I believe NASA haven’t been to the moon or anything like that, just that some of the footage looks poor.</p>

<p>NASA released the footage and conflated people who question the footage with flat earth believers. Obviously once you do that the general public will dismiss any criticism of the footage as they won’t want to be lumped in with flat earthers.</p>

<p>Even if the NASA footage is 100% fake that doesn’t mean the earth is flat. The Greeks realised the earth was round thousands of years ago. Even if photographic proof doesn’t exist it doesn’t mean it’s not round</p>
