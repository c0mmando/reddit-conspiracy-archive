       On 9/11, the WTC towers came crashing down to earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching over them that day, right across the street, was a
       <strong>
        gigantic black monolith.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This building, the Millenium Hilton, is styled to look just like the curious object from Stanley Kubrick's
       <em>
        2001: A Space Odyssey
       </em>
       , which was released 33 years before the towers came down.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <em>
        2001
       </em>
       the black monolith signals/preempts the
       <strong>
        spiritual ascension
       </strong>
       of the creatures who touch it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the odds that a film named '2001' would feature a strange object which would later stand before the WTC complex which came down 2001?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just the tip of the iceberg.
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ykw7GiG.jpg">
        A relevant image collage
       </a>
       reveals a host of 'coincidences' which any sane, objective person will have a hard time explaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like short videos which pack a punch,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ULjJ3EqyY">
        this video
       </a>
       has a habit of blowing peoples minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question is: how do
       <strong>
        YOU
       </strong>
       explain the 9/11 black monolith?

       Yes, Neo's passport does expire on September 11, 2001, in a film released in 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the odds of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the beginning of the film, Neo is seen using a hollowed-out copy of Jean Baudrillard's treatise 'Simulacra and Simulation'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baudrillard wrote about the inherent duality of the nature of existence, and in a 1985 piece specifically asked the question: 'why does the World Trade Centre have TWO towers?'

       It was a subtle reminder of the ploy that the PTB (powers that be) are trying to do.

       I'd say they're about 30% there.  I would say more, but we're still living in a "developed" nation..though they are doing a hell of a job keeping us distracted and lowering our testosterone levels with the shit we wear, eat and drink.

       I noticed something in the 1998 Godzilla the other day too (crap movie). At the scene when they are luring Godzilla with a pile of fish, the main guy (Nick?) looks at his watch and the time is 9:11. This is when Godzilla first enters the centre of the city, fights the military and causes a bunch of damage.

       Well, in that case, thanks for policing our comment sections and keeping us on track. There really is no place for humor here after all. What would we do without watchful protectors like yourself? Doing it only because it's the
       <em>
        right
       </em>
       thing to do. We'd be totally lost. Thank you for your service.

       Keep in mind - the answer to this depends on the scope of the question. Were the matrix the only piece of entertainment to mention a birthday, that would be a truly remarkable coincidence. But given the huge amount of content Hollywood has put out, synchronities are guaranteed to happen.

       It's like winning the lottery. From
       <strong>
        your
       </strong>
       perspective, it's an extremely unlikely event. But nonetheless, there is an
       <strong>
        extremely high
       </strong>
       likelihood that
       <strong>
        someone

       will win the lottery.
      </p>

       In fact, statistically it would be shocking if no one won. Similarly, given the huge amount of movies put out, it would be extremely shocking if we

       That movie is a mystery school presentation of their religion. It's not shocking that an obelisk was looming over the event that marked the ending of the old world order. They put it there to mock us. And why aren't we rioting in the streets? Where is the civil disobedience?

       I’ve probably watched about 5 hours of TV in past five years, yet when I visit somewhere with one on, it is amazing how it instantly transforms my perspective into a fabric or story with an emotional response - the commercials only add to it (that familiar feeling of being annoyed and craving the programming).

       The movie depicts the philosophy of Luciferianism. It's the doctrine of the Mysteries. What was imparted unto those primitive "man" by touching that obelisk was the gift of intellect: the knowledge of right and wrong -- given to them by Lucifer.

       Well, first off I was only talking about the odds of the birthday synchronicity. And also, that is a distinct conversation from whether or not the matrix has esoteric meaning (which i believe it does, especially given the Gnostic references with the ship names). Which is a distinct conversation from this monolith. So there are three dissent topics at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the building, quick googling shows construction was started in 1990 and the building opened in 92. And from what I've noticed of skyscrapers in general, "rectangle" is a common shape and "black" is a common color. So again,it would actually be
       <strong>
        more
       </strong>
       surprising if there
       <strong>
        were not
       </strong>
       such a building nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my response to the op, it isn't really making any specific claims, so I'm not sure what to respond to. Perhaps the question "what are the odds...?" But again, it is misframed. A clearer way to phrase that question would be to omit the 2001 post and ask "what are the odds that i can find a movie using the symbolism of &lt;insert symbol of thing found near ground zero&gt;?" To which the answer is "pretty good." Because there have been a ton of movies. Were it not 2001 &amp; black rectangles, it would be some other film and some other symbol, because we humans are really good at finding connections and patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, the op is not really making any claims to respond to. Is the insinuation that the hotel was built a whole eleven years before nine eleven specifically to provide some spiritual symbolism, in which case not only were the attacks planned over a decade before they happened, but also the hotel owners and architects were in on it? That the twin towers were picked as a target because they were next to a black rectangle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you say that the hotel is styled after the monolith. Do you have a source for this? Do we really need to find a deeper reason for why a skyscraper is black and rectangular other than the fact that skyscrapers are often black and usually rectangular? This seems like a fully sufficient explanation.

       To be fair to OP, neither of those are similar proportions to his building.  I worked down the street from the Wabash building, it's pretty much square and I don't know the Manhattan one but from the image it looks square as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black square buildings are not uncommon, OPs building is uncommon in that it's very thin and....monolith like, like OP was mentioning.   I would never associate either of the buildings in your example with the monolith from 2001, but OPs is immediately recognizable in that regard.

       Excellent comment. Those who are trying to find any old black building and claim that they look similar to the Kubrick monolith are either taking the piss, or just not yet open-minded enough to consider the implications of what is being explored here.

       I'm not trying to obfuscate anything, I'm trying to do due diligence of at least some attempt of statistical analysis (though admittedly a lazy one, it was late and I was in bed). And play devil's advocate with a little consideration of Occam's razor thrown in. This is the opposite of obfuscation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for obfuscation, I pointed out that it was challenging to respond to anything specific because you hadn't made specific claims, just pointed out the synchronicity and made vague statements about deeper meaning therein. So if you want to avoid obfuscation, make a specific claim and back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the designer and the owners of the Hilton know about 9/11 all the way back before 1990? Did the people planning the attacks choose the twin towers specifically because the were next to a structure Kubrick used symbolically in 2001?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say that the building was "styled after" the monolith (yet you still haven't cited any sources here). Did the designer watch the film, realize the spiritual symbolism, know that he or she was building a structure next to the sight of a terrorist attack over a decade in the future, and decide then to use Kubrick's symbolism? Was Kubrick in on it too? Is it not simpler to consider that the architect just made a rectangular black skyscraper?

       I'm not sure what you mean by this. I'm trying to consider alternative positions and explanations. If you don't do this you can fall into self-deception. I'm not even disagreeing with you or saying that you're wrong about anything.

       I know for sure that they're almost always rectangular. So the color is really the only variable at play here. I'm no architect, but I don't feel that choosing to make their building black is a surprising thing.

      <p>
       Side note: the dimensions would be an interesting variable. Do the dimensions of the building match that if the monolith? Now

       I did this from bed last night. I may take a look later if I have time but it looks like another commenter may have even found a couple more. I don't really have knowledge of all the worlds cities off the top of my head but again, it's just the process of considering alternative possibilities instead of getting locked into one way of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to question your own ways of thinking, then you can do this yourself, instead of just accepting "I can only think of one other black rectangular building" and moving on. If you are
       <em>
        not

       interested in actually considering the likelihood of other possible scenarios and would rather just dig your heels, then by all means

       do this step.

       It would be fascinating to see if we could determine how many 'black monolith' style buildings there are around the world, and then determine how many history-changing major media events occurred in the calendar year 2001, and then crunch some number to work out a 'probability'.

       I am totally open to the possibility of these things. But I would feel like I'm being intellectually dishonest with myself if I were to simply accept them as gospel truth without hard evidence.

       It is indeed an interesting coincidence that the building next to the towers looked like the monolith from
       <em>
        2001
       </em>
       .  But to go from that to believing with certainty that the architect did so with the explicit intention of invoking Kubrick's symbolism to predict a terror attack is technically an act of faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, I'm not knocking it and I see the attraction in that line of thinking. But I tried looking for any evidence to take it out of the realm of faith and didn't have much luck. The architect's name is Eli Attia if you're interested in looking. If you can find anything directly connecting him to Kubrick I would genuinely be interested in reading/watching it

       Sure, but a lot of little poor pieces of evidence do not amount to good evidence. Also, this is still a matter of scoping. Given the vast amounts of films/books/video games/TV shows, the odds that for any given event, I'll be able to find at least one piece of pop culture with a lot of little coincidences get pretty darn good.

       Indeed, which is why keeping an open mind is always so important.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious what your thoughts on "little clues" in general is. I've been watching a lot of star trek recently and was considering where the enterprise's designation, NCC-1701 came from. That's 17.01 in dd.mm format, which is used in Europe/Germany, where Adam weishaupt began the Bavarian illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry and paints an extremely rosy picture of a post-scarcity pure communist society. In the show, the world has to go through global war and famine before entering a communist utopia. It also includes esoteric beliefs about the alien origin of life on earth. You can even
       <a href="http://strangersandaliens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/star-trek-generations.jpg">
        see the one eye symbolism in star trek movies
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, 1701 was 47 years before Adam Weishaupt was born. If you're interested, do some reading into the
       <a href="http://thesyncmovie.com/2017/01/so-it-began-with-the-number-47/">
        numerological significance of the number 47
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From that link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From a spiritual perspective, number 47 is a combination of the energies and attributes of number 4 and number 7. The vibrations of number 4 include those of productivity and application, inner-wisdom and practical-thinking, honesty and integrity, endurance and determination, conscientiousness and discipline. Number 4 also relates to our passion and drive in life. Number 7 brings the qualities of spiritual awakening and enlightenment, intuition and inner-knowing, psychic abilities and mysticism, independence and individualism, persistence of purpose and manifesting good fortune.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then later:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The Bible credits Jesus with 47 miracles.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Declaration of Independence has 47 sentences.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Could Gene Rodenberry have been using the number 1701 to simultaneously signal the 1/17 attacks (look up the Law of One) and also invoke the occult protections he believed he would receive outlined above by using the number 47 years apart from Weishaupt's birthday?

      <blockquote>

        .
       </p>

      <p>
       That episode aired 792 days after 9/11/2001... and

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616#cite_note-3">
        numeric designation of earth in the main Marvel Comic books universe
       </a>
       , given by prolific writer Alan Moore who was extremely influential in the comic book world. And what was the name of the Star Trek / X-Men crossover book, you ask? Why, none other than "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_X_(Star_Trek)">
        Planet X

       ". Yes, the very same name given to the fabled planet Nibiru...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you accept that in the powers that be broadcast events down to the specific date, then they have probably already told us about upcoming events. The new star trek show currently running has a ton of
       <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/star-trek-discovery/photos/1007691/take-a-closer-look-at-these-11-new-star-trek-discovery-posters/">
        one eye symbolism in the promotional material
       </a>
       . If star trek is predictive programming, then the date january 17th is probably significant. Given that next year is the ten year anniversary of the reboot, that seems like a pretty good candidate for the year part.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think the other "coincides" point to? I was able to connect Nibirui, the North Star, "Lord Jesus Christ", Weishaput's birthday and the "47" significance listed above. Could it be something about a fake invasion from Nibiru and a false "Jesus" savior who will promise a star trek utopia like the "north star/guiding light"?

       That's a lot to digest. The book I am currently reading has a section on science fiction as one style of cultural engineering. Occultists and posers hide their symbols and numerology in pop culture. I personally don't get too involved with numerology study since it is easy to get sloppy, and it's also unpersuasive to most people.

       Indeed. But I didn't start from any one of the people mentioned actually saying that they used actual symbolism (except maybe Alan Moore and 616, but even that's unclear and if true he was probably just trolling the religious types).
      </p>
      <p>
       I picked a random number from pop culture, and within a few minutes was able to cook up a conspiracy with every but as much evidence as OPs with just a few minutes and some Google-fu.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is to give perspective. I'm not assuming "case closed", like you said - it's that I'm aware of how hyper-good my mind is at finding connections, and how easy it is for us humans to find "coincidences" like this. If it weren't the enterprises designation, I'd probably be able to find some other random number, or something about the Vulcan hand symbol to build a network of coincidences on. Similarly, were it not the Hilton millennium tower, there would be some other thing nearby. This is just the nature of the
       <em>
        astronomically huge
       </em>
       number of data points reality has.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why having at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       level of actual evidence of deeper significance is
       <em>
        so vital
       </em>
       in considering which sets of "little clues" deserve further inspection. I don't inherently have any problem with op's conjecture, I found it very interesting, so I
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       try to follow the little clues and did some research on the architect (Eli Attia), but couldn't find any sort of thing about him even being in the occult, much less inspired by Kubrick. So unfortunately that puts OP's theory at the same level as the one I pulled out of my ass.

       I have indeed. Been into conspiracy theories for most of my adult life. The more I learned about my own human psychology and cognitive biases though, the more I began to realize why literally every conspiracy theory felt true to me, regardless of whether or not there was actual evidence. I was simply taking any given author I read at his/her word when they said that butterflies symbolize mk ultra programming (example. I all still pretty convinced of this though).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrast this with Masonic symbolism though, where we have actual Masons who have confirmed the symbolism

       your initial comment insinuated that I, by contrast to yourself, had seen the coincidences op provided, decided in my mind that it was bullshit, and thought "case closed". This frustrated me because that was not at all my thought process, and I hoped to defend myself by demonstrating why I'm hesitant to buy into "lots of little clues" on their own, and how that is
       <em>
        fundamentally different
       </em>
       from close-mindedly thinking "case closed". My frustration stems from being automatically pegged as "close minded" just because I don't come to the same conclusions as someone else (and automatically assuming that of someone can in it of itself be a form of close-mindedness).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if you consider that a waste of time, but I promise you that I am an earnest truth seeker trying to make sense of reality as much as anyone else is.

       You're discussing a single event, the Neo birthday.  There are scores of the synchronicities that all point to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is NOT the equivalent of the lottery, a single event, where yes there is an extremely high likelihood that someone will win the lottery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, movies have to shown some date, but the same date, over and over, that also happens to be the most major event in our lifetime?

       Well, suppose it had happened on the day before. You'd still be able to find a lot of synchronicities, it just wouldn't be the ones we have for 9/11. People would instead find tons of examples of 9/10 showing up in films, it would just no longer be neo's birthday, the overpass in Terminator, Lisa Simpson's pizza brochure, etc. - it would just be a different set. We just don't have a readily available list of 9/10 synchronicities because no one's been looking for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly if it had happened on 9/9 or 9/12, we'd rapidly find yet another set of examples of those numbers showing up in movies.

       I feel ya.  These are all coincidences in a chain of coincidences which will never amount to more than a coincidence among a sea of other coincidences.  Maybe you're right?  If so, I think there are subs where one can discuss coincidences as merely being coincidences.

       My personal take is a resolve to agnosticism in life in general, with the exception of close, personal, yet shared experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could very well be that some huge group of in-the-know people are orchestrating world events, putting esoteric symbols everywhere, and putting significant hints on the passports of fictional character (though this seems incredibly ridiculous. If you're going to do that, wouldn't you have that be part of the plot or something? Idk...).
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also very well be that, since humans suck at cooperation, there is no highly coordinated grand global conspiracy, the world is mostly just unorganized chaos of self-serving individuals, and our human skill of noticing patterns that lower animals can't is getting turned up to 11 and going overboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, it could be something else that none of us have even
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       of. It is kind of hubristic for me think think that
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       have an accurate grasp of "The Truth".
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is most likely somewhere in the middle of all that.

       Keep reading my friend.  I get you want to have a personal philosophy of agnosticism, but that can only be maintained without info.  The more you know, the less one can remain agnostic.

       I used to think that there was, for multiple years. I was hugely into all things Illuminati/NWO/etc. But the more I learned about epistemology, psychology, culture, cognitive biases, philosophy, etc. The more I began to doubt my own ability to truly
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like, taken to the extreme, I can't technically prove anything beyond the simple fact that I exist (shout out to Descartes!). I can't even know that i didn't come into existence a nanosecond ago (shout out to "last-thursday-ism), my senses aren't fooling me 24/7 (shout out to Nick Bostrum and simulation theory!).
      </p>
      <p>
       This all gave me a multi-month existential crisis one winter (seasonal affective disorder was also definitely at play) but now I am much happier and a lot less stringent about my beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for more information being a path to enlightenment, I only agree to a point. Perhaps information has led the conspiracy community to the truth. Or perhaps, for all I know, all the information about Bohemian Grove, the builderberg meetings, 9/11 truth, mk ultra, etc - perhaps
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was also a psy-ops, an incredibly successful one. Perhaps the real Illuminati has successfully hidden themselves so well and have even fooled all the conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps the truth is just un-knowable enough that I should just go get coffee with a friend, go for a walk on the beach, whatever, instead of being obsessed with finding something that I can't ultimately be sure of anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       My contentment in life, happiness, relationships, etc all improved a ton when I accepted this

       Some stories say dragons are red, some stories say dragons are green.  Some stories say the dragons soar in the air, some say they swim in the sea.  Some stories say the dragons are as big as a galleon, others say as small as a wagon.

       Because there's a ton of movies, tv shows, books, and video games. So there's a ton of random numbers ripe to be seen as synchronicities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just off the top of my head since i was watching star trek last night. Let's pretend something happened on January 17th. That's 17.01 in dd.mm format, which is used in Germany, where Adam weishaupt began the Bavarian illuminati. Also, it's the USA number of the enterprise in star trek.
      </p>
      <p>
       Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry as a predictive programming exercise to make us want the new world order. In the show, the world has to go through global war and famine before entering a communist utopia. It also includes esoteric beliefs about the alien origin of life on earth. You can even
       <a href="http://strangersandaliens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/star-trek-generations.jpg">
        see the one eye symbolism in star trek movies
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, 1701 was 47 years before Adam Weishaupt was born. If you're interested in going down the rabbit hole, do some reading into the
       <a href="http://thesyncmovie.com/2017/01/so-it-began-with-the-number-47/">
        numerological significance of the number 47
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From that link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        From a spiritual perspective, number 47 is a combination of the energies and attributes of number 4 and number 7. The vibrations of number 4 include those of productivity and application, inner-wisdom and practical-thinking, honesty and integrity, endurance and determination, conscientiousness and discipline. Number 4 also relates to our passion and drive in life. Number 7 brings the qualities of spiritual awakening and enlightenment, intuition and inner-knowing, psychic abilities and mysticism, independence and individualism, persistence of purpose and manifesting good fortune.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then later:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The Bible credits Jesus with 47 miracles.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Declaration of Independence has 47 sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
         There are 47 strings on a concert harp.
        </li>
        <li>
         The tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are located 47 degrees apart.
        </li>
        <li>
         1947 is when the UFO crashed at Roswell
        </li>
        <li>
         4+7= 11 – a master number and part of the “awakening code”. Also Jose Arguelles’s kin is 11 – he brought forth the Law of Time aka the World Thirteen Moon Calendar
        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not going to provide any sources, but take my word for it, Gene Rodenberry was using the number 1701 to simultaneously signal the 1/17 attacks (look up the Law of One) and also invoke the occult protections he believed he would receive outlined above by using the number 47 years apart from Weishaupt's birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rabbit hole goes even deeper. Look at look at US code title 50, chapter 35, section - you guessed it - 1701.
       <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701">
        It outlines the emergency powers given to the President to deal with "extraordinary threats"
       </a>
       . But the sheeple are just going to ignore this and keep watching their Kardashians. Even the semi-woke people here at r/conspiracy are still willfully asleep. Don't you find it a bit odd that no one has ever posted about the significance of 1701, 47, or how illuminatus Gene Rodenberry warned us that puppet Trump would use the 1/17 attacks as an excuse to invoke section 1701 and declare himself American Emperor, just like he "joked" about doing??? The whole goal is to cause a civil war. It's all laid out in plain sight but people just don't want to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: I don't actually believe anything I wrote above, I'm showing how easy it is to come up with the stuff given any random date.

       Because there's a ton of movies, tv shows, books, and video games. So there's a ton of random numbers ripe to be seen as synchronicities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with this comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, at what point do we question if it truly is a case of random coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my OP I cited the
       <strong>
        2001
       </strong>
       connection: a
       <em>
        film
       </em>
       with the year in its title, and a history-changing
       <em>
        event
       </em>
       which occurred in the same calendar year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also cited the
       <strong>
        black monolith
       </strong>
       connection: in the
       <em>
        film
       </em>
       it is a key element of the narrative, in the
       <em>
        event
       </em>
       there is a building which mirrors it overlooking 'ground zero'.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the reasons why I like to share these two specific connections is because it acts as a
       <em>
        filter:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people will understand the
       <strong>
        significance
       </strong>
       and be willing to look further, while others will not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is nothing wrong with either reaction, in my opinion. This is meant for some people, it is not meant for others :)

       I would indeed agree. I
       <em>

       the point is "when there's concrete evidence" and not "when the coincidences fit my preconceived notions".

       Yet this is the core claim being implicitly made. After googling around I found the architect,
       <a href="http://www.eliattia.com/">
        Eli Attai
       </a>
       . I was not able to find anywhere where he mentioned A Space Odyssey or Kubrick. However I always try to follow the evidence, and giving you the benefit of the doubt I am sure you do indeed have a link showing him referencing this in his design. Or at least him mentioning Kubrick as an inspiration?

       Which leaves it on exactly the same grounds as the evidence I found that Gene Rodenberry left in Star Trek indicating how Donald Trump will be used to usher in the NWO next year on Jan. 17th.

       If you're not yet convinced, consider this. The 666th episode of star trek would be season 3, episode 9 of Star Trek: Enterprise. Named...
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Star_(Star_Trek:_Enterprise)">
        <em>
         North Star
        </em>
       </a>
       . In the Occult, the north star is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="http://makara.us/04mtempler/POLARIS.htm">
         is a “star of direction” in the esoteric sense because it distributes those energies in creation which impart purposive intention and therefore a definite objective or course of action.
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That episode aired 792 days after 9/11/2001... and
       <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5fxWBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA59&amp;amp;lpg=PA59&amp;amp;dq=hebrew+alphabet+792+jesus&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=IrRtlLPNRj&amp;amp;sig=xerIufDLe4VDxrw0Yr7woNVQBec&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjprvujpOjZAhWOjVkKHUruBTsQ6AEIQDAH#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=hebrew%20alphabet%20792%20jesus&amp;amp;f=false">
        792 is what you get if you add up the letters for "Lord Jesus Christ" in Hebrew!
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets even weirder. According to some manuscripts,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/616_(number)">
        the number of the beast is actually 616
       </a>
       . That's also the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616#cite_note-3">
        numeric designation of earth in the main Marvel Comic books universe
       </a>
       , given by prolific writer Alan Moore who is probably also in the illuminati. And what was the name of the Star Trek / X-Men crossover book, you ask? Why, none other than "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_X_(Star_Trek)">
        Planet X
       </a>
       ". Yes, the very same name given to the secret planet Nibiru that the illuminati have kept hidden from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who see the significance of this will understand that the illuminati are planning to execute an attack using planet Nibiru on January 17th, and from that a fake "Lord Jesus Christ" will be preseneted to save us, because they believe that the North Star is guiding them to do this. This attack will be so significant that it rippled back through time and influenced Gene Roddenberry to use 1701 as the Enterprise's designation and caused the writers of that crossover book to name it "Planet X".
      </p>
      <p>
       You must admit, there is a suspiciously large amount of coincidences I'm finding here. Are you willing to look further?

       Please don't take this the wrong way but I'm getting strong deja vu to my experiences with religious folk who write off my struggle to believe in God due to lack of evidence as being "hard-headed".

       You're welcome. Please don't take this the wrong way, but I would appreciate if you did the same. If you're not willing to share the hard evidence that this architect was using Kubrick as an inspiration, that is your prerogative, but could you at least explain

       Of course. But before I decide whether I agree or disagree, I like to do some research so my opinion is at least somewhat informed. So I tried googling for connections between that architect and Kubrick, but didn't find anything. Being a good tin foil hatter I'm open to the idea of certain things being buried from the first few pages of Google so I tried asking you for your evidence so I could make an informed opinion and that went nowhere as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be honest, I'm not even sure what we disagree on. You don't really seem interested in participating in discussion. I tried honestly getting at your logic behind why some coincidences are valid connections, yet some, like my connections between Gene Roddenberry, weishaupt, 666-"Lord Jesus Christ"-North Star-Nibiru etc are not but you never made any comments on this either

       I think predictive programming should be the only thing posted on r/conspiracy until people get the picture. Also Stanley Kubrick died 666 dies before 2001. And Trump wanted to purchase the twin towers when he was 33 years old. These are not coincidences, they know what they're doing.

       Let me ask you something, have you ever painted something? Where do you think that creativity come from? The Greeks had a word for it, "the Muse". Artists and poets would invoke the Muse for inspiration on new pieces. Ask any artist you know, sometimes that shit comes to us and we have no control over it. It feels like we are just vessels for something greater than us, channeling whatever they want to send out to human society.

       As an artist I can say that I've had visions of the future that didn't make sense to me until years later. But they were never too specific. I think the details get filled in with actual knowledge while the "base" comes from the "creative source".

       No. i don't paint. I don't draw, I don't write.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I did, I'd paint a landscape. So it would come from right in front of me. If I drew I'd draw Sci-Fi stuff, similar to that in which all other Sci-Fi stuff comes from, based off of all past experiences. Same with writing.

       No you just get a good idea and have the itch to get it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human mind isn't creative. We're limited in a lot of ways. For example, it's hard to imagine what a true alien would be like. Considering near every animal on earth follows the same basic construction with a face, eyes, mouth, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're literally unable to think up what aliens may look like. Because they'd need the ability to operate tools, yet probably wouldn't look like us in any way possible.

       Those aren't ripples of the first world war. Those are coincidences. This sub seems to get those mixed up.

       I find it funny how you dont consider yourself an artist, and then you say that humans aren't creative.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then say that we can't think up what aliens could look like, yet we have a plethora of different examples of alien life in artwork. HR Geiger, star wars, star trek, independence day, district 9, hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, HG wells, lovecraft, even marvel and dc. Each alien race depicted in these works is vastly different than the next. I would aruge that aliens in artwork is a clear example of how
       <strong>
        vast
       </strong>
       and expansive our creativity actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look i know you have never experienced this and its probably hard for you to relate, but this artistic connection with something
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       than  our world does happen. Go read some Lovecraft and then tell me how that dude had a limited creative mind and wasnt tapped into some dark dimension

      <p>
       Painting a human blue/green/purple/orange doesn't magically make them different. There are a lot of very basic fundamentals that are found on almost everything around us. Such as a very clear face. Bipedal movement, Two arms for working with, hands that somehow use the human's weapons on them. etc. etc. It's all very repetitive and uncreative. And exactly what you would expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans cannot create things. We can only modify things. Everything is based on everything before it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at a car. It's just a self-propelled cart. What's a cart if not a board with wheels for easier movement, and what's a board but a sturdy version of a deer you're dragging back to camp? Even the act of dragging is seen in nature from other animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is truely creative in any way, since it's nothing more than things we already know, zip-tied together to create things we understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention how nearly every alien race is impossible, but glossed over due to the fact that if we knew how that life could have been made, we would make it. Much like actual Sci-Fi tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Take "The Orville". A half serious, half comedic show about Sci-Fi. There's a race, forget the name, but they're
       <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z91ZYvD6Hdg954ZoHOCdOxpPk4M=/0x0:780x439/920x613/filters:focal(254x71:378x195">

       </a>
       :format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56814517/orville_baby.0.jpg). Again, very basically humans. Face, arms, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, lore wise. They're a mono-gender civilization, and on birth have a gender change surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this raises the questions. Such as how did that work pre-surgery skills? Why would it had been done in the first place?
       <em>
        How the fuck is there a baby
       </em>
       ? None of these will be answered, because it's just shit used to say "These are aliens".
      </p>
      <p>
       Other examples, Dwarves in LOTR. Living underground is needlessly hard. No real point. And how did they live before discovering mining? Same book, Hobbits, they're a very lazy and seemingly weak people. Other empires would have conquered them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass Effect, Krogans are extra organs for their harsh environment. With secondary, and even tertiary systems. In the case of testicals, 4. Yet still very human like. A face, two arms, two legs, etc. The Elcor are basically just Elephants without trunks, and the Hanar are just space jellyfish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every peice of "Alien" description is based off of other earth-bound creatures or legends.

       Except that's just it. You cannot imagine, not describe something in which is not of this world. Try to imagine a new colour, a new shape, or a new creature.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't do colours because your brain is limited in what it can process visually. You can't do shapes because every shape ever already exists. And you cannot do creatures, because either they'd be impossible to actually survive due to the human mind not being able to actually create the environment in which the creature would need to be shaped by, or because you would base it off of earth based creatures, of which require a earth like planet to have been raised up in.

       True a lot of it is recycled, and our ability to describe things is limited by our bodies, but you are asking for a bit much here. I can give you DMT and ask you to describe what you see, and you won't be able to because of these limitations. But that doesn't invalidate your experience

       "Outside the ordered universe is that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes"

       Not just that. But by the mind. We cannot imagine a true alien, because we cannot imagine life not of earth. The human mind is VERY good at recognizing faces. Even animal faces. The idea of an animal without a face like ours is weird, and also stupid. We have very little idea as to how a creature can survive without a face as we see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eyes need to be close to the brain, so you need that on the head, so you can turn both eyes and head to see things faster. We also need ears, best way to use them for triangulation is to have them across from each other, and still be able to be moved without moving the entire body. So, yeah toss them on the face.  Nose? Well it should be above the mouth so we know how things smell before we eat. But the mouth should also be in range of the eyes so we can see what we're eating. Could you imagine if you ate blind with it in your neck?
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's because that's what we know. That's what we're surrounded by. Every being on this planet evolved from the same stuff more or less. And one thing about that is the eye. Every eye out there needs to be wet. So eyelids and tearducts in order to keep it wet. Why? Because we evolved in the water of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what would an eye look like, if it was fully evolved on land? We cannot say. It might not even be close to the eyes we know of, due to entirely different variables.
      </p>

      <p>
       No, the fact your brain is just misfiring is what invalidates it. What you're seeing isn't real, so it's illogical to be used as things that exist. For example, you could easily make an alien being that doesn't look like us. The issue is both conveying what the fuck it is, as well as explaining how the hell it survives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back a bit, the Krogan is a good example. Evolution is a fickle thing. The idea of having multiple organs means you're more complex to make, and as a result, more prone to failure, or say, cancer. How will you survive, vs a lot more less complex beings? A single Krogan is around 800 pounds. That's a lot of muscle and organs to keep fed with calories. 8 100 pound creatures might be able to do more, while having a better survival rate for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Humans and our closest relative are so different, Evolution is nothing than say, forks in a blockchain. If a block chain forks, you can have two of the same coin, more or less. But differences increase down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that was mildy off topic, but I'm just pointing out that Humans do in fact lack creativity because we're surrounded by a world that is, inherently, uncreative.

       Actually, that passage goes back to my illogical point. Nothing can be "Outside the ordered universe". The laws of physics only exist inside the universe. A being made, outside the universe could be governed by different laws, and literally burst into atoms, or whatever it's made of, upon entering the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that passage is just a bunch of descriptive words. Great for building a scene, but they're actually fairly basic words. It's basically saying that Azathoth is chilling in a cage, or very least chambers, unhappily listening to drums and flutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it's good storytelling, Long words to build tension in a scene. But that's all that going on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is saying there's rifts in time, or ripples, or whatever. It's just coincidences that people are taking as correlation. It's easier to spot "Predictions" That come true, than it is to count the ones that didn't.

       These have been coming out for years? George Romero and Zombies back in the late 60s. The original fallout 21 years ago. Hell, the entire planet of the apes films coming out is a Reboot prequel of a reboot. Again 60s/70s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video Games you can't really compare because they're basically new. However the rise in movies it's from cheaper CGI allowing you to put a person in a ruined city centre, instead of having to block of a street, build a huge set in the middle of nowhere, or use county footage.

       Ah, if you're looking for that kinda proof/defining worship as such, try meditating.  You can feel yourself grow internally and outside observers (with their own clear vision) will recognize the internal changes as easily as any fool can see a 20' human.

       Even if this isn't the case this is probably what the powers that be actually believe. There are loads of symbolism related to 9/11 and time travel. Here's an entire channel dedicated to just that:

       Also the one world trade tower ("freedom" tower) is depicted in media as a portal between dimensions. Almost as much as the twin towers were. You'll start to see it in movies once you're aware: Lord of the Rings (two towers), Dark tower (one tower).

       If they plan the events themselves they know what's going to happen. It has nothing to do with being psychic. These people were all aware 9/11 was going to happen because they were a part of the group (freemasons) who are responsible for it.

       How did you stumble into r/conspiracy? Yes, that's called predictive programming. They believe these "warnings" enter our subconscious mind and thus we share the responsibility of the event with them. They consider it a form of karmic absolution. If we are "warned" ahead of time and decide to do nothing about it then we deserve what's coming to us.

       I've been a redditor for half my life...so 12-14 years.  So I cant say how or when I subscribed to this sub but I can sure say the madness has ramped up over the years. Literally everything is a conspiracy now, all mass shootings are false flags, last I heard Steven Hawking died years ago and they keep replacing him with actors.  Flat Earth and moon/holocaust deniers are in full force. Like fucking good grief I'm sick of the horse shit.
      </p>

       I enjoy conspiracies that have some sort of plausibility, evidence and reason behind them.  I think they are out there, but people (not just this sub) are literally crying wolf over spilled milk.

       This is absolute horse shit.  Like from any sane moral/ethical framework.  Whether these people exist and think this is another matter.  How you can claim this is the case.. I am pretty sure it's not worth wasting time, but I'll ask...how did you come to this conclusion that that is indeed what is happening in the world?

       Flat Earth and Mandela Effect are horseshit, predictive programming is not. Predictive programming is observable in all media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it verifiable? The only way to verify such a claim would be to a. ask a master level and powerful freemason yourself which would accomplish nothing as they would not share their secrets with you or b. become a mason, earn yourself a high position in the entertainment industry and see what this is all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for everyone else all that can be done is to observe several examples of predictive programming and to use your own common sense. Most importantly, you have to approach this with an open mind and never let cognitive dissonance get in the way. The ego will try to pass it off as coincidence to preserve it's world view but the true self, the intuitive part of us, will see it for what it is: the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I'm a very logical person. I can see how conspiracies have become a joke with the advent of our new president, the sun worshiper, Trump. This place is 90% nonsense posted by the alt right. But a thread like this one is a safe haven for truth and discovery. This is a rare opportunity to inform yourself, I suggest you use it. A lot of good stuff has been posted in here. Or instead go focus your aggression on the hundreds of threads droning on and on about "Russia", "guns", "dumb liberals", "Fake News", "space doesn't exist", etc.

       See, you invite me to use my common sense and when I do, (yet disagree), you claim "no, no, it's really real, it's just your ego trying to label it as a coincidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it not possible for coincidence to happen?  Is there no way to distinguish between humans finding patterns in data that isn't connected vs what you are claiming actually is the case?  Because with no way to tell the difference I can only take your idea with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, the reason you gave for the secret societies doing this is completely insane, ((as if me watching The matrix and seeing 9-11 in his ID (which I never even noticed at the time) somehow makes me partly responsible for the event)), which is the propped up on further insanity of "karmic absolution".  It still doesn't cover the motivation of why they would want to do these things...it's just curcular:. We do X because they deserve X, and they deserve X because we subconsciously tell them our plans of X and they do nothing to stop us.  Horse shit.

       Because movie directors are freemasons and freemasons orchestrated 9/11. I'm not saying the director did 9/11 (It was an event planned by many people including world bankers, politicians, government agencies, etc.) but he had advanced knowledge for a reason. Basically they believe they are allowed to perform their rituals that involve mass killing because they "warned" us ahead of time through predictive programming. On a subconscious level they let us know they were going to do it and thus their belief is that the universe will now grant them karmic absolution from their actions as a result. It does sound crazy but no one ever said the most powerful people on the planet are sane.

       I know this because it's the only logical conclusion. Let's not enter the realm of mysticism here. As open as I am to the idea of synchronicity being God's way of communicating with man we can't pin all of this on the collective unconscious. Sometimes the perpetrators have to pay for their crimes and for that to happen they must be exposed for who they are. You do not put symbolism this elaborate in films ahead of time without having advanced knowledge, just the way it is. Hollywood cast "spells" on the public. That's a fancy way of saying they insert symbols into our subconscious in order for us to anticipate their planned events.

       I'm informed and I've made my observations. The only requirement I don't meet is inquiry. I could inquire with a freemason but that wouldn't get me anywhere. I could become a mason and get myself a career in entertainment, only then would I truly know for sure.

       1 - Most/some Hollywood is connected to the occult.  The occult know when their holidays are.  They track the sun, stars, and moon and are astro-theologists.  Similar to how we use horoscopes for trivial matters (Today is not a good day to start a business), they use these forces on massive scales (in 12 years the planetary alignment will be perfect for ____).
      </p>
      <p>
       So any occult-connected director would know 9/11 in 2001 would be a major approaching holiday for them, and all major holidays have "celebrations" (to them).  The occult would have been talking and planning what to do with the approaching 9/11 holiday for years, if not a decade or more as this was clearly a major operation... er, celebration.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - Why show us?  Karmic Law.  Their own occult religion believes that they must warn us about their behavior so we have the option to consent or resist.  If they do not warn us, they break Cosmic Law, which Karma is part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... they warn us.  In their own way.  These warning are super esoteric and often in coded languages or cyphers... but they've put it our there, so its now on us to figure out.  Any consequence is now the result of our free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know they're doing this and do nothing, you've consented to the consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this to be their POV.

       What leads you to this conclusion? I know this is a popular opinion in conspiracy circles, but what is the evidence to support it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another explanation is that they put this stuff in front of us, just like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv6FHRoDwVo">
        the sticky tape
       </a>
       on the 'lunar landing module', so that those with eyes to see will begin their own path of ascension i.e. they allow the masses to see what is happening so that the smart among us can see through the illusion if we choose.

       That the occult obey Karmic Law isn't really a conclusion so much as part of their whole religion.  It's like asking how did I conclude the menorah is part of Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read a ton on occult and assorted groups and activities.  That they follow Karmic Law (or view Karma as an aspect of Cosmic Law) is not really debated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree on the "show those of the masses with eyes" as they are trying to recruit and/or legitimize their activities... and/or honey pot those of us with eyes to see but a heart that won't participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like 9/11 is a great example of this.  That day, everybody in America chose to believe the presented reality or disbelieve.  This type of Divide &amp; Conquer is part of why they show, but obscure, these things.

       There is too much evidence for me to present a singular thing.  It would be like proving a beach based on a handful of sand.  I have a bookshelf filled with books on the topic, and then the internet happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why I believe it exists:  I've seen it in action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the religion exists:  These people believe in a Saturnian Golden Age and their religion will bring it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence for it:  Again, kinda too vast for a reddit post, but... Here is a good overview of the religion, it's origins, and it's beliefs/actions/intent.

       Interesting. Idk how to explain it exactly but I feel 911 was an event that had such a impact on human consciousness that it rippled out and transcended time and space. The world changed from that day on. That is why we know of all these predictive programming clues decades leading up to the event.(many many more besides back to the future). I feel it's the "universe"(god, creator, take your pick) leaving clues as to what will happen/happens/happened depending on if it's the past present or future of this event.

       so what is all this for though?  Ascension?  Into another state of consciousness?

       Replace god/creator with : small group of people who have nothing to do but plan these things, think in terms of symbology, and look to be seen as all powerful to the human cattle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a multigenerational plan. Most people don’t think about this because they are so caught up in their own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer timeline of this plan seems supernatural. The reality we live is a creation of a group of people that may have been ruling for thousands of years.

       No, the point is massive events in our collective consciousness could potentially ripple backwards through some sort of non-local correlation, if the mind is indeed a quantum phenomena.

       It's an absolutely horrifying thing to consider, but maybe....just maybe...these are prime examples of what a coincidence is. You could go out of your way to make it look like some old movie or TV show predicted something simply by digging for anything that in some possible way could be interpreted as a connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the other commenter said, you can say "what are the odds" and act confused. However, the thing is that the odds actually are extremely high when you actually do the math and consider all factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or...thousands of movies and TV shows are made with thousands of props.

       Oh ok so do the math and prove it to me please. Not that I don't believe you but I see these kinds of comments all the time and never see the math posted. I do know that with just 26 people in a room there is a 50%chance two of them have the same birthday which seems crazy but apparently works out.

       is pretty interesting and goes deeper into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever something happens in high enough frequency, there are always going to be coincidental circumstances. Most of the time we don't add any real meaning to them. In Poker, there is a 0.39% (254 : 1) chance of getting a Straight, 0.14% (693 : 1) of getting a Flush and 0.024% (4,164 : 1) of getting a Four of A Kind. These seem unlikely to ever happen. However, if you played Poker with a group for more than an hour, they seem ridiculously common and even almost inevitable at some point. Think of every single time a number or date has been displayed in a movie before 9/11. Most of the time we don't notice because such details wouldn't be pertinent, we block them out and therefore don't keep track of how common they are. 
On surface value, a building looking like a figure from 2001: A Space Odyssey being close to 9/11 looks like it could be an improbable, but it's not. That is merely a suggestion that OP created. That "strange monolith" is the Millennium Hilton hotel, which was actually one block away from TWC. It was in the heart of Downtown Manhattan and was the shape of most buildings around it. It was definitely not the only Black building in Manhattan either and Rectangles aren't the uncommon. So the question OP could have asked was "What are the chances of there being a building with a Black rectangular face in Downtown Manhattan?"

       Funny thing.. Less than 2 weeks after "Trinity", the first detonation of an atomic bomb, a B-25 ran into the Empire State Building. Then less than 2 weeks after that, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.

       I just wonder if that first B-25 was supposed to be blamed on the Soviets and used to kick off

       It’s one of the more interesting theories for demolition, and I entertained it myself for quite a while. I’ve watched all the videos explaining how a nuclear implosion in the basement would rise up through the building etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory has (at least) a couple of major problems, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, in all official materials relating to nuclear weapons, side effects include radioactive fallout, an EMP, shockwaves commensurate with the payload and a bunch of other things. None were observed with a sufficient level of compatibility. So, if it was nukes, they were special stealth nukes that had exotic properties. In other words, not nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       By far the biggest problem is that nuclear weapons likely do not work and never have. They’re just an unfalsifiable boogeyman.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at how the threat of nuclear war and nuclear terrorism has been deployed by politicians worldwide since the end of the Second World War, all while never seeing any evidence of these ultimate weapons being used, it makes perfect sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now
       <em>
        that’s
       </em>
       a rabbit hole.

       Nah. It was a subterranean detonation, nothing exotic, but that contained much of what you're talking about. Thousands of 9/11 first responders and NYC residents did contract all manner of radiogenic cancers, however. Much more info here:

       If that is what happened, why are there no accounts of abnormal radiation readings in the NY area.  There are probably thousands of geiger counters in college and high school science labs in a five mile radius of the wtc.  Are there any accounts of anyone seeing above normal levels?

       Then I started looking into the verifiable evidence for nuclear weapons, and there is hardly any. That which does exist and can be verified has other more plausible explanations.

      <p>
       Be my guest though, if you have strong evidence for nuclear weapons being real feel free to post it. This isn’t really the thread for it mind you.

       The hypothesis is that the US would blow up the Empire State Building, blame it on the Soviets, then use the public outcry to go to war with the USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is suggesting that the Soviet Union
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       attack the US. C'mon, this is not that difficult.

       You have every right to hold that opinion, but is it relevant to this thread?
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that there is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHjohmgOh2M">
        overwhelming evidence
       </a>
       that 'nuclear bombs' are wartime propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any event, this thread is clearly intended to focus upon the 'coincidence' of the black monolith and other related connections or 'synchronicities' between that event and certain major artefacts of popular culture.

       I think what he is saying is relevant, because for the monolith to be true it would also imply a conspiracy on a much grander scale then most give it credit for.

       Sure, I buy the monolith concept. Ties into Mark Passio's lecture on
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUsVMZ3EJw">
        9/11 as an Occult Ritual
       </a>
       . I don't recall him mentioning the monolith specifically, but they're complementary hypotheses.

       But yeah I meant this goes waaay back, at least to the 1940s.

       Thank you for this comment. It suggests to me that you understand that significance of these so-called 'coincidences'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was aware that the official story of 9/11 was bogus for years and years, but it took until a couple of years ago for me to discover the overwhelming evidence that, yes, the towers were built to be brought down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This line if inquiry is shunned by most 'conspiracy theorists' because they believe they already have everything figured out and are no longer open-minded to new information and perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this sense, they are no different to the so-called 'sheeple' who they mock for being willfully ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who are still able to genuinely entertain new ideas without necessarily accepting them, the 'built to be brought down' angle opens up an entirely new rabbit hole for investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, when Neo wakes up at his desk, what does the computer tell him to do? Follow the white rabbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when Neo finally realises his own power, which building is he standing atop? One marked
       <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2E3JDtqHaVM/hqdefault.jpg">
        MMI
       </a>
       i.e. 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, when you realise what '9/11' really was, you will unlock a power within your mind you never thought possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most people, even in this sub, would rather remain stuck in their dream (nightmare) than open their mind to what is really going on in this realm.

       Not OP, but probably a mixture of outright media fakery (that is, photoshopped images) and/or to a lesser extent, pareidolia.

       The video footage that went out ‘live’ was clearly composited, so no reason to believe in any other evidence presented by the media.

       Info on that?

      <p>
       I have seen the video with the face in the smoke and it's clearly in the vid. You can't "photoshop" a video. But you can composit a video, yet I've never seen/read info about that regarding live footage of 9/11 being composited. Any links or keywords I can search on that topic would be genuinely appreciated.

      <p>
       Or are they another case of the

       which is central to the 9/11 narrative fed to the lemming masses?

       This isn't new evidence or a new line of thought. This is pointing out that there is a building in New York that looks like something in a movie called 2001. This thread is absolute nonsense and likely designed to muddy the waters when it comes to legitimate conspiracies regarding 9/11.

       This is so awesome your talking about this angle. I came to the idea myself some time last year when I was entertaining the idea of a greater symbolic meaning to 9/11, and that perhaps they had built the towers with explosives already in them. Obviously that is unlikely, it kind of opened my mind to the idea that they were built with the purpose of being destroyed. It sends a chill down my spine when I think about it.

       The monolith from "2001" isn't the Millennium Hotel. I don't even understand the point you are trying to make. What are the odds that the WTC complex would be located near a building that is black and rectangular? Pretty damn high. What are the odds that a black rectangular building is similar in appearance to the monolith from 2001? Pretty damn high. (

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the odds that "2001" would happen to be the same year as 9/11? Pretty damn high, if that's the time frame he was thinking about for the future setting for his movie when he wrote the script. So probably about 1 in 10 or so if he wanted it set 30-40 years in the future or in the 200X time frame.

       Yeah, it is pretty weird that there is something large and rectangular in Manhattan. Next we are going to be told that the monolith from "2001" was built on the surface of a planet. Just like the bedrock that holds up the Hilton. Or that "2001" was filmed on cameras, just like the footage of the 9/11 towers burning.

       It's basically the exact same proportions as the monolith. And it's an extremely rare style for a building.

       The fact it wasn't intentional weakens your already very weak theory.

       In my comment I agree it looks like the monolith. However, so do many, many, many other black rectangular buildings.

       Sorry it hurts to see that there's no "there there" with your theory/hypothesis. Your entire thread is asking what people think of a "link" between a building and events in 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots and lots of major events happened around large monolith-looking buildings in 2001 all over the world. Because there were many major events in 2001 (like every years) and monolith-looking buildings are everywhere.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The monolith in 2001 a Space Odyssey is an allegory for the masonic belief system that mankind was created by god(s) and that humans can evolve to become gods
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2001 the black monolith signals/preempts the spiritual ascension of the creatures who touch it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why do you say that ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first monolith evolved the apes beyond the animal planting the seed of what would be come an intelligence (humans).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the sun struck the monolith on the moon it emitted a radio signal directed at the monolith orbiting Jupiter thereby signalling the intelligence behind the monoliths that mankind had advanced far enough to achieve space travel.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Bowman pursued the signal and entered the wormhole he was transported to the intelligence behind the monoliths and they gave him the power of the star child, made him an immortal being of energy, and sent him back to Earth as a Christ like figure to guide humanity to a greater destiny among the stars.

       One of the relevant things that video doesn't cover is Doc Brown is using remote control to test the DeLorean when Marty shows up at 'Twin Pines'. (Many people believe the planes flown into WTC were under remote control).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more evidence hinting at use of remote control aircraft on 9/11 going all the way back to
       <em>
        WarGames
       </em>
       in 1983 I think.

       Parallels in entertainment media are not "evidence" of any details of the 9/11 attacks. If 9/11 perpetrators had chosen another symbolic building (Eiffel tower, Renaissance Tower...etc) at random to fly airplanes into, I bet we'd still find hundreds of coincidencidentally similar scenes in movies, board games, and TV shows.

       Not looking for your 'approval' friend. So, you can take off the "authority hat". What's evidence for you is evidence for you, and everyone is different.

       Yeah. All this shock that black cuboids are showing up... Given the fact that this is basically the shape all tower block/skyscrapers are, it would almost be sign of a conspiracy if there
       <strong>
        weren't
       </strong>
       any black cuboids around in the middle of lower Manhattan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an Asimov quote I can never find where he says basically this... Something like, people assume the supernatural because they come across incredible coincidences that seem to defy the laws of statistics. But given the sheer number of people, the lengths of their lives, and really just the incalculable number of
       <strong>
        events
       </strong>
       happening all the time to people, you must expect a certain number of insane coincidences on a pretty regular basis. If there were never any rare coincidences,
       <strong>
        that
       </strong>
       would be evidence for the supernatural.

       What has 9/11 resulted in? An endless war. A war consunsunes everything.  After 9/11 the millennials and those born after have a lower life expectancy, more poverty, more costly education. Just about everything economically is being thrown against the youth to prevent thier rise. Income inequality built on the backs of that youth is worse than the depression. When the youth ask for mercy in Healthcare or education or a living wage they are met with choruses of "Socialist!" "freeloader!" "traitor!"  oh what you want is a pie-in-the-sky fantasy!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet when it comes to spending on the endless war, no debate. No controversy. No shaming. No questions except, "Why isn't it more?".

       There's also a giant eye that opens for only a few minutes during 9/11 to mark the event.  Of course, it's very expensive architecture isn't

       The one thing that always seems to be missed/missing from these threads is the Unveiling of Isis ritual. Iirc it's Masonic and has something to do with the three pillars (towers 1, 2, and 7 was what I remember relating). It's been some years since I've dug into it but, it was the connection that got me here today.
Good post.

       Then I started looking into the verifiable evidence for nuclear weapons, and there is hardly any. That which does exist and can be verified has other more plausible explanations.

       Be my guest though, if you have strong evidence for nuclear weapons being real feel free to post it. This isn’t really the thread for it mind you.

       If they plan the events themselves they know what's going to happen. It has nothing to do with being psychic. These people were all aware 9/11 was going to happen because they were a part of the group (freemasons) who are responsible for it.

       That the occult obey Karmic Law isn't really a conclusion so much as part of their whole religion.  It's like asking how did I conclude the menorah is part of Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read a ton on occult and assorted groups and activities.  That they follow Karmic Law (or view Karma as an aspect of Cosmic Law) is not really debated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree on the "show those of the masses with eyes" as they are trying to recruit and/or legitimize their activities... and/or honey pot those of us with eyes to see but a heart that won't participate.

       Something like 9/11 is a great example of this.  That day, everybody in America chose to believe the presented reality or disbelieve.  This type of Divide &amp; Conquer is part of why they show, but obscure, these things.

       That's a lot to digest. The book I am currently reading has a section on science fiction as one style of cultural engineering. Occultists and posers hide their symbols and numerology in pop culture. I personally don't get too involved with numerology study since it is easy to get sloppy, and it's also unpersuasive to most people.

       You really dedicated yourself to pissing on an idea you "know" is wrong. May I humbly suggest putting that energy into research. Then you can teach actual lessons instead of petty mind games.

       You killing someone isn't worship doing something. It's you being crazy. If you suddenly grew 20 feet as a result of the worship, then it would have done something.
