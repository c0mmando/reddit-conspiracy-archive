       Is fascinating to see center right movements from US fighting against police state, corporate power, mass population control and how they hate and fight the antifa movement at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Europe the same battle the right does in US is fought by these left movements.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you may think they are the same as antifa movements in US but they are not. These are old movements not tied down in crap like "dumb feminism" or "don't offend me with your free speech"
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is that the "left" antifa movements are artificially created to disrupt the people fight for a fair society, and the European antifascist symbols are used in US to discredit and divide the fight against unsettling situation of poverty and malcontent that is rising in the US society.

       I agree with you 100% on the US Antifa movement. However I wouldn't be too sure the European movements are the real deal, either. TPTB always lead the opposition. Always. And if there is a genuine grassroots movement, it will quickly be infiltrated and derailed. They've been at this game a very, very long time, and they know what they're doing. Same as it ever was.

       No they are not, they are in fact heavily infiltrated, you are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my theory, and let me know what you think,
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe movements genuinely created and then infiltrated to be controlled and disrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       US movements created directly just to be sure it doesn't happen as in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       then off course, it depends of each community and different movement, each has its own story

       Well, I don't know. I wouldn't want to make a blanket statement. Depends which movements you're talking about. Do you have one in mind that you think was originally organic or grassroots but later was taken over?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is some interesting research on how various movements were controlled from the beginning, including
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/marx.pdf">
        Marxism
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/reed.pdf">
        socialism
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/debs.pdf">
        labor,
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">
        the Indian independence movement.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, antifa is not the first anti-fascist movement in the US. If you go back to the 30's, there was an anti-fascist movement. Though I imagine that was also manufactured by Intelligence.

       What's interesting is that when the tea party was a thing they called it a corporate movement of rich people manipulating poor people into protesting on their behalf. But that is exactly what antifa and the resist movements  are

       Actually, ironically enough, it is what you say they are. Most of those Berkeley groups aren't antifa, don't call themselves antifa and don't act like antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I like how your metaphor can also be used to prove my point. NK isn't democratic and thus shouldn't be called DPRK, just like the American "antifa" aren't antifascists and thus shouldn't be called antifa.

       You seem to misunderstand my position on the matter. I think most antifascists are a bunch of lowlifes and are just looking for fights, so especially the Flaiano comment is very applicable. However I also believe that the antifascist banner is being used by groups that are in fact not antifascists.

       I've known very right-wing antifascists, who were in the true original european antifascist movement that in large literally died out because of heroine addiction. I am sure that some of them sympathize towards communism or Che Guevara (the latter might also be considerd to be an example for antifascists because of his own anti-fascist fight, and not because of his ideology). However they are not core principles of the antifascist movement, nor is antifascism a core principle of communism - in fact, I would argue that communism has, almost by definition, very fascist elements - I really dislike the way people use different ideologies that are so easily separated, interchangably. I would argue the same is the case for people that call the alt-right nazis. Those people are equally stupid. Simply because one or two core elements are the same, doesn't mean that you can use the two terms interchangably when there are so many differences between them.

       Interesting hypothetical, however poorly setup. The original antifascist movement didn't side with anyone, they were only anti. Whenever a group large enough appeared somewhere, that in their eyes had fascist ideology, they would come to try to fight them. So i imagine if enough fascist muslims would start demonstrating somewhere, the antifa would probably fight them.

       Hence the anti-fascists are the fascists quote. I agree with the above. There are a number of ideologies that the some are part of and some are not, in antifa groups

       they wear the shirts but it is just fashion. they have no ideology. try to have a discussion with them about facism, socialism, capitalism, anarchism, you can't. their ignorance is astounding. and i say this coming from the farthest left you are ever likely to meet.

       antifa confuses things like racism with facism. the klan are a bunch of anachranistic rascists. all facists are statists. some racists of statists, some racists are anti-statists. all facists are pro-buisness. some racists are pro-business, some racists are anti-business.
      </p>
      <p>
       if antifa were really anti-facistists they'd target wall street, congress, esp congress, defense contractors, the news media, police departments, jeff bezos, alphabet etc. not the klan. don't get me wrong, protesting the klan is fine, but it is anti-racist, antira, not antifa.

       Antifa are openly anarcho-communist. At least spend some time on their boards, reading their literature, etc., before making such a strong affirmative statement. It makes you look like a goon when you are that wrong. I lurk in their subs to see what they are saying all the time. If you believe Antifa aren’t Leftists, and aren’t self-identifying as either Coms or AnComs, then you don’t know what you’re talking about.

       You don’t even understand the terms being used. I can tell from the context that you believe that Fascism is a word that means Statist Authoritarianism. Which it isn’t. Anti-Fascism isn’t anti-Totalitarianism, it is Anti-Fascism. Anti-Fascists aren’t Anti-Communist. They are fine with Authoritarianism and Totalitarianism. What they are against is Fascism and Fascism alone. Antifa IS Left wing. The only oppose Right Wing Authoritarianism, they are fine with Left Wing Authoritarianism. I wish people would learn what the word Fascist means.

       Close, I would say fascism as an expression of Statist Authoritarianism. The original form fascist ideology could be defined as right-wing exclusive: G-B, Italy, Germany to a certain extent, however ever since WWII more and more left-wing movements in mostly non-European countries have been considerd fascist (mostly africa, and asia). If you were to look at a modern-day example of what I would qualify as left-wing, or at the very least not right-wing fascism, you would have to look at the Philipines. Just for your interest, the term fascism is still a contested concept and there are multiple definitions being used. If you see fascism as political ideology, it has mostly been eradicated after WWII. If you see it as a set of principles and actions, it is still very much alive.

       Source please. Pretty sure they have roughly the same politics and even have plenty of intermixture and exchange. If anything the main difference is that the Euro Antifa are way more hardcore, willing to trash fascists' apartments and attempt assassinations as well.

       Yup, I was there before the comments went to shit, but its free speech, so regardless of "feelings", it continues. Its still a great sub to get news that is censored everywhere else, like what's happening in South Africa with illegal land grabs, and MANY other news bits.

       But yeah, this is typical r/politics techniques, label anyone who seeks alternative news sources as a "nazi." Good job

       That has nothing to do with racism; stereotyping maybe. Regardless, not driving in high crime areas if you can help it is totally different than saying we need a white-ethno state.

       And that's why I am centrist, because I don't want a white ethnostate. I want everyone united and whats best for the country as a whole.

       But at the same time, the white neighborhoods are the safest and best places to live. So it makes sense why some would want a white ethnostate.

       No, see that is the issue. It has little to do with the color of their skin and more do with their economic situation. There are poor white neighborhoods with just as much crime as poor black neighborhoods.

      <p>
       Where I disagree with the "SJW" culture is that they want to break down everything by race. I don't agree that race is a big factor in just about anything. Biology doesn't even acknowledge race as a real thing because there is are no distinctly racial characteristics.

       If that's the case, then by now Africa should be a technological Hub and powerful nation, but its not. There are also intelligence studies that show interesting facts. Same deal with Muslim countries, where inbreeding with first cousins is the norm, and we see they have remained as 3rd world countries. The only thing that has some Muslim countries on even playing fields is those who have Oil, using Western Tech and Workers to pull it out.

       Sure, skin color is one of them. There are also racial genetics that allow companies like 23andme to let people know what racial background they consist of.

       Now I am aware that there are a lot of recent (last few years) articles of scientists arguing that race does not exist. I haven't looked into this that much, other than a few debates that this itself is a conspiracy by liberal scientists as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we were to argue whether race exists or not (because I can post sources from both sides), we still have cultures, countries, skin color, religion, and many other things that divide and separate the people between themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I 100% agree with Churchill on Islam:

        Did you know that being exposed to Malaria is what leads one to being susceptible to sickle cell?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I wasn't going to use the sickle cell argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of right now, I 100% believe that races exist. However, things get blurry when we have mixed people, mixed race folks who are beyond 2 backgrounds, but have several/multiple backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR - I believe races exist, but am on the fence in terms of what that means beyond skin color and genetics

       Listen, I can't fully argue or debate this with you, because I am not 100% well versed on these matters at this point.

      <p>
       I am on the fence about a lot of things in this conversation. I think there are both Universalities in Humans, as well as differences, and this conversation isn't just about science/genetics, but also has to do with philosophy, spirituality, group consciousness, racial consciousness/awareness, epigenetics, karmic soul groups, the hive mind subconscious, and a number of other features.

       This is evidence of genetic/epigenetic mutations within a single population yes. I suppose if that is all race is to you. Where it becomes unclear and the difference between ancestry and a traditional definition of race is how much it has an influence on you as a person; and if there is any reason besides superficial ones we can't get along.

       I hear all your rebuttals, but still disagree.

       I think the "there are no races they are just constructs" argument is a liberal psy op, just like the whole "gender is just a construct" debate.

       I think race = Ancestry, genetic identifiers, differences in the subconscious and consciousness, skin color/physical features, differences in cognitive abilities such as logic/reason/intelligence, personality differences, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the branches of thought and reasoning of mine above, is still not understood by science. I also ascribe to these philosophies as well:

       So on top of all of those features, I see cultures as a representation of the subconscious hive mind, or collective consciousness if you will.

      <p>
       In terms of Epigenetics, it is argued that the stereotypes of races are examples of this. I am, for example, of East European Slavic origins where Alcoholism is rampant and have lost my father and an uncle to alcohol poisoning. These same cravings are something I battle with constantly and certainly these are argued to be epigenetic memories.

       These parts are unproven and based on nothing but your personal bias and/or theories. Though you seem aware of this. Considering there is large amounts of variance within a so called "race" it seems meaningless to me to say there is a racial component to those aspects. Is the highest intelligence black person less smart than the highest intelligence white person? Unknown and unknowable. So what is to be gained from this?

       These parts are still unknown in science. Take consciousness itself, it is yet to be understood and reverse engineered. They are not "my bias or theories." Consciousness exists, its scientific fact, but it is not understood. Your argument here is faulty

       It depends on whether a study was done on this. I dont know, but I'd guess if you take 1000 white people and test them compared to 1000 white people or asian people, the black people will be seen to have the lowest cognitive ability in some facets, but higher cognitive ability in other facets (such as physical, reaction, sports, awareness, etc). If this study is in the U.S., I would argue this is so because the blacks that came to the U.S. was via slavery boats and the males were chosen for their physical acumen

       Yup, this is what sets these races apart from those who don't have this. There are many more facets/aspects, like this example, that further set apart the races

        Epigenetics might tie into your own personal family history sure, but there is little reason to suspect a large racial component.

      <p>
       Actually, there are many reasons that epigenetics can be seen as racial components, and plenty of articles that discuss this as well in academia. They are super scared that racists will take their work and use it to further racists debates. So it makes sense why all of a sudden, in the last few years, there is a psy-op from liberal biased academia, to come out with this "no races" propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really interesting is to see whether these same sort of articles/studies exist in Eastern Academia (India/Asia/Middle East/Etc) where Academia has a better balance towards conservatism

       Not really, you have shifted the definition of race to match what is available. Ancestry and genetic heritage isn't the same thing as race that implies that there is a larger grouping that is different on some fundamental level than just superficial features explained by genetic mutation.

       No it is completely shifting the definition and meaning of race. The reason race is a taboo subject is because some people say your "race" has a definition of what you are or what your potential is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact culture influencing people is an argument against race as it is traditionally defined. That suggests that there is no inherent nature but it is shaped by environment and where you are born.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you wish to redefine race into a new meaning which is the sum of all the parts of you that is fine but meaningless outside of the study on the individual level.

      <p>
       Actually, many scientists predict that consciousness will be scientifically figured out in X times. There are a variety of social, cultural, psychological studies/experiments that point to various markers within different races and it can be argued culture is a product of race and not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good experiment would be to take a bunch of Asian babies and allow them to start their own culture in a number of echo chambers to see what happens as they get older. There are arguments that these children will display various examples of ancient Asian culture playing out in their behavior and culture creation because its within their subconscious and epigenetics to do so, and therefore we can argue race exists because of this

      <p>
       I agree the standard IQ test is limited in its ability, however there are other intelligence tests available, and I would argue these tests are enough to line up with both stereotypes and the the demographics we see in typical American Universities, or Global, by country, demographics on education

      <p>
       I'm not sure. There are what can be deemed subsets like Icelandic, Alaskan, etc. However these same 2 groups are often included as other racial groups. While I do believe race exists because of the various branches of thought, links, philosophies, I have listed, in terms of how many there are, I'm not sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that perhaps, a person who is mixed with a number of different races, at a certain point loses the purity of 1 race, and I am not sure what that really signifies. Perhaps there is a evolutionary movement towards homogeneity like how some scientist are predicting there will only be one race of all mixes in the future:

       hey not to pull rank but you guys are totally wrong. whatever is going on top down there is a bottom up component. you guys are seriously underestimating the number or far left hardcore "punch nazi" kids that are in the us and actually believe that anyone right wing is a fascist nazi in disguise.

       Agreed, these clowns have no idea what they're talking about. They can't imagine their enemies as anything but monolithic, moneyed, and bad-intentioned. It's a coping mechanism, they can't fit a populist far left into their schema for the world so they make these narratives up.

       Wrong. I see the system as the enemy, but also Antifa (financed by Soros) as the enemy as well. As is communism, the anti-free speech movement, religions like Islam, Catholiscism, etc, and liberal bias within media/academia, etc.

       We don't need an anti-corporation movement, we need an anti-capitalist movement. People like you who maintain the fiction of a difference between those two things will never do anything but reproduce the current situation over, and over, and over again. There is no "True Capitalism" that we need to achieve or return to, the past 500 years of slavery, genocide, oppression, and exploitation
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       capitalism or, at the very best, all things that capitalism is willing to tolerate for profit. You need to quit daydreaming about independent craftsmen and fucking fisherman and recognize that Capitalism was, is, and always will be a system whereby the few enslave the many. Until you do that, your analysis will remain incoherent and ultimately toothless, you will never be anything more than a confused reformist who ultimately, at the end of the day, runs interference for the elite by drinking the ideological kool-aid they've handed you.

       Nice projections and assumptions. I ascribe to no ideologies, because that then allows me to entertain and study all ideologies, and what you just said in the quote above is literally what you are all about, anti-capitalism is toothless and weakass scapegoat ideology

       i'm your garden variety, untrademarked, 1980s punk, anarchist. i would have less animosity toward antifarians if they would cease and desist calling themselves anarchists. no anarchist ever has told someone what they can think or that they have to be respectful to anyone, as long as you don't interfere with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       interference is intereference. violence is violence. if you commit interfere with someone or commit violence, i could care less whatever justification you tell yourself to allow you to feel righteous and assuage your cognitive dissonance. i feel equally about this for antifa and for those they mislabel as facists.

       The fact that they're actually not, and it's a hilariously bad lie they use to shield themselves. For example, they beat up a mexican old man and his teenage son with a sign that read "End violence, end racism, peace" and you could see through their masks they were white people. The dad and son did nothing except walk past them and were all confused and asking "why are you doing this to us" as they were on the grass getting mauled.

       antifa is neither for, nor against, anything but whatever rally they show up at.
      </p>
      <p>
       ask any supposed antifarian what facism is. it can be defined in one sentence. they won't be able to tell you. they might cite historical attributes, but most will not really be actual attributes, they will be hollywood portrayals of them. they might cite various identity based animosities, none of which are facist, just shitty. ask them what the difference between US facism and NAZI facism, they won't know (german facism is based on prussia-philia, US facism is based on profit margins. henry wallace gave a great description of it back in 1945). ask them what anarchism is. it can be defined in one sentence. they won't be able to tell you, they won't even be able to come up with attributes. bonus question--ask them why calling oneself antifa is redundant if you are an anarchist.
      </p>

       be warned, they are very hostile and suffer from astounding levels of dunning kruegar.

       antifa clearly popped up here as an astroturf thing, but like most astroturf things, sincere, useful idiots hopped on board. search american anarchist subs and websites and articles before 2016. count how many times antifa is mentioned.

       If it can be claimed that antifa is fabricated for such reasons, then it can be claimed that neo-nazis and "alt-right" folk who make public appearances are fabricated to discredit right wing politics. And the main reason why the center and right wingers oppose antifa and extreme leftists is because they are more anti-free speech and most of their social activism involves attacking and attempting to silence others speeches and public events. Do you really think these extreme leftists and antifa care about fixing social issues? They just want power over other people.

       There is no "left" antifa and "right" antifa, only one antifa and it is left nor right.

       i gave you an up vore. i don't know how long it will last.

       your comment is probablly the most apt in the thread.

       antifarians expose themselves in their thin skinnedness and knee jerk down voting.

       i'm your garden variety, untrademarked, 1980s punk, anarchist. i would have less animosity toward antifarians if they would cease and desist calling themselves anarchists. no anarchist ever has told someone what they can think or that they have to be respectful to anyone, as long as you don't interfere with them.

       interference is intereference. violence is violence. if you commit interfere with someone or commit violence, i could care less whatever justification you tell yourself to allow you to feel righteous and assuage your cognitive dissonance. i feel equally about this for antifa and for those they mislabel as facists.
