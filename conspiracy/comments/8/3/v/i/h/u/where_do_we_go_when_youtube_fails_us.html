    <div class="md"><p>Uh, infowars i guess?  Though really,  these &quot;conspiracies&quot; actual fake news.   What is real is the conspiracy between Russian oligarchs and the Trump administration to subvert our democracy.  </p>

<p>I just want to point out the difference between real and fake conspiracies here.  Fake conspiracies like Parkland, Sandy Hook, 9/11 all involve casts of thousands of people in broad daylight executing a seemingly flawless plan, thus duping everyone in the world except for the brave truthers to whom the design is all too obvious.  </p>

<p>Real conspiracies on the other hand involve rather fewer people, acting incompetently to hatch a half-baked plan that often gets found out.   Then begins the investigation which slowly uncovers new but unsurprising facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bilderberg meeting is real insofar as it does have an anchor in reality.  But because of the secrecy surrounding the affairs, much speculation occurs regarding their goals and motivations.   For this reason I treat any information about the group skeptically.</p>

<p>What I think is fake is the idea that these people are pulling all the strings, which I believe is the accusation generally levelled.  That is, the wield illumimati/god level power to orchestrate world events.  They do not.  They are people like us with flaws, families, and enemies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tragic, real events.  Of course we do not have the full story.  But the official versions are more compelling and credible than the conspiracy versions.</p>

<p>I put the question to you: how many people must be in on these conspiracies?  Hard evidence from any one person on the inside would be enough to push a wedge into the crack and let the light in (and boy would there be money in that!).  How can the puppeteers muster and command the resources to keep all this under wraps while simultaneously being foolish enough to leave clues behind wherever they strike?  Because they can?  It never really adds up, you just have to keep piling on layers of deception, bringing in more conspirators and institutions to explain the incongruencies, until the whole world is controlled by the jesus lizard on the dark side of the flat earth.</p>

<p>So yeah, I know that the official story isn&#39;t the whole story.  But I&#39;m even more skeptical of the conspiracy versions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad I&#39;m not alone. I&#39;m not entirely sure what is real or fake. All of theses shootings seem to be orchestrated, but i don&#39;t know if people really died. It seems like some did? It&#39;s hard to say really with all of the Sandy hook shit that has surfaced. The Las Vegas one is another hard one to pin down. All I know is, it is blatantly obvious that they are shoving gun control in our faces. I absolutely hate David Hogg and that other piece of garbage that went on Bill Mahars show. I was furious watching that. Just because you went through something traumatic, doesn&#39;t make you an expert on politics.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit absolutely works this way in the real world because people are flawed and make mistakes.  There is incompetence in everything all the time so of course we will uncover incompetence when we investigate any event.</p>

<p>Also, we don&#39;t yet live in 1984 minority report world yet so unless somebody has already committed a crime we have measures in place to limit what actions the state can take.</p>

<p>The thing is, you can spot anomolies and incongruencies everywhere if you look for them.  Seeing them pop up in these tragic events is not proof of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>What changed my mind about all this was that the pattern was always the same, the conspiracies always had an answer for every weird little detail.  In the real world, the truth is that people don&#39;t know why that man decided to go on a rampage.  In the chaos that follows mistakes happen, something gets misreported, etc.  This is just how it goes, not the designs of some sinsister overlords.  </p>

<p>Let me ask you:  how are these movers and shakers so clever as to never get caught, yet so stupid as to be leaving trails of clues wherever they go?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They never do, and never will get caught because there are way too many people who think the same way you do. They (whoever they is) really do have a monopoly on the news, and that helps tremendously. I respect what you are saying, but I think we can agree to disagree. The official story to 9/11 is the biggest joke in history. I will leave it at that. That to me, is the big one. All of these shootings maybe could go either way. I get really upset about 9/11 because the story they sold us is so elementary, it insults our entire country&#39;s intelligence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you should know, I used to believe the conspiracy version.  Or at least I had mega-doubts about the official version.  But I never really got a good answer from the conspiracy version.  The trails always went off into wacko world where its jesus vs. the lizard people on the dark side of the flat earth.  I wondered why that was.</p>

<p>There were so many glaring holes in the official story, I couldn&#39;t abide.  But I couldn&#39;t follow the conspiracy notions to their logical conclusions because that stuff gets pretty insane pretty quick and I just couldn&#39;t buy it.  So I took another look at the holes in the official story.  I suggest you do too.  The picture is different than what many would like us to believe; there are liars on both sides of the fence.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to convince you here that any one conspiracy is fake.  What I urge you to do is identify the patterns that conspiracy theories share and ask yourself why that might be.  After all, if there&#39;s one thing we can do well (often too well), it&#39;s find a pattern in the noise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair enough. I can definitely agree that some of the theories do take a wild turn into the rabbit hole i.e lizard people and stuff like that. Although you can never be 100 percent sure that isn&#39;t true either, just 98 percent sure. You are right about there being liars on both sides of the argument. Like you said, we are all human with families and flaws. I will try to keep an open mind from here on out. </p>
