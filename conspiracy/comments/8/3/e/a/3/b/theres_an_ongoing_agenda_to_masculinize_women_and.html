<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oGQLj3OEuA">Masculinization of women &amp; feminisation of men - Neo feminist Agenda - Mark Passio</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.drcurtisduncan.com/2012/08/the-conspiracy-to-feminize-men-and.html">The Conspiracy to Feminize Men and Masculinize Women</a></p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m posting this is because it&#39;s an issue that affects us all. Men&#39;s test levels and sperm counts have been dropping for decades. The age of puberty has been dropping in an unnatural way as well.</p>

<p>These things should be cause for concern. You&#39;d think they&#39;re be all kinds of research into finding a solution and bringing things back to normal, but there isn&#39;t. It&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t want to find out because someone already knows what the answer will be.</p>

<p>Instead we get Hollywood and Bill Nye and the rest of the media pushing us to accept feminization of men and masculinization of women as &quot;the new normal&quot;.</p>

<p>The thermal ones right?</p>

<p>Yes, I read that just holding one in your bare hand for 30 seconds was enough to create measurable exposure to an estrogen mimic (BPA?)</p>

<p>Why do we need receipts like this? Why not keep the old ones that used regular paper and a bit of ink?</p>

<p>Men have the power to bring about change in society, so if you want to uphold the status quo it makes sense to neuter males. Women would never start a revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender roles have always sucked. Good riddance. This vision alt-right conservitards have of a 50&#39;s utopia where everyone followed gender roles and everyone liked it never existed except in their minds.</p>

<p>Gender roles are like religion, a bunch of logical fallacies wrapped in a pretty package of ego and authoritarianism. If you study religions around the world, you find they have many commonalities in their structure and beliefs. But that doesn&#39;t make them true! It just means that when humans are stupid they tend to be stupid in the same ways over and over again. Think: If gender roles were natural, there would be no need to put so much effort into enforcing them. Regressives suffer a deep cognitive dissonance, they assert that enforcing gender roles is soooo berry important because they are soo &quot;natural&quot;.</p>

<p>Environmental pollution causing endocrine disruption and the acceptance of different gender expressions in the media are separate things. The former, admittedly, should be a cause for concern. But the health of modern people in developed countries is so rekt, focusing on one particular symptom is short-sighted.</p>

<p>The real conspiracy is that exposure to toxins and pollution is being twisted into a divisive social-norms issue so that sane, altruistic people will dismiss the objective facts, just like how economic issues get twisted into racism. No matter how much a society and oppresses and clamps down on homosexuality and trans people, they are always there. So many young LGBTQA people grow up in environments where unconventional gender expression is unthinkable, where they&#39;ve never even heard of it and they think they are the only one, or they watch it get punished with social ostrization, imprisonment, torture and death, but it lives on anyway. The only objective problem with it is the pain and stress it causes to idiots with tiny conformist brains.</p>

<p>There, ftfy</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t use plastics at all, right? Do you wash your hands after everytime you touch a receipt? There are plasticizers in drinking water across the country ffs. You are so dense that you don&#39;t even understand the point we&#39;re making here</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with your &quot;super healthy&quot; eating habits, you smug mislead elitist. Both my body and my lifestyle are far from being obese, you presumptuous dolt. I probably eat much like you do, if not better; almost no processed foods, organic everything as much as possible, basically no red meat consumption and limited meat consumption in general, i pay attention to my vitamin, mineral and additional nutrient intakes and vary foods regularly. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re eating bags of watercress, you&#39;re still eating food that was packaged in plastic, which in a lot of cases will cause compounds to leech into the food. Past that, these compounds are everywhere else in modern society, it&#39;s inescapable.</p>

<p>But yeah, just eat healthy bro, that&#39;ll fix it. You are absolutely hilarious</p>

<p>Also your research skills are appallingly poor. I&#39;m going to be honest with you, and I know it&#39;s going to be a shock, but you&#39;re actually a dumb person. And I don&#39;t mean that as an insult, you just don&#39;t have great critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>This is one of the best answers I&#39;ve seen so far. </p>

<p>A lot of people have given apathetic &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;  answers... or straight up denial... or trying to claim it&#39;s some kind of trans or homo-phobic thing. </p>

<p>But this is a public health issue that seem to be getting ignored. I like the above comment because it fits in with another example of &quot;forced acceptance&quot;. Obesity.</p>

<p>We know statistically that there&#39;s an epidemic of obesity. We also seem to disagree over the exact cause. And we also see an attempt at engineering people&#39;s perceptions with regards to obesity.</p>

<p>70s era feminism acted as a method to screw over poor people by making the issue about women but instead of representing low income women, it became a generalized ideology adopted by wealthier college women who treated themselves the same as the low income women they claimed to represent.</p>

<p>Step 1: Replace men with the state. Women don&#39;t need men anymore for any reason. Makes both sexes easier to control.</p>

<p>Step 2: Once men and women are the same, women will have to be in the workforce just as much as men. This means more corporate consumption and more corporate profits.</p>

<p>Step 3: Once you have a fully enslaved population, the children are no longer raised by families but they are raised by the state, through daycares and schools, and can be programmed as the state wishes. Full control is achieved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it’s true that what you eat and drink is your own choice, that isn’t the only source of Xenoestrogens. I’ve always eaten pretty healthy, but still got sick. I’m not sure if you’re aware of how prevalent these chemicals are in our daily life. Xenoestrogens are in pesticides in our food, they’re in exhaust from cars, they’re in plastic water bottles, they’re in canned food, they’re in the plastic that grocery stores wrap meat in, they’re in a lot of carpets, they’re in building materials, they’re injected into livestock, they’re even in fumes from copiers and printers. I avoid all of those the best I can, and eat entirely organic now, filter my water, etc. but it’s pretty damn hard AND expensive. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24466711/">Polish study</a>  cites that Xenoestrogens are in our water, soil, food, and air, as well as household cleaning supplies. </p>

<p>You say as long as nobody’s being forced to be a certain way, there’s no issue, but it’s practically impossible to fully escape Xenoestrogens. So yeah, it actually kind of does feel forced.</p>

I think they are trying to depopulate us by doing this,  making us either gay or making us not want to have sex or procreate. Look at Japan right now,  no one cares about having sex or having kids. I think that could be happening here through many ways. I think our hormones are being interfered with which can feminize our boys and drop their testosterone levels,  making them not want to have sex. I wonder how much sex or country is really having,  being truthful, I bet it&#39;s much lower than previous generations. I&#39;ll be researching this more,  it&#39;s something I see happening with my own eyes daily.  Is that a guy or a girl?  I ask myself that quite a lot these days and I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s about feeling secure with yourself enough to look more feminine or girls to be more masciline. Kids at schools are being asked what name they want to be called,  some girls are asking to be called Harold or other manly names and identifying as the opposite sex.  This just didn&#39;t happen 20-30 years ago, this is new and being pushed on our children as a choice they get to make. Our very genders are being destroyed and watered down. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s dissect what you have said. You are only focusing on individual traits. Eating meat and drinking beer are not the issue. Actually that is what we ate in all history. Agriculture produce is a recent phenomenon. Mankind was mostly depended on eating meat/fish etc for long long time. So get out here with your vegan conspiracy. </p>

<p>The issue of feminisation is systemic. From the early childhood boys are not allowed to be &#39;boys&#39;. All these schools are like jail-house with hundreds of rules and regulation. Primary teacher (mostly women) are hell-bound to cut down any boyish activity and try to make them docile. These are reflected in the persona of the males in later life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Berkeley, the alleged epicenter of this &quot;radical rewiring&quot; of humans. Yet, I go to the gym, and its at capacity with large jacked tattoo&#39;d guys getting their pump on. I go to the park, and notice there&#39;s a pickup softball or soccer game. On this early fine Saturday morning if I leave my house and turn left I will pass a yoga studio full of ambitious women maintaining their figure, then past that the smoothie cafe where the previous class goes after to gab and catch up. But I can keep walking past that and go to my breakfast diner and order my heart-clenching corn-beef-hash and eggs with nothing but a smile from the server. If I were so inclined, I could loiter until lunch time until they&#39;d cook me an enormous double-half-lb bacon burger with all that fatty-goodness, and no hormones because we&#39;re fancy like that.</p>

<p>My point being, men generally naturally gravitate to doing masculine things, and women feminine things, and nobody is trying to stop that. The difference now is society is making a point to say &quot;yeah, this works for most of us, but if your heart tells you to go another way thats totally cool too--don&#39;t be ashamed for you-doing-you&quot;. For some reason this pisses the fuck-all out of a lot of people in this country, but I don&#39;t get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are any of them as readily known, scientifically verified, and personally avoidable as the impact of obesity on sperm count, testosterone production, and <strong>estrogen conversion</strong>?</p>

<p>Just a man <a href="https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/news/20041022/obesity-takes-toll-on-sperm-fertility#1">being over 25 on the BMI scale lowers his sperm count  by 24%</a>. This is old facts, yet everytime it&#39;s brought up it&#39;s brushed aside in favor of blaming it on what&#39;s either unavoidable (shit in the tap water) or that the person in question probably doesn&#39;t even knowingly consume (soy, like them libruls love).</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>No offense meant here:</em> You&#39;ve just applied those stereotypes, yourself.  Nobody is saying all men have to be &quot;strong&quot;, and all women have to be &quot;dainty&quot;.  Instead, there is a biological basis to this discussion.  Since the 1970s, data suggests that males are slowly being purged out of existence, medically and socially, despite what our inflammatory media leads us to believe.</p>

<p>Objectively speaking, based on the most current data, the average American male&#39;s testosterone has fallen significantly over the last ~30 years, and subsequently, so has sperm count and overall health.  Males require more testosterone to be &quot;healthy&quot;, with low testosterone even influencing things like heart disease risk and cognition.</p>

<p>For a female, this might not seem like an issue.  For males, it&#39;s alarming.  <em>Why is this happening?  Why is our collective health declining so rapidly?</em></p>

<p><strong>Not only that, but socially</strong>: Why are males <em>constantly</em> accused of being a monolithic, privileged, racist, misogynistic, patriarchy?  Not only is this an outdated concept (<em>based on the current course of our culture</em>) but it&#39;s a falacy.  Men today have no advantages over women, aside from <em>usually</em> being physically larger/stronger.</p>

<p>-The myth of the income gap has been destroyed repeatedly, and in many cases, women are making more than men.</p>

<p>-Rates of suicide are highest amongst white males, with 7 out of 10 US suicides being carried out by this group.</p>

<p>-Women attend and graduate from universities at a significantly higher rate than men, and usually get better grades.  And as of 3 months ago, women now outnumber men in US medical schools.</p>

<p>-About 94% of those incarcerated in US prisons are males, with the majority of those being white males.</p>

<p>-Women can beat on their man, but men can&#39;t even lay a finger on a woman.</p>

<p>-Men are still expected to pay for women on dates.</p>

<p>-Fat women are bold and beautiful, while fat men are viewed as pigs.</p>

<p>-A woman sharing her body on Facebook is liberating, but a guy sharing his hard-earned abs is shamed as a douche.</p>

<p>-<em>&quot;If you&#39;re under 6&#39;1&quot;, swipe left&quot;</em>; do you realize how <em>devastating</em> that is for some guys?  The average male height is 5&#39;9&quot;; that eliminates ~86% of the male population.  As if they can help how tall they are.</p>

<p>-Women feel pressure to be thin; that&#39;s easy, walk and eat right.  Men feel a pressure to be thin <em>and</em> muscular; do you realize how difficult it is to maintain 150 lbs of LBM?</p>

<p>-Women can usually freely talk about their feelings with those around them, while men are expected to keep it to themselves.  And if they don&#39;t, they&#39;re often viewed as weak.</p>

<p>Society is clinging to these outdated ideas about men, such as women are shamed by men for having a lot of sex.  <strong>Let me inquire:</strong> When have you seen that happen with <em>your own two eyes</em>?  And if you have, I would bet my bottom dollar that it was a woman shaming another woman.  Being &quot;reckless&quot; is in, and it has achieved popularity in MSM.  All of these ideas are antiquated, and promoting them is allowing women not to achieve equality, but instead continue to paint us as monsters living in ivory towers.</p>

<p>And still, we&#39;re expected to approach you?  And be chivalrous?  And give in to these false ideals, while we&#39;re constantly being hyper-analyzed and bashed in some form or fashion?  We&#39;re too feminine, or too masculine.  We&#39;re too clingy, or too unavailable.  We&#39;re unkempt, or metrosexual.  We make too much, or don&#39;t earn enough.  Our muscles are too defined or not big enough.  His penis is too small, or too big.  He&#39;s too short at 5&#39;9&quot;, but too tall at 6&#39;4&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Stop listening to <em>Buzzfeed</em> and open your eyes to what is actually happening.  Men are being biologically and socially wiped from existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The feminists are warring against (the definition of) femininity...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They appear more to be warring against masculinity to the point where any existence of it is considered &quot;toxic&quot;.  Misandry is not  a component of individualistic philosophy, but rather a learned behavior like misogyny. An Androgynistic society is forced. It is far from an organic and natural...and is doomed. The natural roles of men and women working together in a synergistic relationship is far stronger and able for survival and fighting off threats than the confused and paralyzing effect of androgyny.</p>

<p>Marriages have never been more unhappier. As the roles of men and women become more confused, couples become more and more frustrated at the complete lack of definition created by the Marxist philosophy. It will, as predicted, purposefully destroy the American family and society. Men and women have evolved to play specific roles to create a strong civilization...feminized men are weak and cannot perform the harder physical tasks or think in a linear fashion as do men...a mindset and mental frame that is critically needed to survive a hostile environment.  </p>
