       There was a nice response to my previous post, of an Art Bell caller, so I figure I would bring up another one of my favorite callers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In September of 1997, a guy calls into Art's show, frantically telling Art that he was a worker at Area 51. He sounds fairly distraught on his first call, which is 'cut off' early. A week later, he supposedly called back, claiming his first call was a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a neat listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you enjoy.

       Personally, I think it was a well done hoax, and it was just a fluke that they lost their signal during the call.

       Whoever called back was not the first guy, didn't sound anything like him, which of course makes it even crazier because it gives some credence to the first caller.

       I heard that asshole on another similar call-in show. I cannot immediately remember what it was but I'm leaning toward it being a Bigfoot thing. He admitted to contriving the hoax and said he originally wanted to call in during the vampire episode but couldn't get through the lines so took the area 51 opportunity.

       The first guy, if faking, had to be one of the greatest actors ever. You know how you can tell when someone is fake laughing? It's the same with hearing genuine terror in a voice, and that guy sounded genuinely terrified. The guy who called back was either a bad-acting opportunist who realized the first guy was never calling back, and called back in to get some fame (and to sell a book too iirc, which makes it seem even more like a scam), or a really bad acting government agent trying way too hard to mimic the voice of the first guy, and even trying to match the fear making his voice crack, which

        So, guys, I just did a bit of research. Apparently, the reason this guy lost transmission during his call is that their satellite had lost earth lock. That means that somehow their satellite was knocked out of position. Their satellite was knocked out of position
What the hell could have done that?﻿

       How often does that happen? With tens of thousands of those things up there, you'd think they'd get hit with debris or knocked out of position all the time.

       I don't think for a second that all TV and radio isn't ready to be put out of commission by NSA or similar agencies at a moment's notice. Why wouldn't they have that power?

       Well, it was only a Youtube comment....

       None of us have researched the claim.

       Maybe Art Bell just switched off the caller because
       <em>
        it could otherwise compromise national security
       </em>
       ....
      </p>
      <p>
       you know, Bell or his team didn't necessarily
       <em>
        know for sure
       </em>
       whether it was a dangerous call... but I'm sure they had instructions to be cautious if confidential info started to be said on air... to act before thinking it through!

       Cutting off the caller makes it all that more intriguing. I'm sure the station did have protocol/procedure for callers that may leak confidential info, and as you say, be cautious of what gets out over the airwaves.

       That makes sense. He didn't want his show taken off air, so he would have been cautious. However, I would think, like any radio host, he could have just terminated the call. It was pretty convincing the way it went down.

       Definitely one of my favorite unsolved mysteries. Some say Art Bell could have hoaxed it for publicity, but I don't think that's true. As to whether the call was genuine, you might say "I want to believe."

       I think it's very unlikely the satellite got knocked out of position. However every satellite has course correcting engines - so they can and do position themselves from time to time. The ISS does this as well using the Soyuz I believe, it may also have on-board engines, I don't remember.

       But their link got cut somehow, that's not bullshit - that

       Omg I remember hearing this live when it happened. I was eating a Burito from my favorite places to eat late night. It was kind of scary as shit when I heard it. There really wasn't anyone to talk to online then about the show. So it just kind of hung there till the next night and people would call in and talk about it.

       It goes deeper than all the people saying "the call dropped". If i remember correctly, the call didn't just drop, the station lost power/connectivity in a way that had never happened before, as if someone had hacked into their systems and shut them down.

       IT WAS A HOAX AND ART BELL GOT CHUMPED.last time im going to clarify this for you. the area 51 caller called jimmy church. he was at the time he called art bell trying along with a friend for days,weeks trying to get through on open lines. they had the call very well planned out. they were part of,and still are involved in a traveling art theater company. he called jimmy and they re-staged the call. start the vid at around 2 minutes.they re-enact pretty much what happened on the art bell show.he goes through a series of call ins and then brings the actual caller on  his name is Brian glass.he comes on about 13:00 min mark.

       i will go further to suggest art bell knew it was a set up. art was suspected as having staged calls for years.

       That show attracting quite a bit of entertainment. Some of it would stop you in your tracks, thinking what could be.
