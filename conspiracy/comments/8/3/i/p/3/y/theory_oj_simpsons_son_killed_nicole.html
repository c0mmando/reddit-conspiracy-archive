       anyone ever look into this one? it's more than a little plausible. basically OJ's son Jason was a volatile young man who maintained a good relationship (purely platonic) with Nicole after the breakup. He had been diagnosed with "intermittent rage disorder" and was prescribed the drug Depakote to control it. apparently on the night of the murder, nicole and her boyfriend were supposed to go to jason's restaurant and pulled out at the last minute. the theory is this drove jason into a rage that ultimately led to him murdering her at her home, and then calling his dad in a state of panic. like any good father OJ offered to take the rap, with the thought that he might get off cause as he wasn't the actually killer, the evidence wouldn't match up ( he was right). jason's work card could never be found from the restaurant the night of the murder, and he was barely questioned by police. At the time of the killings, Jason was on probation for assault with a deadly weapon — he attacked a former employer with a knife.

       Solid theory. I still think Kato did it. He was banging her. Got jealous. Killed her. I bet those gloves fit him.

       the problem with that theory - in my opinion:  OJ would not have taken the fall for Kato.
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree with the OP -- have always believed that OJ's son did it, and OK is basically a hero father.

       Who was her boyfriend? Cause Ron Goldman was just a waiter who was there dropping off a pair of sunglasses that she had left at the restaurant he worked at earlier that day... they barely knew each other, other than waiter/patron a few times cause I think it was a restaurant her family frequented...

       no waiter is going the extra mile like that for someone who isn't connected. but on the off chance he did,
       <em>
        bing bong
       </em>
       "here are your glasses, ms. nicole brown simpson." and is out in less than a minute. nah, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       the truth will come out eventually. especially since the juice is making the mistake of talking about it instead of just dying on a golf course.

       Well if you're talking about the interview that airs tonight, again, that was recorded decades ago and is not new... OJ isn't talking about anything as far as I know... and the waiter/sunglasses thing: Nicole's mom had called the restaurant after they left, and the manager said he would have someone bring them to her after the restaurant closed.. the manager sent Goldman to Nicole's house (presumably because that was where they were told to bring them to)...

       The LAPD found candles and music and all that in Nicole’s bedroom. Goldman went over there to fuck her if he hadn’t been for weeks already.

       I too thought they barely knew each other, but after reading Fuhrman's book, it seems clear that there was at least something casual or friendly going on between the two. They were seen at Starbucks together and he was seen driving her Ferrari, in the weeks prior to the murders. Goldman's hairdresser also commented saying that he told her he was dating someone older who had kids.

       I prefer Occam’s razor on this one.  Ex-NFL Star with CTE, rage, and jealousy issues flies off the handle, blacks out, kills the woman he’s been abusing for years, and lucks out when his mediocre legal team gets set against a pair of sub-par prosecutors and a bungled investigation and when the jury pool is tainted against the police due to recent events.

       The theory is that Jason called OJ and OJ went to the murder scene and that’s why his shoe prints were present and his clothes and car were bloody.

      <p>
       I've got cuts on my hands right now. Don't remember when it happened during the course of the week. Am I a murderer?

       No proof they were his footprints or his shoes. Tons of people wear those types of footwear &amp; isotoner gloves. They aren't exactly rare clothing items. You can walk into any upscale mall &amp; purchase either of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       From court testimony:
      </p>
      <p>
       "So you are saying Simpson could be the source of that stain, not that he is the source of that stain?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecution emphasized after the recitation of each test result that the blood samples were consistent with Simpson and the two victims, but cannot be called an absolute match.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of that could point to OJ helping his emotionally challenged violent son avoid a stint in prison.

       There was a BBC doco which was the first time I think the son was named as suspect. They did there own research and a chemical test not available at time of murder was used which came to the conclusion that the blood was tampered with.

       The theory is that the plan to frame himself to look like the murderer was set in motion almost immediately.  OJ wanted everyone to think he was guilty.  OJ went to the crime scene when his son called him for help, that explains the blood, glove, and footprints.  He cut himself intentionally, again to make himself look guilty.  None of what you said contradicts this theory.

       I read the book on this and the investigator that spent some years looking into this had a very thought provoking theory on this one. OJ was claimed to faint at the sight of blood, the son had a weird crush on Nicole, she stood him up for dinner at the restaurant he was a chef at. Also he clocked out early or something like that. OJ went to the scene to gather the evidence and hid it before his flight. Would explain why he was clearly hiding something and why the glove didn’t fit. Who knows?

       One of the big pieces of evidence used to find OJ guilty in the civil trial was his Bruno Magli shoes. There is little doubt the killer was wearing a pair of size 12 Bruno Magli shoes. In the murder trial he denied having any. In the civil trial there were numerous photos of him presented wearing Bruno Magli shoes identical to those found at the crime scene. I think OJ killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, but he was absolutely stitched up on kidnapping charges in Nevada.

       yep i always believed oj didnt do it but he knew exactly who did do it.  would explain why the son was the first to meet oj after the chase.  and how oj had so much knowledge of the crime.  he's either a 'good' father, or a pyschopath.

       I actually wrote a presentation on this exact subject for a debate class in college.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a couple more details alleged - OJ hired a lawyer for Jason BEFORE he even got one for himself, and there was a beanie with animal DNA on it found near the crime scene that is an exact match to one Jason is wearing in a picture with his pit bull. Nicole was also supposed to come to Jason's restaurant for dinner THE NIGHT SHE DIED but backed out. Jason's timecard from that night is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combined with the history of violent incidents and the fact that Jason had issues with taking his medication, I convinced myself doing the research that OJ covered for Jason. Hell, the Bronco chase could have been giving Jason time to dispose of evidence/get to a lawyer.

       100%, OJ knows how Nicole and Ron died that night. If he did act alone, he could have come clean about it and not faced any consequences, and I think he's narcissistic enough that he would have. He can't do that directly, though, if there's someone else involved because that implicates the other person.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many loose ends if it was just OJ. He's covering for his son and I really hope that comes to light one day.

       OJ killed Nicole with such rage - but I do believe that his son was waiting in the car for his dad.  He lawyered up real quick and possibly disposed of his dad's clothes from the murder.  But, I don't believe he knew his dad was going to kill them.  He just helped with the coverup.

       Funny you mention this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew a gentleman who was a roommate of OJ's at USC, who became a close friend of his.  They would vacation and spend holidays with OJ and his family throughout  the years (and marriages).  OJ's kids from his 1st marriage even referred to this gentleman and his wife as their "aunt and uncle".
      </p>
      <p>
       One time over drinks, I had a discussion about the whole OJ murder case and he genuinely believed that OJ's oldest son, Jason, committed the murders and OJ tried to cover for him.  He said Jason was a hot head and he really had a big problem with Nicole screwing around and embracing his Dad.
