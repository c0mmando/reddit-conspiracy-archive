        Chapters
       </a>
       ' page, though I imagine and hope that all of the site's content will be useful for you. I am the site's author and am always open to constructive feedback and criticism, so I'd love to hear what you think and if you have any suggestions for content or about the design.

      <h4>
       What is it?
      </h4>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A database of lists of some of the most valuable and important ideas, events, media, tools, and quotes which serve to broaden horizons and practical understanding of various aspects of life and to shed light upon the larger picture which is developing.
       </li>
       <li>
        A catalyst which can help to 'raise all boats' and enable more people to get closer to a common understanding with greater speed and efficacy so that urgent and critical issues can be addressed in more informed and focused ways.
       </li>
       <li>
        A call to action to help more people realize the necessity of forming new 'software / operating-systems' to upgrade and/or replace current obsolete systems which are, in many cases, incapable of addressing current issues.
       </li>
       <li>
        An effort to 'sort the wheat from the chaff' and the valuable information from the noise, and condense the overwhelming number of variables and 'pieces of the puzzle' into a useful framework so that the broader image is more easily understood and is externalized so that the various pieces don't all need to be juggled in one's mind.

       This is a great idea. I was thinking that with the internet censorship that is happening we need to collect these materials and store them offsite to preserve them.

       Thanks, I'm glad that you think so. I've tried to make it as accessible as possible. The whole site is under 1.5mb on my computer, and I believe when downloaded it is roughly only 5mb when last I checked, so it's not too 'heavy' and very easy to share and preserve.

       It seems to me that you may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater after a very brief skim of the surface. While I may agree with some stances of those on the left I don't consider myself to be leftist, socialist, or communist, and actually I have many disagreements with those who do. I imagine that those that consider themselves to be on the right would agree with much of the site's content. I self-identify as independent (not part of the Independent Party) and feel it is most practical and beneficial to move beyond left vs. right, red vs blue, binary, tribal thinking and behavior.
