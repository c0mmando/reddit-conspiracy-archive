        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey fellow conspirators... This is my own theory I&#39;ve drawn from connecting dots. </p>

<p>First, The dots;</p>

<p>Recently DARPA has been involved in many different &quot;gene drive&quot; technologies.</p>

<p><a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2017/12/darpa-invests-100-million-in-gene-drive-technology/">https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2017/12/darpa-invests-100-million-in-gene-drive-technology/</a></p>

<p>The U.S. federal government is also pressing companies like 23andMe as well as Ancestry.com to release to them, their respective DNA databases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.technocracy.news/index.php/2015/10/19/feds-pressing-ancestry-com-for-customers-dna/">https://www.technocracy.news/index.php/2015/10/19/feds-pressing-ancestry-com-for-customers-dna/</a></p>

<p>We all know that DARPA paves the way inventing new nefarious ways to destroy their adversaries...</p>

<p>The CDC recently repealed a moratorium on the development of genetically engineered viruses and diseases.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/12/nih-lifts-3-year-ban-funding-risky-virus-studies">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/12/nih-lifts-3-year-ban-funding-risky-virus-studies</a></p>

<p>Right now TPTB need us, the peasants, as their resource gathering workforce. We are the backbone that brings them wealth. Yet, we as a majority, may very well be replaced by fully autonomous AI backed machines in the very near future. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/gizmodo.com/robots-are-already-replacing-human-workers-at-an-alarmi-1793718198/amp">https://www.google.com/amp/s/gizmodo.com/robots-are-already-replacing-human-workers-at-an-alarmi-1793718198/amp</a></p>

<p>Now, The picture; I believe it is entirely possible that once full automation is in effect, a virus targeting specific genealogies, or possible a virus NOT targeting specific genealogies will  be used to reduce the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So DARPA pretty much created what we know as the internet today. 
The ideas for the internet came from ETs tech transfer either 
by face to face meeting or telepathy transfer during sleep or whatnot. </p>

<p>Since coming to this conclusion, I&#39;ve always thought of DARPA as being one of the major vehicles for taking ET tech and releasing it to the public. It&#39;s like technology laundering.  </p>

<p>Regarding DNA work, It would make logical sense that they would be working with ET groups to tweak DNA in preparation for the earth frequency increase changes. They could be either working to maintain the status quo (low frequency for humans) or to prepare as many people for the change (high frequency for humans).</p>

<p>CDC is 100% full of shit. MMR vaccine causes regressive autism in select number of healthy babies . The rumor is that they are working on a fear-based epidemic that would be widespread provided people were sufficiently afraid. Right before releasing it, they would launch a coordinated campaing to ensure that global fear levels are extremely high.</p>

<p>Do not fall victim to this.  Work to practice converting fear into positive energy.  It is your choice. </p>
