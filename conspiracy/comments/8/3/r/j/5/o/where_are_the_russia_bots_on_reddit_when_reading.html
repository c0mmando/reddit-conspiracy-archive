<p>All of the comments about what Putin said seem based on the headline and not one person actually read or watched the interview.</p>

<p>Only the Kremlin has posted the transcript of the interview, which illustrates that Putin came off well in the interview and made Megyn Kelly look like an idiot.</p>

<p>All the US media has is fake headlines and refusal to really discuss the issues raised.</p>

<p>Even the morning talking head shows ignored this interview because they don&#39;t really want to talk details of what was said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the US media wants us to know that their beloved George W Bush pulled us out of the ABM treaty....because 9/11! (terrorists don&#39;t have ballistic missiles)</p>

<p>&quot;If we speak of the arms race, it began at that very moment, when the United States pulled out of the ABM Treaty. We wanted to prevent this. We called on our American partners to work together on these programmes.</p>

<p>Firstly, we asked them not to withdraw from the treaty, not to destroy it. But the US pulled out. It was not us who did this but the US.</p>

<p>Yet we again suggested we work together even after this. I told my colleague then, “Imagine what would happen if Russia and the US joined forces in the crucial area of strategic security. The world would change for a long period to come, and the level of global security would rise to an all-time high.” The reply was, “This is very interesting.” But they ultimately rejected all our proposals.&quot;</p>

<p>Why do our politicians hate peace?</p>

<p>&quot;Megyn Kelly: One of the questions that our audiences have is how do we walk this back? How do we get to the place where these two great nations are less adversaries and something closer to allies, which we clearly are not right now. Do you agree we are not?</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin: Unfortunately, we are not. But we were not the ones who made the US our adversary. It was the US, the US Congress, who called Russia its adversary. Why did you do that? Did Russia impose sanctions on the United States? No, it was the US that imposed sanctions on us.</p>

<p>Megyn Kelly: You know why.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin: No, I do not. Can I ask you a different question? Why did you encourage the government coup in Ukraine? Why did you do that? The US directly acknowledged spending billions of dollars to this end. This was openly acknowledged by US officials. Why do they support government coups and armed fighting in other countries? Why has the US deployed missile systems along our borders?</p>

<p>Listen, Russia and the US should sit down and talk it over in order to get things straight. I have the impression that this is what the current President wants, but he is prevented from doing it by some forces. But we are ready to discuss any matter, be it missile-related issues, cyberspace or counterterrorism efforts. We are ready to do it any moment. But the US should also be ready. The time will come when the political elite in the US will be pushed by public opinion to move in this direction. We will be ready the instant our partners are ready.&quot;</p>

<p>Putin asked for evidence so that he can see if they violated Russian law.</p>

<p>&quot;If you are worried about anything, state it officially, send us documents proving it and explain what exactly those people are accused of. We will see if they have violated Russian laws…</p>

<p>Megyn Kelly: I did that.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin: No, this is not true. If they violated Russian law, we will prosecute them. If they did not, there is nothing to prosecute them for in Russia.</p>

<p>Here is her evidence ....</p>

<p>&quot;Megyn Kelly: I will give you one piece of evidence. Andrei Krutskikh is an advisor to the Kremlin when it comes to cyber issues. In his speech to an information security forum in February 2016, he reportedly said, quote, “I am warning you. We are on the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals.” What do you think he meant? Because it certainly sounds like a threat right before an election hack.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin: Sometimes I think you are joking.</p>

<p>Megyn Kelly: No, I am deadly serious.&quot;</p>

<p>Why not present evidence?</p>

<p>Because the only &#39;evidence&#39; they have is running ads, many of them after the election.</p>

<p>They US has imposed sanctions, an act of war, based on lies and propaganda.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen the &quot;putin interview&quot; stuff; it&#39;s been edited into <em>tiny</em> soundbites that leave no room for context. (and we all know the media would <em>never</em> use those to drive a specific narrative /s)</p>

<p>Look at any post on world news about Putin, I have no idea what people are talking about.</p>

<p>They attack Putin as stealing the election based on propaganda by the corporate media.  They cannot offer any evidence.</p>

<p>When Putin asked for evidence he got:</p>

<p>&quot;Megyn Kelly: I will give you one piece of evidence. Andrei Krutskikh is an advisor to the Kremlin when it comes to cyber issues. In his speech to an information security forum in February 2016, he reportedly said, quote, “I am warning you. We are on the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals.” What do you think he meant? Because it certainly sounds like a threat right before an election hack.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin: Sometimes I think you are joking.&quot;</p>

<p>THIS is evidence.  They have put sanctions on Russia in an attempt to stop a gas pipeline to the EU.  This is an act of war.  Our politicians and media are hopelessly corrupt and they think we are really stupid.  They are embarrassing our nation on an international scale.</p>

<p>Paid posters seem to have a list of propaganda posts about how evil Putin is, and apparently have never seen an interview with him.</p>

<p>Every time he speaks, he makes our politicians look like morons.</p>

<p>He talks geopolitics, they talk in propaganda points based on lies.</p>

<p>And the &#39;evidence&#39; of election interference is ridiculously laughable.</p>

<p>No one in their right mind could follow the media&#39;s changing propaganda, from &quot;hacking&quot; the election to now running a few ads....are we really such a weak nation that Russians ran a few stupid ads and we were all manipulated?</p>

<p>They think we are really stupid, and they put their manufacturing consent bots all over the net to make us think everyone else is stupid and give up.</p>

<p>They have shut down discussion in many places.  I can only discuss politics on the conspiracy subreddit.</p>

<p>These people have all the other subreddits to control, yet they are still here manipulating discussion.  </p>

<p>If they are not paid posters, what the freak are they doing here?</p>

<p>No, because Americans don’t give a fuck about that. The goal is and was to be divisive, that’s why they pick stuff that purports to threaten what people care about or stuff that ”religious” white people have an innate fear of. Like how just before the election the NFL story trending on Twitter was some BS about Hillary wanting to change the name of the Washington redskins, or how liberals want to enact sharia law, or that theres been a war on christmas and only trump can bring god back to the white house. That’s the type of shit that riles people up, stories that any rational thought would demonstrate to be untrue but have enough emotional resonance to them to get both sides to destroy each other over.</p>

<p>And again, this stuff is not difficult to find at all. Tea Party News, TEN_GOP, etc</p>

<p>I find this hard to believe, simply because every SINGLE comment I make about Hillary still is either in the negatives, or at the very least has a red cross next to it (controversial). Who are all these people out there that still support her, and feel the need to downvote anyone saying anything bad about her? It&#39;s literally <em>every</em> time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I begin, I want to remind you that there are <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=jeocvejp&amp;amp;sh=84f00560">tons of different countries and corporations that hire shills online.</a> This includes both sides of the political spectrum. I don&#39;t put much trust in the people who try to downplay one side because we don&#39;t actually know who has the bigger effect. So you don&#39;t even have to read further if you are only interested in shilling in general.</p>

<p>To respond to your post, CTR started with 1 million, but accumulated about 10 million until the election when it was defunded. After that, Shareblue <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/david-brock-donald-trump-donor-network-231588">likely took in some of the CTR personnel</a> according to Politico, and shareblue was funded to about 40 million. </p>

<p>In the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/60bduk/a_well_funded_partnership_between_media_matters/">Shareblue leaked memo</a>, it mentions that there is a right wing problem on platforms such as Reddit, Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter, and that they are going to fight back online against it. Just like CTR did, they pretty much  admitted that they will be shilling on Reddit. </p>

<p>They do other types of influence operations outside of social media as well. Another link on Shareblue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the Clintonian grass roots seemed to have organically sprouted in anger. But closer inspection yielded traces of Miracle-Gro that led to the 6th floor of a building in Manhattan. &quot;They will put that pressure right on the media outlets in a very intense way,&quot; said Daou, of Shareblue. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/shareblue-galvanizes-twitter-army-to-voice-outrage-on-clintons-behalf/">https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/shareblue-galvanizes-twitter-army-to-voice-outrage-on-clintons-behalf/</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pre-Shareblue stuff:</p>

<p>Clinton Staff busted for shilling on social media in 2007: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/12/clinton-staff-a/">http://www.wired.com/2007/12/clinton-staff-a/</a></p>

<p>Correct the Record--Superpac that worked directly with Clinton Campaign in 2016, openly admits they will be shilling on reddit, Twitter, and Instagram. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160618091140/http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/">https://web.archive.org/web/20160618091140/http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/</a></p>

<p>My advice is to familiarize yourself with the first link I cited because it contains everything we know about shills from 1999 to today, across both sides of the political spectrum and corporations. </p>

<p>I think the majority of accusations about specific users being Hillary shills is bullshit, since I&#39;ve been accused of being one myself. But on the other hand, the same goes for the majority of people who are called Russian shills (also something I&#39;ve been accused of). Both sides use the accusation against others without evidence. The sheer number of entities out there who hire shills means we don&#39;t really know which specific users are paid and what angle they have. It&#39;s best to just verify a claim yourself and inform yourself about all of the public information available about shilling. </p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;s laughable that you can&#39;t even consider the possibility that the US would employ similar agents to similar ends.

<p>Megyn Kelly: Let us do it. They wanted to investigate the helicopters and the UN wanted to go and check the helicopters that were on site. And Russia said no. Russia said no. Why?</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin: There was nothing of the kind. Russia did not say “No.” Russia is for a full-scale investigation. If you do not know this, I am telling you this now. It is not true that we are against an objective investigation. That is a lie. It is a lie just as the vial with the white substance that allegedly proved that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which the CIA gave to the US Secretary of State. He later apologised, but the damage had been done, the country had been ruined. This is yet another piece of fake news, which has no substance behind it. An investigation should be conducted to gather the substance. We are in favour of such an investigation.</p>

<p>Megyn Kelly: Since the beginning of the year, there have been at least four chlorine-based chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Our Secretary of State Tillerson just said that Russia bears the responsibility for this given your earlier promises to reign in chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Your response?</p>

<p>But Trump, he&#39;s the worst president ever according to the media.</p>

<p>Not the guy that started an unending war based on lies, not the guy who was hired to end the wars but only escalated them...Trump is the problem? </p>

<p>And Congress, with members who have been there for decades, are even more responsible than individual presidents for the disaster this country has become...the media treats them like the good guys too.</p>

<p>There is something terribly wrong with the media, why would you trust them?</p>

<p>Read for yourself and think about what the US is doing around the world.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary, but the only way we can fix it is if we admit we have a problem.</p>

<p>Everyone who spends any time on the net knows about the bots everywhere, and no one is offended and overwhelmed by Russia bots, I don&#39;t know what the freak the media are talking about.</p>

<p>Hillary bots  won&#39;t let any discussion on news, world news or politics and

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the trump subreddits aren&#39;t helping.</p>

<p>I have tried to have reasonable discussions, trying to unite both sides against the real evil in this country....only to be kicked off.</p>

<p>The bots are trying to create the impression that trump supporters are stupid fools, I am not sure why they would do that.</p>

<p>If there are real thinking Trump supporters, they need to do more to hold him to account not kiss his ass when they know he is wrong.</p>

<p>And if Trump is a Russian agent, what the hell is this bullshit WAR on Syria?</p>

<p>What the fuck does anyone think we are doing in that country?</p>

<p>I am consistent.  I hate war.  We waste the majority of tax dollars on war.</p>

<p>I have had enough and am just waiting for everyone else to wake up and see that nothing will improve, nothing will ever change until we stop these monsters.</p>

<p>This unending war in Syria is a war on the poor.</p>

<p>The government will never do anything to help we the people, we have to expose their crimes, hold them accountable and be the change ourselves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the CIA is running candidates against progressives...</p>

<p>But....</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t Trump declare &quot;we defeated ISIS&quot; in Syria, take credit and leave the country alone?</p>

<p>Why are we there protecting an oil field in a country where we are not welcome?</p>

<p>And then we complain when they try to get rid of us?</p>

<p>Our policy makes no sense, and ending the wars is one of the reasons people wanted Trump not Hillary.</p>

<p>So demand he stop wasting money on these fucking wars already!</p>

<p>&quot;Ex-DEA agent: Opioid crisis fueled by drug industry and Congress &quot;We had been achieving incredible success in an almost unstoppable wave, and then suddenly it stopped&quot;</p>

<p>truthwillout777 • 14 points • submitted 4 months ago</p>

<p>Then after enabling the opioid crisis ....&quot;Senate GOP offers $45 billion for opioid crisis&quot;
truthwillout777 • 57 points • submitted 4 months ago</p>

<p>&quot;JOE RANNAZZISI: Because I think that the drug industry -- the manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and chain drugstores -- have an influence over Congress that has never been seen before. And these people came in with their influence and their money and got a whole statute changed because they didn&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>Seven months after the bill became law, Congressman Marino&#39;s point man on the legislation, his Chief of Staff Bill Tighe, became a lobbyist for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.</p>

<p>Since the crackdown on the distributors began, the pharmaceutical industry and law firms that represent them have hired at least 46 investigators, attorneys and supervisors from the DEA, including 32 directly from the division that regulates the drug industry.</p>

<p>Mike Gill, chief of staff for the DEA administrator, was hired by HDJN, one of the country&#39;s largest healthcare law firms.</p>

<p>And most recently, Jason Hadges, a senior DEA attorney overseeing enforcement cases during the slowdown, joined the pharmaceutical and regulatory division of DC-based law firm Hogan Lovells. &quot;

<p>Joe Rannazzisi: <strong>You know all these people that died happened under my watch. The one thing I wanted to do, the one thing that I just thought would have the most impact, is to lock up, arrest one of these corporate officers. You arrest a corporate officer. You arrest somebody that&#39;s involved in the decision process, knowing what the law is. If you make that arrest, then everybody sits up and takes notice because three-piece-suit guys just don&#39;t do well in prison. They don&#39;t.</strong></p>

<p>Joe Rannazzissi now consults with state attorneys general who have filed suit against distributors for their role in the opioid crisis. Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn is running for the Senate. As for Congressman Marino, he was just nominated to be President Donald Trump&#39;s new drug czar.</p>

<p>Simple. If this is a real issue, and not a narrative-serving lie you fabricated, then you take screenshots whenever you see this happening. Then make a post about it.

<p>Why? Just make a post on this sub about it. As anyone can see, your posts and comments about the Russia narrative get tons of upvotes, so don&#39;t give me some bullshit about this sub being opposed to it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re one of the iron guard crusaders against the alt right on this sub, and appear about as credible, so I call you alt-left to indicate your position on the other side of the coin.</p>

<p>Oh, and just as an FYI, if you actually read the comment you linked they said: &quot;Just a heads up, if you post this again I&#39;m going to consider it harassment as they&#39;ve tried to call me a suspect account.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet I&#39;m certain that you both consciously and unconsciously added it to the blob of bias in your mind that could be termed as, &quot;evidence I&#39;ve seen online of Russian bot activity&quot;. That&#39;s what happens when you allow yourself to be spoon-fed things that trigger your confirmation bias and critically analyze nothing, while telling yourself that lying and fabricating things to serve your agenda is justified because you so firmly believe that your positions are the correct ones.</p>

<p>Btw, it&#39;s not only a shitty post for the reasons I mentioned, but also because many of the comments he is using as evidence link to accounts who are not on his list, and which are still clearly active, normal users.</p>

<p>This new information will not be filed in your brain, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have suspicions that I deal with shillblue quite often...  Maybe Russians too.  But it does nothing to point it out.  At the end of the day, if someone gets paid to make certain arguments, that doesn&#39;t necessarily make the arguments wrong.  In fact, it&#39;s kind of irrelevant to the argument...  How the argument came to be, whether it was paid for, thought up in the shower, or created as a meme or joke, these things don&#39;t determine the argument&#39;s validity.  So if someone is called out for being a shill, it&#39;s like, ok but are they wrong tho?</p>

<p>The types of people who will accept a paycheck like that aren&#39;t typically able to produce high level manipulations...  So they won&#39;t be skillfully using fallacies to deceive, most of the time.  They&#39;ll just be persistent, consistent, and absolutely closed off to changing their opinion.  And so, these may be secondary features or even affects of their being a shill, but they are the only really important parts of your engagement with them.  You can tell if you&#39;re dealing with a rational person if they&#39;re able to concede to evidence.</p>

<p>Examples would be...  </p>

<p>Certain groups paid people to not only assemble the evidence for the Holocaust but also get online and argue against Holocaust deniers.  Whatever you think of the Holocaust, assume it&#39;s totally real, is it wrong for such actors to exist, assuming the Holocaust or totally real?</p>

<p>I was listening to a podcast the other day and a black nationalist was talking about certain Egyptians being black and not Arabian or white.  He went so far as to say that he does not believe in DNA evidence nor would he recognize the legitimacy of a study unless it coincided with his historical understanding.  Clearly not paid but clearly not a rational person.</p>

<p>Putin asked Megyn Kelly &quot;Why did you encourage the government coup in Ukraine? Why did you do that? The US directly acknowledged spending billions of dollars to this end.

But <strong>we are ready to discuss any matter, be it missile-related issues, cyberspace or counterterrorism efforts. We are ready to do it any moment. But the US should also be ready. The time will come when the political elite in the US will be pushed by public opinion to move in this direction</strong> We will be ready the instant our partners are ready.&quot;</p>

<p>It is time for the US to admit our own meddling, and shut the f up about Russians running ads on Twitter.</p>

<p>Then the American people need to demand discussions, instead of warmongering.  THIS is our job, and the reason we cannot allow bots to control all avenues of discussion.</p>

Because if Americans saw how reasonable these leaders are, they may start to question the whole ball of lies we&#39;ve been told. Big bad Russia is coming - be scared! But mostly, give the MIC a shit load of cash to build weapons against an enemy that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>pushing for Trump to confront Putin about election interference...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I would think he would at least tell Putin, &quot;Fuck you, I am the Alpha here. We are America, and we can fuck you up.&quot; I would be down on the Trump train (centipede?) if Trump handed Putin his ass on a platter. We are America and no one fucks with us</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>What constitutes real evidence? Don&#39;t you take the word of the 17 American intelligence agencies over that of Putin&#39;s?  We ARE the world leader. We do what we want. Fuck Russia, really</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Which 17?</p>

<p>[–]PencilFaceButt[S] [score hidden] 40 minutes ago </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>I don&#39;t know. All I know is that American agencies are to be believe over Russia any old day for an American</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>As an American, I am proned to believe over a Russian president that came from the KGB. As an American.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Right now, to me as an American, its looking highly probably that Russia meddled. But at the same time, it is still appearing as though may or may not have colluded. Either way, why is Trump not telling that little weasel Putin that fuck the fuck off? Are you American?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>This poster really wants Trump to tell Putin to fuck off, has no idea the evidence is non existent, points out he is American several times, yet writes in bad english.</p>
