       This whole story is as strange as one can be. We'll probably never know the whole truth but this is some twilight shit.

      <p>
       EDIT: This post yesterday in regards to brigading issues seems to hit the nail on the head, and a nerve too. Dare we challenge the MSM narrative somehow, and they all come out like rats...

       he easily could have spoken with an eyewitness who gave him a description of the shooter. it's then pretty standard practice to radio that out to the rest of the force so they know who to look for.

       actually yes. most conspiracy's can be easily dismissed if one is willing to look at the most plausible explanations first and consider them with more weight than the far reaching explanations. the conspiracy's that can't be explained away by common sense are the ones that are worth pursuing and exploring.

       your plausible explanation is just as good as mine, or am I wrong?

       You are assuming something happened, just as much as I do at this point. The only difference is your assumption is allowing you to sleep at night...

       look i'm not trying to convince you either way, i've just found in my life that common sense leads to a better and less confusing life. i also used to work in law enforcement in several capacities so i do have some relevant experience in how cops responding to the scene would act. do you really think it's impossible that the responding officer would have talked to a victim running from the school and that the victim would have given him a description of the shooter? i followed the incident live on the police scanner soon after the call went out and they knew fairly quickly who their suspect is. so why is it so crazy that someone on scene would have a description of the shooter? a lot of times when calls go out, the 911 caller gives a description over the phone. so are you willing to say that everytime a cop shows up knowing what a suspect is wearing that it means there is a secret plan that the cop is in on? i just can't follow that logic. all the best though friend, i don't mean to argue. this just seems like a simple explanation that doesn't justify a conspiracy to me personally.

       If the cop learned from a witness, they would have included it in the radio communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Students/Staff indicate shooter wearing maroon shirt, ROTC”
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if they witnessed the shooter the radio communication would have been much more specific and would have included the shooters movements and location.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Shooter moving to south end of school, I’m in pursuit, suspect wearing maroon shirt”.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is more interesting to me that the cop was able to get a description out so quickly, yet the schools caneras were on 20 minute tape delay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor Cruz boy was set up, that’s really the most simple explanation. Since CNN and MSM are complicit in the story now, they have to run with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the real question...
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it really a terrorist attack on our schools and they are using ‘gun control’ narratives to drown it out and keep us safe by remaining in the dark?

       this is true, which is why i stand by my original statement that the cop himself didn't see the suspect at the point where he radioed the suspect description, so obviously he was operating on second hand information.

       again this supports the theory that he had second hand info from a victim/someone that had escaped the school.

      <p>
       are you denying that he had a history of social media posts that made people suspect that he would do something like this? or that the FBI had already been alerted to the possibility that he had threatened to shoot up a school?

       It’s very probable he was the shooter, until we see a video still image of him in the school with his gear on I’ll remain skeptical.

       The four swat guys carrying the heavy bag out the school in bizarre fashion signals a lot, don’t you think?

       haven't seen that footage so i can't comment either way. on the surface that doesn't seem out of the ordinary for a swat team to have equipment they are carrying around and certainly isn't enough evidence to assume the whole thing is rigged/fake.

       The shooter was wearing body armor based on multiple witnesses. Yet, this cop who just got on the scene delivers the exact outfit the very moment he shows up there.

       The witness said body armor.  That doesn't mean that she is exactly describing what he was wearing.  Just as if a witness said he was carrying a "machine gun" wouldn't mean that that was what weapon was actually used.
      </p>
      <p>
       He arrives at the school wearing the red shirt and carrying a backpack/bag.  A school administrator sees him and calls it in on the radio (he's a known problem at this school).  In the bag he has the weapon and a flak-jacket type vest and a face covering, puts these on and does shooting.  Could have been a vest to hold magazines or a fake airsoft vest to look more tactical.  Who knows.  Then he ditches the vest and weapon and leaves trying to not be noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not an incredible or impossible thing to imagine.

       I'm saying that it is entirely plausible that the sheriff outside of the building got the correct description from one of the students fleeing the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I think he
       <em>
        saw
       </em>
       the shooter exit the building and still did nothing. That would explain why he had the proper description, and why the story is full of holes (he doesn't want to admit that he saw the shooter and did nothing, so he just lies and says the description came from elsewhere).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was further picking on the quip about how the "non crisis actors" saw him weaing a body armor and a helmet. He wasn't: they caught the guy, and he wasn't wearing all black.

       Two different Coral Springs officers were on scene.

       One was already there off-duty watering the baseball diamond, the other one arrived on duty.

       I recall that an school administrator saw Cruz come onto the property and send out an alert on the radio about it.  Shooting started soon after.  Could have noted on the radio that it was Cruz and he was wearing that specific shirt (since it was the shirt from that very school).

       actually yes. most conspiracy's can be easily dismissed if one is willing to look at the most plausible explanations first and consider them with more weight than the far reaching explanations. the conspiracy's that can't be explained away by common sense are the ones that are worth pursuing and exploring.
