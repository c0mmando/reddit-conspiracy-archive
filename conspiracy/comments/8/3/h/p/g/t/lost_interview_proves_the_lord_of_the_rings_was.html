        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>JRR Tolkien, along with CS Lewis and others, was a member of a society of writers known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings">Inklings.</a> They wrote books that exposed Satanism and control by the elites through metaphors, with the Lord of the Rings and Chronicles as the most prominent examples.</p>

<p>The Two Towers represent the two pillars of Freemasonry, as does the All-Seeing Eye of Sauron on the top. They also may represent the French and English Grand Lodges that competed for many centuries for dominance.</p>

<p>The Ring of Power represents dark occultism. Its only real power is to make the wearer invisible (symbols to hide one&#39;s intentions from the public) but it makes one visible to the Ring Wraiths (other dark occultists).</p>

<p>Using the Ring corrupts the wearer, and none have been able to completely destroy dark occultism. Isildur&#39;s name means &quot;devoted to the moon&quot; a reference to ISIS worship. His failure to destroy the ring could refer to the failure of the Israelites to destroy the dark occultists in Babylon (or many other historical events).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a> is an expansion of the lore and contains many hidden truths. It refers to an ancient Island kingdom (Atlantis) that was destroyed when they failed to kill the leader of the evil forces, and he slowly corrupted them, until their island was destroyed, and they fled to the ends of Middle Earth.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a previously lost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p7jFcnnE4U">recording</a> of JRR Tolkien was recovered. In it, he explains how the Lord of the Rings is actually a metaphor for the evil people ruling the world; there are followers of the evil wizards, and the good people of the world (hobbits) need to work together to defeat them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bit fanciful. The link you&#39;ve provided for the claim about the Inklings makes it very clear how light-hearted and non-serious the self-declared &quot;Inklings&quot; were.</p>

<p>Also, an Atlantis-alike featuring in the Silmarillion is just evidence of Tolkein weaving more human mythology into his work. He was adamant that the setting of Middle-Earth was on this planet that we inhabit, some time about the early Bronze Age. So it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if he decided he&#39;d throw in a splash of Atlantis too.</p>

<p>Tolkein was omnivorous and drew on all sorts of inspiration, transforming it with great skill into his fantasy writing. From memory, so maybe a bit wrong, he was pretty pissed at Hitler for appropriating the Nibelungen legends (in Wagner&#39;s operas, which had themselves appropriated German mythology). You can get a rough idea of how widely Tolkein cast his net <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien%27s_influences">here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tolkien was retelling our pre-history through the medium of literature (as it&#39;s always been, going back to the Vedas, Gilgamesh and the Iliad).</p>

<p>Numenor is quite like Sumer or Krete.</p>

<p>Atalanta is clearly Atlantis.</p>

<p>George R. R. Martin&#39;s also retelling pre-history in a sneaky way. The Valerians are closer to the Shi of Ireland, the Demigods of Sumer, and the Minoans of Krete than any other fictional race in modern fantasy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh the steam that rises from me.   </p>

<p>It seems there is a reason I recently stumbled back to the works, and it was in time to meet these allegations.</p>

<p>Tolkien did indeed despise allegory, but his intent was to provide an alternative mythology for England.   He felt the legends of Arthur had to no substance, no whereto and whyfor, if you will.   Therefore it stands to reason he would have to explain events present in almost every mythology but with his own spin upon them.   The man wanted to write elaborate fairy tales that had substance and back story.</p>

<p>We have fallen angels and giants upon earth in the Noldorin elves, we have two holy trees, a flood myth, an Arthurian figure in Aragorn.   </p>

<p>It may be my love of the works, as I have been reading Tolkien since I was ten, but I doubt his was a work of evil.</p>

<p>I found this link recently and have wished for further elaboration upon such accusations.   For that you have my thanks.</p>
