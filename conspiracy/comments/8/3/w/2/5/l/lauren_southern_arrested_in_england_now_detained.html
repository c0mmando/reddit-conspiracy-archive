        The fact that harmless drugs are against the law here prves we have no freedom as well. We even pushed other countries to adopt that. And what about the nations we took over? Are they free?

      <p>
       Its all relative. We are more free than the UK, but have more prisoners then them.

       Do you want to really play the "its all relative" game?

       You are literally not more free because factually more are in prison. In prison = not free. Also it’s not a population thing. US literally has more prisoners than China.

       You realise that you are seeing our situation through the lens of the media, right? If you think there aren't massive paedophile rings operating in the US, you really need to do more research. If you think that the police are actively stopping them, then you are in for a horrible shock.

       Fucksakes. Big busts are happening all over the world all the time - paedophilia is a menace in every country. Big busts happen here, too, and too regularly. People really need to stop fucking raping children.

       The globalists are everywhere, too. Have you not noticed that you have a president who claims to want to drain the swamp and then fills his cabinet with oil executives and globalists? He wants to imitate some of the worst dictators in contemporary history and people applaud that. You think that your country is immune from the Rothschilds? That's, ahh, cute...

       So like radical Muslim preachers on the street corner calling for Jihad? Incredible how Lauren Southern gets immediately charged and banned from setting foot on U.K soil while these preachers get a slap on the wrist and are able to walk the streets freely and continue their campaigns of hate.

       No, that is a bit of a stretch by the other guy. But i have seen, over the years, Muslim protests about attacking England (which is fine, it's a free speech law and i respect their right to practice free speech) but, i have seen other marches get shut-down and any 'far-right' speech get immediately punished. Be it work, school, on the streets etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no question that our police force and government attack far-right groups more than they do relilgious hate-speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest tragedy is that the Indians (Sikhs) hate the Muslims more than any other culture, yet they are branded racist for speaking out against them

       This happened the same day as the latest Asian grooming gang in Telford story came out? This is getting ridiculous and is going to lead to some dark places on the far right, they're not helping fight Islamophobia by trying to brush it all under the carpet and silence people like Lauren Southern whose views on many things I do not share.

       This is my outlook as well. I don't agree with Southern on a great many things, but silencing people like here and looking the other way on the very real issues with Islamic violence isn't doing
       <em>
        anyone

       any good. The idea that criticizing a religion is some how racist or unacceptable is not a path we want to go down.

       They used a painted and manufactured for to turn us against others, so they could turn us against ourselves. Then they took that responsibility from us. Now in effect, they have turned, against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case that was too quick or confusing I'll say it again. The government made the citizens fear, a force which could exist anywhere and in the mind of any man, woman or child. Then the citizens told the government to go use force against those people, not realizing "those people" was themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the government did just that, and the new Dark Ages has begun. Don't lose hope. Free minds will walk in the light again. Remember those who worked to show you the light.

       Out of all the stupid political left vs right antics of the past couple years this is the first thing that I found truly disturbing. The UK calling western conservatives terrorists and not letting them in country. Today its pettibone and southern tomorrow its what? Registered republicans? Gun owners? Once you start calling people terrorists its a little hard to go back I feel.

       Western is a meaningless buzzword. There is no “West” citizenship not singular “West” culture or ideals. Case in point, the UK does not share her ideals. Being white does not magically grant her a citizenship.

      </p>
      <p>
       Bukhari (52:256) - The Prophet... was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger. The Prophet replied, "They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans)." In this command, Muhammad establishes that it is permissible to kill non-combatants in the process of killing a perceived enemy. This provides justification for the many Islamic terror bombings.﻿

       So "western" has no cultural meaning yet you are on some kind of crusade against western supremacists? The only thing I find confusing in all of this is how you manage to preform such extreme mental gymnastics without so much as a hint of being at all self aware.

       Stop conflating people that are "pro west" and or conservative with white supremacists. Why is it so hard to understand that a person can be "conservative" without being a white supremacist? Just like how you can be pro west with out being a western supremacist. Or you could just be an advocate of free speech who doesn't appreciate authoritative thought police trying to silence opinions however unpopular they might be. I'm pretty sure people that live in any country are going to be predisposed to being a fan of the advancement of that country out of basic self interest.

       Richard Spencer and his entourage of pasty fan boys are a joke to the vast majority of Americans BTW. Richard Spencer is not the arbitrator of western politics and has no bearing on the definition of the word "western". Stop. with. this. nonsense.

       The first link in your post says Lauren Southern was banned from the UK for distributing racist material, but it was actually material critical of Islam. You have continued to bring up "western supremacy" and you have defined that as intrinsically racist. So in the context of this post I think its fair to remind you that Islam is not a race.

       Culture differences boil down to geographic isolation over long time periods. Race was created in the same way, but its not as rigid. For example a white person born and raised in south Africa does not necessarily share any cultural similarities to a white person born in Pennsylvania. In other words a person can look outwardly a certain way, but a better categorization for that person than race would be culture. That is why I take issue with the people crying "racist" over things that really come down to cultural differences. There are very few people in this world who are dumb enough to still buy into the idea of genetic superiority. On the other hand I would ague that most people subscribe to some form of cultural superiority. I think this is unavoidable and the only solution is to tolerate a difference of opinion and utilize a free exchange of ideas. That's why I don't like people who want to silence others.

       Culture is even less rigid then appearance though. You can get culture raped and forget your identity, religion, and ethnic group. Like African Americans

       environment dictates your culture and no matter your appearance you will have a cultural identity first and foremost (your appearance may also impact your cultural identity depending on your location). You can say that African Americans had their culture taken away and in some respects that is true, but that is also denying African Americans their own unique culture that exists today as a subset of a broader American culture and that is a subset of an even more expansive western culture. It seems like you chose to see the world as nothing but a system of hierarchies enforced by systematic oppression perpetrated by white people (correct me if I am wrong in that assumption). I think that is not really a clear picture of things but I can see how you'd come to that conclusion since its kind of the prevailing viewpoint for a number of people. Maybe try thinking outside of a race centric world view for a while and see if you can think of any other possibilities.

       Before your ninja edit you said "the alt right talks about ancient Greece all the time", so you added "western society" cause I think you realize that they actually don't talk about ancient Greece all the time. That's the whole reason I commented. I studied ancient Greece quite a bit in college and have even done a summer in Greece excavating.

       If anything, I was thrown by that comment because you rarely see discussion on ancient Greece. It occurs on this sub probably more so than others due to its connection to some of hidden history conspiracies as well as a fantastic historical mystery; the collapse of the bronze age.

       If I have zero knowledge of the alt-rights apparent association with discussion about ancient greece, then how am in ever going to get knowledge other than by discussion?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I Google "alt right ancient greece", I get two articles saying bannon likes Thucydides, therefore thebhistorybof ancient Greece is bad. What the fuck is that shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       GQ actually lambasted Thucydides as a "dry scribe" who "hits on themes such as the clash of civilizations and realpolitik amorality that naturally appeal to a dermatological nightmare like Bannon". Fuck that anti intellectual shit. Thucydides was much more than a "scribe" and his dryness in comparison to his contemporaries is of historical significance and was hugely important to the development of recorded history. I don't expect the cretins at GQ to know anything about that. Thucydides has done more important things than every single person who's ever been involved in GQ,  put together, could ever even
       <em>

       to accomplish. I now associate you with this sort of politically-motivated anti-intellectualism.

       I'm gonna be straight up with you since I've tried being friendly. You come across as a uneducated dickwad.

       I'm sure that there are literally millions of pieces of proof on youtube, and that I totally won't get a single video with an alt right guy talking about 300.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Why
       </em>
       do they like 300?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what is wrong with liking the battle of thermoplylae? I've thought it was a very cool historical way before thay movie ever came out. I started a degree in history and studied the Greek-Persian wars for years before thay movie was made.

       It cracks me up how obviously painful it is for you to be in a position where you have to discuss and back up ideas you clearly haven't thought-out ahead of time.

       Because people in the past thought a lower age of consent was okay that makes present day child rape okay in your book? What kind of argument is that even? People use to own slaves as well does that make slavery okay? Also stop calling everyone on this thread "alt-right" because that is an absurd thing to assume based on the comments.

       No one said anything about Muhammad you dolt. You responded to a comment about child rape gangs by bringing up ancient Greece. I addressed that comment by saying your argument is childlike so no I haven't avoided your question, but you've avoided every question I've asked you in this thread.

       You brought up Muhammad and that is why I said no one said anything about Muhammad. I am talking about the above comment and this post of yours. You cant just put Muhammad into the conversation and act like "they" are the ones who did so. Are you drunk or something?

       Nope. There is no law against traveling to another state to protest. That's why you can't show me the law, and that's why all of the women in pussy hats at the Women's March didn't get arrested. ;-)

       So your excuse is that you believe everything you hear from some idiot on TV? You don't need to be a lawyer to just search what the law is and show it to me. You can't, because it doesn't exist. All you can do is downvote my comments because you won't admit you're wrong.

      <p>
       You cited a law in the title of this post that you made. Were you a lawyer when you cited that law? Why can't you find this other law that you made up? Lost your lawyer card in the last 6 hours? :-)

       4 hours later and you still couldn't find the law that you falsely claimed was a real thing. I'm not surprised. It's very easy to search and find any law you're interested in, but that law has to exist first. Sorry, but it just doesn't exist. :-)

       I can't be informed on something that doesn't exist, such as the length of the horn on a pink unicorn. That's why you couldn't find it while searching, because you won't find a law that doesn't exist. You don't need to be a lawyer to use Google or whatever else you'd like.

       Simply the fact that just about every civilized country allows protests of foreigners protesting at another country’s embassy falls under freedom of speech and/or protest.

       But the UK also does not share Muslims ideals. Being Muslim or Arab does not magically grant them citizenship to England either. And what about the migrants stunts with the migrants boats? I.e. riding them across the Mediterranean to Europe? What about the people they harass while being a tourist in a foreign country far away from their home nation? Your double standards are thick and rich! If a country not agreeing with someone’s ideals is grounds for denial of entry, then European and North American countries don’t need to take in one more Muslim. Is that what you believe? Or are you a hypocrite with double standards?

       I know that the UK was never a bastion of free speech, but the sheep are taught that they live in some semblance of a democracy where freedom of expression holds some modicum of value.

       Do two wrongs make a right? Why not just say any act of violence against someone because of something they can’t control like the colour of their skin is wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people seem to be happy to hold double-standards and say it’s fine for one group to suffer because that social group made another suffer in the past. At what point do we stop using the past to justify violence in the present?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m from Tower Hamlets in London where “white British” is behind “Bangladeshi” in terms of numbers in the borough (think it’s 32% vs 33%). That’s just ethnicity, if we look at the data for religious identification in the area then I think I remember “Muslim” being by far the most popular religion in the area. Why shouldn’t the majority religious demographic of an area face criticism if they’re given funding and that funding isn’t positively impacting everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Criticism of “Muslims” needs to be more focused. As with everything, most Muslims just want to live their lives and get along with people. There are definitely radical elements who are clearly allowed to exist because people higher up find them useful for some reason or another. From what I can gather it’s the Wahhabist Muslims who are the source of most of the radical aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully this would stop the knee-jerk cries of “racism” whenever Islam is criticised. There are plenty of white Muslims in the UK, so I’d be happy to point that out if that meant people stopped conflating criticism of aspects of a religion and political system with racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are radical Muslims in London though. Visit Whitechapel and if you’re a woman walking there at night wearing western clothes then there’s a good chance that you’ll be called a “slag”, “slut” etc. Obviously this is anecdotal but several woman I know have been followed by groups of young Muslim guys and threatened specifically because of what they were wearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen a few of Lauren Southern’s and Tommy Morrison’s videos and some of their arguments are reasonable, but they’re too quick to get emotional and resort to “cries of what about the children”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t see why it’s useful to ban them though. If anything it just lends more credibility to the notion that they’re treated unfairly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look into the history, it seems that there’s a very cozy relationship with the British Royal family and the House of Saud. British intelligence in the early 1900s found it useful to have people on their payroll promote a more radical interpretation of Islam
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a few of your comments in the thread and I don’t know if you think that people who criticise Islam must somehow be alt righters who believe western civilisation is then pinnacle of human achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think that at all, recent western civilisation has been the story of technology and science and doing anything and everything to maintain that advantage. There’s plenty of great civilisations that can be admired. Saying that though, it’s perfectly fine to think that western society is awful, but when people say this but still want take from the welfare state or use the National Healh Service for free then they should expect criticism.

       Two negatives do make a positive, however the SA land seizure is in no way equivalent to hundreds of millions of blacks being murdered and land seized for hundreds of years. It’s relitively peaceful with a few minor incidents.

       Two negatives might make a positive in mathematics. Do you believe that is true in society too? You want to live in a world where it’s an eye for an eye? How far back can people go to justify violence against a social group?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven’t been able to find any reliable  statistics about the farmer’s deaths in South Africa, but I would question “relatively peaceful” as the numbers at the minimum seem to show a significant increase in violence and murders. I’m not sure where you got the number of “100s of millions of blacks being murdered” either?
      </p>
      <p>
       So do you believe murdering people because they belong to a social group that treated another social group poorly in the past is justified? As long as you’re not hypocritical and accept it when another group murders people for the actions of a social group then I guess that’s at least consistent. It’s stupid , but it is consistent

       He’s right. The San and Khoi people are native to South Africa. The other tribes, that now make up the majority, are Bantu descendants and they migrated down here at about the same time as or just before European settlers arrived on our shores.

       I'm from Alberta, Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laura Southern was or is still working for Rebel Media which acts like a right wing Conservative 'news' outlet here in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her boss is this guy named Ezra Levant who made a name for himself by publishing the Mohammed pictures in the Western Standard. He's Jewish but used the argument that it was 'free speech' to avoid Canada's hate speech laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny because if you tried publishing drawings of bad stereotypical Jewish people, B'nai Brith would be all over your ass as well as the hate crimes police, and probably the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hilariously hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways...
      </p>
      <p>
       Alberta has oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservatism here in Alberta is largely dictated by people outside of Canada in the oil industry, Koch Brothers, Heritage Foundation, Exxon, etc all rile up the rural right wingers here to insure that we don't ever try to nationalize our resources again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ezra Levant is a big time oil industry shill and uses his outlet to attack anti-oil activists, which are mostly college kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where Laura Southern comes in. She acts like a men's rights activist and goes against campus feminist activists. Many of which are also environmental activists.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this basically started as a really roundabout way to insure the oil companies get access to Alberta's oil again.

       I wasn't sure. I thought she quit or got fired around when all those anti-semitism accusations got kicked up against that Gavin guy.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most recently she has been working on a documentary in South Africa.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was jokingly going to write that it was probably about the plight of white farmers in South Africa and decided to look it up first out of curiosity. It's exactly about that. Damn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad thing is that she's a good journalist/documentarian if she wasn't so hung up on pandering to her base. I like her but hate everything she stands for and the people she works with.

       Oops, my bad. Thanks for the correction. I haven't heard anything from her in a couple months.

       Like, the Rebel isn't recognized as an actual news outlet but that didn't stop them from going to the Alberta Legislative Building and making a stink before getting kicked out. They wrote it up like they were some underdog reporters who got picked on because they weren't part of the 'liberal media'.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have 'liberal media' in Alberta that isn't the university newspapers. All our news is all corporate owned. All 4 major papers here are owned by one company and it's owned by Levant's old boss and some shadow investors from the US connected to Goldman Sachs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything Southern or Levant say should be scrutinized heavily to make sure all the facts are accurate.

       So someone pokes fun at Mohammedans and their cult; they're immediately labeled the worst person on earth.
Muslims throwing gays off rooftops, raping women and then stoning them to death for being raped; that's just being a good upstanding member of society.

       Not saying It was right for them to ban her, but she lied on her form and claimed she was pakistani. Thus, allowing them to come at her sideways. Would she have been banned if she didn't lie? why did she lie? for jokes?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact she lied devalues all this outrage imo. From THEIR pov (UK police, seems nobody is looking at it from that way), They could classify it as terrorism in their own twisted way. Its a sucky situation but she brought this on herself imo.

       "Sabbatean-Frankism as the Paradigm of the Modern Left
      </p>
      <p>
       What do all these influential intellectuals all have in common?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Communism (Marx)
       </li>
       <li>
        Sexual depravity (Freud)
       </li>
       <li>
        Corporate Leftism (Bernays)
       </li>
       <li>
        Multiculturalism (Horace Kallen)
       </li>
       <li>
        Deconstructivism/Critical Theory (Walter Benjamin)
       </li>
       <li>
        Frankfurt School (Adorno)
       </li>
       <li>
        Radical jurisprudence (Brandeis, Frankfurter, and Cardozo)
       </li>
       <li>
        Large-scale, non-selective immigration (Israel Zangwill, Emma Lazarus)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       They are all linked to Sabbatean-Frankism, a distinct quasi-Satanic schism within Jewry. The extraordinary prevalence of Sabbatean-Frankist influence among top Jewish intellectuals from 1850-1950 makes it statistically impossible to deny its role because of the impossible coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sabbatean-Frankists sought to invert traditional Jewish-Christian values, including the 10 Commandments, restrictions on debauched sexuality, man’s dominion over the environment, etc. Further, given Sabbatean-Frankism’s apocalyptic nature, the modern Left is riven with irrational destructive impulses.
      </p>
      <p>
       This general thesis has been explored by historians Paul Johnson and Gershom Scholem, but never in such detail. There are several implications of this thesis:
      </p>
      <p>
       • The failures of the contemporary Left do not represent “good faith” secular humanist efforts gone wrong. It is very possible that Freud, Marx, and other Sabbatean-Frankist intellectuals purpose-built their ideas to destroy the West.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The US Supreme Court was heavily influenced by Sabbatean-Frankists. Their impact help cause a revolution via court fiat in the 50s-70s that undemocratically imposed decadent/anti-Judeo-Christian (i.e. Frankist) values on the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Since the Left is fundamentally a quasi-Satanic movement devoted to destroying traditional Judeo-Christian civilization, it is a natural ally with like-minded Islam, despite superficial differences (feminism, gay rights). Islam and the Left will seamlessly cooperate to destroy the West as they cooperated to topple the Shah in the Iranian Revolution."

       This is what the United States has been doing for years, albeit a little more obviously. Make terrorism illegal, but don't strictly define what makes something terrorism. Then take anybody who speaks out or dissents, accuse them of terrorism and lock them up without trial or even a chance for trial.
