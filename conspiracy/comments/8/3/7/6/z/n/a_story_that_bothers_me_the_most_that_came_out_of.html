       Remember after the shooting there were reports coming out on social media and PooTube about locals seeing multiple shooters or hearing shooters from different directions, impossible if it was just weird guy Paddock up in his hotel rooms?
      </p>
      <p>
       One story got completely buried and nobody mentions it anymore. It was scrubbed from the Net within a week or so but maybe it still survives as quoted material on someplace like AboveTopSecret which always has a lot of immediate postings from people listening to police radio and otherwise examining events like these with a critical eye and ear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, a woman posted on Facebook that her sister was okay. This sister had been working as a bartender at the concert event in Vegas. She says there were different bar areas set up, with people flowing freely around them throughout the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her particular bar was set up very near the stage, to one side of the stage. She was busy making drinks before the shooter arrived. Then she saw someone come up FROM the stage area, and while facing OUT to the crowd, began shooting into the crowd. At this point she quickly ducked behind the bar, hoping the shooter wouldn't focus on her. He didn't and continued to shoot into the crowd. She didn't see where he went afterwards because she stayed hidden for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her sister who reported this on Facebook said her bartender sis was traumatized but thank God she was okay otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       This account was barely mentioned anywhere and pretty much disappeared while people were focused on multiple shooter accounts posted on PooTube. It got lost in the shuffle but is incredibly important because it is highly specific about a second shooter location ( if Paddock even did any shooting himself.) Many of the other accounts were "officially" being debunked as people hearing echoes, etc. But this bartender's experience is highly specific and there must be other survivors with a similar story, one of seeing a shooter come up from the stage area to aim into the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edited for correction: I misremembered this post slightly; the bartender saw MULTIPLE shooters come up from the stage and start shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you scroll down a few points within this post at Abovetopsecret you will see an excerpt from the Facebook post from the bartender's sister:

       Wonder why singer wasn’t shot and ran backstage?  Not a hard target to hit, he was facing away from backstage at first, obviously.  Smells like BS to me.  All of it does.

       Well, I guess if you shot the singer first people would notice and scatter. The way the bartender described it to her sister, the shooter had a good element of surprise because people were facing front to the stage and he could fire right at loads of them as they were facing him, before anybody thought to scatter. I think if he had taken the singer out first he would have lost that element of surprise and horror.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish it were safe for the bartender to tell her story openly, but obviously it wouldn't be safe for her or her family. I just remember her story and am miffed at how it completely got lost in the shuffle, especially with all the endless talk and PooTube videos about helicopters, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, it is PooTube. :)

       The singer ran off stage pretty quickly. You can see it in videos. I guess I can't judge because I don't know how i would react but I wish he would have taken a second to yell "there's a shooter!" into his mic before running away. Because a lot of people didn't realize what was happening at first and stood around in confusion as the shots started.

       As I recall there were definitely multiple shooters or the guy had to be dual wielding rifles.  Yeah the whole Vegas thing got swept under the rug real quick.  That guy had intelligence agency written all over him.

       There was reports of multiple shooters because the police on the scanners and the police that were being interviewed said there was multiple shooters originally.

       No she was very clear; she was busy making drinks; vaguely became aware of a commotion above the sound of the loud music; looked out in front of the bar and a guy sort of loomed up before her and was shooting with a long gun ( not a pistol) spraying the crowd ; she quickly ducked down behind the bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       She saw a guy in front of the stage who had come out from the wings of the stage area to face the crowd.

       I think if someone was spraying the crowd from the stage, we wouldn't have had people standing up giving Mandalay Bay the finger, saying 'they aren't real gunshots.' There would probably be way more that 58 deaths too.

       copyright says Scripps, these are the Getty sequence, rather odd drill photographs.
      </p>
      <p>
       use Bing and search for Vegas Shooting and Getty, they will show up. some are odd beyond belief, the Israeli soldiers playing at LV cop with their LVMPD handler is classic.
      </p>
      <p>
       they arrest an asian dude in the street in one training sequence.

       another couple of pictures shows parts of a photographer crouched taking pictures in front of crouched LVMPD officers approaching the scene !?

       LV was a drill or something else that got sold as a mass casualty event. the Saudi coup ties into it for some reason.

       Let’s not forget that an armed Predator Drone patrolled the skies above Vegas for the remainder of the night. But yeah, they probably weren’t LOOKING for anything, it was probably just to make sure that Paddock stayed dead ;)

       To clarify,  her bar was near the VIP section of the audience, but in Vegas VIPs are more likely to be people with a lot of mileage on their players' cards, so sometimes they get free bennies like discounted food, discounted rooms, or preferred seating at events. Doesn't take much to be considered a VIP in casino land, so it's doubtful there would have been any " names" standing in that VIP section that night. More likely to be Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Idaho who were on vacation and playing a lot of slots.
