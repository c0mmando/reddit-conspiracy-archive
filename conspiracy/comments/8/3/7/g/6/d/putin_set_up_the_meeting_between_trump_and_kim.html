I just find it unbelievable that in a year, Trump has the clout to set up a meeting like this on his own when other world leaders have refused to meet with Trump. Russia has had a relationship with North Korea for decades. Plus, Russia recently claimed they have a missile that can penetrate America’s defenses and Trump had no response. The Cold War never ended for Russia. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t meet without concessions from NK or it&#39;d just be giving them the appearance as an equal internationally. Here, they&#39;ve already agreed to &quot;freeze&quot; their program...which honestly doesn&#39;t mean much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For instance, all of this negotiation has been the work primarily of SK&#39;s leader Moon Jae-in, who began initiating talks some weeks ago.  </p>

<p>Btw guess who&#39;s the #3 importer of steel to the US, and the number one importer of steel pipe and tubing? South Korea! Which is why it&#39;s been reported that at the same meeting SK brought the meeting offer, it requested exemption from Trump&#39;s steel tariffs.</p>

<p>SK diplomats are smart enough to know that if they blow smoke up Trump&#39;s ass and make him feel like a big strong hero, they might get some tariff concessions.</p>

Every other president has declined or refused based on the principle that the US would not negotiate with a &#39;dictator and its regime&#39;. The premise of your argument hinged on Trump setting this up, which is not true. South Korea facilitated the dialogue with NK, first in Pyongyang earlier this week, and then communicating with the White House yesterday. All Trump did was say &quot;yes&quot; - going against US policy on NK. </p>

<p>I think we have to think about 2 things before May: 1. Will the meeting actually happen? 2. How much of a shitshow will it be with Kim and Trump in the same room? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the corporate media was pushing their fear campaign and beating the drums of war the Trump admin was behind the scene working towards diplomacy.</p>

<p>It is strange that the corporate media thinks they can control America&#39;s foreign policy with propaganda. Now that they didn&#39;t get the war and conflict they wanted it must be Putin&#39;s fault. Hilarious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said the media was making a ridiculous Putin connection. I said the media wants war they don&#39;t care who it is with they are just pushing for war. Trump was playing the role of the leader of the most powerful nation on earth. That is not a submissive role. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia does not want war. You seem ignorant of what&#39;s happened in geopolitics in the last 20 years - not saying that as an attack; it is what it is.</p>

<p>NATO and the Western powers have given them <em>no choice</em> but to arm themselves in defense. NATO has been encroaching eastward even though they promised in 1993 explicitly that they won&#39;t. Western NGOs funneled billions into Ukraine, funding neo-nazi militias and violent uprisings to install a pro-Western president. They (the West) have tried to block Russia from vital resources like the Black Sea, and instigated proxy wars in Middle East countries like Syria.</p>

<p>NK has also been trying to negotiate peace for a decade now, including during the Obama administration. NK leadership is corrupt and scrummy, considering the state of the country and its people, but they are not suicidal. They remember the carnage that befell them during the Korean war (entire cities were literally flattened by carpet bombs) and certainly know that they will be wiped off the face of the planet if they instigate anything. </p>

<p>We are past the idea of large scale wars as we have known them technology wise. Any boots on the ground WWIII event would be by design imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boots on the ground are what proxy wars are for. WW3 will more likely be done through economic  battles and alliances rather than quick nuclear destruction. Either way, I think both Putin and Kim are playing Trump and he’s falling into their trap. </p>

A small offense in the meeting is all they’ll need as an excuse to start a war and “prove” democracy doesn’t work, which has been Russia’s MO for a while now. </p>
