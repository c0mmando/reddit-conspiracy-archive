    <div class="md"><p>Okay but we know wikileaks was working with the Trump campaign. That&#39;s all been verified. Whether Trump knew, idk,  but other people did. Why should people be allowed to link to a known conspirator to defraud the United states? Next people will insist pizzagate theories should have been allowed on the sub. Certain entities are not to be trusted with information sharing, and Wikileaks has fallen greatly in stature from when it appeared to be working on behalf of the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but the belief that this was some overnight &quot;switch flipped&quot; performance that took over politics instead of a generally left wing sub supporting the most likely left wing candidate to win is just silly. I have asked multiple times for any evidence of it and have only been met with comments along the lines of &quot;we don&#39;t need proof, we remember it alright&quot; which leads me to believe its completely false and just radicalizing people.</p>

There were no good options, HRC is a terrible person, and Bernie should have been the nominee. But to give HRC and the DNC the criticism they deserve is met with accusations of &quot;RUSSIA&quot; and &quot;RIGHT WINGER&quot;, especially if you criticize them from the Left, which is really, really, really easy to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/politics and other big subs were taken over by NEOliberal (economically very right wing to extreme right wing) corporate shills
for Clinton/DNC/Soros/corporations (e.g. mon saanto, big pharma, etc.).</p>

<p>Most politicians in the modern Democrat party are not left wing,
centrist or even moderate right and haven&#39;t been for decades (Reagan onwards: things went downhill).
Get money out of politics and you&#39;ll get decent representatives
and not NEOliberal shills pretending to be left wing.
We can at least get centrists and not fake centrists, ya know (just sayin)?
Also nationalizing the FED, and getting rid of freemasons would help us clean the government (&quot;drain the swamp&quot;).</p>

<p>The Democrat and Republican parties are both funded by corporations (incl. military-industrial complex), banksters, wallstreet, etc. Neither party is &quot;moderate&quot;.
The corporate media pretends &quot;between Democrat and Republican&quot; is moderate
but being in between two similarly corporate extremist parties is still extreme.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all extremists. Bernie was an independent who ran as a Democrat and thus
was a rare exception and tried to bring back FDR&#39;s near-centrist New Deal mixed economics (social democracy: fair market capitalism + untampered social programs with no corporate interference or at least well regulated against profiteering cronyist scams).</p>

<p>I also want to remind the sub that &quot;THE LEFT&quot;/&quot;THE RIGHT&quot; is
language we should ideally avoid because it&#39;s A) divisive, B) prone to extremely broad generalizations, C) what some think is left/right is not actually left/right respectively and centrism is also ignored for some strange reason, D) everyone on the left half of the spectrum is a leftist, but people seem to confuse left wing with SJW/feminist/&quot;white privilege&quot; brainwashed people lol. This just increases the divide and conquer agenda&#39;s power.</p>

<p>Saying left wingers are SJWs is like saying right wingers are racists. Not everyone who is left/right wing is SJW/racist. The whole SJW vs alt right or whatever is divide and conquer.</p>

<p>LET ME REPEAT TO ASLEEP PEOPLE: CLINTON IS NOT LEFT WING, DAMNIT.
People to the left of Clinton are fucking centrists and moderate right! Clinton is an extremist
who (secretly) wanted TPP for goodness sake (she pretended to change her mind but come on, wallstreet was breathing
down her corrupt neck). Left wingers are pro-worker and anti-corporate/banking corruption.</p>
