       Beginning on September 18, 2001, letters containing weaponized anthrax spores were mailed to two senators, Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, and several news media outlets. In early October, five Americans were killed and 17 were injured by the bioweapon. Initially, the government blamed Iraq for providing the anthrax to Al Qaeda terrorists but the facts soon proved the anthrax came from US bioweapons labs and they shifted their focus to two US bioweapons researchers. The first was officially exonerated and the second allegedly committed suicide before he could be charged, though the FBI still flimsily maintains that he was the lone anthrax killer. Yet, the facts suggest that elements inside the US government/military-industrial complex carried out the 2001 anthrax letter attacks, terrifying congress and the nation that a deadly weapon of mass destruction could be moving through the mail, all to drum up support for sweeping surveillance powers and brutal wars of aggression under the guise of a "Global War on Terror."

        false news stories

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No tests ever found or even suggested the presence of bentonite. The claim was just concocted from the start. It just never happened.
That means that ABC News' "four well-placed and separate sources" fed them information that was completely false -- false information that created a very significant link in the public mind between the anthrax attacks and Saddam Hussein...
       </p>
       <p>
        ABC News already knows the answers to these questions. They know who concocted the false bentonite story and who passed it on to them with the specific intent of having them broadcast those false claims to the world, in order to link Saddam to the anthrax attacks and -- as importantly -- to conceal the real culprit(s) (apparently within the U.S. government) who were behind the attacks. And yet, unbelievably, they are keeping the story to themselves, refusing to disclose who did all of this...
       </p>
       <p>
        They're not protecting "sources." The people who fed them the bentonite story aren't "sources." They're fabricators and liars who purposely used ABC News to disseminate to the American public an extremely consequential and damaging falsehood. But by protecting the wrongdoers, ABC News has made itself complicit in this fraud perpetrated on the public, rather than a news organization uncovering such frauds. That is why this is one of the most extreme journalistic scandals that exists, and it deserves a lot more debate and attention than it has received thus far.

       Forced to Pivot to "Lone Nut" Scapegoats
      </h1>
      <p>
       The FBI then publicly targeted bioweapons researcher Steven Hatfill as a "person of interest." Hatfill was harassed with 24-hour surveillance for months, including digging through his garbage, tapping his phones, questioning his friends, public humiliation throughout the media smearing him as a murderer, and harassment by local police. These "bumper locking" tactics drove him to drink. Hatfill took the case to court. The judge found
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-wrong-man/308019/">
        "not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that Dr. Hatfill had anything to do with" the anthrax attacks
       </a>
       . So why did Mueller's FBI frame an innocent man with no evidence? Attorney General John Ashcroft might know. His Department of "Justice" was the parent agency of the FBI. Unfortunately, during his filmed deposition for the Hatfill case, he answered "I don't know" a total of 85 times. Ultimately, the Justice Department settled, awarding Hatfill $5.82 million dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, Mueller's FBI publicly targeted bioweapons researcher Bruce Ivins, who was also subjected to 24-hour surveillance but "committed suicide" via Tylenol overdose before he could be charged. His family was offered money to speak out against him. Obama came into office and closed the case, ensuring it would never be re-opened. The government had no evidence against Ivins anyways, though they like to pretend as though the case was solved.

       <p>
        President Obama -- in what I think is one his most indefensible acts -- actually threatened to veto the entire intelligence authorization bill if it included a proposed bipartisan amendment (passed by the House) that would have mandated an independent inquiry into the FBI's anthrax investigation...
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, the veto threat issued by the Obama White House was refreshingly (albeit unintentionally) candid about why it was so eager to block any independent inquiry: "The commencement of a fresh investigation would undermine public confidence in the criminal investigation and unfairly cast doubt on its conclusions."  That would happen only if the FBI's claims could not withstanding independent, critical scrutiny.  But -- as is even more apparent now than ever -- the White House is fully aware that it cannot.  In a rational, non-corrupt environment, that would be a reason to insist upon -- not take extraordinary steps to block -- an independent investigation into one of the most consequential crimes ever committed on U.S. soil.  But that, manifestly, is not the world in which we live, and thus -- despite continuously mounting evidence that we do not know anywhere close to the full story of who perpetrated this attack -- the country's political leadership continues to stonewall any efforts to find out.

       Two of the anthrax letter recipients, Democratic senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, had been holding up the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act until the letters likely scared them into submission. It is notable that they

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI's lead investigator of the anthrax case, Richard Lambert,
       <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1714250/former-fbi-special-agent-in-charge-richard.pdf">
        sued former FBI Director Mueller and others in 2015
       </a>
       for obstructing and impeding the investigation and then firing him when he complained. He doesn't believe there was enough evidence to conclude that Ivins was a lone anthrax killer. Lambert's complaints included:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (a) WFO’s [Washington Field Office's] persistent understaffing of the AMERITHRAX investigation; (b) the threat of WFO’s Agent in charge to retaliate if Plaintiff disclosed the understaffing to FBI Headquarters; (c) WFO’s insistence on staffing the AMERITHRAX investigation principally with new Agents recently graduated from the FBI Academy resulting in an average investigative tenure of 18 months with 12 of 20 Agents assigned to the case having no prior investigative experience at all; ...
(e) FBI Director’s Mueller’s mandate to Plaintiff to “compartmentalize” the AMERITHRAX investigation by stove piping the flow of case information and walling off task force members from those aspects of the case not specifically assigned to them...
       </p>
       <p>
        (f) WFO’s diversion and transfer of two Ph.D. Microbiologist Special Agents from their key roles in the investigation to fill billets for an 18 month Arabic language training program in Israel; (g) the FBI Laboratory’s deliberate concealment from the Task Force of its discovery of human DNA on the anthrax-laden envelope addressed to Senator Leahy and the Lab’s initial refusal to perform comparison testing; (h) the FBI Laboratory’s refusal to provide timely and adequate scientific analyses and forensic examinations in support of the investigation;...
       </p>
       <p>
        (j) the FBI’s fingering of Bruce Ivins as the anthrax mailer; and, (k) the FBI’s subsequent efforts to railroad the prosecution of Ivins in the face of daunting exculpatory evidence. Following the announcement of its circumstantial case against Ivins, Defendants DOJ and FBI crafted an elaborate perception management campaign to bolster their assertion of Ivins’ guilt. These efforts included press conferences and highly selective evidentiary presentations which were replete with material omissions...
       </p>
       <p>
        After leaving the AMERITHRAX investigation in 2006, Plaintiff continued to publicly opine that the quantum of circumstantial evidence against Bruce Ivins was not adequate to satisfy the proof-beyond-a-reasonable doubt threshold required to secure a criminal conviction in federal court. Plaintiff continued to advocate that while Bruce Ivins may have been the anthrax mailer, there is a wealth of exculpatory evidence to the contrary which the FBI continues to conceal from Congress and the American people. The FBI vehemently opposes Plaintiff’s position.

       Foreknowledge
      </h1>
      <p>
       June 22-23, 2001, three months before the anthrax attacks there was a bioterror drill at Andrews Air Force Base called Operation Dark Winter that simulated a large-scale bioweapons attack on the US. Just like the real attacks, the
       <a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2001_dark-winter/Dark%20Winter%20Script.pdf">
        script
       </a>
       mentioned letters being sent to media and a threat of using anthrax. The June drill included
       <a href="https://youtu.be/we7Map5Pho0?t=146">
        fake news broadcasts
       </a>
       played to the participants in the drill that were almost identical to the fake ABC stories mentioned earlier that came out after the attacks in October:
      </p>
      <p>
       Drill Actress Portraying News Anchor:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NCN has learned that Iraq may have provided the technology behind the attack to terrorist groups based in Afghanistan.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Former CIA Director James Woolsey played the CIA Director in the drill. He was a member of the Project For a New American Century (PNAC) neocon thinktank, famous for their September 2000 paper
       <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf">
        Rebuilding America's Defenses
       </a>
       that laid out plans for colossal increases in military spending and a "core mission" to "fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous major theater wars." But PNAC worried that their ambitions plans might take a while because "the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor."
      </p>
      <p>
       (Listen to General Wesley Clark explain how he was told right after 9/11 that the Secretary of Defense had a plan to take out
       <a href="https://youtu.be/9RC1Mepk_Sw">
        7 countries in 5 years: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran
       </a>
       . It seems that plan is still underway, though the time frame was a little ambitious.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 12th, 2001, the day after 9/11, and three weeks before the first anthrax attack infection, PNAC member Donald Kagan and his son Fred Kagan went on the Milt Rosenberg radio show and spoke about the supposed need to retaliate for 9/11 by attacking Palestine and Iraq. Incredibly, they also mentioned anthrax, saying
       <a href="https://youtu.be/G9VdaB8b-es">
        "what would have happened, if instead of just having jet fuel on those planes, they had had anthrax bacilli?"
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 16th 2001, two days before the anthrax letters were mailed, Richard Perle, Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee and a member of PNAC,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/0PqU7dXEirU?t=31">
        appeared on CNN to warn that the next attack might be biological.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Government watchdog group Judicial Watch found out that Bush and Cheney and other top officials went on the anthrax antidote Cipro on the evening of 9/11, well before there was any warning that anthrax attacks might occur. This is not something done lightly as the drug has serious physical effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judith Miller, a New York Times writer who took part in the Operation Dark Winter drill, wrote a book called
       <em>
        Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War
       </em>
       . Athough Iraq had destroyed its WMD programs after the Gulf War, the book vastly exaggerated Iraq's bioweapons capabilities, just like the Bush Administration and its neocon supporters would do to justify their coming war of aggression.
       <em>
        Germs
       </em>
       was released on October 2nd, 2001. Days later, on October 5th, the first American died in the anthrax attacks, catapulting Miller's book into a best-seller. Miller was part of a think tank called the Aspen Strategy Group, that included members such as Vice President Dick Cheney, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former CIA Director James Woolsey, future 9/11 Commission Director Philip Zelikow
       <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/1998-11-01/catastrophic-terrorism-tackling-new-danger">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, in 2005, when Miller was in prison for failing to testify about the "Plame affair", Cheney's Chief of Staff "Scooter" Libby sent her a letter with
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/nat_MILLER_051001.pdf">
        a cryptic message
       </a>
       , exemplifying her special relationship with the Bush Administration and their sketchy warmongering neocon clique:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You went to jail in the summer. It is fall now. You will have stories to cover -- Iraqi elections and suicide bombers, biological threats and the Iranian nuclear program. Out West, where you vacation, the aspens will already be turning. They turn in clusters, because their roots connect them. Come back to work -- and life.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And the FBI didn't just cover up the anthrax attacks. For example, while Mueller was director, the FBI made public statements claiming that Abdulaziz and Anoud al-Hijji -- two Saudis who fled Sarasota Florida after 9/11, leaving behind cars, clothes, jewelry, and furniture -- had no connections to 9/11. Yet, multiple of the the
       <a href="http://www.floridabulldog.org/2018/01/robert-mueller-involved-in-fbi-release-deceptive-statements/">
        FBI's own reports, released via the Freedom of Information Act, say the opposite: that the al-Hijji's had "many connections"
       </a>
       . Mueller was briefed on these papers. Former FBI agent Stephen K Moore says that
       <a href="http://www.floridabulldog.org/2017/11/ex-fbi-agent-says-911-commission-misled-public/">
        he investigated California Saudis who had connections to Saudi intelligence and the 9/11 hijackers
       </a>
       , but the 9/11 Commission incorrectly claimed they did not. Clearly, the public isn't getting the full story.

       The  Amerithrax Letters were recently decoded and were left with ciphers  that are obviously testament to the countries that created the Virus'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But  there was an RNA Sequence overlooked in the ciphers that showed a  strand from the genetics of Candida Albicans. TTAAAGT was used in a  legitimate path cipher to highlight a section of text removed, with the  remaining section of text entered into a 6x6 grill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  message in the second letter was then segregated in the same manner but  from the selection of the vertical acrostic YADDA meaning 'gossip' in  Yiddish.  The message left behind: YOU DIETH TO NO WAR IN ISRAEL YOU  AFRICAN ALLAH, I AM THE GREAT AIDS THAT NO AMERICAN D(octor can cure).
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a mere fraction of the discussion that was going on in the letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  FBI even admitted a genetic sequence of CODONS were in the cipher, but  missing one letter that was not highlighted with a double score, they  added this on their own to try to associate a code to Invin's friends by  attributing these CODONS to translating to his friend's initials.
      </p>
      <p>
       This  obvious null, and the use of it as an assumption of the presence of a  cipher is unmistakable as an attempt to cover up the direct evidence  that clearly is crafted from a recognizable type of cipher structure  that follows strict guidelines in decoding.
      </p>
      <p>
       There  are Path Ciphers, and Biliteral/Anagramed translations, with  Compartmentalized Segments that are identified with Acrostics.  There  are marks with specific guides that are used to formulate the structure  and the mechanics of the ciphers.
