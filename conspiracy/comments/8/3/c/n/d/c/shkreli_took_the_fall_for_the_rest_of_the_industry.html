<p>Just LOL. You haven&#39;t read the first thing about this case, have you?</p>

<p>I asked what the judge had to do with it, I read your post as talking about a random judge as an example. But now I’m aware. Fuck me right?</p>

<p>But then who’s fault is that he mislead investors 10 million dollars? Who’s fault is that he mismanaged funds? I understand other pharma executives are waaay more dangerous, but they are not dumb enough to “troll” and stay in the spotlight. </p>

<p>Maybe after he became a “villain” to some, he could have gone back to his comfortable life, but instead he continued to put on this front for his 15 minutes of fame which I think affected his sentencing. </p>

<p>If the judge was a mouthpiece for obama, Clinton, and Schumer like you claim, wouldn’t Shrekli have gotten the maximum? </p>

<p>Dude committed a crime and continued to be an asshole. All that matters is that Wu Tang album.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so is everyone&#39;s theory that he got caught for securities fraud simply because people disliked his pharma practices? like it was being actively ignored, but when he crossed the wrong people he paid the price?</p>

<p>i can&#39;t tell in this thread. 80% of the posts allude to the price inflation but that&#39;s not connected to his crimes,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he completely embarrassed senators. Those senators ripped shkreli apart on price gouging. They were so shocked at how unethical a person like shkreli was. I heard pharmaceutical companies went to the senators after that and told them that their entire campaigns and lives and mansions were financed by the same methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His testimony to Congress. At first you&#39;re like: &quot;Wow, he&#39;s a sniveling, smirking, condescending prick.&quot;  And then you&#39;re like, &quot;Wait. He&#39;s A little reckless, but also way more confident than a baby gazelle tossed into a lion cage should be. Why though?! ... He&#39;s the gazelle, right? And they clearly want his head on a platter and his ass in jail, right?&quot; </p>

<p>And then you start realizing that what he&#39;s the most guilty of, is LAYING BARE the backdealing and pocket-lining and the hypocrisy of politics meets big Pharma.  In a somewhat hard to like and hard to watch manner, he stares down the idiots &quot;interrogating&quot; him, and the message is clear. They are the criminals, and they are the architects of this racquet.  And if Obamacare is so great, and if what he did is so bad, why is it perfectly legal?  He pulled back a curtain that they dont want pulled back.</p>
