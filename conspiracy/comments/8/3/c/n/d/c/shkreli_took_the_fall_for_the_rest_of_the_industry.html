       Let us not forget that he is the poster child for predatory pharma, the perfect fall guy that the industry could get behind imprisoning. Once he's put away people won't care.

       lol seven years chillin in a high end resort jail is totally worth the lifetime paycheck he will passively receive for being industries fall guy. They privately love him cause he’s hated by the herd. Martin=Bernie. Same shit, different day.

       He didn't get thrown in jail for any of the Pharma related shit he pulled, he mismanaged a couple of hedge funds and when he got called out for fraud by the investors he paid them more than they had originally invested to keep them quiet.

       Shkreli is a hero, he brought attention to the normies.  I garauntee he knew he'd get slapped. The dude is an edgelord memesmith. Had fake thugs with that wootizzang fiasco.

       I asked what the judge had to do with it, I read your post as talking about a random judge as an example. But now I’m aware. Fuck me right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But then who’s fault is that he mislead investors 10 million dollars? Who’s fault is that he mismanaged funds? I understand other pharma executives are waaay more dangerous, but they are not dumb enough to “troll” and stay in the spotlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe after he became a “villain” to some, he could have gone back to his comfortable life, but instead he continued to put on this front for his 15 minutes of fame which I think affected his sentencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the judge was a mouthpiece for obama, Clinton, and Schumer like you claim, wouldn’t Shrekli have gotten the maximum?

       so is everyone's theory that he got caught for securities fraud simply because people disliked his pharma practices? like it was being actively ignored, but when he crossed the wrong people he paid the price?

      <p>
       i can't tell in this thread. 80% of the posts allude to the price inflation but that's not connected to his crimes,

       he completely embarrassed senators. Those senators ripped shkreli apart on price gouging. They were so shocked at how unethical a person like shkreli was. I heard pharmaceutical companies went to the senators after that and told them that their entire campaigns and lives and mansions were financed by the same methods.

       His testimony to Congress. At first you're like: "Wow, he's a sniveling, smirking, condescending prick."  And then you're like, "Wait. He's A little reckless, but also way more confident than a baby gazelle tossed into a lion cage should be. Why though?! ... He's the gazelle, right? And they clearly want his head on a platter and his ass in jail, right?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you start realizing that what he's the most guilty of, is LAYING BARE the backdealing and pocket-lining and the hypocrisy of politics meets big Pharma.  In a somewhat hard to like and hard to watch manner, he stares down the idiots "interrogating" him, and the message is clear. They are the criminals, and they are the architects of this racquet.  And if Obamacare is so great, and if what he did is so bad, why is it perfectly legal?  He pulled back a curtain that they dont want pulled back.
