    <div class="md"><p>I think SJW shills online and violent shill groups inflate how many SJWs there are in real life (and also severity of brainwashing). But propaganda does work sometimes and the way to fix it, is by reasoning with people instead of attacking.</p>

<p>SJW vs alt right and all this illogical crap is divide and conquer. Look at the shitty YouTube channels that thrive on this rage-fueling sport. Both these groups think the other is ignorant of &quot;identity politics&quot; but often they are hypocritical victims to the deception themselves.</p>

<p>Extreme political correctness VS ANTI-political correctness. It&#39;s a trap, most people were in between these extremes before media started pushing divisive twisted stuff. Lol @ the Neonazi vs antifa psyop.</p>

<p>SJW and social justice are two different things, I hope people realize that. White privilege/biased feminism/ is SJW propaganda.</p>

<p>But not wanting poor people to go to prison for cannabis use, is just common sense social justice. Super rich people get away with murder. Alcohol is probably more dangerous than cannabis.</p>

<p>Another problem with this divide and conquer stuff is that some people incorrectly equate &quot;SJW&quot; with &quot;leftist&quot;. They&#39;re two different things just like &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;rightist&quot; are separate things.</p>

<p>Economics hurt the elites, not social issues. So naturally the NEOliberal (very right wing) modern Dem party pretends to be very different from the other major NEOliberal party (modern Repubs) by using the bullshit selling point &quot;hey we&#39;re lefties because LGBT rights, pro-choice....and let&#39;s throw in SJW feminism, what&#39;s the matter, are you a bigot?&quot; lol. Both parties get money from wallstreet and corporations. Neither are left, centrist or moderate right. The media&#39;s definition of moderate is bullshit.</p>

<p>Dems haven&#39;t been left or centrist in decades. Similarly with Repubs, they&#39;ve been insane far right shills for a long time too. It went downhill from Reagan/Thatcher NEOliberal shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally.  The divide and conquer method works like crazy and often I get caught in the PC vs anti-PC debate with my gf over semantic nonsense.  Often we realize we both support human rights in the end and are just confused about how to fix it via our ideologies. But inherently, those ideologies aren&#39;t meant to give solutions, but just to divide us.  You really helped me understand that a lot better, thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to start a whole thing, but centuries of social and cultural injustice, coupled with a massive increase in higher education and information technology create a perfect storm of people standing up for what is right. </p>

<p>There is a generational gap today, in which several population groups have grown up with a significantly different experience than any generation before. People in my age group grew up with access to the internet before it became a corporate click-machine, and were granted access to college education at an unprecedented rate.</p>

<p>Older folks grew up with limited access to information, and what they did get was carefully crafted by official sources. They also came up in a time when the American dream still existed for most white people.</p>

<p>If you give the first generation to grow up in an integrated society access to education and wide-spread communication, you&#39;re going to see an increase in social activism.</p>

<p>The &#39;SJW&#39; narrative is just a conservative spin or buzzword meant to fool people into discounting the very real systemic oppression in modern, Western society.</p>

<p>What you call an SJW, I&#39;d say is just a person wanting to be treated the same as anyone else, and finally feeling safe enough to voice that opinion.</p>

<p>The SJW title, to me, is no different than the Conspiracy Theorist title that was deliberately created and popularized to discredit people looking into JFK or similar conspiracies.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve bought into the SJW spinjob, then you&#39;re a fool. The SJW meme is just something pushed and popularized to keep poor white people from connecting with poor blacks, women, and other marginalized groups in society.</p>

<p>People become social activists because of social injustice, pure and simple. Some people often shoot themselves in the foot by making their points in a bad way, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that Western society has been built to benefit white, Christian, heterosexual men at the expense of everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s hilarious you blame millennials and not the boomers who sat on their asses while all this was happening. Wages have been stagnant for 50 years. They didn’t learn half of what we did in school. They refuse to accept any personal responsibility, and are children. They had cheap, subsidized education, good paying Union jobs, and still failed to prepare for retirement. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, schools went to shit because they provided no oversight, involvement or proper funding. Millennials who already had a better education were forced to goto college and obtain debt while other countries without their heads up their asses provided free and subsidized education. So now US companies can’t even find the talent they need. </p>

<p>Why wouldn’t they buy RVs? Boomers have allowed foreign investors to buy up more and more real estate and then not use it to artificially drive up rents. Camping is also fun as hell, and cheap. For 1/3 the price of a new car I can have a home on wheels. Pretty useful when you have to change jobs every 2 years because Boomer run companies can’t handle paying people market rate. </p>

<p>Millennials brought Obama. Boomers gave us Trump. 
It is definitely an apt comparison between the two generations. </p>

<p>They can’t handle their views being challenged. Churches are filled with pedos who are being protected, but “a godless society” is to blame for their falling memberships.

    <div class="md"><p>Whose idea was the trophy? Oh yeah, Boomers. 
Why did they need them? Boomers can’t handle losing.<br/>
Couldn’t play dodgeball because Boomers would get mad if their kid was left out. 
They weren’t coddling us, they were coddling themselves. Not even allowed to complain at sporting events anymore because Boomers get violent and attack people over a perceived bad call. </p>

<p>Boomers most likely have brain damage from all of the lead. Not surprising you think ADHD and depression are fake. Your assumptions have no basis in reality. 
You call them snowflakes when others  can’t handle anything short of complete obedience. They can’t even handle other people enjoying things they don’t - see Pokémon Go </p>

<p>Went off to a college that I was forced to go to, because you know “respect your elders.” Learned how to actually take care of and think for myself, took on more debt than most Boomers paid for their first home even though they made more money with a very basic education right out of High School. Joined the real world during the economic collapse while all the Boomers went on Unemployment for 2 years and then on to disability. </p>

<p>This administration is the epitome of the boomer generation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right but bear in mind &quot;corporate centrist&quot; is an oxymoron (I&#39;ve never heard of a corporation supporting Bernie Sanders for example, maybe a medium? or semi-large company like Ben ad Jerry&#39;s Icecream -- or if they are a big corporation then they must be rare exceptions to the rule I guess, maybe because they&#39;re fairly nice people, or woke™ or from Vermont or something xD). </p>

<p>But for the most part, Bernie Sanders&#39; New Deal economics (similar to FDR&#39;s) are only slightly left of centrist (direct centrist in Europe) and the corporate media collectively shat heavily on him for going against their far right NEOliberal corporate Dem/Repub/Bush/Obama/Clinton economic agenda (more power to corrupt corporations).</p>

<p>For example, Fox News was scared shitless and so lied about Bernie&#39;s tax plan -- claiming the
peasants would pay a 90% tax rate....complete bullshit, Bernie&#39;s TOP tax rate bracket (which working/middle class people are nowhere near) was only 52%.</p>

<p>I believe centrists are our allies, friend. :)
The media may claim &quot;centrist&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; means &quot;between Dem and Repub&quot;
but of course that&#39;s propaganda. Being in between far right and far right is not centrist
or moderate.</p>

<p>This is what&#39;s really happening:</p>

<p>So basically NWO shills:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>their acceptance in society is solely as a target market of businesses, but that gets dropped once those campaigns fail, which they all do — Hollywood’s last few years epitomize this</p>

<p>they have no place as employees, as shareholders demand returns, not safe spaces, and refusing to do what is necessary to succeed just means you’ll get replaced with someone else, as all labor is effectively interchangeable in our current global technocracy.  Google, Facebook and Twitter can only get away with this because they’re monopolies — try pulling that SJW card at an investment bank or law firm</p>

<p>the whole thing is a fad because it’s completely at odds with making a living, for everyone except tenured teachers and professors</p>
