<p>A Russian would say otherwise. As would a Christian, because Christians argue that Putin is pro Eastern Orthodoxy, and since he has been in power, there has been a massive resurgence there.</p>

<p>So just like the U.S, the Gov which has admitted to election meddling in Gov&#39;s around the world</p>

<p>So basically just like the U.S. military Industrial Complex using the military to invade and kill in Middle East countries for Israel and Oil, got it</p>

<p>I doubt any Christian groups could beat out the Banksters, Israel, M.I.C. Deep State, Globalists which already have the dictatorship in the U.S., allow Soros to meddle in the countries politics, and kiss the ring of the Rothschilds</p>

<p>Infowars was never on kid, I found out about soros/rothschilds being kicked out of russia from another redditor. Now answer the question:</p>

<p>Is kicking out Soros and the Rothschilds system out of a country that used to meddle, good or bad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>McMaster actually made no such claim. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He said Russia’s attempts to “pit Western societies against each other” have failed and ended up “uniting all of our polities against Russia.” Moscow will therefore have to reevaluate what it’s doing as “it’s just not working,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His claim is that the purpose of Russian propaganda (by 13 individuals) was to pit us against one another. He says nothing about collusion. The implication is that this troll farm targeted multiple left and right wing demographics, which of course is a fact, considering most of their posts were related to the Energy sector.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s quite difficult to pass bipartisan legislation across our parties at the moment, except in one case, which is sanctions against Russia, where the vote was 98-2,” McMaster said. “That was made possible mainly by Russia itself and Russians themselves in engaging in this campaign of political subversion.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And more importantly, we need to ask why he promotes the Russian interference narrative. It&#39;s not in an attempt to attack Trump, nor is it done to promote the notion that the election wasn&#39;t legitimate, but rather, it&#39;s because he&#39;s a top level rep for the military and from their perspective, hostilities with Russia are great for business. </p>

<p>Mattis also never alleged or alluded to collusion. That&#39;s a phony narrative. </p>

<p>&quot;If we export something made from steel or aluminum then yes. Tariffs on raw materials will affect everything downstream, namely they&#39;ll become more expensive and thus less competitive with other nations&#39; exports made with cheaper raw inputs bought on the global market. Simply subsidizing domestic steel production would have been a better approach. Instead Trump just effectively raised the price of steel and aluminum for every machine shop and factory in America.&quot;</p>

<p>you couldnt refute this comment so you started ranting about slave labor instead.</p>

<p>&quot;so these tariffs are not going to be good for america and its allies in the long run because...&quot;</p>

<p>What the fuck is &quot;centralized&quot; about a world economy where goods are bought and sold by competitors? You&#39;re the one who wants the President to micromanage imports and exports, <em>that</em> is a centralization of power.</p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing for sensible trade policy in line with modern Capitalist economics. You can&#39;t answer that, so all you can do is yell &quot;you&#39;re pro slavery&quot; over and over again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not living in a fantasy land. The time for things like anarchism or communism has not yet come, so as long as we&#39;re stuck living in Capitalism I at least want it to be efficient and well-managed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer to this question should tell us just how fooled we were if we thought that Donald Trump was some sort of anti-establishment outsider.</p>

<p>The legitimate and appropriate outrage against Donald Trump is being directed in areas that PSYOP both parties into taking more reactionary positions.</p>

<p>For one, it is quite amazing that the most powerful Democrats, generally speaking, ignore what Republicans have been doing to steal elections -- especially since the 2000 fiasco.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like Democrats, by going after Donald Trump and Russia, are protecting Republican election stealing. </p>

<p>Republicans have been the Party of Oligarchy consistently for over 100 years. We should not expect them to change.</p>

<p>The answer? Support the opposition within the opposition -- groups like Indivisible or Justice Democrats -- until they topple the current flock of powerful Democrats.</p>

<p>Maybe you forgot. PNAC was a Republican plan. While we can all be mad about HRC and her adherence to it in Libya, we can also recognize a key difference: Democrats drew the line at Iran in a very stark manner, then later actually made a peace deal. Republican DJT is breaking that deal. Further, Republicans current PNAC-like document is called &quot;To Rebuild the Military,&quot; and it is funded by so-called libertarians. I suggest everyone search this document and post one of the very few articles on it. It should be at the top of this sub. Instead, so far, Republicans have been protected here -- the new PNAC is not even known around these parts.</p>

<p>So, to correct your assertion, actually many people have been forced into compromising on the Democratic side to oppose the incredible and continued war mongering of Republicans. Why? Because fewer wars is better than more wars, and the families of the dead would certainly agree.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Or you could say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the outrage against HRC was legitimate, then they&#39;d use legitimate arguments -- not but her emails, the Clinton foundation, Seth Rich, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ridiculous right?</p>

<p>The fact is that outrage <em>is</em> legitimate against both. If there is anything an r/conspiracy member should understand, it is deflection and misdirection. We should be opposing it, not adding to it.</p>

<p>Wait a second...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There certainly are legitimate issues with Trump, but none of them are covered or explored; and we&#39;re instead left with nonsensical, exaggerated hysteria over nothing-burgers. </p>

<p>So we agree. Good.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you think anyone can be &quot;trusted,&quot; you are using the wrong test. The correct test is to ascertain who will stop the bleeding or improve the situation. I assure you, the Party of Oligarchy that has written multiple plans to react against society and turn the clock back to the 19th Century is not that party and never could be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no Party of Oligarchy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There certainly is. Since the 1870&#39;s, with nearly perfect consistency, Republicans have been owned by the oligarchy -- to the point where John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and JP Morgan got in a room to fix the 1896 election for William McKinley. Interestingly, it was McKinley who broke the Monroe Doctrine and began the first major American war action outside the hemisphere.</p>

<p>This is not to say there are not oligarchs in the Democratic Party. Of course there are. Rubber stamping the oligarchy directly is like sticking your ass in the air and asking for it. At least with a conflicted party, you are moving in the right direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dismantling it or abandoning it</p>

<p>And exactly when did this last happen? Oh that&#39;s right. 1860. Don&#39;t hold your breath.</p>

<p>I believe they both are largely comprised of actors working towards a goal(s) that is against the best interests of the American people. The higher up the hierarchy you go, the fewer true differences actually exist. This is the ultimate truth I discovered after reading 165000 combined emails from John Podesta and Hillary Clinton during 2016.  The John Kerrys, Hillary Clintons, and Chuck Schumers of the Democratic Party aren&#39;t any different from the John McCains, Marco Rubios, and Jeb Bushes of the GOP. They are more closely aligned with each other, the intelligence community, and international corporations and NGOs than they are with either party&#39;s platform. They are power brokers not progressives. They have more in common with Hitler than they do with Gandhi or MLK. </p>

<p>I would like to remind you that all the Democratically appointed Justices voted against corporate speech. The lines were very clear.

<p>Libertarian ideology is itself a product of the oligarchy. You should read up on its roots.</p>

<p>Then, maybe you ought to read up on <em>Citizens United</em>. It frees just plain old corporations -- and here&#39;s the smoking gun -- Republicans gave all corporations free speech even though there was no general corporation in the case. Normally, that would be called &quot;judicial activism.&quot; Throwing in little fancies like how &quot;many 527&#39;s or 503c&#39;s&quot; is obfuscation.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t steal them though. To win the presidency, 270 electoral votes are required. That&#39;s how our democracy works. 2000 was bullshit because of the technical issues in Florida, but it doesn&#39;t compare to what was essentially a fake primary this past year.

<p>Citizens United was a case about double standards that  were imposed against the Republicans but not the Democrats.

    <div class="md"><p>GWB blatantly stole the 2000 election by stopping the vote court with a 5-4 Supreme Court decision and its just &quot;bullshit&quot; to you? But I shouldn&#39;t ask questions because you ignored this one, jumping right around it, and back to Evil Hillary&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know that party primaries and elections are two different things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you found one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are guilty of this. I agree with you there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee thanks. Neil Gorsuch will be deciding these cases, thanks to the stolen Supreme Court seat, which you continue to dance around. So, there&#39;s a difference that even you can&#39;t deny -- but you will. Laugh time. LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Citizens United was a case about double standards that were imposed against the Republicans but not the Democrats. The view of the Justices was that if corporate money was going towards Michael Moore&#39;s Fahrenheit 911, then it could go to Citizens United&#39;s Anti-Clinton film as well. If you want to blame someone for it, blame Michael Moore&#39;s fat ass. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no factual truth is this whatsoever. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is nothing about &quot;double standards&quot; involving Democrats versus Republicans in the case. Try reading it.</p></li>
<li><p>There was no &quot;view of the Justices&quot; that Citizens United was being treated differently than Michael Moore. Did you personally make this up or are you reading Fake News sites?</p></li>
<li><p>Anthony Kennedy and the other four decided that all corporations could spend unlimited and undisclosed money on electioneering, not &quot;it could go to Citizens United&#39;s Anti-Clinton film as well.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>It would be hard to blame &quot;Micheal Moore&#39;s fat ass&quot; since it was Citizens United that started this whole thing by filing an action to censor his movie. Then, Citizens United and David Bossie turned around and declared just the opposite. This minor detail should wake you up to a little reality. Don&#39;t forget to thank me. :)</p></li>
<li><p>The Supreme Court, unsatisfied to give Citizens United its little victory on the specific issue, re-argued the case then decided to overturn 100 years of campaign law and decades of court precedent -- far beyond what Citizen United was requesting -- and did so not just for the nonprofit that was in the case, but also for all corporations. This is called &quot;Constitutional corporate personhood.&quot; Are you for that? Maybe you are a Republican then, because most people -- including most Democrats -- oppose it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, just like you started the insults and the laughing ridicule earlier, you stepped it up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you treasonous Hill-bots have turned so far towards authoritarianism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People who oppose reactionaries like Donald Trump understand on a daily basis that things like suggesting summary execution of drug users or lusting over a president for life need to be opposed. And that&#39;s just two examples from this week. </p>

<p>At least some Democrats and some independents (like Bernie Sanders) understand the exigent circumstances here. Exactly zero Republicans have the people&#39;s interests on their radar.</p>

<p>Modern society was built almost entirely by Democrats, with FDR and Lyndon Johnson lifting the heavy weight. A majority of today&#39;s population recognizes this. Outraged (like you) about the complicity or even corruption of the Democratic establishment, and fully aware that third parties don&#39;t work, they have a plan to turn this thing around. Get the Republicans out of power and overturn the Democratic establishment. It&#39;s not gonna happen this second. It took Republicans 37 years of constant assaults against our way of life to tear things down as much as they have. It will take a few years to rebuild.</p>

<p>Magical thinkers like you are fine to let the most reactionary and destructive elements stay in power on some delusional fantasy that a third party will rise up and save us or a total crash will reset the system for some better world.</p>

<p>Hasn&#39;t happened since before the Civil War -- not gonna happen now.</p>

<p>Rather, what is going to happen is people like you, reactionaries claiming to be the &quot;far left,&quot; will continue to support the unprecedented Hooverist assault on our way of life that was put on steroids with Ronald Reagan in 1981 to continue to destroy our system and ruin our way of life just as we have seen for 37 years. Fortunately, people are awake now. Most of us know that Republicans are the Party of Oligarchy. Many are working to take over the other major party because that is the only option that has been shown to work. We did it in the 30&#39;s and we can do it again.</p>

<p>Wake up sheeple. :)</p>

<p>Tariffs hurt international corporations and they help truly domestic ones. Basically they are an efficient means of taxing wasted potential production, while decreasing the costs for domestic companies to enter into the market, creating more jobs and more competition. There is a point where tariffs become too high, but we are currently at the opposite of that point with respect to US history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is why I didn&#39;t post any to begin with. Charts, graphs, and studies are easy to manipulate when it comes to economics because there are so many factors that contribute to the data. What matters is cause and effect. By outpricing foreign and international interests, tariffs promote true domestic growth. The extraordinary claim is the one that attempts to deny this law of economics, not the one making the claim. So prove to me that tariffs will hurt wholly domestic GDP. Otherwise, your claim is easy to dismiss without examination.  </p>
