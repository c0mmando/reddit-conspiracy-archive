      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the 1930s, few Americans proposed with the precious stone. Then everything changed. In his 1982 Atlantic story, the investigative journalist deconstructed what he termed the "diamond invention"â€”the "creation of the idea that diamonds are rare and valuable, and are essential signs of esteem."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So this company hired ad agencies to create the propaganda brainwashing of the Diamond:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Movie idols, the paragons of romance for the mass audience, would be given diamonds to use as their symbols of indestructible love. In addition, the agency suggested offering stories and society photographs to selected magazines and newspapers which would reinforce the link between diamonds and romance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But now, the Monopoly is under threat:

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Indeed, even the most experienced diamantaireâ€™s in the world canâ€™t tell the fakes from those extracted from mines when using their naked eye, which is where technology comes in. More affordable prices, which are only seen dropping further over time, have already prompted budget shoppers to gravitate towards the man-made gems.

       Except you literally can't tell the difference. So you're paying more money just for the fact that De Beers says you should and for the prestige of bragging to your friends. Strong use of financial resources there.

       Chemical vapor deposition made diamonds can't be distinguished from the mined ones, except by spectral analysis. Diamonds must be GIA certified if they are 1 karat or more. And of course  De Beers GIA certification has spectral analysis machines so they can label and decrease the value of lab grown diamonds... But that leaves the less than 1 karat market completely open to lab grown, which are more perfect than mined diamonds (less flaws and inclusions).

       I suspect it is only a matter of time before artificial diamonds "improve". Adding impurities is generally easier than reducing them. And China has a lot of very smart engineers. When there is this much money on the table. Someone will come up with something.
      </p>

       The real solution to prevent fakes is to track diamond source to destination, but this will make people wonder why their gems came from African war zones.

       Ah, I must have missed all that clamoring.

      <p>
       So, people who wanted a useless item that is mined using child labor, warlords, and other negative things, that was only wanted because advertising created a fake market, are now pumped that this useless item can be grown in a lab, knowing that any diamond purchase, whether lab or natural, will feed the beast that is the diamond market, further contributing to the child labor and warlordism?

       Why not actively work against the concept that Diamonds Equal Engagement Ring and Social Status?  Cuz that is the We and the This my folk have been waiting for.

       I was in Colombia recently where married woman wears Emerald instead of diamond. I was told people prefer emerald because it is a locally sourced. Honestly, I think it looks much better than diamond which is colorless.

       Good. The diamond industry is fucking bullshit and they deserve to go down. Not only the blood diamond angle, and not just the market manipulation, but also propaganda manipulation of the masses. It's bullshit all the way around. There are legitimate industrial uses for diamonds, but the arbitrary, artificial social pressures to buy their worthless rocks is fucking irritating.

       I think it is pretty cool that the Chinese have put this brutal monopoly in a death spiral.  I am with a gal that told me she hates CZ due to its differences but she loved the idea of lab grown diamonds.  Initial pricing showed it much less than mined diamond, like 1/6th the price.

       When I started reading up on synthetic diamonds, I was intrigued, because I've always had diamond studs in my ears. Needless to say, I quickly got on board with it. When my relationship progressed to where we started talking about engagement rings, I brought it up to my girl and she started going on about how she wasn't going to wear a Target-esque cubic zirconia ring and it would be an insult. However, I explained that you would never know the difference and the quality would actually be better, and we could use all the money saved on honeymoon, new car, extra payments on the house. Showed her a couple of articles and she agreed. I'm really fortunate she's a reasonable woman in a financial sense.

       Diamonds are used in saw blades, drillbits, cut off wheels, satelites, spacecraft etc. etc. Basicaly anything that involves alot of heat and needs to still retain it's strength diamonds are used in. They're actually extremely useful

       I understand that so leave the real diamonds for actual uses such as the things you mentioned

       But real diamonds to buy solely for the purpose of jewelry? Again thatâ€™s a market that was created for monetary gain and no actual use

      <p>
       Using lab grown diamonds that nobody can tell except a chem test would not only save many lives but is also better for the environment and being cheaper to buy then actual real diamonds Iâ€™m all for it

       Your 100% right, I never said that they didn't. I work in the steel industry at the moment and am very familiar with diamond tooling. The cheap brands use the dust that jewellers get from cutting stones to shape, but the good brands use micro lab diamonds usually. Which is basically just a lab generated diamond a few layers of carbon thick that they overlay on tools to protect the steel from heat.

        Lev Leviev.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lev LevievÂ (born July 30, 1956) is an Israeli businessman, philanthropist and investor, of UzbekÂ Bukhari JewishÂ background, Known as the "King of Diamonds". Lev Leviev has a net worth of $1.1 billion as of September 2016,Â and has been a major philanthropist forÂ Hasidic JewishÂ causes inÂ Eastern EuropeÂ andÂ Israel. Beginning in the 1990s, Leviev avoided being directly involved with theÂ Yeltsin family, and nurtured ties withÂ Vladimir Putin.Â His diamond mining investments inÂ AngolaÂ and his investments inÂ Israeli settlementsÂ have been the target of protests. A prominent member of the Bukhari Jewish community, he is president of the World Congress of Bukharian Jews.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leviev owns diamond mines in Russia and Africa, and is a major competitor to theÂ De BeersÂ international diamond cartel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leviev is currently controlling shareholder and chairman ofÂ Africa-Israel. Africa-Israel is on the verge of insolvency, asking to restructure NIS
        <strong>
         21 billion of debt.
        </strong>
        Trying to save the company from bankruptcy, justice Varda Alshech has confirmed the debt-restructuring arrangement between Africa-Israel and its creditors. However, the justice expressed her disapproval: "The arrangement is far from being the best," Alshech said, because the company "is passing on the damage of its investments to its investors."
       </p>
       <p>
        According to an article published inÂ The GuardianÂ on July 24, 2017, Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, Jared Kushner sealed real estate deal worth $295m with Lev Avnerovich Leviev's firm cited in money-laundering case. The ties between Trump family real estate deals and Russian money interests are attracting increasing interest from the justice departmentâ€™s special counsel,Â Robert Muelleras he is investigating alleged Russia interference in the presidential election.

       I wouldn't care so much if Da Beers wasn't a blood sucking company that used it's enormous power and wealth to corrupt countries and the people who run those countries.

       When I started reading up on synthetic diamonds, I was intrigued, because I've always had diamond studs in my ears. Needless to say, I quickly got on board with it. When my relationship progressed to where we started talking about engagement rings, I brought it up to my girl and she started going on about how she wasn't going to wear a Target-esque cubic zirconia ring and it would be an insult. However, I explained that you would never know the difference and the quality would actually be better, and we could use all the money saved on honeymoon, new car, extra payments on the house. Showed her a couple of articles and she agreed. I'm really fortunate she's a reasonable woman in a financial sense.

       Diamonds and other gems used to be rare, hence their value and status.

      <p>
       now they are common and mass produced. decorative but not rare nor expensive.

       diamonds are lousy investments, somebody will only get one third back on the purchase price.

       They are indeed, but there's something you don't realize. I know all about you, the Guatemalan circus clowns, the animals and the videos. I have ALL of the videos Donna. Did you not think they would surface at some point? How would the kids react when they see their mom with all those clowns? How cheated will your husband feel when he sees how flexible you truly are? Props for your stage name though: "Donna Hump". I thought that was pretty clever.

       HK under British rule wasnt a land of copycats. Its always been much more advanced than the mainland and even the communists didnt want to taint it too badly when they regained control. They know it was a million times better off unddr British rule so they kept a lot of that intact.
