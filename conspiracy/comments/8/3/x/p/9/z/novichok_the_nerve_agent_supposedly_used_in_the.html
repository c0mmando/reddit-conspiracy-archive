        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the BBC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chemical used in the attack, the PM said, has been identified as being part of a group of nerve agents known as Novichok.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43377856">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43377856</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil_Mirzayanov">Dr. Vil Mirzayanov</a>, Former Chief of the Foreign Technical Counter-intelligence Department at Russia’s premiere chemical weapons institute said (in 2009):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without any exaggeration, I can say the last 26 years of my career as a Soviet/Russian physical chemist was spent on Novichok [Novichoks are the “latest” breed of chemical agents – those developed after VX. Ed] and other chemical agents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, what is the problem? Why are Novichok agents so dangerous? First, agent A-230, which was adopted as a chemical weapon by the Russian Army, is 5-8 times more poisonous than VX gas. It is impossible to cure people who are exposed to it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In spite of all that, I’d like to emphasise that the Novichok formulas and agents are not terrorist weapons. They are extremely dangerous – most likely lethal – for people who would try to synthesise or manipulate them without the help of highly experienced scientists and engineers in special laboratory installations observing extreme safety measures. Without exception, Novichok weapons cannot be used for any reason without specially trained military personnel under medical supervision. Chemical weapons (chemical agents in specially designed mines, bombs, rockets) need special launchers, and binaries need special chemical reactors. From time to time some people in the US raise the alarm about the possible use of chemical
agents by terrorists. It is just evidence of their lack of specific knowledge about the details in this field. Chemical agents cannot be sent in envelopes to kill and terrorise innocent people, as
someone from a bio-defence laboratory did with anthrax.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they would have to develop a special delivery system just for the purpose of killing one guy, while risking to kill themselves, and they would need a large team of trained specialists to make it happen. So this whole thing would probably cost millions to see through.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Novichoks are believed to work in a similar way to sarin, which was used in Syria in April 2017, and VX, used to assassinate Kim Jong-Nam, the half brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, at the Kuala Lampur Airport in February 2017. They are also believed to be deadlier than VX and sarin, whose survival rates are already slim. <strong>Similar to VX, the ingredients for a novichok attack were relatively safe, thereby causing no harm to the potential assassin;</strong> when combined, however, they were deadly and worked so quickly that a chemical signature would be nearly impossible to find.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The formulas for the various Novichok agents are not a Russian secret. The U.S. and the UK surely know how to make these. The agents  are said to be made from simply components used in civil industrial processes. The Porton Down chemical weapon laboratory of the British military is only some 8 miles away from Salisbury where the Skripals were allegedly poisoned.  The British government claims that Porton Down identified the agent allegedly used on the Skripals. The laboratory is surely also capable of producing such stuff, just like similar laboratories in other countries are able to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now lets counter May&#39;s claims:</p>

<pre><code>Novichok agents are claimed to be up to 10 times as toxic as VX. One drop of VX can kill a person. If the Skripals were poisoned with such an highly effective agent how come they are still alive?
The Soviet Union, not Russia, developed such agents. The main work was done in Uzbekistan.
Russia is likely able to re-produce such agents but so are many, many other countries.
What is Russia&#39;s &quot;record of state sponsored assassinations&quot;? The British claim that &quot;Russia&quot; was somehow involved in the death of MI6 agent Litvinenko is highly dubious. I am not aware of any other cases. It is indeed a long standing protocol to never bother spies that have been exchanged.
If Russia sees &quot;some defectors&quot; as legitimate targets why doesn&#39;t it immediately kill them? Skripal was living openly in the UK since 2010. Why would Russia kill him at all and why now?
</code></pre>

<p>Given the above it is absurd to conclude that it is &quot;highly likely&quot; that Russia was responsible.</p>

<p>The real likeliness for that is just as high as the likeliness that Saddam could hit the UK with a chemical weapon missile within 45 minutes. That was a fraudulent claim another British government once made.</p>

<p>May&#39;s claims today are just as believable as the all nonsense Tony Blair said about Saddam.</p>

<p>Way more likely is an involvement of Skripal in the Steele dossier and the CIA/MI6 operation against Donald Trump. Was he assailed because he threatened to talk about it?</p>

Even if you have them in your pocket (HA!HA!HA! It&#39;s already funny)  some Novichok agents have been specifically designed to be resistant to standard nerve agent antidote therapy. So, if it is used against you - you are DEAD. If you are not dead, then 99% it was not &#39;Novichok&#39;.</p>
