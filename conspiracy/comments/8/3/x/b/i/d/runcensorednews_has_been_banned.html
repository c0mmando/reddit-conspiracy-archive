    <div class="md"><p>Wrong, the articles themselves never advocated for the death of anyone. The comments did occasionally but they were usually removed. There were some obvious trolls who would come in and make blatant racist statements on articles not even about race, most likely someone&#39;s alt created for the purpose of reporting the sub since these were newly created. </p>

<p>The second one did happen sort of, it was more in the context of black on black crime in Chicago or criminal activity of illegals who were deported several times. There was never an article about blaming a minority just for the sake of doing it. </p>

<p>Minor but important correction on the third one, it was blaming <strong>illegal</strong> immigrants for something. This is a distinction that is very important and that a lot of people don&#39;t make. There is a big difference and blurring the line only serves to push a narrative. So there was an attempt by you but its not accurate. You speak like someone who has never been there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, the mods specifically stated and enforced the rule that calls for violence were not tolerated. Every now and then it would get brigaded with newly created accounts who purposefully violated the rules. Racism was fairly common though, which would fall under free speech in my opinion, and considering it was allowed for a long time the admins must have agreed at some point. Personally I never bought into their whole Jew conspiracy but overall it wasn&#39;t that bad. You could see articles there that you couldn&#39;t anywhere else.</p>

<p>Yeah, no shit. That&#39;s what happens when you proudly genocide others for factors they can&#39;t control, like race or sexual orientation.

However, you could go into those threads and use ceddit to see exactly what was removed by the admins. They were all violent comments. </p>

<p>So the subreddit was probably banned because the mods were not sufficiently removing comments inciting violence. One of which was, &quot;When are we gonna retaliate?

<p>For all the flack r/conspiracy gets for anti-semitic comments being common here - and it&#39;s true that they aren&#39;t <em>uncommon</em>, so the flack isn&#39;t totally unwarranted - the users tend to be pretty quick in downvoting overt hate and bigotry, for the most part.</p>

<p>But not always.</p>

<p>There is some homophobia and transphobia that pops up here from time to time, too, and once in a while one of those threads will get traction, but for the most part they don&#39;t and are quickly downvoted as well. Again, not always, but more often than not.</p>

<p>At the very least, it&#39;s certainly better in that regard than it used to be.</p>

<p>Wow, that went 0 to 100 real quick. I thought we were actually having a reasonable discussion about this, but apparently I&#39;m a SJW now? And I&#39;m not just labeling people I disagree with as extremists, these are <em>actual neo-nazis and white supremacists</em>. We aren&#39;t talking about the alt-right or conservatives or Trump supporters or the disenfranchised poor. We are talking about real, self-proclaimed neo-nazis. People who moderate subreddits like <a href="/r/nazi">/r/nazi</a> and call themselves nazis.</p>

<p>And no one is denying them a voice. They are more than welcome to have their little klan meetings, hold political rallies, write books, create their own websites, and spread their voice however they want. That&#39;s freedom of speech at work. But no one else needs to host that content for them. And no one should be bullied or shamed for banning neo-nazi content. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how many times I have to say this, but they DO have the same rights as everyone else. Literally no one is taking away their right to speak their opinions. All that happened is they were banned from this specific website for violating this specific website&#39;s content policy. They are more than welcome to go to Voat or Stormfront or whatever other website will accept them and keep on speaking their opinions there. But if they break the rules on those websites and get banned, that won&#39;t be infringing on their rights either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not cheering censorship, I&#39;m explaining why a group of extremists were banned from a private website. And I find it odd that I need to explain to you that neither I nor Reddit are a regime and neither of us are trying to stop free speech.

The nazis were well ordered, civic minded, fanatically nationalistic, hard working, and as a political party they were highly respected throughout the world through the 1920s and 1930s.

<p>The bigots&#39; freedom of speech does not extend to someone else&#39;s platform. A private company or entity saying, &quot;not here&quot; is not infringing on someone&#39;s freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You seem to be missing the point.</p>

<p>Corporations aren&#39;t deciding what is correct speech.</p>

<p>They are deciding what is acceptable speech <em>on their platform</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you work so hard to miss this point again and again and again and again, because it&#39;s <em>a really damn important</em> distinction.</p>

<p>Every one of the people on that sub were and remain free to express their views on another platform or, even better, create their own platform so they can say what they want, how they want, when they want.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> freedom of speech.</p>

<p>This argument that Reddit, Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter are private businesses and not the government so therefore they have the right to censor and police the thoughts, actions, and content from anyone everywhere at any time is entirely hypocritical considering each of those companies are entire monopolies of information, social media, news, culture, entertainment, and everything that shapes current society.</p>

<p>All the while these coveted corporations use government funded public infrastructure to distribute mass propaganda and channel the very same freedom of speech, assembly, journalism, and privacy against everyone on the planet.</p>

<p>Far from crying wolf that everyone on Reddit who disagrees with me is a shill, but many of us are 100% certain of the concerted effort to craft and mold public opinion, and this shit did not start with Russian troll farms on Reddit or <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or<a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. It started first with paid promotion of course like all things, then a moderator takeover of <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>, followed by the moderator teams who policed large amounts of subreddits, and then the slow creep into <a href="/r/AMA">/r/AMA</a> so that our favorite celebrities could play advertisement with us and we got to find out which ones cared marginally about outreach, and which did the bidding of their agents and advertisers. </p>

<p>This a concerted effort brought about by decades of brain-drain in America and the world serving various interest, but the point is and just so you&#39;re aware, bots, seo&#39;s, script kiddies, ddos/doxxing and corporate influence of Reddit was pre and post Obama which goes to show you that people who defame Russian propaganda are blissfully unaware of the private, corporate, and state efforts which incorporate all actors on this so called world stage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment is unrelated to this comment chain and you know it. This game you play is a slippery slope, you&#39;re more interested in framing a narrative and painting me as a bigot because of my comment in a different conversation and subreddit. People like you will take this attitude and multiply it given the platform and tools. </p>

<p>Primarily the difference is Reddit admin rules and moderation versus subreddit moderation and rules. I&#39;m pretty sure long ago it was decided by public opinion that we&#39;re going to be offended by the word nigger and faggot, so that is an easy way to ban people and there messages based off rhetoric they use. </p>

<p>The mods of uncensored news had a hands off approach, it must frighten reddit users what happens when you don&#39;t police your own discussion boards and let the users upvote and downvote what they please, its a stark contrast to what this website has devolved into. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The_donald mods work pretty hard to keep their sub on Reddit by making sure they follow the terms and conditions laid out - are the unfairly attacked? Probably, which is not right. But Christ are they fucking annoying, just a cunthair more annoying than the subs that constantly call them out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No where in this discussion is the <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> mentioned, but since you did and the irony escapes you criticizing the most scrutinized subreddit which has its own containment rules and algorithm which is unprecedented, but was introduced by our coveted reddit admins and moderation teams.</p>

<p>There are 15+ subreddits dedicated against <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and Donald Trump. You can&#39;t even see there content like the rest of Reddit on the frontpage, and yet you&#39;re trying to champion reddit policy and action as something to hearld as a standard. </p>

<p>I read your analogy, and it&#39;s a pretty poor comparison given what&#39;s at stake.</p>

<p>Reddit has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications">parent company</a> which has subsidiaries that deal across multiple outlets and publications with influence across media and information. </p>

<p>Reddit is ranked #4 most visited website in the US, 80 billion in pageviews, 500 million montly visitors, and you&#39;re trying to argue there is not precedent or motive to quell free speech? Or is your argument really as naive as we should take a call to violence or threat made on Reddit as grounds to ban entire subreddits and users.</p>

<p>If we follow your logic Reddit should implement hate speech filters, should scan users profiles for dissenting thoughts and search for violent or threatening behavior past, present and future. It should follow through on finding alternate accounts linked to subreddits that violate it&#39;s rules and then it should start reporting people to the authorities. </p>

<p>Reddit being privately owned is exactly why it should fall under scrutiny. Your home is not privately owned, the bank owns it, and they can dispatch the sheriffs to evict you. Your place of business is again seldom privately owned and still falls under local, state and federal jurisdiction, hence no longer having the right selectively choose who to service. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying essentially is that you do not have the right to stand outside a bank, an institution, or a government building and protest because it&#39;s privately owned and thoughts are bigoted.</p>

<p>Rereading your original comment it sounds like you&#39;re encouraging government overreach into privately held corporations, which I don&#39;t agree with but to each their own. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m encouraging the federal government to do its job, I&#39;d like to think we would all agree on regulation and enforcement of law and order, as it pertains not just to silicon valley, but big pharma, and practically every institution as we know them considering private interests have infested government, military, law enforcement, prisons, media, food, infrastructure, health, schools, etc etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory. The thing is I post here frequently. I respond to a variety of topics. I hardly ever get downvotes in those threads.</p>

<p>The user I responded to only participates in certain r/conspiracy threads. You can probably guess which threads.</p>

<p>You were not here early. I&#39;ll tell you what happened. I posted and I stepped outside for 7 minutes .Lo and behold 7 downvotes. The only comments being upvoted are the one I responded and one other. The other is a near verbatim carbon copy. One user responds to me and it turns out they are brigading(full transparency-he did not come from ASH).</p>

<p>The reason I got downvoted was because some people don&#39;t like the truth. Every regular r/conspiracy users knows Admins gatekeep. Everyone knows problems with mods and racism exist in all major subs. But what really bothers some people is talking about ASH. Despite the name ASH is a hate reddit sub that brigades, plants racism and ultimately goes on a witch hunt. </p>

<p>Would it be crazy to say you came here from r/SubredditDrama? I see you do have some conspiracy posts but only post in certain r/conspiracy threads (namely those dealing with Trump/Clinton/Russia). You are otherwise absent.</p>

<p>Is that unusual to you? That the people who respond like you do only post in certain r/conspiracy threads and tend to brigade?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just chiming in:</p>

<p>I think you’re failing to grasp how a lot of people use Reddit. I lurk through subs I don’t participate in (like this one) because I’m genuinely curious about what people I probably disagree with are saying about various topics. I often don’t care to upvote or downvote stuff, unless it’s needlessly hostile or bigoted, but I’ve definitely felt the urge to downvote something I’ve found to be very stupid. I’ll bet a lot of people actually do follow through with downvoting stuff they disagree with or find stupid (which is a circle shaped Venn diagram), so it makes perfect sense to me that a post that’s gained popularity on a front page subreddit would get an uptick in votes from people who don’t participate in the sub. That’s not brigading, that’s people using the voting system.</p>

<p>I also just have a hard time imagining what the purpose of Astro-turfing an inconsequential Reddit thread would be. Where is the money for that coming from? Who would get paid to do that? Who actually thinks doing that would be at all impactful? Reddit isn’t as closely tied to the actual public world of material power as someone who spends a lot of time online would probably think. Same goes with twitter and the hysteria over “Russian bots” there. That’s my lefty reading of the situation, at least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, though.  Fascism elevates government over all -- religion, ideology, human rights -- and therefore is exactly as <a href="/u/sacrimony">/u/sacrimony</a> described.  Only someone who understands that true nature of government will understand just exactly how profound a curse this is.</p>

<p>Mussolini&#39;s &quot;Doctrine of Fascism&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If liberalism spells individualism, Fascism spells government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Mind you, he is using &quot;liberalism&quot; in the old sense, the closest American equivalent would be libertarianism or &quot;classical liberalism.)</p>

<p>Fascism is indeed the greatest form of government.  In as much as we elevate government over religion and speech and culture and human rights of all kinds, we embrace fascism.</p>

<p>Beware! Down this road lies utter ruin and abject desolation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that exact quote might indeed originate from a neo-nazi, it&#39;s very dangerous to label the question &quot;which elites are censoring dissent&quot; as exclusively a neo-nazi talking point. It then gives elites the power to dismiss anyone who questions censorship as nazis.</p>

<p>Even if a &quot;neonazi&quot; is recorded to have said the phrase, do you really believe that such an idea was completely unique to him, and that it hasn&#39;t been said by numerous scholars, in an altered form, for millenia?</p>

<p>Stealing linguistic territory from your enemy is a dirty, yet common strategy. A recent example of this strategy the attempt to rebrand &quot;globalism&quot; as an antisemetic term. Once this rebranding is complete are people no longer allowed to discuss that word on reddit either without being called a neo-nazi?</p>

Not all opinions are valid, if you went around killing people because in your opinion they were lesser, would it be wrong if society made it so that you were stopped? Or is it just society cutting off an &quot;unpopular opinion&quot;? And sure, maybe most people commenting on neo Nazis stuff don&#39;t end up acting on it, but what about the people that do act on it? </p>

<p>unless they confirm your threat is credible. and you admit there is no distinguishing between a credible threat and a non credible one unless someone physically checks it out. Which is why I am on reddits side in removing the subreddit for calls of violence. there is no way to curate what is credible and not especially when the mods wish to promote the threats regardless of credibility because they want to be edgy to triggering or are actually hateful.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a PR manager for white supremacists, you sure talk like one.  This is almost word-for-word an extremely common talking point passed around by the &quot;alt-right&quot; and neo nazis to try to get people to listen to what they have to say.  That&#39;s because in current year the biggest problem white supremacists have is getting their word out.  No one will listen to them.  They know that 98% (number I made up) of people will automatically reject their message, but as long as that other 2% gives that message a chance then their movement grows.  </p>

<p>It (racism) was conclusively refuted by the American Civil War in the 1860s.  It was conclusively refuted again with the defeat of the Nazi army in 1945.  It was conclusively refuted <em>again</em> by the american civil rights movement in the 1960s.  How many times must we &quot;sit down and have a discussion&quot; about why Jews aren&#39;t evil?  How many times must we &quot;discuss&quot; that blacks aren&#39;t inferior?  How many times?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;re confusing supporting the right to speak and supporting the content of speech. My statements apply to <em>any</em> unpopular opinion, whether it&#39;s nazis in 2018, gays in 2012, communists in 1992, blacks in 1980, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to take the high road and actually refute what bad people are saying. But, if you don&#39;t do it, you validate them. More importantly, if you don&#39;t do it, your audience doesn&#39;t know that you are on the right side.</p>

<p>If an audience sees one side trying to support their stance and fighting for their right to speak it, and the other side resorting to trying to silence them or resorting to insults, the audience is going to take the side of the former. The audience never hears why the first group is wrong, they are just told that the first group is wrong and then witnesses them being treated unfairly.</p>

<p>Silencing them doesn&#39;t make them go away, it makes them come back bigger in a generation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bias is untruth and in the 21st century, propaganda describes biased material. Also the semantics here are irrelevant. Even if we restrict ourselves to discussion of propaganda with the most obvious biases, such as antisemitic Nazi propaganda, it&#39;s clear that speech can be used to incite violence in spite of its refutability--and any example that fits under my relatively modern, exclusive definition of propaganda fits under your more traditional and inclusive one as well. So, again, you&#39;re grasping for straws in the rubble pit of your argument. But my larger point remains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People aren&#39;t always interested in or capable of finding or discerning the truth. All through history the masses have been incited to violence with lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These simple facts formed the very bases for Hitler&#39;s success as an orator, for the Nazis&#39; successes in genocide. People aren&#39;t always rational actors. Even when there&#39;s underlying issues priming them, it&#39;s often indoctrination that gives them that final push. Fact checkers can go ignored, can themselves be propagandized against. You&#39;re acting like speech plays no part in this, like words aren&#39;t used to radicalize, and you&#39;re frankly embarrassing yourself, bud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that they&#39;re unpopular. It&#39;s that they&#39;re dangerous. Why should mainstream websites provide homes for these self-reinforcing 24/7 hate rallies that themselves bar and bury conflicting views? Nothing good comes of them. They aren&#39;t open to a genuine dialogue. All they do is affirm, radicalize, and organize angry, impressionable, powerless-feeling individuals. </p>

<p>Yes people need places to explore ideas. And there are plenty of those. Reddit has subs for liberals, conservatives, libertarians, socialists, and on and on. There&#39;s this sub. There&#39;s the flat earth sub. If you can&#39;t find a single community that&#39;s not a hateful cesspool to discuss your ideas, your ideas are probably <em>shit</em>. </p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is that convenience is king and if we stop letting Nazis set up their noisy clubhouses on private fucking property right next to popular outlets for video game discussion, memes, and porn, we&#39;ll lose less people to hateful ideologies.

<p>You make it sound like the people targeted by the propaganda are members of the same groups of people who criticize it.  Do you think people in r/enoughtrumpspam mocking propaganda posted in TD effectively &quot;neutralize&quot; it?  Few people in TD question the facts presented to them in memes, and the mods of TD ban people with dissenting views.  But TD and ETS are just one example.  People who only browse echo chamber subreddits (or whole websites) aren&#39;t going to get any of that &quot;satire&quot; you&#39;re replying on to balance out the propaganda.  </p>

<p>No one cares about the people who get banned.  IMO they&#39;re lost causes.  I care about stopping them from recruiting more people to their movement.  A thousand pissed-off nazis angry that their favorite subreddit got banned is a lot better than letting them have a platform upon which they can recruit fifty thousand more.  </p>

<p>Reddit is a private company that is looking to go public in the near future. They care about their bottom line. Advertisers have shown a strong willingness to back away from the kind of rhetoric that was on display in uncensorednews and with good reason. </p>

<p>(Neither is absurd.) Over 90% of mass shootings are in gun-free zones. Gun-free zones attract criminal shooters. This sub attracts shills. Neither place has a proper deterrent. The solution is to give power to the people. Arm the citizens; Allow redditors to call out shills. The biggest bastion for truth on this site has the hardest-working shill-deporters. But they couldn&#39;t do it without the members (whom some people refer to as nazis) who call out the shills. I bet many of the shills doing work here have been deported from there.</p>

<p>Really, this sub is becoming a total shit-hole. It is like the Chicago of subreddits. The toughest gun-control but the highest murder rate.</p>

Do you think that after the military got its thought-control appropriations money they sauntered here by way of Krispy Kreme as slowly as they could? Or do you think they much more likely got that clause in that NDAA to cover for massive existing operations? I am convinced for example that 100% of the big old communities on Google Plus are run by military narrative-defenders. And reddit is a much higher priority site for that.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s currently not protected. Gotcha. </p>

<p>Probably not. The US is pro capitalism right now.  Why do you want big government censoring companies on what they can do. </p>

<p>Write back when you re-read the constitution. The law about how the government can&#39;t stop your speech. Not average citizens on private property where <strong>YOU ACCEPTED</strong> a contract to abide by their rules on private property. </p>

<p>Free speech does not exist here. Speech is not a protected class. You want governments to control business on what they can do are say you can go move to a communist country. </p>

<p>If you actually believed in what you were saying you NEVER would have agreed to reddits TOS. So you&#39;re a hypocrite or just incredibly ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;re confusing whether something is legal with whether it is right.</p>

<p>Reddit probably has the right to ban people from its platform for any reason. Whether it is right to do that depends on the motivation. Silencing unpopular opinions is not an appropriate motivation. Being paid to do it is not an appropriate motivation.</p>

<p>For example: let&#39;s say there&#39;s someone in your house. You have the right to kick them out. Whether it was right to kick them out depends on your motivation. You don&#39;t want someone in your house? Ok. You don&#39;t want someone in your house because they are black? Not ok. Either way, you have the right to do it, but whether it was right depends on your motivation.</p>

<p>Haha no, not all opinions deserve equal representation.  If you&#39;re of the opinion that we should genocide nonwhites, you shouldn&#39;t be surprised when people try to silence you, because, you know, they either don&#39;t want you inciting violence or being victims of violence themselves.  We&#39;ve made the mistake of giving these people voices in the name of &quot;tolerance&quot;, and I hope we eventually realize that there is no value in giving these people a platform to call for violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a socially theoretical isolation chamber that removes the factor of human fallacy and probability yes, I might agree with you. But you&#39;re much more likely to stifle the spread of a disease if you remove the infected from contacting the public. It&#39;s not a matter of eradicating extremists, there will always be extremists.</p>

<p>What happens when you give a man who is toxic a voice through public forums or discourse. That man might get elected president. On the opposite end what happens when you stifle someones influence by removing them from public discourse and forums. Bernie loses the Democratic ballot.</p>

<p>Removing a subreddit that has become polarized towards extremism is a small step towards preventing extremists from amassing a following of semi-toxic but non extremist people. Couch critics who lurk and agree with certain media because they don&#39;t realize they&#39;re being fed toxicity and their like. It only takes a few radicals to create a situation like the Brian Jones town Massacre. Same concept.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for free speech but Reddit is privately owned and publicly browsed. They can make their own extremist chatroom somewhere else where it is more isolated, and awkward to browse, and a lot less likely to reach people in a misleading context such as r/uncensorednews. </p>

<p>Personally I would prefer that thoughts/ideas I find distasteful remain in the open for all to see.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t.  Reddit has no responsibility to give these people a platform to call for acts of violence and influence others with those kinds of ideas.  These kinds of ideas do not deserve tolerance, and tolerating them will only lead to further acceptance and recognition of them and their ideas in the name of &quot;tolerance&quot;.</p>

<p>What&#39;s frightening is that for some, they are <em>becoming</em> conservative stances. It&#39;s a minority so far, but it&#39;s a growing one.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be that way. It&#39;s not that long ago that I would have said I fall on the conservative side of many issues.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not something I&#39;d say anymore - not because my stances have changed, but because the crowd calling itself &quot;conservative&quot; is changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think subverted is the right word when it was created to be a white supremacist group from the very beginning. The mods were neo-Nazis who saw how many people wanted an uncensored news subreddit, so they created one and advertised it pretty heavily. Their goal was to take advantage of people who were angry about censorship in other subs and start exposing them to neo-nazi talking points. I don&#39;t know if it was to recruit more members or just to have a safe space to post all of there stuff, but it was their intention from the very beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still seems fishy. Equating alternate news with extreme political views has been a tactic of the powers for a long time. Subverted isn&#39;t the correct term if it was run by neo-nazis from the begging though. </p>

<p>People act like racist talk is the worst thing in the world. It&#39;s not and I prefer there be a place that acts as a steam release valve for some of the anger. Users who straight up threaten to harm people should be investigated individually but banning the whole sub is lame.</p>

<p>The sub was already under attack by reddit admins removing comments with their bot called &quot;Truth and Safety&quot;.</p>

<p>They still have however a sub at voat, it&#39;s /v/uncensorednews</p>

<p>They had it in their sidebar incase the sub is down.</p>

<p>Damn, uncensorednews was for me one of the best subreddits on reddit I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually was subbed there until recently. I unsubbed cause the comments were like straight up racist sometimes. Maybe it&#39;s like a hub for all those far right enough to care about politics hosting only liberal propaganda. Example being r/Bitcoin being censored causing the creation of r/btc which is just a hub for those dissenting from r/Bitcoin. It&#39;s the irony that uncensored news would only have one sided conversations (idk if they censored) while promoting free speech. I consider myself center right libertarian but that sub made me uncomfortable with some of the remarks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s no where left to post the propaganda then how does it &quot;stink more&quot;?  How does a hate movement recruit people without a place to post its message?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It absolutely does. Satire has the effect of neutralizing propaganda and countering it&#39;s absurdity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You make it sound like the people targeted by the propaganda are members of the same groups of people who criticize it.  Do you think people in r/enoughtrumpspam mocking propaganda posted in TD effectively &quot;neutralize&quot; it?  Few people in TD question the facts presented to them in memes, and the mods of TD ban people with dissenting views.  But TD and ETS are just one example.  People who only browse echo chamber subreddits (or whole websites) aren&#39;t going to get any of that &quot;satire&quot; you&#39;re replying on to balance out the propaganda.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but all you are doing by banning these places are reinforcing these people&#39;s worldviews radicalizing them more, and really becoming the very thing you are trying to prevent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one cares about the people who get banned.  IMO they&#39;re lost causes.  I care about stopping them from recruiting more people to their movement.  A thousand pissed-off nazis angry that their favorite subreddit got banned is a lot better than letting them have a platform upon which they can recruit fifty thousand more.  </p>
