       I had posted a thread by Seth Abramson about Felix Sater working as a CI for Mueller. Seemed like a long shot at the time to most people but now buzzfeed is confirming this and many more extensive details regarding Felix Saters life and career
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the thread by Seth Abramson (you can see I did post this link here before under my history) :

      <p>
       Article by buzzfeed today:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonycormier/felix-sater-trump-russia-undercover-us-spy?utm_term=.qiGk49PLe6#.qoEd5VL0PZ">
        https://www.buzzfeed.com/anthonycormier/felix-sater-trump-russia-undercover-us-spy?utm_term=.qiGk49PLe6#.qoEd5VL0PZ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some highlights:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now BuzzFeed News has obtained the statementSater gave under oath to House Intelligence Committee investigators at his attorney’s office in December, interviewed him extensively, and corroborated many details of his spy-thriller account through legal documents, emails, letters, and interviews with 10 current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials familiar with his undercover work.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He obtained five of the personal satellite telephone numbers for Osama bin Laden before 9/11 and he helped flip the personal secretary to Mullah Omar, then the head of the Taliban and an ally of bin Laden, into a source who provided the location of al-Qaeda training camps and weapons caches.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sater provided US intelligence with details about possible assassination threats against former president George W. Bush and secretary of state Colin Powell. Sater reported that jihadists were hiding in a hut outside Bagram Air Base and planned to shoot down Powell’s plane during a January 2002 visit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He went undercover in Cyprus and Istanbul to catch Russian and Ukrainian cybercriminals around 2005
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Signing Sater’s cooperation agreement for the Department of Justice was Andrew Weissmann, then an assistant US attorney and now a key member of the special counsel’s team. Mueller himself would be the FBI director for most of the time Sater served as a source.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As for his regular life, when he relocated back to the US in 2010, he recalled, “Donald said, ‘Where have you been?’” Sater said Trump asked him to join the Trump Organization. “That's when I became senior advisor to him,”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The deal, which Sater said set out a way to lift sanctions on Russia, surely would have pleased the Kremlin, but it would have been a sharp departure from previous US policy. Still, Sater summoned Trump’s personal lawyer, Cohen, to a Midtown Manhattan hotel in February 2017, and Artemenko gave him a letter about the plan.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump has denied knowing the man who had an office three doors down from his own and who helped his company explore deals across the globe.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And most importantly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To this day, Sater continues to cooperate with the FBI and Justice Department, he said in his statement to the House Intelligence Committee. He wouldn't disclose additional details, except to say that he works on “international matters.” Two US officials confirmed Sater continues to be a reliable asset.
       </p>

       I don't think it's black and white. I wonder why Sater has chosen to speak - possibly to protect his life. If the stories in that article are true there will be hit men after him on every continent.

       Yea, that figures. Kinda weird to try and spin it as optimistic for the mueller probe, though, to my mind it's another nail in the coffin. Another lynchpin of the original story that never went anywhere and turned out to be better connected to the accusers than to the accused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Page, former FBI informant, goes to Russia and doesn't get a meeting with Sechin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Veselnitskaya, within three days has two meetings with Glenn Simpson and one with Trump Jr., where she makes him an unsolicited offer of Russian support. It doesn't go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now Sater, another FBI informant, sends an email to Trump's lawyer, makes another unsolicited offer of Russian support which again doesn't go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leaves Flynn, who everyone's shut up about and whose case has switched judges and gone all classified, not a great sign for the blue team. And Manafort, who it seems will get legitimately got, but so far not for anything to do with Trump or the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's left? I saw something floating around here about how trump's lawyer's brother's wife's dad's business partner is in tight with the Ukrainian grain mafia, I guess there's that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing's gone to bits, there's no denying it. And all of those bits fit rather neatly into the counter-narrative - that the feds and GPS, in concert with the clinton campaign, ran a seriously illegal entrapment operation on trump in an attempt to frame him for russian collusion. Like this bit here, where the guy who emailed trump's lawyer with a brazen offer to fix the election with his best pal putin's help turns out to work for the FBI.

       ... and then given binders with recording devices in the spine to take to the Russians so the feds could listen in on them. Page = Male-1 = UCE-1. UCE stands for 'undercover employee'. I'd say that's beyond reasonable doubt. Happy to take corrections, but not if you're going to do that thing where you pretend to be too stupid to understand me and just jet off onto unrelated topics.

       No that doesn't work because that's how they discovered Carter Page in the first place, youre implying that he was given those binders to go to a meeting where they unmasked the very Informant that they used?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go through the timeline again because UCE-1 can't be Carter Page, UCE-1 uncovered Carter Page as the American being recruited

       , it was Page who delivered the documents, the documents had recording deviced hidden in them, the devices caught the russian spies talking about page's recruitment potential. The accounts of Male-1/Page from Buzzfeed and NYT mirror the account of UCE-1 from the court press release. Absent some major missing piece of information, it would seem clear that Page is UCE-1.

       Carter Page was Male-1, UCE-1 is the one who uncovered Carter Page being recruited..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Page met with a Russian intelligence operative in 2013 and provided him documents about the energy industry, according to filings in a 2015 espionage case in New York. The case included secret discussions between Russian spies that sounded like they were from an airport novel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Russian operative, Victor Podobnyy, was one of three men charged in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spy ring. According to the court filings, Podobnyy tried to recruit Page, an energy consultant working in New York at the time, as an intelligence source. Page is referred to in the document as ‘‘Male-1.’’
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FBI agent who penned the complaint explained that in the conversation the two Russians were discussing Podobnyy’s “attempted use” of Page, who was interested in business opportunities in Russia, as an intelligence source for Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why would the FBI get fisa warrants on someone who was working for them? They wouldn't even need it, they would already know what he was up to because they hired him. Instead the under cover agent discovered that he was being recruited by Russia

       Your link doesn't mention UCE-1 or suggest in any way that there were any other people involved who might possibly fit the bill. It says what my links to Buzzfeed and NYT say, just with a bit less detail - Page was 'Male-1', a New-York based energy consultant who was a recruitment target for some Russian spies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's the description of UCE-1, from the third link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ... Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. In response to requests from Sporyshev, UCE-1 provided Sporyshev with binders containing purported industry analysis written by UCE-1 and supporting documentation relating to UCE-1’s reports, as well as covertly placed recording devices. Sporyshev then took the binders to, among other places, the Residentura.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Can you at least comprehend why people might think that the two accounts refer to the same person?

       Again, I'm not saying it's bulletproof, I'm saying it's beyond reasonable doubt. Pretending not to be able to understand the premise doesn't really count as a reasonable doubt.

       Well his one's better than yours at least, but no not up to much. Both accounts have Sporyshev and Podobnyy as co-conspirators, and an obvious scenario exists which allows both claims - 'he gave the documents to Sporyshev' and 'he gave the documents to Podobnyy' to be true at once: they were both at the meeting where he handed off the documents.
      </p>

       Yea that bulletproof line was a clanger, naff attempt to forge a centre, o well no regrets. Good call on your part. You're pretty sharp.

       But then it doesn't matter how sharp you are, if you're willing to pretend to be stupid as part of your argument, there's no use to you. It's the internet argument equivalent of pissing all over yourself in a barfight - yea sure maybe the other guy backs down, but not quite fair to say you 'won'.

       There's nothing to "win" here. I just want to know how you can reconcile the FISA warrants on Page when he was supposed to be an informant? What am I missing here, UCE-1 (unknown) uncovered Male-1 (Page)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In June 2013, the FBI interviewed Page regarding his contacts with the Russians, Page says. The FBI believed that Russian intelligence services had attempted to recruit Page as an agent with promises of business opportunities in Russia, according to the 2015 court documents.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It does make some sense that UCE-1 could be the same person  as Male-1 because of the back story, but falls apart when you try and figure out why they would give Page binders to record himself, then have a meeting with him warning him about Russian recruitment, and then later on issue fisa warrants because of the dossier and his trips to Moscow. Wouldn't the FBI be the ones behind all that if he was working for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it looks like UCE-1 was sent in by the FBI to stop the Russian spies recruiting Americans. They happen to find an American they were recruiting and warned him

       Your comments in the thread I just linked not only aren't based in reality, they are actually flying in the face of demonstrable facts.

       The reason nothing happened again is because the Trumps once again see through the BS. Sater even admits when he approached Trump with the deal he was lying and winging it. He wasnt in contact with Putin.

       I don't think it's black and white. I wonder why Sater has chosen to speak - possibly to protect his life. If the stories in that article are true there will be hit men after him on every continent.
