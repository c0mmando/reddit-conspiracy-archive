       I feel that this is because they never want your phone to be truly off!!! With my old phones, with removable batteries, if I turned if off at %50 when I turned it back on it was still at %50. New phone, Samsung 7s, loses up to %15 battery life while "completely off". So clearly the phone is working hard while off.....

       It's also so you buy more phones..  Batteries are usually the 1st to go and well now you  Cant replace it yourself . Just gotta buy a new one or pay them to fix it..

       Well, if they have a smart phone, chances are good they can perform a query in a browser. It's just a matter of their desire to remove the battery being greater than their fear of the task.

       If you’re iPhone is still under warranty take it in and have them fix it for you for free, batteries that retain less then 80% of its original capacity have been covered by warranty since 2015 now....

       Most of the silicon valley morons who use Apple Foxconn shit are neither intelligent or rich. A hipster who can do a bit of coding and is a tiny cog in a gigantic machine is unlikely to be "rich" or very worldly, and last time i checked you dont need a computer science degree to work at a silicon valley company. To be high up the food chain, sure there are smart people up there, but most are not high on the food chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually, yes a lot of coders and people who do nothing but software know very little about hardware or the design and engineering of semiconductors or more broadly of computer hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were talking about people working in the fields of HPC, EDA, for a company like Synopsys or Applied Materials they would typically much more well versed in hardware, because a co-design approach between the hardware and software is essential to get useful work done with your $200 million new supercomputer or billion dollar fab.

       what i want to be able to do is to slide the cover off, take the battery out and replace the cover without needing any tools and to be able to do this in a second or two. this is to ensure that the phone is off and to preserve battery power for later, when i will need it. this is great for multi day hikes and camping trips. and fucks up surveillance efforts.

       Nah, just recently apps on the iOS store were allowed to go to 64 bit, which can only work on iOS 10+. iPhones bought before September 2016 would have iOS 9, which isn’t supported with 64 bit apps. One app for example is the Dunkin’ Donuts app, which stopped support for 32 bit versions and wouldn’t work unless you upgraded to iOS 11 (Apple stopped allowing updates to iOS 10 at that point). Just one example where what you said isn’t necessarily the case.

       I guess I'm the weirdo of the group then, I still have my Galaxy S2 &amp; I'm on my 3rd battery. Got this phone for a penny from Amazon for a 2 year contract, probably over 5 years ago now. Haven't allowed updates in a couple years, still going strong, knock on wood. Chrome gets tripped up on those
       <em>
        fucking annoying
       </em>
       banner ads Reddit puts in threads now, and a few other sites get wonky, but overall a great purchase...and no, I will never buy a phone that doesn't allow me to swap out batteries, what a horrible WASTEFUL policy.

       Haven't allowed updates? lol I'm pretty sure the Galaxy S2 stopped getting updates a long time ago anyway. I personally couldn't stand to use an old phone like that, but whatever works for you.

       I bought 2 unlocked Moto E phones when they were $35 new a couple years ago. Still rocking #1. It's a phone. It goes online and gets emails and let's me read Reddit when I'm in the bathroom. I fill the 32gb sd card with podcasts every week. I don't get what the fuck people do on their $800 phones that I can't do.

       One angle is planned obsolescence. They make the battery so hard to replace because they squish into a tight, narrow frame. It makes it very difficult and undesirable to repair because of the risk of damaging other parts of the phone.

       That's probably just a positive cosequence for them.

      <p>
       To be fair, there is also an engineering reason too. Making the battery non-removable makes it much easier to make it bigger.

       Not just that. The battery’s are considerably marked up. Also you need proprietary screw drivers and tools to make the swap. Finally, their iOS detects alterations and voids your warranty.

       It doesnt detect alterations. If you buy an oem battery and install it with the same adhesive strips they use (which you can buy from sellers online), and if applicable to the generation of phone, reapply the waterproof gasket which you can also buy online, they have no way of knowing it wasnt replaced by a certified tech.

       is just so the government hack is less costly and difficult. The Snowden files talked about capabilities where a device (computer, phone whatever) could had been "turned on" remotely when no power was present (battery or electric line) using some sort of wireless power device.
      </p>
      <p>
       but this means getting relatively close to the device, if you don't take the battery off then is easier.

       you should be happy they do this, maybe your tax money will be spent elsewhere instead on costly remote energy devices :)

       I dont think that is what started it, but I think it has potentially become a convenient use in applications where "offline" snooping is actually happening. its a lot more likely that OEMs originally started doing this in the interest of frequent device replacement. People used to have phones for a few years at a time at least, now they are almost disposable (even though the prices have become absurd). The battery is the one piece of hardware in a mobile device that has a high likelihood of failing in the short term. CPUs, memory, even the display are all capable of operating for quite some time (without physical damage). So you want to make sure people arent holding on to phones for years at a time, make it so they dont work anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally do not believe that all phones that don't have removable batteries are offline snooping on people. I believe the technology is certainly possible, and likely applied in certain situations but I do not believe this is the "reason" most phones have non removable batteries these days.

       Remember OEM manufacturers are not Google or Apple of the US Government. I am sure they are lobbied to do things in certain ways, but first and foremost they are looking to make a buck. Information companies are the ones to be afraid of (for the most part).

       My dad thought I had gone missing a few years ago and called the police. They found me in a park by triangulating my cell phone signal. I asked them out of curiosity how that could be prevented in the future and, surprisingly, they told me the only way to do so is by removing the battery.

       Well, it really does allow for more attractive design, more efficient space usage, and better water resistance. No phone with a removable battery has nearly as attractive of a design as unibody phones. I do wish there was at least one option for a high-end smartphone with a removable battery nonetheless because I like to swap batteries instead of plugging my phone in.

       It's cheaper to manufacture them that way too. Modular designs with moving parts are usually more difficult to engineer, not to mention that they don't like the end-user servicing the hardware at all. They also want to discourage peooke from using third party batteries.

       It's cheaper to make them like that(you can easily research this) and allows them to sell you their batteries with cost of labor to replace or forced you to replace your phone, it is far more for them to make profit than anything else, the phone can be fully off if the battery fully dies(this is for the paranoid weirdos who think a turned off phone can record them).
      </p>

       I agree it is bullshit, but it also is for profit, not a crazy conspiracy about recording. It is a conspiracy to take more of your money though, so it belong here.

       Your phone isn't just a phone - it's also a tracking device. Friendly law enforcement can triangulate your location very accurately both in real time, and historically (ie when investigating a crime). This "functionality" wouldn't be available if could just take out the battery.

       Yes, this was a common thing teens "knew" in the 90s and early 2000s, we would all take out the batteries from our Nokias if we wanted to go out drinking and not tell our parents where we were if we were gone for a longer period. One time one kid in our group would forget and the cops found us immediately, adding even more proof. We were 3 guys and 2 girls and we'd often disappear for a week during summers and one of the girls' parents would ask the cops to find her, and the only time they did was when one of the guys forgot and we were yelling at him minutes before we got a knock on the door with two cops coming to take her home.

       Yep, it’s just a way for the govt nsa etc to have constant monitoring on everyone at all times for their mega database. I’m always curious if there are keywords or phrases that trigger said devices to record or whatever it is that they are able to do. Anything with batteries and WiFi are accessible at this point, it is all bullshit imo.

       Yeah no shit. Because of cost cutting and fuck the consumer. Up to the s5 and note 4 had removable batteries and were waterproof. There is no engineering obstacle to such design, just added cost of r&amp;d. But its really not complicated, you need high tension on the cover and a gasket.

       "Galaxy Note 4 will have the same IP67 rating as the Galaxy S5.... That IP67 rating means it can be submerged in water up to 1 metre (3.3 ft) for 30 minutes."
      </p>
      <p>
       The iphone 8 and X share the same IP67 rating.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature IP68-rated water and dust resistance. The IP68 rating indicates that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is water resistant up to 1.5 meters (4.92 feet) for 30 minutes"
      </p>
      <p>
       So samsung managed to get an extra 1.66 ft of depth for the same 30 minutes with a sealed battery. Woopdy fuckin doo. Apple still cant do any better than samsungs 3+ year old removable battery designs.

       Yeah sure, you know better based on anecdotal evidence of 3 year old+ phones coming in with damage. You have the factors of wear and tear, drop damage and user error (not snapping the cover on completely) leaving the seals less than waterproof. These factors can lead to sealed devices having compromised water proofing, although epoxies hold better than plastic joints and silicone gaskets. But whats better, a dead phone thats waterproof and epoxied shut, or one that just needs a $30 new battery and rear cover?

       This trend leads to more heavy metals and toxic waste in the landfills. Plus steady, predictable profits for cell phone manufacturers.

       I never said I was on the side of nonremovable batteries. Not sure why you're acting like I am or why you're so vehemently attacking me about it. I have a V20 BECAUSE it is a nice phone and one of the few remaining ones with a removable. All I said was that removable batteries are not as waterproof as ones that are sealed with the purpose of waterproofing. Its a really simple statement and youre arguing against words that you put in my mouth.

       This. And pre-paid flip phones are often used as burners in some places which creates a second-hand market for them. Yeah they're pretty feature stripped in North America (which is why people don't consider them vs. smart phones), but it still has its uses other than being the cheapest phone option.

       Not having replaceable batteries allows them to create a greater seal. I think the newest Samsung can be at a depth of 1m for about half an hour. older phones were dead soon after they hit the water.

       It doesnt detect alterations. If you buy an oem battery and install it with the same adhesive strips they use (which you can buy from sellers online), and if applicable to the generation of phone, reapply the waterproof gasket which you can also buy online, they have no way of knowing it wasnt replaced by a certified tech.

       Most of the silicon valley morons who use Apple Foxconn shit are neither intelligent or rich. A hipster who can do a bit of coding and is a tiny cog in a gigantic machine is unlikely to be "rich" or very worldly, and last time i checked you dont need a computer science degree to work at a silicon valley company. To be high up the food chain, sure there are smart people up there, but most are not high on the food chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually, yes a lot of coders and people who do nothing but software know very little about hardware or the design and engineering of semiconductors or more broadly of computer hardware.
