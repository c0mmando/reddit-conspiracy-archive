It&#39;s a conspiracy theory and this is a place for conspiracy theories to be discussed. We don&#39;t need them telling us the idea doesn&#39;t deserve a place here. When you see someone else talking about it, and you support the idea, don&#39;t just upvote it. The upvotes get lost in a sea of coordinated downvotes. Reply with a comment stating you are supportive, even if you don&#39;t engage the contrarians. Leaving a comment in support is worth a thousand upvotes. Just keep sharing ideas and the truth will come out like a million dollar piece of art that was derided as garbage during its creation. </p>

<p>Edit: and my point is proven. We are having a good discussion with almost 60 replies and yet the post itself is sitting at 0. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your standard for evidence? I&#39;ve seen plenty of information to convince me. The main proof is that the earth should curve at a certain rate, and that rate just isn&#39;t visible. How many experiments need to be done before you accept that piece of information? Look at the $18 million dollar model of the Mississippi River. It&#39;s accurate to within one millimeter, yet it&#39;s flat. How can that be? Land surveyors don&#39;t take curvature inn account, nor do building engineers, no do airplane pilots. How many others need to say it before you accept that nobody takes it into account because it doesn&#39;t exist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But they should not act as if the science is settled and the topic no longer deserves discussion. Why are all flat earth threads downvoted to zero? I thought downvoting was supposed to be used for statements that are non-contributions, not for statements that you don&#39;t personally believe in. If a flat earther counters a point made by a globe earther, it doesn&#39;t mean they haven&#39;t contributed to the discussion, so why are most comments like this at negative votes? Doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What honestly bothers me is that disproving the Flat Earth is so unbelievably easy. </p>

<ul>
<li>Be in the northern hemisphere. </li>
<li>Find Polaris.</li>
<li>Choose a star on the celestial equator. </li>
<li>Measure the angular separation between Polaris and your chosen star. Spoiler alert, it will be 90 degrees. </li>
<li>Keep going south until you lose sight of Polaris and notice how the angular separation didn&#39;t change. </li>
</ul>

<p>For this to be true on the Flat Earth, this means that the two stars must be at MULTIPLE different heights at the same time. Impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t personally know why the North Pole star can&#39;t be seen from the south, but that doesn&#39;t make the globe theory true. This is the limitation of the scientific method. It doesn&#39;t help you find the truth. It helps you find a hypothesis for a certain data set, but it&#39;s up to you to say &quot;this hypothesis is likely true.&quot; Even if the theory matches the data, does that automatically make the theory true? No. In most cases, we treat it like it does and then we hope someone else comes along to replicate the results. We observe the sky and say &quot;it is this way because the earth is a globe.&quot; Then we test that explanation until we find a hole in the theory. If we don&#39;t find a hole, does that make it true? Not necessarily. It could just mean we haven&#39;t found the hole in the theory yet. Saying &quot;globe earth&quot; can explain this phenomenon and your model can&#39;t, so therefore globe model is truth is a false assumption. Me not being able to explain it doesn&#39;t mean my model is incorrect. It just means I haven&#39;t figured out the process by which it works.</p>

<p>Like gravity? So what youre saying is that the best we can do is collect data and interpret it with models, right?</p>

<p>So this whole post of yours basically boils down to </p>

<p>This is fun! Two questions that&#39;s I&#39;ve been dieing to ask. But first your response. I would say a theory are ideas that explain something. Like the Big Bang Theory for example. But the Globe is not a theory. It is a fact and it is proven in our society. I&#39;ve personally seen ships go over the horizon on Lake Ontario (lake by my house) so that&#39;s one small piece of evidence supporting that fact. You can not agree with it, but that doesn&#39;t make it a theory in our world. Now for my other questions, if you don&#39;t mind :)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We obviously can see that the moon is round, and the sun is round. Also Mars and other planets by telescope but let&#39;s just focus on the Moon and the Sun because that&#39;s with our eyes and it&#39;s undisputed. If that&#39;s the case, why is the earth the only flat one? And if you stood on the Moon, do you think you would see the curvature with your naked eyes?</p></li>
<li><p>The North Star. If the earth is flat,shouldn&#39;t we be able to see it from all points in the world? How come you are unable to see it from the Southern Hemisphere? Or from Brazil or Australia let&#39;s say if you don&#39;t believe in hemispheres.</p></li>

<li><p>Why do you consider Big Bang to be a theory but consider globe earth to be a fact?</p></li>
<li><p>The ship going beyond the horizon is also explained by the flat earth model so that cannot be used as proof of the globe model. It explains it by saying that as the ship moves beyond your ability to see it, it begins to optically merge with the horizon. It’s not going over anything, it just appears that way as it moves away from you across a flat plane.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s funny that you mention the example of dinosaurs as proof that we can know about unseen things. It’s a separate discussion from flat earth, but ask yourself these questions: why were dinosaur bones only first discovered in 1820? If they were millions of years old, they would have been discovered by cultures around the world way prior to 1820. Plus isn’t it weird that a complete dinosaur skeleton has never been found? If they perished in a cataclysmic worldwide disaster, some of them should have been preserved completely as they were unable to escape the immediate destruction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ok so far, it looks like none of the points you made are conclusive proof of a globe earth. Let’s continue.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It’s a logical fallacy to say that “since I see spheres floating above my head, the thing I’m standing on must also be a sphere.” You understand that right? I mean it’s acceptable for guessing, but we are attempting to be scientifically accurate, so I don’t think there’s room for the assumption in question. Secondly, we can’t confirm that planets are spheres. They look circular in telescopes, but other than that, we can’t say whether they have the depth required to make them spheres or if they are just flat discs of light. For me to say “earth is the only flat one” would imply that I’m comparing things of the same type, and part of my argument is that they aren’t the same in the sense that a light in a room is not the same as the floor of the room. They are there to serve different purposes. One allows you to see, the other to stand.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of the North Star, considering we are moving around the sun, which is moving around the galaxy, which is also moving, why has the northern star not moved from its position over the course of a few millennia? It’s impossible in the heliocentric model and, in fact, it’s literally what you would expect in the flat model. The only reason you can’t see everything from every point on the surface is for the same reason that ships disappear on the horizon; your eyes literally can’t see that far.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Even if you don’t agree with 100% of what I said, have I shown you enough evidence to take the globe model from the “fact” bucket and put it back into the “theory” bucket where it belongs. Also do the same for Big Bang and dinosaurs. You haven’t done any research beyond what school taught you about those topics.</p>

<li><p>No one was alive during the big bang so it is very difficult to say without a shadow of a doubt, what happened billions of years before there was any life.</p></li>
<li><p>I understand your counter argument for the ship theory. I do not agree at all with it but we can agree to disagree for now.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t personally find it weird that dinosaurs were only discovered 200 years ago. Obviously our ancestors were significantly less advanced then us so they would of not had the capabilities to study and search for dinosaur bones then we have. And yes, there are indeed fossils that are pretty much 100 percent perfect. &#39;Sue&#39; is the largest T-Rex fossil that was ever found and I believe it is about 85% complete. And it is not weird. These bones have been in the ground for 60-150 million years. It is amazing that any of the fossils are still preserved. Honestly though, personally I am far more interested in the Flat Earth Theory then the existence of Dinosaurs. </p></li>

<p>I think you know my &#39;very much unscientific&#39; arguments why the earth is flat. I am no scientist. But I am interested to hear your opinion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsoKNM-tabg">this video</a>. There are obviously of hundreds of videos like this, and its just a bunch of students who developed this weather balloon which is no way in connection with NASA.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to hear your arguments for a flat earth. And this part confuses me, Flat Earth&#39;ers always make the comments that all of the pictures of earth are fake or part of some grand conspiracy. Why is there no picture of the flat earth then? The flat earth society has been around for over 60 years. Why haven&#39;t they released a picture of the earth? or specifically the EDGE of the earth? You think this would be the top on the priority list for Flat Earth believers..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start by saying I really appreciate the attempt at civil discussion. This is what dialogue should truly look like. We are simply people exchanging information with no reason to pass judgment or be cruel to each other. So thanks.</p>

<p>I watched the video and noticed that the title says that the fish eye lens effect was corrected. However, watch the video again at the part where it is above the cloud coverage. The camera is swinging in all kinds of directions, but there is one thing that tells me there is still a fish eye effect on the lens. When the camera is pointed straight at the horizon and the horizon bisects the middle of the viewfinder (which is already impossible because the horizon should never bisect the screen at that height in elevation), but when it’s in the middle of the shot, you’ll see it go straight across with no bend. Then as the camera pans downward and the horizon line moves up toward the outer edge of the shot, then the line begins to curve and it appears like the earth is a ball. So in other words, you can tell it still has a fish eye effect because the horizon keeps morphing from curved to flat, based on the angle of the camera. If it were not a fish eye lens, the curve would be consistently shown, no matter how wildly the camera was swinging. I hope you can look back and notice the changing horizon.</p>

<p>You ask why is there no picture of the flat earth? What are you really asking to see? Did you want a picture of the flat earth from far away in outer space showing how it’s a flat disc and how it’s simply suspended in space? Who of us is able to travel that far outside in order to take a real picture of the earth? None of us can, so we are at a disadvantage because we cannot empirically determine that for ourselves. On the flat earth map, the North Pole is the center, and the edges of the disc are in every direction south of the pole. That means the entire outer edge is everything below the 60 degree mark on a globe. Maybe we can send up a balloon from that region if we can’t get close enough to Antarctica to do it(Antarctic treaty prevents people from going there to do anything personal). In addition to this idea comes the burden of proof. If NASA claims they have a picture of earth and it looks round, fine. But what does it say when you study the pictures and find huge differences in land mass sizes from one decade to the next? If the entirety of their photographic evidence contradicts itself, then we have to admit that they simply haven’t provided the evidence to match the claim because all their evidence is contradictory.</p>

<p>Airplane pilots almost exclusively fly over the northern region and not once do they fly over the South Pole. The official explanation given is that it’s too cold, but if were on a spherical earth, it shouldn’t be any colder than the north, especially during the time of year when the Southern Hemisphere should be in summer. So that’s one aspect where it supports the flat model while simultaneously not supporting the globe model.</p>

<p>You are asking the right questions. It seems like it should be easy enough to go anywhere and just send up your own balloon with your own camera and settle everything once and for all. The problem is in getting close enough to the outer edge. The outer edge is protected from any unsupervised human activity by the Antarctic Treaty. If you want to do anything, you have to jump all of these expensive and time-consuming hurdles in order to apply to go there. Obviously if you say you’re gonna send a balloon up to check if the earth is flat, they’ll just reject you with some silly reason. So it’s not easy to get the the critical place that would settle the issue. Again with them blocking access and making up tenuous reasons that don’t hold up to scrutiny. So yeah regular people are blocked from doing that.</p>

<p>Lastly, you mention all you do is see people argue against spherical earth instead of arguing for flat earth. It goes back to the notion that the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. The positive claim in this instance would be that the earth is a sphere. So then NASA and whoever else gather all their evidence and present it to the world. Now if it doesn’t hold up, then we can say “hey it doesn’t seem to match reality. Let’s go back to the drawing board” but if the evidence is accurate and comprehensive, then we can say “yeah that seems to match in most if not all instances.” As of right now, it’s looking more like the former than the latter. NASA continues to put out evidence that, upon critical analysis, tends to create problems with the globe theory. That’s why you see people attacking the globe. The default position we would take if nobody told us otherwise would be that the earth is flat, fixed, and at the center of this place. If someone comes along and deceives 99% of people into believing something that is counter to their own experience and understanding, that doesn’t make the deceit true. It just means people have too much trust in these institutions and they generally don’t have the free time to watch hours upon hours of questionable footage from NASA.</p>

<p>As a call to action, I would invite you to watch this video where the host discusses a bunch of international flights that had to commit emergency landings. He shows how the places that planes landed in make no sense on a spherical earth and how they make perfect sense using the flat earth map. Thanks again for a great discussion. Remember, even if you don’t agree completely with all the points I’ve made, we are barely scratching the surface in terms of what evidence suggests that it’s not as described. Take a look at the video, thanks: <a href="https://youtu.be/figx1DBiIJE">https://youtu.be/figx1DBiIJE</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am trying to keep it civil as well. Only way to have an actual conversation</p>

<p>But sorry, but I have a very hard time believing the society is not able to send up a balloon with a camera. This is not an endeavor that is impossible due to any financial or physical constraints. Check out this guys <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUZDOQm_HE">video</a>, I am sure it&#39;s a fish eye however it just goes to show you that its not that hard to send up a balloon. And you do not have to be in Antarctica to send up a balloon. You can send them up from all over the world. Lets say you sent up a balloon from Brazil or Argentina somewhere, Surely you would be able to see that Southern Edge is much closer then the Northern Edge.</p>

<p>Also, what is your reasoning that the South Pole should be no colder then the Arctic? There are a ton of scientific readings disputing that. Not too mention you can check the weather temperature anywhere in the world 24/7 (For example at the the time I am writing this, it is currently -29 Degrees Celsius at McMurdo Station). Therefore, you are suggesting the government is has paid off sites like weather.com to issue fake weather temperatures to suggest that the Antarctic is colder then the arctic. </p>

<p>And there is tons of &#39;proof&#39; of a spherical earth way before NASA ever existed. Aristotle figured it out 2,000 years ago, long before NASA was ever a thing. And how does the burden of proof not fall on the Society for providing their own proof to support their claims? It doesn&#39;t matter that the majority believes in a spherical earth. In the Scientific world today, you have to back up your claims to be taken with any creditability. This applies to organizations like NASA and also it applies to the Flat Earth Society. So I would like to hear the proof that the Society has before I give it actual thought.</p>

<p>There are many parts of that video that are false btw. For one, it claims there are no direct flights from Johannesburg, South Africa to Sao Paulo, Brazil or from Santiago, Chile to Sydney, Australia. This is incorrect. LATAM Airlines has plenty of commercial flights that fly the exact routes which this video suggests are not traveled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your line of thinking is correct in that we as citizens should be able to send up balloons on our own from places that are accessible to us. That was one of the points that convinced me. I saw high altitude balloon footage with no fisheye lens and what did it show? It showed the horizon bisecting the middle of the view. That’s impossible on a ball. It’s only possible if the earth is a flat plane. There is no northern edge. The north sits in the center and every direction south is going outward toward the edge. So the only edge possible to see would be the southern edge, but what limits us in this case, is the fact that the atmosphere limits how far we can see. Even if there were no atmosphere, our eyes cannot see infinitely far so just because it’s a flat plane doesn’t mean you can freely see all the way across it. To get a good view would necessitate getting close to Antarctica, which is the name given to the ice wall you hit when trying to go south in all directions. </p>

<p>Secondly, everything you said about Antarctica temperatures proves my point. According to the globe model, in a northern summer, the north faces the sun and the south points away from the sun. Now, in a southern summer, the same thing happens but in reverse; the south points toward the sun and the north points away. So if that’s the only difference, why is the south getting less sun and thus experiences colder temperatures? On a globe like earth, the temperatures of a northern winter should be the same as the temperatures of the southern winter. However, this is not the case. What we actually observe is that the north is far warmer than the south, which is an observation that fits the flat earth model while simultaneously being impossible on a globe model.</p>

<p>Third, I’m making a distinction about burden of proof because we don’t seem to be in agreement about with whom the burden of proof rests. If nobody taught us otherwise, the conclusion we would come to using direct observation is that the earth is flat and everything in the sky rotates around us. Therefore, that’s the default position. If someone wants to make a claim contrary to that, then the burden of proof is on then to provide the evidence. For instance, let’s say everyone does a rain dance to produce rain. Someone comes along and tells us “you don’t have to do rain dances. Just pay me because I’m the one who controls the artificial water source.” Now it’s up to that person to prove their claim. Now let’s say they produce a picture of themselves holding a water hose. Is that proof enough? No. Let’s say they produce a video of themselves spraying water. That might be enough proof to convince you, but if a video expert discovers that it’s edited, then you would insist the person was lying and you would go back to doing rain dances. Now let’s say the guy continues to produce videos and photos that are obviously manipulated for the purpose of convincing you he is the one in charge. Imagine how you would feel the the whole village except for you bought this guy’s lie. That’s the situation we’re in. This group of people came along and tried to make a positive claim that conflicted with simple observation. When it came time to produce evidence to prove their claim, they provided lies and deception. So therefore we can put that theory down and go back to square one.</p>

<p>In reference to the Southern Hemisphere flights, i can’t argue for certain that those flights exist or don’t, but the main takeaway I wanted you to get from that was that international flight paths make more sense on a flat earth map than they do on the globe map. First, I mentioned how observed temperatures make more sense on a flat map than the globe map, then I mentioned how observed flight paths make more sense on a flat map than a globe map. There are dozens of these points of contention that make zero sense when trying to apply the globe model, but make perfect sense when considering the flat model. Is that merely a coincidence or does it tell you that one model is a more accurate representation of reality?</p>

<p>Finally, what would it take for me to believe in a spherical earth? It’s like looking at a red cube and asking what it would take to convince me that it’s a green sphere. If you could show me it’s a green sphere, then that would convince me! However, I don’t understand how one could possibly attempt to convince someone a red cube is a green sphere. They don’t share the same shape or color. So what would convince me? Showing me evidence that the earth is a sphere would convince me it’s a sphere. As of right now, all the physical evidence I see that attempts to support the globe is either deceptive in nature or simply uninformed. If you tell me it’s a sphere, then that sphere has a certain rate of curvature, which is not observed at all anywhere in earth. How can you assert that it’s a sphere is the basic definition for a sphere is not even met?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be interested to see these videos that you speak of that show the earth is completely flat. Because everything I have seen this is not the case. Obviously the reason for sending a fish eye lens up is that you can see a much wider picture. Yes it is distorted, I&#39;ll agree with you there however that fish eye can be corrected. Thus some of the non-fish eye lens show a smaller section of the earth so it will look flatter. </p>

<p>And no, there are more factors to the temperatures then you mentioned. That is such a simplistic way of looking at it. For one, the Antarctica land mass is far bigger then the Arctic and under all of the ice and snow is land and mountains so the elevation is much higher. Which drives the temperature down. Also, the Ocean under the Arctic is warmer then the ice so it actually warms the Arctic more so then the Antarctica.</p>

<p>And those flights do exist, but regardless I don&#39;t see how that is proof either way. Airlines have reasons for the paths that they take. Some paths are just not traveled enough that it makes economic sense to have multiple flights a day from Place A to Place B. Also, flying over the Antarctic is genuinely dangerous because there is almost no chance for survival in a crash landing. There was a flight that crashed there a while back and over 250 people died.</p>

<p>And I genuinely don&#39;t think you can ever believe in the reality of a spherical earth if that&#39;s the case. From what it sounds like you would need to be taken up to space to see if for yourself. Too bad the Concord is no longer flying, because it flew high enough that you could see the curvature of the earth with your own eyes from that flight. Maybe eventually another commercial airliner will fly high enough that one can see it again. Then you could see it with your own eyes. </p>

<p>Until then you must understand that your view of the earth and the solar system is literally Pre-Aristotle which is over 2,000 years old. You are free to think that way if you wish, it seems insane to me but you do you I guess lol. There is tons of evidence over thousands of years which is Pre-Nasa or any other type of Government organization. How do you expect to physically see the curvature of the earth though if you are standing on earth? I&#39;m not sure you do, but I have seen this argument from other flat earthers which is ridiculous. If so, would you expect to see the curvature of the moon if you were standing on its surface?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I searched on Youtube &quot;high altitude balloon footage no fisheye&quot; and there were several results, this being one of them: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv4Hwk17F8Y&amp;amp;frags=pl%2Cwn">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv4Hwk17F8Y&amp;amp;frags=pl%2Cwn</a></p>

<p>Yes, this one does show the horizon as being flat all the way across. Even though you mentioned it would look that way without a fisheye lens, what is more important to note is the fact that it is eye level with the camera. At 115,000 feet, the earth below you would not extend out to your eye level. That only happens on a flat plane. Do you understand the difference in perspective that the two surfaces generate?</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t considered the point about Antarctica being at a higher elevation, so that makes sense. However, the issue with the water temperatures being different proves my point, not yours.</p>

<p>What flight are you referring to that crashed in Antarctica? The point of contention about flight paths was that they are wildly different on a globe versus the flat map. When analyzing certain international flight plans utilizing the globe model, they make no sense from a business standpoint. Like the emergency landing in Alaska; how does it make economic sense for an airplane to be flying a path that would allow them to make an emergency stop in Alaska? It doesn&#39;t make sense at all. Airplane fuel is expensive, the pilots can&#39;t just be careless. But when you overlay the flight path into a flat map, it makes perfect sense, and thus the airplane was actually not wasting fuel as it seemed before. You need to understand the discrepancy in flight paths and you need to understand the lengths any business will go to minimize its costs.</p>

<p>All I said was that in order for me to be believe in a spherical earth, I would have to be shown a sphere. I didn&#39;t say I would need it to be shown from space. If it were a sphere, we could measure the ground and find out how much the sphere curves. If we know the exact diameter or circumference of the sphere, then we can calculate the rate we should expect the sphere to curve. When we do the calculations with the circumference of earth, we see that the curve should happen at 8 inches per mile squared for every mile of distance between two points on the sphere. So let&#39;s check our answer. Has anyone ever measured the earth to curve at 8 inches per mile squared? No. Plain and simple. It&#39;s never been measured to have any curvature. So if a sphere curves, upon what basis can you claim the earth is a sphere?</p>

<p>You make it sound like I&#39;m saying that all I do is look down and see the ground curving. No. There are scientific means by which we can determine if the space between two points is flat or curved. If it were curved, everybody (engineers, architects, surveyors, pilots, captains) would be able to replicate those findings. Ask a random sample of the aforementioned people whether they take the curvature of the earth into account in their daily work and I guarantee you that 9 out of 10 of them say they don&#39;t (and in the case of the 1 out of 10, they probably have hypothetical calculations that make adjustments that end up being practically insignificant anyway). </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whether my view is pre- or post- anyone else&#39;s view. Those are appeals to authority and tradition and aren&#39;t scientific in the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I do not understand what you are getting at. I do see a curve though, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>The water temperature does not prove your point. It is just a reason that the Arctic is warmer.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/257-killed-in-mt-erebus-disaster">this</a> is the flight I am talking about.</p>

<p>And again, the reason that pilots take some of those paths is just as you mentioned. To minimize costs. There is not enough demand to go from City A to City Q every single day. Thus the reason for connecting flights, and yes, sometimes if you fly from the Southern Hemisphere you travel to larger airports in Dubai or other places. However as mentioned before, there are the direct flights which that video you showed earlier counter the argument that video was <em>trying</em> to make.</p>

<p>Also though, Say your flat earth model was real, I would assume it would take a very long time to fly from say, Sydney, Australia to Santiago, Chile. This is a direct flight path which takes about 13 hours on the globe earth, yet is at opposite points of the world on the Flat Earth. According to the flat earth model that you provided this would require a pilot to fly over North America to get to Australia, correct? Yet in reality, that flight never even comes close to North America.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao either every single person who works with construction on the land must account for curvature or none of them. It’s not some do, some don’t. If it were a globe, the curvature should be measurable by anyone and everyone, yet it’s not.</p>

<p>Also, if you can see a curve in the video I linked, then it’s because you’re expecting to see one and your brain is trying to match the raw data to the expectation in order to minimize cognitive dissonance. Take a straight edge, pause the video, and measure it. It definitely will not show 8 inches per mile squared, which is the only possible rate given the earth’s circumference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, well I am not an engineer but I do work in the construction field, and no you do not have to always account for curvature. You need to make the ground is level, but reletive to the world a building is so miniscule that it doesn&#39;t matter. Obviously you have to make sure the ground is level, but that 8 inches per mile is not a constant. It is an average indicator over thousands and thousands of miles. And if we are talking about one small piece of land (let&#39;s say of about 5 acres), objectively 8 inches means nothing. The ground has to be level, and you need to dig proper footings as according to Code, but no, for a standard building you do not have to account for curvature lol</p>

<p>And fine, I took a screen shot as you can see <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JbeddTa">here</a> and drew a straight line using Microsoft Paint from one edge of the screen to the other edge to get to the bottom of this. And the results seem to imply that the horizon is not exactly as straight as you implied. Quite clearly you can see that the center of the earth is above the line.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d like to hear your response about the Sydney, Australia to Santiago, Chile argument. How is it possible that on a flat earth model pilots can make that flight in 13 hours? And would they fly over North America?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you don’t have to account for curvature proves there is no curve.</p>

<p>Secondly, you keep referring to 8 inches per mile—the actual rate is 8 inches per mile squared—and the way you speak about it tells me that you don’t understand spherical geometry / trigonometry. You measured an alleged curve in the video. You can’t just say it’s a curve a be done with it. Does it match the rate of curvature you would expect to see at that elevation, given the circumference of the earth?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No it does not.. Btw I thought earlier you said that you had no proof that the earth was flat. Is this actual scientific proof? </p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not a mathematician. Doing a bit of research though that 8 inches per mile squared is a somewhat inaccurate formula. It is the formula of a parabola, not a circle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klI3tmmXseA">This guy</a> explains it well.</p>

<p>Regardless though, I can tell you are getting lazy with your arguments. First you said there was no curvature and I proved you wrong using the exact video you posted and Microsoft Paint. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can’t just say it’s a curve a be done with it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I can, If it was flat, there would be no curve, hence the word <em>flat</em>. And we do not know exactly how high the balloon is so even if I was a mathematician those calculations would be impossible with the limited information at hand. What we can physically see is that there <em>is</em> a curve and that is the important bit of information.</p>

<p>Also, I still haven&#39;t heard a reply from you regarding my last question. If a pilot is flying from Sydney, Australia to Santiago, Chile, will they fly over North America? This is a very simple question. If you do not answer this question in your next response, I am going to assume you are purposely ignoring it because you know the answer to be no, and that answer goes against the narrative you are trying to portray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s fine. Make all your assumptions about me, including that I’m lazy. A lazy person would not utilize free time in their adult life in order to analyze information they learned as a child and synthesize it into a theory that goes against their fundamental understanding of the world. If that makes me lazy then I wonder what you think of people who accepted facts they were taught in school without verifying those claims empirically.</p>

<p>I hope these two items give you something to think about regarding the accuracy of the <em>theory</em> that you support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked at the Wikipedia page for Sue and it mentions that the bones were found partially above ground in an area they weren’t working. If the paleontologist could look down on the ground and find them, how is it possible that nobody prior to 1820 found anything? You say we are more advanced now than they were, but if you found a random bone on the ground, could you determine what animal it was from? The natives likely could. You’d think they’d be the first ones to tell stories of these giant lizard bones they found. You don’t need modern excavation equipment for that. Dinosaurs are a modern fabrication reinforced by Hollywood (just like every other lie in society is reinforced by them).</p>

Their only rebuttals to having their information falsified is to come back the next day (or hour, when they have a budget surplus) and spam the same exact nonsense again.  The only time I saw flatties get <em>somewhat</em> creative was when they received the talking point that it was invisible vedic space dragons eating, then &quot;uneating&quot; the moon, that caused eclipses.  Yeah.  That&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start by saying I really appreciate the attempt at civil discussion. This is what dialogue should truly look like. We are simply people exchanging information with no reason to pass judgment or be cruel to each other. So thanks.</p>

<p>I watched the video and noticed that the title says that the fish eye lens effect was corrected. However, watch the video again at the part where it is above the cloud coverage. The camera is swinging in all kinds of directions, but there is one thing that tells me there is still a fish eye effect on the lens. When the camera is pointed straight at the horizon and the horizon bisects the middle of the viewfinder (which is already impossible because the horizon should never bisect the screen at that height in elevation), but when it’s in the middle of the shot, you’ll see it go straight across with no bend. Then as the camera pans downward and the horizon line moves up toward the outer edge of the shot, then the line begins to curve and it appears like the earth is a ball. So in other words, you can tell it still has a fish eye effect because the horizon keeps morphing from curved to flat, based on the angle of the camera. If it were not a fish eye lens, the curve would be consistently shown, no matter how wildly the camera was swinging. I hope you can look back and notice the changing horizon.</p>

<p>You ask why is there no picture of the flat earth? What are you really asking to see? Did you want a picture of the flat earth from far away in outer space showing how it’s a flat disc and how it’s simply suspended in space? Who of us is able to travel that far outside in order to take a real picture of the earth? None of us can, so we are at a disadvantage because we cannot empirically determine that for ourselves. On the flat earth map, the North Pole is the center, and the edges of the disc are in every direction south of the pole. That means the entire outer edge is everything below the 60 degree mark on a globe. Maybe we can send up a balloon from that region if we can’t get close enough to Antarctica to do it(Antarctic treaty prevents people from going there to do anything personal). In addition to this idea comes the burden of proof. If NASA claims they have a picture of earth and it looks round, fine. But what does it say when you study the pictures and find huge differences in land mass sizes from one decade to the next? If the entirety of their photographic evidence contradicts itself, then we have to admit that they simply haven’t provided the evidence to match the claim because all their evidence is contradictory.</p>

<p>Airplane pilots almost exclusively fly over the northern region and not once do they fly over the South Pole. The official explanation given is that it’s too cold, but if were on a spherical earth, it shouldn’t be any colder than the north, especially during the time of year when the Southern Hemisphere should be in summer. So that’s one aspect where it supports the flat model while simultaneously not supporting the globe model.</p>

<p>You are asking the right questions. It seems like it should be easy enough to go anywhere and just send up your own balloon with your own camera and settle everything once and for all. The problem is in getting close enough to the outer edge. The outer edge is protected from any unsupervised human activity by the Antarctic Treaty. If you want to do anything, you have to jump all of these expensive and time-consuming hurdles in order to apply to go there. Obviously if you say you’re gonna send a balloon up to check if the earth is flat, they’ll just reject you with some silly reason. So it’s not easy to get the the critical place that would settle the issue. Again with them blocking access and making up tenuous reasons that don’t hold up to scrutiny. So yeah regular people are blocked from doing that.</p>

<p>Lastly, you mention all you do is see people argue against spherical earth instead of arguing for flat earth. It goes back to the notion that the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. The positive claim in this instance would be that the earth is a sphere. So then NASA and whoever else gather all their evidence and present it to the world. Now if it doesn’t hold up, then we can say “hey it doesn’t seem to match reality. Let’s go back to the drawing board” but if the evidence is accurate and comprehensive, then we can say “yeah that seems to match in most if not all instances.” As of right now, it’s looking more like the former than the latter. NASA continues to put out evidence that, upon critical analysis, tends to create problems with the globe theory. That’s why you see people attacking the globe. The default position we would take if nobody told us otherwise would be that the earth is flat, fixed, and at the center of this place. If someone comes along and deceives 99% of people into believing something that is counter to their own experience and understanding, that doesn’t make the deceit true. It just means people have too much trust in these institutions and they generally don’t have the free time to watch hours upon hours of questionable footage from NASA.</p>

<p>As a call to action, I would invite you to watch this video where the host discusses a bunch of international flights that had to commit emergency landings. He shows how the places that planes landed in make no sense on a spherical earth and how they make perfect sense using the flat earth map. Thanks again for a great discussion. Remember, even if you don’t agree completely with all the points I’ve made, we are barely scratching the surface in terms of what evidence suggests that it’s not as described. Take a look at the video, thanks: <a href="https://youtu.be/figx1DBiIJE">https://youtu.be/figx1DBiIJE</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked at the Wikipedia page for Sue and it mentions that the bones were found partially above ground in an area they weren’t working. If the paleontologist could look down on the ground and find them, how is it possible that nobody prior to 1820 found anything? You say we are more advanced now than they were, but if you found a random bone on the ground, could you determine what animal it was from? The natives likely could. You’d think they’d be the first ones to tell stories of these giant lizard bones they found. You don’t need modern excavation equipment for that. Dinosaurs are a modern fabrication reinforced by Hollywood (just like every other lie in society is reinforced by them).</p>
