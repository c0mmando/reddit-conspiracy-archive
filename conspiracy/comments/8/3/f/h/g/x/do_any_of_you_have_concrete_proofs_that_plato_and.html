        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>That is an idea that I once entertained but it came back to me as I was reading Manly P Hall &quot;Secret Destiny of America&quot; and he putted Plato and Aristotle on the same sentence of Jesus when talking about ancient sages.</p>

<p>First of, a man like Manly P Hall certainly knew that Jesus didn&#39;t exist and that is pretty much settled. It is a simply matter of tracing his journey with esoteric wisdom and comparative references on his achievements and Old Testament&#39;s prophets achievements. </p>

<p>So one may ask: &quot;So is that whole knowledge attributed to Jesus, bullshit?&quot; - No, the bible is obviously based on empiricism, but it&#39;s very clear that releasing a work by them wasn&#39;t the same as today or a few centuries ago, when one, even outside of secret circles, work on something and then publish with their name on it for the whole world to know what they did. Some people, even today, simply don&#39;t care, don&#39;t need and wouldn&#39;t actually benefit from the whole world knowing their greatest achievements because they believe or even they know that some things better be secret.</p>

<p>My theory here is that the great ancient sages published their works under characters which name and story were all based on esoteric wisdom and the collect of writings attribute to one of those characters may or may not have been writing by only one person. In the case of Jesus, it seems obvious that such character collets the wisdom of a number of sages. One of the more recent cases of this is Shakespeare; it is very, VERY unlikely, not to say impossible, that Shakespeare existed when you consider the esoteric references on his plays. A man who came from the people may be very talented, but wouldn&#39;t know how to apply the hidden knowledge.</p>

<p>Then one can mention Plato and Aristotle&#39;s statues, which are nothing but artistic representation, just like the paintings of Jesus or even the &quot;School of Athens&quot;, which depicts Plato and Aristotle in a way very close to how Jesus was depicted. </p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t mean to start a religion war here, all I hope is good material for research and good arguments after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m don&#39;t understand why it is important if these people actually existed.  What they are said to have taught is what is most important.  Generally, when several independent and contemporary historical  sources refer to a person it is assumed, without contradictory evidence, that the person existed.  When a great person exists there are often tales and myths built up around that person, as is still the case today.  All three of these men fall into this category IMO. </p>

<p>There are so many contemporary writings of Jesus that I would say he existed.  The fact that those writers disagree about who he really was, even the Gospels are inconsistent on fact, lead me to believe that a lot of peoples belief systems were transplanted onto this transcendent figure.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of proof that Shakespeare was attributed with works that weren&#39;t actually his however I find the idea that he came from common folk and was thus incapable of producing these things wrong.  Many so-called common folk throughout the world have done great things and many have been initiated into the mysteries.</p>

<p>I very much enjoy Hall&#39;s writings but one must remember to take them with a grain of salt as he was a high level mason himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing is Nietzsche using esoteric references on Zarathustra, another thing is a man from the common folk from centuries before Nietzsche not only using esoteric references but also doing political brain-washing when, for instance, referencing the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>If and only if there was a talented writer from the folk involved on the plays, he was certainly guided by higher authorities.</p>

<p>The same still happen nowadays on Hollywood. Movies are not made by a creative screenwriter and an artistic director. They have a huge crew that involves not only the elite but also the army, FBI and whatnot. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean Nolan isn&#39;t super talented, but if you observe it closely, every movie look almost &quot;the same&quot;. Kubrick was probably the one who differentiate more from the rest and, still, the hidden wisdom is all over his movies.</p>

<p>By that logic a bunch of popular fictional characters would be considered real people because their personality, mostly written by a series of skilled professional writers, remains the same.</p>

Pythagoras is another such figure whom is opined to have &quot;never existed&quot; per rigorous researchers (Pythagoras &gt; Socrates &gt; Plato &gt; Aristotle).

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even sure if those are cases of &quot;glory grabber&quot;. The elite simply doesn&#39;t give a single fuck about getting recognized by the plebs, which is one of the reason why they use politicians and celebrities in general as puppets. </p>

<p>After all, if you have enough money and power to cross the world whenever you want to and you better not have your family exposed, what&#39;s the point of being recognized by the people? Have a best seller on Amazon when you don&#39;t need money and giving interviews to Oprah and Bill Maher, specially knowing they&#39;re worthless little puppets used to condition and entertain the junk of society?</p>

<p>Such thing gets more clear to understand when you&#39;re back to ancient times. Why would someone with power enough to influence on the bible want to be recognized by a slave who could barely speak?</p>

<p>But nowadays those same slaves believe they&#39;re any special because they live in a &quot;democracy&quot; and have the right to vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a good post when you&#39;re shaking people up!</p>

<p>I think you might be right about the authorship not being glory grabbing (better to not be exposed). P&amp;A&#39;s books cover <em>everything</em>, which is suspicious in itself, but they also held advanced thought in their dominant clutch for 1000+ years. That is odd, now that you got me thinking about them...</p>

<p>P&amp;A may be actorly names like &quot;Xavier&quot;or just be the Neil Degrasse of antiquity. Book I read about Pythagoras (forgot title, female author) stated there was effort to &quot;miracle birth&quot; Pythagoras to better compete with the burgeoning Christianity---what does <em>that</em> tell ya?</p>

<p>Even Mohammed, who has historical action to back-up his existence, has nothing <em>written by himself</em>. </p>

<p>Back to the power of the Storyteller. The Christian churches of Paul&#39;s letters were suspiciously well-established such a &#39;short time&#39; after &quot;the crucifixion&quot;. And Paul is feeding them his letters, trying to steer the narrative. Given that <em>Paul</em> existed, it is suggestive of the mechanism by which the slaves were indoctrinated. By-the-way, He has no anecdotes from people who met, saw, or had a coffee table made by JC. &quot;100 Years Before Christ&quot; (Matterson?) suggests Paul&#39;s stuff was written before the Gospels and that his JC refers to a long-ago resurrected prophet. </p>

<p>The Jewish &quot;Midrashic&quot; tradition, where the stories are openly embellished &quot;to add insight&quot;, kinda like fan-fiction, puts them in healthier perspective? I like Bill Gaede&#39;s YouTube physics, and Mathis&#39; assault on &quot;Historical Facts&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A modern version of this kind of idea is misattributed music on old p2p networks. Every parody song was attributed to Weird Al for example. I bet things like that have happened a lot throughout history, especially in the days before we had any kind of centralized authorities on information like that established/imposed. I think Shakespeare in particular is likely a pen name or something. The guy is known for double entendre and his name is practically a synonym for male masturbation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The position of Shakespeare in Anglo literature, itself heavily referenced by the English-Speaking Empire later, is even more appropriate to the issue at hand, that is, does God exist and/or did Jesus come and go directly between Him and Us. </p>

<p>The first question finds its center in the Protestant Reformation, and the second in the ongoing expansion of an essentially &quot;Atheist&quot; faction surrounding Francis Bacon, the first son of Elizabeth Tudor and her equerry, who was the cousin of James VI of Scotland and I of England, Charles of Stuart, and &quot;real&quot; heir to the throne in his own right, excepting bastardy.</p>

<p>All this comes to me by way of German Mathematician Georg Cantor. Cantor took a break from inventing infinity in the 1880&#39;s to spend his &quot;mad years&quot; researching Shakespeare and Bacon. That math now enables the modern technological breakout. And conspiracy.</p>

<p>The way that atheistic alchemical &quot;schools&quot; in proto-protestant England and Bohemia shaped the early &quot;Reformation&quot; into an eventual &quot;Enlightenment&quot; can be seen. So now we begin the &quot;real contest&quot; between Christians and Atheists - right at Shakespeare/Bacon. Before that era there really was not a question.</p>

<p>That fight continues today, for instance, in the strange reluctance much of the population of christo-based countries are being moved from Christian faith into a pure, might we say, &quot;technological&quot; materialism, only with effort. Even though the Singularity-AI-Space-Quantum-Continuum races forward, undoubtedly still a religion, uncertainly OF WHAT.</p>

<p>I&#39;d likely argue that it&#39;s still Jesus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, and one of the main things that gives science a power of secrecy is the fact that most of the people give it a mythical kind of treatment, but, of course, not assuming it as a myth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disregarding science in any way. Get into a lab or get into an open field and discover how determined plants work or create a new form of technology, you&#39;re doing science.</p>

<p>But when the whole mainstream media begins to talk about the same scientific theory of which may or may not be real and funny cocky actors like Neil Tyson are promoting it everywhere... </p>

<p>The most common thing nowadays is an atheist douche who believes to be engaged in everything that is right in this world to simply qualify as a stone-age nut anyone who doesn&#39;t believe in global warming.</p>

<p>Then you ask such atheist (or even a christian at times) how many hours they spent on a lab and field research to prove it real and they will send you a video of Neil Tyson... I mean, is it very different than believing in a myth?</p>

<p>Science theories that only a few can explain and no one can prove is a modern form of exoterism. &quot;I don&#39;t believe in Jesus, I believe in Neil Tyson&quot; sort of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, they attribute many references and writings to individual characters and Yeshua (&quot;salvation&quot; in hebrew) is one of them. You&#39;ll find what sepparates Yeshua from the character of Jesus in judaic researching. I&#39;d give one good material I know but it&#39;s not in english. Shouldn&#39;t be any hard to find it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing is Nietzsche using esoteric references on Zarathustra, another thing is a man from the common folk from centuries before Nietzsche not only using esoteric references but also doing political brain-washing when, for instance, referencing the Plantagenets.</p>

<p>If and only if there was a talented writer from the folk involved on the plays, he was certainly guided by higher authorities.</p>

<p>The same still happen nowadays on Hollywood. Movies are not made by a creative screenwriter and an artistic director. They have a huge crew that involves not only the elite but also the army, FBI and whatnot. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean Nolan isn&#39;t super talented, but if you observe it closely, every movie look almost &quot;the same&quot;. Kubrick was probably the one who differentiate more from the rest and, still, the hidden wisdom is all over his movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Generally, when several independent and contemporary historical sources refer to a person it is assumed, without contradictory evidence, that the person existed. When a great person exists there are often tales and myths built up around that person, as is still the case today. All three of these men fall into this category IMO.</p>

<p>There are so many contemporary writings of Jesus that I would say he existed. The fact that those writers disagree about who he really was, even the Gospels are inconsistent on fact, lead me to believe that a lot of peoples belief systems were transplanted onto this transcendent figure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By that logic a bunch of popular fictional characters would be considered real people because their personality, mostly written by a series of skilled professional writers, remains the same.</p>
