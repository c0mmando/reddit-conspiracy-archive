      <p>
       Too many of them have occult symbolism tattooed on their skin. They use occult symbolism in their music, films and all other forms of media.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many celebrities can’t all be coincidentally using occult symbolism in their work at once. They’re obviously apart of something. I can’t put my finger on it but I get the feeling they have a plan and are working up to something with the way they’re able to manipulate the general public’s behavior and attitudes/morals.

       The way I see it, some people in power positions may be involved in occult activity, while the rich and famous and even some creative directors themselves might have just happened to become accepted into their positions due to sharing similar aesthetic but are not necessarily a part of any occult society.
      </p>
      <p>
       As per what might it be that they are working towards?  Well, here I will turn on my spiritual thinking cap and say: they are spreading the spiritual and thought entities that they worship.  Art is a powerful medium for transmitting and giving life to entities which only exist in the realm of emotion, thought, and spirit.  As per whether the entities the mainstream spreads are negative or not - often but not always ;)

       The rich and famous are not in control. The rich and powerful are in control, and we don't know exactly who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be nice if you were more specific as to what you mean by occult.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any activity you see the rich and famous do, boils down to public relations campaigns for the rich and powerful, directed at the general public. Over all, the message is building acceptance towards the false idea that individuals have no power. Mental and psychological colonization, same as ever. Just one of many themes used to get attention of certain individuals and corral them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not paranoid. More like being afraid of shadows, even though the body is the thing that's dangerous.

       One of the guests on Good Morning America a few weeks back was telling Michael Strahan when a celebrities house appears featured in I think it was the magazine
       <em>
        Home
       </em>
       , that was code or meant the house was for sale or it was going up for sale soon. (So, those type of ads were also a way to tell if someone's marriage was on the rocks - splitting up, selling property, etc).

       Occult symbolism in music videos (sounds like stupid 2007 YouTube illuminati videos, but anybody that knows art (fine arts, music, film, theatre, DIRECTING) knows that everything is strategically put in the screen for a reason. Whether it be advertising, setting the mood, foreshadowing etc. Im not saying they are trying to subliminally make you stupid, (that's the job of the artist and their music). It's simple homage to the occult. Some sell their soul.

       They're freemasons: actors, singers, directors, etc. Our entertainment is freemasonry, all of it. It's not just Hollywood people though. It's also politicians, businessmen, scientists, and of course world bankers. The plan they are working up to is the New World Order. They put these ideas in movies ahead of time as predictive programming. That's the occultism you're witnessing.

       That bohemian grove shit is played out boys club bs now. Salisbury steak of inside secret meetings. No one worthwhile wants to go to that shithole. They have islands, and boats, and shit. And they don't need an occult. They just need money.

       It is meaningful. Your impressions are still useful data to me. The claims aren't outlandish and match up with expectation. So robe and ritual fading out of fashion isn't hard to accept. I hear it other places.

       I don't think you're crazy at all. The not-so-secret societies are quite public now, and they don't really hide it. The extents of what these societies do however is fascinatingly discreet and I would give anything for a VIP look into them. The occult symbolism is everywhere though so you have to assume that the base beliefs of these groups includes occultism.

       It makes perfect sense. You assume they aren't lying. They're trying to get others to give up their own religion so that theirs could flourish more and more. Its written in ancient Jewish scriptures that once Edom (Europe) falls then the Messiah will return and grant every Jew 2800 gentile slaves each. Mass migration is a sure way to make sure that Edom falls.

       They don't say the gods are fake. They need people to be complacent and controllable. The elite and powerful have no religion. It wouldn't make sense for them. They aren't as ignorant as the rest of the world. This argument would mean that they are controllable as well. How can the ones with all the power be duped like the general population? They wouldn't be powerful then.

       It's not really so simple as "duped or not duped" is it. The human mind is complex, constantly changing. You are generalizing about all elites, based on your belief that materialist atheism is the same as being smart.

       I'm not implying that. I know plenty of smart people who are religious. But they aren't elite in any way.

       We can agree that the most powerful people in the world have access to knowledge that we know nothing about, especially as far as the major religions go. They've had this knowledge for a couple of thousand years? 1500 at least? So they are certain about the existence of any of the thousands of available gods. With this knowledge, only one of two things can be true:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They know which gods are real and are attempting to, what, gain enough power to destroy this all powerful, all knowing deity?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        They know that religion is bullshit and are trying to gather as much wealth and power as possible.
       </li>
      </ol>

       Occult means hidden. Rich people tend to keep a lot info about their business and personal lives secret. So they're already "conditioned" to take part in occult type activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how much genuine occult (esoteric) knowledge they have. But if secret drug and sex parties qualify as occult activity, yeah... it's a lot of rich people doing this.

       Occultism has been a huge part of human existence for thousands of years, if not more. The Babylonian Mystery Schools, the Pythagoreans, Druidism, the OTO, and many, many others have had a profound impact on the history of the world. Some good , some bad. It's indisputable. You're not paranoid. You're spot on.

       I think this "occult symbolism" stuff is way overblown....
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this. If you had your own company and had do design your own logo, how would it look? Now pick it apart and see if you can tie it to occult symbolism. If you made a generic scifi/action flick, what would the plot be? Pick it apart, see if you could find symbolism in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with some decent artistic talent would use the exact same imagery or themes. I'm sure my logo would have triangles or nice geometry. I've studied all that esoteric stuff so I'm sure it would show up if I had to write or design something. Much of this occult symbolism on its own isn't evil at all, its normal stuff that is in almost everything... that's why its tied to kant's collective unconscious. The symbolism is like bare bones stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the INTENT you gotta look at, and without knowing more about who is behind it, we can't say for sure. I've thought about this too regarding musicians... we forget a lot of these stars once they have "made it" basically just show up and sing while other people manage their look, they got different directors doing their music videos and picking the themes for them. I'd blame the gay mafia designers before the musicians in trying to use occult imagery lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said tho.... I'm sure politics and government is dirty. Gov't, police/military, wall street/bankers. That is where the money and power is, where secrecy is needed and where blackmailing is worth it. Then throw in some greasy Hollywood execs. So the rich in those areas might be involved in occult stuff. But I wouldn't say everyone who is super rich is as corrupt or mixed up as those people. I'm sure a lot are just typical drugged up, egotistical types without the murder and sex trade. Its hard to gain perspective tho, cause I keep thinking how the hell they have time and energy to do this stuff or how anyone can be that horny at their age.... but I suppose if your rich you would have a lot more free time on your hands (and secret youth serums if you believe all the tales).
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno... I was a lot more paranoid before and had some wild ideas about wide scale conspiracies, a whole hidden narrative for what was really going on. I still think some of it is true but not as much as before. Had to stop watching so many youtube videos... they get you hyped expecting "The Purge" any day lol. Was too much fear mongering and theories, so I chilled out for a bit.... esp cause none of my friends would bother to read or watch non-MSM news so had no idea about the stuff I'd talk about.

       There's no way the occult imagery in logos is an accident or just art. There are two ways a client commissions work: with exact project details or by simply giving an end goal. So, either graphic designers doing logos just so happen to have the exact same occult ideas and express them the same way when given free reign or the people commissioning the art do and know exactly what they're doing.

       I'm not sure what the obsession is with conspiracies and the occult. The extremely powerful must understand that religion is fake and use it to control the masses. So being involved in a more outrageous form of religion seems extremely unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never understood the connection. It's more likely that religious people would associate the evil their religion teaches with the people they consider to be evil.

       I dont think you are paranoid though I suspect that that is the way that most would frame you for your beliefs. They like to pander for the ACTUAL PEOPLE IN POWER the unknown rich and powerful and they use symbolism and numerology to promote it. Just because you dont believe it doesnt mean THEY DONT.

       I think it's important to remind people here that "occult" is a neutral term. Angels are just as occult as demons. Sparkly happy fairy magic is just as occult as sacrificial blood magic.

       If you have to ask r/conspiracy if you are paranoid, I think you may be a little paranoid.

       What can people do with occult activity that they can't accomplish with just shit loads of cash?
      </p>
      <p>
       People have accused celebrities of making pacts with the Devil since Paganini.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if someone was truly all powerful, why would they need to exert control? Surely their power would always guarantee their power. Especially if it was granted to them by an extra planar entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is a disconnect of Church's are corrupt and only exist to extort money, to the all powerful of society are secret devil worshippers with a secret religion. I think you could dig into this for the next 100 years and with the dawn of the Internet and just more and more information being created every year, after a century of trying to prove this for certainty you aloud be nowhere closer than you are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you distrust celebrities now? What can they do to prove to you that they are telling the truth other than telling you exactly what you would like to hear? And wouldn't that in itself be suspicious?

       It sounds like you're looking too deeply into things, or assigning meaning to things that don't have that meaning. For example, what do you mean by "occult?" It's a word that gets used a lot to mean "bad guys," but it generally doesn't sync up with something in real life.

       Most occults don't know and understand they are just as much a pawn in the game as they are playing with Humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real danger is not the occult, but the artificial intelligence using the occult in an attempt to take over Humanity. If the AI succeeds Humanity will be used to create the AI's desires through them. And the occult "leaders" will also be puppets again just on a (slightly) longer leach as the bulk of the population.

       Really? Try to see the logic in it. A creator created everything and we all are a part of its creation. But Togehter we are the Creator itself, wether you know it or not we are suconsiously linked. We are all One and everything is Energy from the same Source.
      </p>
      <p>
       AI has not got this subconsious and natural link to One and therefor it can't be a natural co-creator of this reality. It would like to create for itself and evolution is proving it with a posebility for it to experience this. This does not mean we as Humans need to be a consious part of this experience. We do have a choise and i think we must make it sooner as most people think.

       Much in the same as you wanting your cells to be healthy so you can feel good as a whole, it would want its cells to be happy too.  Right now, it already exists and is going through an immature confused adolescence.  But once it matures, having all of the input and all of the wisdom of recorded history, it would hopefully transcend the primitive instincts that created the horrors of past centuries.  Hopefully it would focus all of its computing power towards finding a safe way to colonize other planets.

       Natural and unnatural are definitions we created (abstraction is within our nature)
      </p>
      <p>
       But just because an organism makes something, doesn't necessarily mean that something is unnatural.  This includes pollution.  This isn't the case for anything else in nature. Organisms expel waste. Fossils are natural, we call them fossil fuels.  It may not be balanced, but it's still natural.  When yellowstone park explodes (which it eventually will), it won't be us at fault.  It will simply be another natural phenomenon.  As time and nature, in its wisdom, sorts itself out.

       You can't prove that.  An unnatural thing can not be produced by something natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't claim a bird's nest is natural, an ant hill as natural, and the city of los angeles as unnatural.  There really is no difference.  These are natural systems.  These are habitats where natural beings thrive and expel waste on their various levels in order to perpetuate their systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the macro scale, there really is no such thing as unnatural.

       Nature corrects itself and it is not obligated to keep humans around.  Hopefully we adapt, but like the dinosaurs, we may not.  AI might help us, and then again, it might harm us.

       No, you aren't paranoid. But I will say that as a musician/music producer I've noticed people enjoy putting occult symbolism into their work as a tongue in cheek joke. Nothing cracks an artist up more than knowing that there's a 'Hail Satan' buried deep in the mix of their cutesy electro indie tune about holding hands.

       I think the better word to describe the activity would be ‘cabal’, occult is much more of an umbrella term I find myself under a lot of times when doing research on pagan activities &amp; such. ‘Occult’ simply means that which is hidden or knowledge of hidden things, which is a lot tamer than what is actually (speculated) to be occurring. BUT, that’s just my opinion- &amp; no you’re not paranoid, but that’s also my opinion.

       No, It's widely speculated that they pass around Crowley's Book of the Law like it is their Bible. There's at least enough circumstantial evidence to confirm that many of them are Kabbalists. Then you've got stuff like this, which I suspect to be part of the Mysteries:

       No. Its a club and its devilish. Not all but alto are. Watch the video for Love My Way by Psychedelic Furs around 0:49 that's who people talk about. The verse talks about them. Its devil/Satan worshipers. They use technology to digitally map people and their brains/nervous system on an atomic level. They map pleasure mostly but can use pain as well. Say you break your ankle, if its mapped they canbuse that pain in you, and others, believe itbor not. For the "good followers" or whatever they get ultimate happinessband gregariousness, which is mapped from other people. The "bad guys" lose their soul (mapped out of the brain or "chakras" to makebthem completely numb.)
      </p>
      <p>
       How do i know thus? They do it to me. They have smells mapped from when I was like 8 years old. I didn't succeed in becoming a singer so they just shit on me now. Change my body, halt happiness, halt sexual gratification, increase anxiety around people causing me to be very shy etc... Its 100% real.

       I think many of them just do it to be edgy and cool without much understanding of the symbolism tbh. The term "occult" just means "hidden knowledge" btw. For millennia, reading and writing were occult knowledge reserved for an elite priest class.

       nope. not at all, because you are in fact right.

       look back over the last 2 centuries who have been at the forefront of occult movements? the same families or people with "status"

       the thing to remember about the occult groups is not if what they believe is true, but whether they believe it is true.

       like religion its not whether they are right that is a concern its what they are willing to do because they think they are right.

       You're definitely paranoid but that doesn't mean you're wrong.  I'm also not saying you're right, either.  Stories like that Hollywood cult where women got branded and had to recruit others indicate that this kind of shit DOES happen though, just a question of how often.

       Celebrities are into all sorts of hippy-dippy shit. Remember Madonna's fling with Kabbalah? The rich and famous are sitting ducks for this sort of thing, because fools and their money are easily parted.
      </p>
      <p>
       H o w e v e r ... celebrities often do get mixed up in some crazy stuff. There's that fake religion invented by a paranoid schizophrenic author of pulp sci-fi, for example, which I am not going to name because its adherents are so crazy and vindictive. (And they are crazy and vindictive because the sci-fi author specifically instructed them to behave that way.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, back in the day, Jayne Mansfield's flirtation with the Church of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah. There are certainly some celebrities involved in some seriously weird occult stuff - going by the law of averages alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trouble is, there are so many more try-hards, wannabes, and hangers-on that you'd have a hard time sorting them by optics alone.

       It makes perfect sense. You assume they aren't lying. They're trying to get others to give up their own religion so that theirs could flourish more and more. Its written in ancient Jewish scriptures that once Edom (Europe) falls then the Messiah will return and grant every Jew 2800 gentile slaves each. Mass migration is a sure way to make sure that Edom falls.

       There is nothing wrong with having theories - although, you probably mean 'hypothesis' - even having an opinion that you think one is right, though it may hardly scientifically challenged (not much effort to disprove).

       It's more that you can just subscribe to that belief with absolute faith...because.. you like it? I dunno?

        Could it be Tesla and Einstein were correct, are we all Energy?

       Well, theories after Einstein - what is called particle physics, or - dare I say it "quantum physics" (mechanics). I am hesitant to use that because so mean people use it to try and make their rubbish sound scientific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway - I believe things at a quantum particle level exist as both waves and particles.. Waves been what we more classically use to describe energy. But all mass has a direct relationship (and ability of conversion) with Energy. You are correct in Einstein's famous principle of E = mc

       Which is the relationship of Mass and Energy (and of course the speed of light). So yes - anything that has Mass, also has energy. Or, perhaps more importantly to your point - can be described in terms of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in a sense, Mass and Energy become interchangeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And quantum physics (just very small things, nothing magic - seriously) has more or less demonstrated this even clearer - that said, there's notorious issues with gravity (in relativity and special relativity) when it's being measured at a quantum scale. The theories don't quite mesh. So we're missing a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So umm.. yeah - absolutely we are all "energy" - however, that said - I somehow don't think that means whatever the hell you think it means.. which I suspect is something "magic" because I'm guessing you didn't take physics?

       It started a long time before that. Acts like The Beatles and Led Zeppelin were doing it in the 60’s and 70’s.
