    <div class="md"><p>I have actually said this before in previous comments.  Either Q is a high level Washington insider working closely with Trump to bring down the swamp, or it&#39;s a LARP.  However, the LARP would consist of someone having better intelligence than just a normal person here in the U.S..  It&#39;s not some guy in his mom&#39;s basement watching the news and spinning it into fantasy.  If it is a LARP, then it&#39;s a much more sophisticated LARP than that.</p>

Any predictions you hear are from people interpreting his message and getting excited and throwing dates out there.  Q only made a couple of predictions very early in the LARP, as you would certainly call it, and those didn&#39;t pan out.   Otherwise there&#39;s been just been a lot of very weird coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stumbled upon this a few months ago. At first I was thoroughly intrigued, but as time went on I kinda lost interest. I will say that browsing the subs and threads that were dedicated to Q was very beneficial in a lot of ways. Mainly just educating me on the various players on the hill and the various connections. At the end of the day I came to the conclusion that Q was either a couple of kids who somehow had gotten access to Trump&#39;s twitter &quot;queue&quot; or some kind of marketing ploy to keep Trump&#39;s base engaged. Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A user on here the other day posted an interesting theory that &#39;Q&#39; is Brad Parscale, who was just named as Trump&#39;s 2020 campaign strategist: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/brad-parscale-campaign-manger-trump-2020/">https://www.wired.com/story/brad-parscale-campaign-manger-trump-2020/</a></p>

<p>The user reckoned part of Brad&#39;s job was to influence 4chan and study how meme&#39;s spread. He reckoned the whole &#39;question&#39; thing that Q does is to figure out what people WANT to be true (what most popular theories people come up with in response to the questions) and then to run that narrative. He&#39;s close enough to DT to be &#39;an insider&#39;; ie. get Trump to do things that &#39;legitimize&#39; Q as a &#39;real&#39; intelligence asset.</p>

<p>Frankly, it seemed like a pretty good theory. I was looking for the post the other day, but couldn&#39;t find it.
Wading through CBTS, it seems to make sense. For example, everyone&#39;s saying this video twitter denizens are calling to be released is some sort of pedo sex tape. Nothing about sex or pedophilia was mentioned in the Q post that idea seems to draw from, but people seemed to latch on to that for some reason. Like, people are posting shit like, &#39;the videos coming! It&#39;s a pedo sex tape&#39; with absolute certainty with absolutely no proof or evidence to support that.</p>

<p>I thought I had seen the heights of stupidity and delusion during the Iraq war, but somehow, America always manages to one-up itself.</p>
