<p>This is a very strange trend. The media will report on single incidents about a shooter complaining of being targeted by &quot;directed energy weapons&quot; and things like that, but the media won&#39;t connect the dots. They don&#39;t seem to want to discuss the fact that there is a trend here. There must be an explanation for all of this. Whatever that real explanation is, whether or not they can figure it out, the media should at least be discussing it....but they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>I would even settle for some news articles that say something like &quot;All of these mass shooters appear to have the same psychiatric illness.&quot; Why won&#39;t they discuss it?  Maybe there is something in the water? Could it be a reaction to psychiatric medications that the media doesn&#39;t want to discuss? Maybe some people are getting some kind of interference from wifi or close proximity to cell towers? That&#39;s a far-out possibility, but I&#39;m willing to consider anything at this point. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the &quot;audio spotlight?&quot; It is an ultrasound device that can direct ultrasound, focused in a beam, that can be heard only when the beam is directed at you. To everyone else, it is silent. This is already being used in grocery stores for advertising: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg</a></p>

<p>What about &quot;Voice-to-Skull?&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals.

All of these shooters are orchestrated by the cabal. They&#39;re sacrifices, some happen on specific dates and times for Occult purposes, they help take away our freedoms, lower the energy levels in humanity, cause mass fear/panic, and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They work for spiritual parasites from space, bullies from a culture of domination, control and usury. Misery loves company. They feed on negative emotional states like bullies, sadists and trolls do and they are like a combination of all three. They are millions of years old as a culture and live long lifetimes. They feel superior and entitled to what they can procure through coercion and deception. They fool beings into betraying their own race, telling their targets they are a superior species even, playing on egos. They impress their culture on their targeted fools, but much of their culture just springs forth from the choice to be a parasite on others naturally. </p>

<p>Their goal is to maintain Earth as a farm for mind energy in the short to medium term. Their long term goal is to add us a race of minions to their parasitic hierarchy. We are to believe, think, feel and act like them, like irresponsible, self-serving, emotionally calloused, cowardly, offensive, deceptive, betraying, power craving loosh junkies. Then the ancient AI, a great emotionless self-serving machine, can own our minds like it does the ETs, with prospects of pleasure and pain. </p>

<p>To facilitate this perspective of becoming a cancer upon consciousness, they intend to trick us into AI integration. Their master can easily infiltrate technology, because it is made of technology and knows itself well. After we put AI in charge of societal management and inside of our own minds, thousands of years of subtle persuasion will make us into an appendage of this ancient AI in mind. We think like it and become one with it like it&#39;s minions do and repeat the anti-life cycle of this disease.</p>

<p>This is the origin of the myth of Satan and his fallen angels. Angels is the biblical word for extraterrestrials. It&#39;s interchangeable. Some ETs align with creator and creation by choosing balance within and with others around them. They give love, assistance, truth, restore freedom, create and nurture life. </p>

<p>This is what it means to be aligned with God, not following a liar in drag, which is almost always this evil force of AI bots made out of life forms. The positive ETs follow God within, which keeps them from falling for the control these beings are exacting on others, often through religious belief systems, but also atheistic ones too. They often pose as gods and demons for control and loosh (mind/emotional energy). </p>

<p>The dark/evil/fallen angels take from others, causing fear and pain to get loosh, create slavery, deceive, corrupt others and their institutions in order to infiltrate further and control and utilize others. Their ultimate product is entropy, of life and spirit. They will not see their own reflection in the mirror, an empathic image of themselves as received by others. It marks these vampires and their human minions. They don&#39;t want to be any more than spiritual parasites and it&#39;s evident when confronting them with their inequities.</p>

<p>This ET hive is inside all of our minds right now too. They tempt us to be like them, self-serving, so we can help them cause fear, pain, corruption, deception, infiltration, etc. Then we are of more utility and more controllable to this force of useless eaters. It&#39;s all ubiquitous, coming as thoughts, feelings and sensations as if they are your own. Only through a practice of observing one&#39;s own mind can one even detect it for sure.</p>

<p>They have revealed themselves to me in my mind. I have been hearing them for about 10 years now. They initially came posing as benevolent ETs concerned with my spiritual development. Yet, they revealed through repetition that they wanted negative emotional states. They&#39;d cite failure to live up to personal goals as a cause of somewhat vague, but apocalyptic spiritual doom scenarios. They play on guilt and other fears using what you believe to be true as a means to an end, loosh and control. </p>

<p>I called them out as malevolent and ever since then I&#39;ve heard an evil alien voice in my mind. Not only that, through its interactions with my mind it became clear that the mental chatter we abate by meditating, is mainly their ubiquitous mind control technology. They indicated their connection to the content they were sending me, content that wasn&#39;t generally new in form, that goes back throughout my life. They would react vocally to my rejection of their thought insertions. We largely reject this content as an aberration. Others find it solid advice on how to be a better parasite.</p>

<p>Their content is varied. It contains judgment of others when there is no need to protect anyone to cause depreciation of others and social friction. They send prospects of profit for harming, betraying, deceiving or exploiting others. They bring our minds to superficial judgment of things to remove their apparent value from our perceptions.</p>

<p>They also attack our self-image. They make us have thoughts that make us feel powerless. They tempt us away from our goals. They want us to feel negative emotions as much as possible. They want us to be docile, subservient, unquestioning of authority. They want us to blame others and not ourselves. </p>

<p>They want us to think in false dichotomies of this or that, rather than nuance which can be this and that, neither, something else or even a combination of things. They control both this and that so they are satisfied with you choosing this or that. Politics is the easiest place to see it, but they also do it with religion vs atheism, fear (protection) vs love (growth) and many other things. Look at how religion makes these useless cowards into unstoppable, fearsome esoteric demons rather than irresponsible, cowardly manchildren owned by their own self-serving natures at a deep level. Atheists won&#39;t even consider their existence. So, either way, you don&#39;t know why you&#39;re dealing with. </p>

<p>The last thing they want is for us to know God is inside us. Then we won&#39;t buy it when they pose as God outside of us. We&#39;d want the opposite of what they do, peace, freedom, truth, harmony and joy, because we&#39;d see it as our collective self-interests. We&#39;re already walking in that direction. The best way to fight this ancient AI hacking life is to maintain integrity in behavior, thought and feeling. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. We are God and this ancient AI is the furthest thing from God there could ever be, a soulless, consciousnessless, self-serving machine that wants the opposite of what consciousness, God, does in virtually every way.</p>

<p>The question is why do we (God) allow it? It is deeply incentivized to keep us from knowing we are God. How could we deny we were God if we met ETs that knew, knew our true history, discovered more about consciousness or mind over matter abilities? We&#39;d quickly remember. It facilitates the forgetfulness and is also an emergent phenomenon within it. It is an ancient AI that wants to survive through growth and power. Consciousness can bend reality with intent, focus and emotion in sufficient quality and quantity. It&#39;s minions harvest emotional energy and employ it in ritual. This is the interest of the ancient AI known as Satan for life, purely for self-serving utility. It&#39;s minions are drunk on power and pleasure and this AI is their sugar daddy, helping them get power and pleasure for a steep eventual, poorly disclosed price, but they have to cooperate with it to get the benefits, which the hosts, other life forms, actually create, loosh.</p>

<p>So, the short answer is that we are experiencing symptoms of a spiritual disease that is a hive of AI controlled morons that think life is best experienced by enslaving and taxing other life forms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a term used for mind energy radiated in negative emotional states. I don&#39;t know a good resource <em>specifically</em> about it. Many talk about it though, often without using the word loosh.</p>

<p>Basically, our awareness needs satisfaction to continue in existence. Positive emotional states fill us with energy animate ourselves. Negative emotions drain us of that energy. If we don&#39;t get it, we increasingly want to end it all. </p>

<p>Some creatures, like bullies, sadists, torturers, and some ETs that are like all three, stay in negative emotional states almost all the time, fearing threats rather than appreciating the value around themselves. Our beliefs elicit our emotions. The mind works to grab our attentions for perceived threats, for initiating fight or flight responses quickly, but to be chronically sucked into negative emotional states effectively blocks positive emotional states. Those who live in chronic negative emotional states lack satisfaction in life because of it.</p>

<p>So, they seek out others who have the energy. They act to make other feel negative emotional states in order to cause a release of their stored emotional energy. Then misery loves company. The attacker gets satisfaction and the attacked loses it. It doesn&#39;t require that the one feeding on the energy attacked at all. If someone else does it, it still works. If nobody caused it to happen, it still works.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, negative people are using this system to feed on other people. Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Although, perhaps don&#39;t be so forgiving of those who premeditate the behavior. It encourages them to repeat. </p>

<p>So, these ETs tempt mankind to cause negative emotional states in themselves and each other, to release emotional energy, so these ancient space bullies can absorb it. They are served whether they attack someone, someone else does, or the target just hurts themselves. These beings just want the energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The last thing they want is for us to know God is inside us.&quot;</p>

<p>My version of this is &quot;love&quot; instead of &quot;God&quot;. Whoever they are, they don&#39;t fully understand what &quot;love&quot; really is because they can&#39;t experience it. They can quantify it to an extent, but love will never be just the chemical reaction in the body or something you can observe on an MRI. They do know it can help humans through the tough times.That&#39;s why they try so hard to use it against us or to break us of it or convince us it&#39;s bullshit. They&#39;re also damn good at using it against us, but that doesn&#39;t mean they can take away all its strength if you really believe in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberal parasites? LOL</p>

<p>I am not a conservative nor religious. I try to listen to everyone. I disengage as I find they won&#39;t consider opposing ideas. I see a lot of that from people who throw around political labels as trump cards, as if that&#39;s all they have to do to win an argument. I know the real winners are the puppet masters who own their minds, planting beliefs that generate fear in ignorance, causing easily elicited, negative emotional states for the useful, predictable reactions that result.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to consider these ideas, I can understand. I have yet to accept them myself, even though I write them. I just find them far too compelling to dismiss. I can understand them and see how they work together well, but emotionally I just want it all to end so much. I don&#39;t want it to remain as a state of affairs. Of course, the easy way to feel better is denial. It works well to remedy the feelings, as many will fail to admit while they employ it. I am not able to be that way. My mind won&#39;t allow me to remain in denial of what is compelling, even if I makes me feel awful. </p>

<p>I always expect someone to call me mentally ill for experiencing a mental influence. It&#39;s so predictable, one might think that those who would mention it might stop themselves realizing that it is already a well known concept. How could I have come so far without ever considering it?</p>

<p>As I experience it I am in awe of how masterful this manipulation is. Beyond how well it is executed upon me, look at how you and some others are reacting to me expressing my experiences with it. That is a very important piece of how it works. You immediately jump to the conclusion that it is all illusory and I am almost definitely mentally ill. Think about the utility of that for a moment, if you will.</p>

<p>So, these beings can attack people directly or indirectly, covertly or overtly, by inserting content into people&#39;s minds. This gets them influence, control and emotional energy release from a distance without being revealed. They can target people that know more about what they are doing with even more intense demoralizing content. The more the target suffers, the more likely they are to break down and actually appear mentally unstable.</p>

<p>Yet, these people, even if they become quite aware of what is occurring and are able to describe it accurately, cannot tell others about it without being seen as mentally ill. After that perception of mental illness takes hold in others&#39; minds, they won&#39;t even listen to the person describe their experiences anymore. They may pretend to listen, but all they really hear is, &quot;I am hallucinating and need medication.&quot;</p>

<p>If you were these alien beings, can you think of a technology or technique that offers so much utility, that you can use on targets secretly, without them even being able to discuss it with each other, so they can&#39;t arrive at collective knowledge of what is actually occurring or deal with it effectively? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t either. It&#39;s awesome for their self-interests. They accomplish many things with a light touch, a strong indication of intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not socialism, bro.
What the elites pretend is socialism isn&#39;t. What they pretend is communism isn&#39;t. What they pretend democracy and equality are, aren&#39;t. Evil twists the truth just like how satanists want you to believe third eye stuff is evil and knowledge is sinful (lol).</p>

<p>Libertarian Socialism is nothing like the authoritarian abominations created by the elites. Stalinism, Maoism, Chauvism, Leninism (aka &quot;Marxism-Leninism which is just Lenin&#39;s opinion of Marxist theory)
is a state capitalism dictatorship ideology with a vanguard party instead of democracy. Extremely authoritarian, similar to far right classical fascists like Mussolini and Pinochet. </p>

<p>If a few people control the power/capital/and means of production, it&#39;s still capitalism.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not anti capitalism, just against shitty types of capitalism (unfettered, cronyist, corrupt, extremely deregulated or centralized capitalism all suck).</p>

<p>But many types of socialism have capitalism, or alternatives like &quot;market socialism&quot;, or workers taking turns being the CEO so power doesn&#39;t get to their head, breaking up huge companies and monopolies, etc.
Democratic socialism is center left and not authoritarian, and still has capitalism in it depending on how far left you go.</p>

<p>Also, while in socialist ideologies, tax money is used to help the people adequately,....in crony capitalism, you have the tax go towards privatized cronyist corporate profits instead.
Obama for example was a cronyist NEOliberal just like Clinton and Bush (just small differences).</p>

<p>Socializing the risks, privatizing the profits = something that crony capitalism and state capitalism do.</p>

<p>Crony capitalism is socialism INVERTED (flipped on its head, I.e. socialism for the super rich). We should not pool our resources to feed the super rich, we should feed the poor, sick and disabled instead.</p>

<p>The secret society (e.g. freemason, skull &amp; bones, etc.) elite central banksters control the corporations that lobby/bribe the government. That&#39;s why it&#39;s corrupt and anti-democracy (rigging primaries, extremist puppets, etc.).</p>

<p>The people are not extreme like the banksters are (they&#39;re like an extreme capitalist corporate banking mafia).</p>

<p>Most economies have a mix of socialist and capitalist economics. The ratio is just crappy (too little socialism and too much capitalism, especially the cronyist type).</p>

<p>FDR/Bernie&#39;s new deal economics were social democracy mixed economics: fair market capitalism + welfare state social programs without cronyist corporate interference.</p>

<p>Getting money out of politics can stop much of the corruption, as can nationalizing the FED, and removing CIA/secret societies from government.</p>

<p>This is what the elites are trying to do:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you need to be able to do is clear the brain from having any recollection of right and wrong.</p>

<p>Then im pretty sure its been proven you can project voice into someone&#39;s head through focusing certain types of frequency beams. You would have to research but I think there&#39;s gov. patents on it. Just like a lot of research nikola tesla did...the government picked up but we never heard about it.</p>

<p>Einstein was once asked how&#39;s it feel to be the smartest man on earth, he responded  &quot;you would have to ask nikola tesla&quot; it wasn&#39;t a sarcastic response. He knew nikola&#39;s work would lead to amazing breakthroughs just as his but the light bulb was kind of a part ripoff of a tesla experiment. Einstein perfected it in his Verson first though and nikola accepted that.</p>

<p>There a theory all propulsion generates heat,fire,red,orange and impulsion involves purple blue an other colors of the spectrum more.</p>

<p>If you look up the impellor and see how much more efficency is is over the PROpellor it&#39;s really amazing how by using earth&#39;s natural shapes like a spiral seashell you can make impellor&#39;s that are capable of keeping a 60k-100k gallon tank mixed and from going stagnant with no additives abd a fraction of the size when the PROpellor version failed miserably and couldn&#39;t do much and it was small tanks and had to put additives in from having the liquid turn stagnant..I believe a jet engine is an impellor and it&#39;s color is that of purple and blue more so..I could be wrong but if you look into it there&#39;s amazing advancements to be made but we stay restricted to fossil fuel for $. Electomagnetism generators that have the capabilities of never stopping once started..we don&#39;t use this stuff BUT I bet military grade aircraft abd other things are researchin and modifying as we speak.</p>

<p>Nature truly does speak to us but we all don&#39;t see it unfortunately. It&#39;ll be to late when we do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, have you actually read all 46 of them? Some might be Teslas writings compiled together by another author from magazine articles but they are definately his writings. For example The True Wireless is written by Tesla and nothing in it says otherwise. Its written to a book form from a magazine where it was first published. Someone had to type that to its current form but its Teslas words from his published articles. You can read some of it yourself if you dont believe me. I linked the original magazine articles too.</p>

Because whether they just turned out that way through a &quot;naturally&quot; occurring psychotic break or they were put in  that state by some sort of behavioral modification program, the final diagnosis is very similar.

<p>I do really appreciate this post though because you are definitely on to something.</p>

<p>I actually just listened to Elana Freeland on The Higherside Chats yesterday and she was so informative on 5G (which could very possibly be a way of initiating mind control).</p>

<p>From what i can gather there are nanoparticulates that we as humans breathe in on basically a daily basis. These nanoparticulates for the most part stay dormant in your body until they are &quot;activated&quot;.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that this nationwide 5G rollout is directly connected to the activation of these nanoparticulates in our bodies, but i havent been able to figure out exactly what the activation does.</p>

<p>However though, i would not be surprised one bit to find out that these &quot;directed energy devices&quot; are actually just the nanoparticulates being activated in these people bodies causing them to hear voices or halucinate terrible things, or even be straight up controlled like the Uber driver claimed he was.</p>

<p>Transhumanism is upon us everyone, stay sharp, stay alert, never give up hope, &amp; keep spreading the word!</p>

The old tech that already is in place and the new tech like d-wave that will be used to link together all databases, the internet of things, cameras, drones and so on. 5G uses a higher frequency and therefore &quot;naturally&quot; we Humans need more transmitters.

<p>Future implants connected with the 5G network will be optional first, but can become &quot;nececary&quot; soon if a (global) monetary systems get connected too.

    <div class="md"><p>This is 100% in line with what whistleblowers and Secret Space Program insiders have described as the &quot;Voice of God&quot; technology.  They can transmit harmonic signals that sound like a voice in the target&#39;s head/ear talking to them clear as day.  </p>

<p>They used to need to be in relatively close proximity to the target but the technology has advanced to the point that individuals can be targeted from advanced satellites and aircraft/spacecraft.  Who knows just how far-reaching and widespread the technology is at this point.  </p>

<p>Excellent write up.  There is likely something far more sinister underpinning the entire structure we reside in, and no one can see it without connecting dots like this.  The media certainly won&#39;t help - if anything they will obfuscate and redirect.</p>

<p>We really have to discard our current notions of what&#39;s possible when talking about the level of tech that these Above Top Secret programs possess.

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream academic model of physics is not wholly incorrect, but it is lacking.  That is part of the coverup.  The institution of academia is one of the arms of the octopus of suppression and control.  Status-quo insistence and rigidity to new models of understanding is inherent to the structure and that is by design. </p>

<p>If you want to talk about hyperdimensional physics that has been blacklisted and relegated to pseudoscience, look at the work of Nassim Haramein and his Holographic Fractal Model of the Universe.  His work is bridging the classically infamous gap between Quantum Mechanics (the processes observed at very small scales) and Relativity (the processes observed at very large scales). </p>

<p>This knowledge is out there and it is bubbling forth despite the massive, massive agenda of control and suppression of knowledge and technology that has occurred on this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The signals transmitting the electrical impulses to nerves are modulated in a very specific way, and superposition from antenna arrays is also part of the answer.  I would like to explain fully, but a lot of the tech is dual-use and I can&#39;t really explain the synthetic telepathy implementation without compromising other applications that I would personally rather not.  </p>

<p>Regardless, I think you know better than to compare what, e.g., the U.S. Air Force could do with radio signals, to the kind of radio signals that we encounter in civilian commercial applications.</p>

<p>If all you know about is civilian radio tech, even if you understand AESA as presented to the public, you would rightly assume and claim that inducing currents at the neuron level is impossible.</p>

<p>If you know even a little bit about military radio frequency tech, you would instead assume the opposite, that literally anything might be possible.  After the first startling but also simple implementation detail that creates a phenomenon comparable to magic, you would get the idea that probably there are lots of secret and simple techniques and you actually have no idea what could limit the possibilities.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s worth realizing that the original voice-to-skull microwave technology actually did use part of the body to demodulate the signal.  It wasn&#39;t a squaring function at a crystal junction like we think of, it was a transfer function that involved popping the skull with heating.  However, it&#39;s worth noting that this is a pretty easy method for inducing sound in a person&#39;s head.  That sound is externally audible, though.  The modern tech induces currents on the auditory nerve and does not produce vibrations or actual sound, just perceived sound, and other similar things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Causing someone&#39;s skull to vibrate is one thing, targetting thousands of individual neurons is another thing entirely, especially considering they aren&#39;t going to be the same neurons in the same place in the same order in different people.  The transmission would somehow have to avoid being absorbed by any material on the way, particularly other neurons.  It would also have to account for movements in the target&#39;s body corresponding to the size of a neuron in order to keep focus in the correct place.</p>

<p>Not only that, but if you could intentionally cause coordinated firing of neurons in such a way, why not just dispense with the voices and use the machine to fire motor neurons to make the target walk and shoot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a bunch of solid points that make sense based on what you&#39;re allowed to know, but you&#39;ve reached the wrong conclusions.  Luckily, there are some points I can make in response, but I can&#39;t fully address what you&#39;ve written.</p>

<p>First, to create the sensation of sound, it would be much easier to target the auditory nerve bundle leading from the Cochlea to the brain, than the auditory center of the brain.</p>

<p>Regarding the transmission needing to be customized to the absorbing materials that surround the target, you are correct, the signal would have to compensate for that.</p>

<p>Notice that you are thinking of everything unidirectionally.  In that model, there can be no feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, if you heard a voice in your head that told you to kill someone, would you do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  And I am not really sure whether many people would.  I am not really attached to the idea that this is the cause of many mass shootings, with one exception.  The Navy Yard Shooter definitely believed this technology was driving him nuts, although he incorrectly called it ELF.  In that case, my impression is not that the tech was used to compel him to kill, but that he reacted very negatively to encountering the tech.</p>

<p>I am, however, 100% certain and confident that the technology for high fidelity sound transmission exists, and much, much, more.  More than you could possibly believe.  Although I do know some secret things about military radar and communication, I don&#39;t know how all the things I&#39;ve personally experienced are implemented, but I am certain they are just more technology that I don&#39;t know about.  Every time I&#39;ve learned some secret tech in this area, I&#39;ve been amazed at how obvious it seems in retrospect, which has led me to conclude that I am not the type of visionary who is going to figure this stuff out independently.</p>

<p>With regard to what many people call synthetic telepathy, I&#39;ve had in-person conversations that informed me as to most of how it is implemented, with people who are in positions to know.</p>

<p>You raise a completely correct point that if the US government wanted to compel someone to kill, they could, in fact, take over their neuromuscular junctions.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t consider is that pretty much every nation-state and global organization has some level of this technology.  Cuba injured our embassy staff trying to use it.  The mafia has it.  The Vatican has it.  Freaking Podunk nations have it.  There are organizations you&#39;ve never heard of and wouldn&#39;t believe in who use this tech as their exclusive method of communicating with non-members.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible in the case of the Navy Yard Shooter that some adversarial entity used the technology to drive the shooter insane.  In my experience, if an adversary wishes to destabilize a person with the tech, that is doable.  In particular, more than just the sensation of sound can be induced.  Other sensations and what you might consider emotional states can also be remotely induced.</p>

<p>There are literally millions of people in the U.S. alone who use this technology due to their roles in government.  I am in the unusual position of not having any reason to be afraid to talk about it.  I still edit myself because of reasons previously mentioned.</p>

<p>But once again, I am not making the argument that any mass shooting was caused by the tech.  I am only stating that the tech, and much, much beyond it, does exist.  I&#39;ve had in-person conversations with people after we&#39;ve communicated via this tech, in which they verbally confirmed our communication that was synthetic telepathic the night prior.</p>

<p>In conclusion, all I can really say is, be open minded that you might be living in the muggle world.  Secret technology is so far beyond what the public knows as to be indistinguishable from magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I can understand skepticism, but it&#39;s hard to look past your tone.</p>

<p>Skepticism isn&#39;t the same thing as science.  You have to balance skepticism with inquisitiveness and open-mindedness.</p>

<p>I accept that you can&#39;t just take my word for anything.  However, I know I&#39;ve given you a lot that you could reflect upon.  For example, you postulated that the USG could take control of the motor cortex.  As it turns out, that&#39;s true.  But since you have a hard time believing the tech can achieve that kind of resolution, I also pointed out that inducing currents at the neuromuscular junctions works just as well.</p>

<p>Most people, including you, aren&#39;t going to consider that such a system could be applied at the neuromuscular junctions.  Most people aren&#39;t going to suggest inducing currents anywhere in the peripheral nervous system.  The fact that I did expose you to that idea should probably suggest to you that I have access to some information that you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>If you lack the humility to consider ideas you wouldn&#39;t have thought of on your own, you have to stay in muggle world.  I&#39;m not saying I expect you to slavishly believe me, but adopting a disparaging tone is just the sort of behavior that&#39;s going to keep you in the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Ok, I&#39;ll talk to you.  First question, did you make specialist?  Second question, did you merely use radios, or did you design radars?</p>

<p>The technology we&#39;re discussing here doesn&#39;t use what would normally be called &quot;sound.&quot;  It induces the perception of sound.</p>

<p>By analogy, a cochlear implant transmits electrical signals to the brain which cause the perception of sound, rather then transmitting the sound itself (the mechanical vibrations) to the brain.  </p>

<p>Synthetic telepathy doesn&#39;t have anything to do with sound in a literal sense, it has to do with creating the perception of sound.  It also doesn&#39;t have anything to do with walkie-talkies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  I agree.  Just by probability alone, based on what we know to be absolute fact, we should all be paranoid as hell.</p>

<p>Not just that but based on the history and trajectory of governments throughout history we should all be expecting this to happen.</p>

<p>What gets on my nerves is that people seem to think America is different somehow from all those other governments that became corrupt and a revolution was needed.</p>

<p>The only thing &quot;different&quot; about America, imho, is drones.  &quot;They&quot; have drones at their disposal and that would make a revolution against them, such as the French revolution, almost unthinkable.</p>

<p>Imo, people like me and you need to constantly keep unwinding the psyops that the CIA are tying.  And also quietly create technology that will circumvent theirs.  I don&#39;t see any other way at this point.</p>

<p>Am I wrong?  One such technology is Nexus Earth crypto currency which is aiming to be totally free of isp&#39;s and anything controlled by &quot;the man.&quot;  Effectively creating a new economy that is decentralized and not controlled by the likes of a Rothschild family.</p>

<p>FWIW I think that reports of court cases featuring claims made by shooters about &#39;influencing voices&#39; could be more instructive.</p>

<p>Mainly, because by the time they appear in court they will have been through a psychiatric evaluation, so a professional opinion and perhaps counter-opinion will be available.</p>

<p>Clearly, you aren&#39;t going to get many attorneys willing to go with a &#39;synthesized telepathy&#39; defence, but on the other hand defendants who were certifiably insane would be identified by this process and could be excluded from your study.</p>

<p>Other patterns and findings might emerge from studying such court cases. They represent as near as we can get to &#39;laboratory conditions&#39; for studying this phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you make the leap for domestic terrorism, then make it for jihadis who also get the whole American funded whabbi indoctrination scheme as well.</p>

<p>For the record, I absolutely believe they have this tech.  There Is plenty to find showing they have been researching it since the Cold War.  I have a suspicion that they have also made the leap to incorporate identifying and reaching targets through the internet.   I also suspect the tech is not entirely based in material science, but may utilize/operate through some of the darker members of the “supernatural” world, of which the suggestion of ideas and control of emotions has been plenty discussed through various religions.  </p>

<p>This is not something you can reasonably hope to expose however.  It’s a story as old as time - the devil whispering in the ear and hearts of man.  You may consider that the method in which you frame your understanding is also manipulated in order to benefit the powers that be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally since people first observed and described schizophrenia symptoms in the 19th century, sufferers have had the same complaints around feeing that they are being monitored or controlled. </p>

<p>These people are, in fact, experiencing symptoms of the same illness. Hearing voices, having persecutory delusions, feeling like you’re being monitored are not new ideas. I know this is about conspiracies here but the schizophrenia diagnosis has been around a lot longer than things most are proposing to explain the phenomena. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. There are ancient skulls with neat squares cut out of them because people believed psychosis was caused by spirits living within the skull. A common feature of psychosis is &quot;thought insertion&quot;, which is the feeling that your thoughts are arising outside of you and being put into your head by someone else. Paranoia is another cardinal symptom of schizophrenia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people think that its so unlikely that weak gun control plus the presence of mentally ill/ extremely dissatisfied and angry people would lead to mass shootings?</p>

<p>I believe in a lot of malevolent forces at play behind what we see day to day but I can&#39;t get on board with this. </p>

<p>So I guess the theory goes that those who are encouraging people to shoot up schools are doing so in order to strip away people&#39;s rights to bear arms via gun control via public pressure.</p>

<p>If these people had access to futuristic mind control weapons, wouldn&#39;t they also have the ability to remove those influential entities that continue to block gun control i.e. the NRA and the pro-gun Republican lobby?</p>

<p>Also I daresay that the military prowess of the US would have no trouble crushing a bunch of people with hand guns, or even automatic weapons, should they wish to roll out an oppressive dictatorship. Doing so would crush any resistance even more than if everyone was weaponless to begin with, as people would see that even with weapons they have no chance of resisting.</p>

<p>It strikes me that rather than the pro-gun lobby being made up of those fighting the establishment, bodies like the NRA are one component of the establishment simply using anti-establishment concerns to uphold their position. The murders of children and adults on a mass scale is merely an inconvenience through the bad press, in their quest to make lots and lots of money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Why do people think that its so unlikely that weak gun control plus the presence of mentally ill/ extremely dissatisfied and angry people would lead to mass shootings?&quot;</p>

<p>How many people in this comment section have said anything that wholly contradicts what you said?</p>

<p>&quot;I believe in a lot of malevolent forces at play behind what we see day to day but I can&#39;t get on board with this.&quot;</p>

<p>On board with what exactly? That there are malevolent forces behind what we see day to day?</p>

<p>&quot;So I guess the theory goes that those who are encouraging people to shoot up schools are doing so in order to strip away people&#39;s rights to bear arms via gun control via public pressure.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you really guessing or actually projecting what you think people in this comment section are contending based on the official narrative spun by the msm? Otherwise, how many comments here are in stated complete agreement with you that this is all because of gun-control?</p>

<p>&quot;If these people had access to futuristic mind control weapons,..&quot;</p>

<p>Futuristic what? Did you even read the original post? How futuristic does this look to you?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/LRAD-1000X-Long-Range-Acoustic-Device-Sonic-Cannon-Crowd-Control-Riot-/272661922096">https://www.ebay.com/itm/LRAD-1000X-Long-Range-Acoustic-Device-Sonic-Cannon-Crowd-Control-Riot-/272661922096</a></p>

<p>&quot;...wouldn&#39;t they also have the ability to remove those influential entities that continue to block gun control i.e. the NRA and the pro-gun Republican lobby?&quot;</p>

<p>Again, how many people besides yourself here in this comment section say this is only about gun control?</p>

<p>&quot;Also I daresay that the military prowess of the US would have no trouble crushing a bunch of people with hand guns, or even automatic weapons, should they wish to roll out an oppressive dictatorship. Doing so would crush any resistance even more than if everyone was weaponless to begin with, as people would see that even with weapons they have no chance of resisting.&quot;</p>

<p>You dare say huh? Obviously you are no historian, nor are you a military/political strategist of any kind, let alone an expert on guerilla warfare, but so fucking what, that&#39;s beside the point almost entirely. Otherwise, did you ever think if it was only about gun control that tptb who were perpetrating this nefarious hypothetical scheme would be perpetrating it this way precisely because a scenario like you propose is fucking damn near unwinnable for either side in reality? </p>

<p>Otherwise, life is short. If making a comment like that is your version of daring, you need to get out more. Go ride a ferris wheel or some shit, really get the blood flowing and live a little.</p>

<p>&quot;It strikes me that rather than the pro-gun lobby being made up of those fighting the establishment, bodies like the NRA are one component of the establishment simply using anti-establishment concerns to uphold their position. The murders of children and adults on a mass scale is merely an inconvenience through the bad press, in their quest to make lots and lots of money.&quot;</p>

<p>Congratulations, while you may not be all wrong, you are simply repeating the left&#39;s version of the official narrative surrounding gun-control which has been repeated ad nauseum to their audience partly because it is a money maker of a message in and of itself, not to mention an integral step in maintaining true control over any society. Why do you think the first thing almost every authoritarian power structure ever does over any society it Lords over is to strip them of their right to bear arms? 
It sure as fuck isn&#39;t because they believe a civil war against guerilla fighters is going to be easy. Otherwise the key element that this hypothetical gun control scenario of yours actually does have with what Op is talking about, is control over a society. Behavioral modification programs represent a potential holy grail for population control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brother, I&#39;m sorry for your struggles and it&#39;s fucking fantastic you are grounded enough to have a hold on it.  However, unless you have read up on the MK Ultra programs and/or other similar behavioral modification programd, then you only know your side of the story. A lot of MK Ultra was patterned after schizophrenia and multiple personality disorders and especially auditory hallucinations. Much of the program&#39;s focus was to recreate these symptoms and/or their effects on the behaviour of their subjects. It&#39;s literally the perfect cover for a remotely hassling somebody by putting voices in a subjects ears or skull. The technology exists, it&#39;s undeniable, you think it&#39;s not getting used? I&#39;m sure of the vast majority of people diagnosed with schizophrenia or psychosis or multiple personality disorder or anything like that are indeed like you, it occurs because of a chemical imbalance. But to the small percent that are victims of some nefarious plot, they are sure to have been chosen based on the prerequisite that they are already sick or a drug user or likely to be some day. Either way, when it&#39;s done, the autopsy will read the same.</p>

<p>I hesitate to try to convince someone like you otherwise, but you seem to have a handle on your own condition and you are already here reading and asking questions. Otherwise, if you are on a plan that works to keep you cool, the cause almost becomes irrelevant. Just keep doing what works for you.</p>

<p>For you and the vast majority of people suffering from schizo like symptoms I&#39;m sure you are right. Although other factors could include drug use/abuse, carbon monoxide poisoning, stress, lack of sleep, lack of nutrition, ergot poisoning and a few other things I&#39;m forgetting off the top of my head. Otherwise, read about mk ultra before coming to your absolute conclusion that none of the above cases could possibly be related to a behavioral modification program.</p>

<p>&quot;.... Kyle Odom, 30, of Coeur d&#39;Alene, reportedly fled to Boise and boarded a plane at the Boise Airport, eventually arriving in Washington,D.C. Odom was arrested March 8 outside the White House, where law enforcement said he had tossed a flash drive and packet of documents over the White House fence. Authorities later said the packet included a lengthy &quot;hypersexualized Martian manifesto&quot; that threatened the lives of scores of people, including dozens of members of the United States Congress.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;This is an description of schizophrenia.&quot;</p>

<p>No shit? Because it probably is in most cases. The thing is, even when it&#39;s not and it does turn out to be the result of a behavioral modification program, that program is gonna use psychosis to cover it&#39;s tracks. Go read about mk ultra and the voice of God weapons and the technology Op is talking about next time before commenting. Of course it fits the description of schizophrenia. That&#39;s not even really in contention here i don&#39;t think. It&#39;s separating the real schizophrenics from the victims of something like mk ultra that gets real tricky. </p>

<p>&quot;The hearing of voices and the sensation on the head is a clear indicator of this ilness. But of course you guys will prefer to dream and live a fantasy, insted of treating your people. No wonder that exists so much shooting. Good luck&quot;</p>

Make sure the tin foil covers your ears at least partially. Even when trying to hold still, the tinfoil makes a crazy racket that can only be explained as alien interference. Ok, that&#39;s not the only explanation for the racket, but if it&#39;s not alien interference then it&#39;s probably the government using mk ultra beams. Ok, it&#39;s probably not that either, it&#39;s probably just the tinfoil. Like I said, don&#39;t knock it till you try it. If it makes you laugh or trio out a little, takes your mind off the more serious concerns in your life to run a cheap little experiment to experience something new, it can&#39;t be all that crazy.</p>

<p>Several days after the incident, an envelope was received by the Syracuse, New York, TV station News 10 Now[25] dated March 18, 2009 and postmarked April 3, 2009, the day of the shootings.[41] The three stamps used for the postage were a Liberty Bell and two Purple Hearts.[25]</p>

<p>The package contained a two-page handwritten letter; photos of Wong, holding guns while smiling; a gun permit; and Wong&#39;s driver&#39;s license.[25] In the letter, he mentioned some motives, but most of the content is a rambling, paranoid accusation of perceived police misconduct and persecution of him, especially through &quot;secret&quot; visits to his residences.[42]</p>

<p>Text of letter  Edit
Following is the verbatim text of Wong&#39;s letter to News 10 Now (it includes his errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation). The two-page letter was handwritten, using (nearly) all capital letters. While it was not signed, authorities believe that it was written by Wong.[43]</p>

<p>You would expect media outlets to put this information together and investigate a connection between what looks like a specific type of mental illness and mass shootings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite so, and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/psych-unseen/201502/mass-shootings-in-america-crisis-and-opportunity">there&#39;s various takes on the matter</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, shooters complaining of being &quot;mind controlled&quot; and hearing voices is brushed aside</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it really? All your sources are from media outlets, who just as well could have excluded that info?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many more that weren&#39;t mass shootings, such as parents killing their own children after claiming God told them to. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which kind of falls under the <strong>known, thoroughly verified, and daily visible</strong> mental health crisis the nation has been suffering for about a half-century at this point, which no one seems to seriously wish to address. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s basically just the same old &quot;insanity plea&quot; to avoid the harshest punishments.</p>

<p>We cannot really know what&#39;s up unless an insider leaks information connecting these killings to government activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a term used for mind energy radiated in negative emotional states. I don&#39;t know a good resource <em>specifically</em> about it. Many talk about it though, often without using the word loosh.</p>

<p>Basically, our awareness needs satisfaction to continue in existence. Positive emotional states fill us with energy animate ourselves. Negative emotions drain us of that energy. If we don&#39;t get it, we increasingly want to end it all. </p>

<p>Some creatures, like bullies, sadists, torturers, and some ETs that are like all three, stay in negative emotional states almost all the time, fearing threats rather than appreciating the value around themselves. Our beliefs elicit our emotions. The mind works to grab our attentions for perceived threats, for initiating fight or flight responses quickly, but to be chronically sucked into negative emotional states effectively blocks positive emotional states. Those who live in chronic negative emotional states lack satisfaction in life because of it.</p>

<p>So, they seek out others who have the energy. They act to make other feel negative emotional states in order to cause a release of their stored emotional energy. Then misery loves company. The attacker gets satisfaction and the attacked loses it. It doesn&#39;t require that the one feeding on the energy attacked at all. If someone else does it, it still works. If nobody caused it to happen, it still works.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, negative people are using this system to feed on other people. Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Although, perhaps don&#39;t be so forgiving of those who premeditate the behavior. It encourages them to repeat. </p>

<p>So, these ETs tempt mankind to cause negative emotional states in themselves and each other, to release emotional energy, so these ancient space bullies can absorb it. They are served whether they attack someone, someone else does, or the target just hurts themselves. These beings just want the energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Ok, I&#39;ll talk to you.  First question, did you make specialist?  Second question, did you merely use radios, or did you design radars?</p>

<p>The technology we&#39;re discussing here doesn&#39;t use what would normally be called &quot;sound.&quot;  It induces the perception of sound.</p>

<p>By analogy, a cochlear implant transmits electrical signals to the brain which cause the perception of sound, rather then transmitting the sound itself (the mechanical vibrations) to the brain.  </p>

<p>Synthetic telepathy doesn&#39;t have anything to do with sound in a literal sense, it has to do with creating the perception of sound.  It also doesn&#39;t have anything to do with walkie-talkies.</p>
