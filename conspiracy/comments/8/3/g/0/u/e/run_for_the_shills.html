It’s just amazing people are still putting faith into the system by labeling themselves conservative and liberal ;and for a conspiracy sub , I’m rather bewildered as to how anyone can outright claim that their way of thinking is superior to the other . I just can’t help but think this is more of the “ divide and conquer “ techniques used by the TPTB to control our conversations , ultimately controlling the narrative . Alienating those with critical thinking , and enabling those who are too willing to be part of the republican/Democrat paradigm. </p>

<p>Do we have any evidence of this? I don&#39;t doubt shills exist, I think it would be naive to believe otherwise, but I&#39;ve been accused of being a shill for Monsanto, Clinton, vaccine manufacturers, the MSM. . .hell, if it were even half true I would be rich.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for me, it isn&#39;t, but all it has done is convinced me that the people who throw &quot;shill&quot; out in place of an argument aren&#39;t very bright and considering it seems that <em>every single post</em> inevitably contains someone being accused of being a shill, I have to agree with the OP that it is simply a tool used by the not-so-bright to avoid an actual debate.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen more than enough to be confident in my assessment, though I would encourage others to make up their own minds.  I&#39;ve been called a Russian troll for being critical of US foreign policy, so I get it when you suggest that the accusation may not always match the accused.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily.  As I hear these folks aren&#39;t paid all that much, and there are of course shills who do not receive direct compensation, yet argue a position based on their personal ties to X.</p>
