<p>Anthropological scholarship affirms Loyola was an ethnic, racial basque. There are zero scholarly sources which affirm him to have been a converso. </p>

<p>No need to pretend you have any whatsoever understanding of this topic. The Jesuits have been some of the foremost antisemites in history and persecuted Jews for 350 years ranging from the 1593 Decree de genere until 1946.</p>

<p>The key to all of this is that ALL societies/ religions have been attacked and subverted in this same way. I know that is hard to buy, but it is what has been going on and if you think about it, THAT is what makes it soooooo hard to figure out the truth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lev Leviev (born July 30, 1956) is an Israeli businessman, philanthropist and investor, of <strong>Uzbek Bukhari Jewish</strong> background, <strong>Known as the &quot;King of Diamonds&quot;.</strong> Lev Leviev has a net worth of $1.1 billion as of September 2016, and has been a <strong>major philanthropist for Hasidic Jewish causes in Eastern Europe and Israel</strong>. Beginning in the 1990s, Leviev avoided being directly involved with the Yeltsin family, and <strong>nurtured ties with Vladimir Putin.</strong> His diamond mining investments in Angola and his investments in Israeli settlements have been the target of protests. <strong>A prominent member of the Bukhari Jewish community, he is president of the World Congress of Bukharian Jews.</strong></p>

<p>Leviev owns diamond mines in Russia and Africa, and is a major competitor to the De Beers international diamond cartel.</p>

<p>Leviev is currently controlling shareholder and chairman of Africa-Israel. Africa-Israel is on the verge of insolvency, asking to restructure NIS <strong>21 billion of debt.</strong> Trying to save the company from bankruptcy, justice Varda Alshech has confirmed the debt-restructuring arrangement between Africa-Israel and its creditors. However, the justice expressed her disapproval: &quot;The arrangement is far from being the best,&quot; Alshech said, because the company &quot;is passing on the damage of its investments to its investors.&quot;</p>

<p>According to an article published in The Guardian on July 24, 2017, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner sealed real estate deal worth $295m with Lev Avnerovich Leviev&#39;s firm cited in money-laundering case. The ties between Trump family real estate deals and Russian money interests are attracting increasing interest from the justice department’s special counsel, Robert Muelleras he is investigating alleged Russia interference in the presidential election.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning more about this Lev Leviev guy I recommend this 30 min documentary, lays it all out </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvd7PqI_Lx0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvd7PqI_Lx0</a></p>

<p>Plus it exposes this shady Chinese company ran by unscrupulous investors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pa">the 88 Queensway group</a> a little about this 88 guy </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is unknown why Pa uses so many aliases. Attempts to research Pa&#39;s history prove inconclusive, which has led some to the belief that he is a &quot;princeling&quot; - the son of a well connected original Chinese communist revolutionary. Reports also list one of Pa&#39;s aliases as having a Russian military background  that spent time in Angola during the Angolan Civil War. It is believed that during Pa&#39;s time with the Russian military he first met the future Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a fucking rabbit hole. </p>

<p>But back to Leviev</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2016, Jona Reichberg, the former head of acquisitions for Leviev’s Africa Israel Investments, allegedly arranged to have NYPD officers provide Leviev a personal escort through the Lincoln Tunnel, shutting down a lane for the “King of Diamonds.”</p>

<p>There&#39;s this little nugget I didn&#39;t include because I knew it would be a downvote magnet</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lev Leviev is also directly connected to Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer for Prevezon Holdings that met Jared Kushner, Don Jr., and Paul Manafort at Trump Tower.</p>

<p>Africa-Israel was trying to receive money from Prevezon Holdings that Preet Baharara had determined came from a tax fraud scheme that lead to the death of Bill Browder&#39;s lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky of the Magnitsky Act.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/who-is-the-israeli-billionaire-with-ties-to-kushner-and-putin-1.5435007">https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/who-is-the-israeli-billionaire-with-ties-to-kushner-and-putin-1.5435007</a></p>

<p><strong>Trump ended up firing Preet Baharara and immediately settling the case with Prevezon.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will find an abundance of Jews among most vocal anti-totalitarians as well (L. von Mises, M. Rothbard, M. and D. Friedman, Ayn Rand, or even Ben Shapiro comes to mind) - it&#39;s their ideology what matters and focusing on people&#39;s nationality is exactly the sign of totalitarian diversion. Why the fuck some (lets admit that of Jewish origin) totalitarian, marxist fantasies are still being taken seriously, and not their critique by an another Jewish fellow Von Mises who in 1920s predicted that communism must inevitably fall is the question that should be answered - and just looking at the place of some people&#39;s origin here is a sign of confusion.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say afraid, but definitely reluctant, and I can see a reason too. It&#39;s most probably because the whole idea is a red herring.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that many crooks and large-scale scammers are of Jewish descent. It&#39;s also clear that a large number of them are motivated strongly by their ethnoreligious beliefs. </p>

<p>That does not in any way indicate that &quot;The Jews&quot; all think or act that way. It also doesn&#39;t mean in any way that group outsiders don&#39;t think or act that way. </p>

<p>To blame &quot;The Jews&quot; for the crimes and actions of some Jewish crooks as well as for the crimes and actions of non-Jewish crooks is misguided, incredibly dangerous, and ignorant of our larger history.</p>

<p>There are serious debates about belief and ideology that we should be having, and there is much to critique about Jewish ideas (or their interpretations) of exceptionalism, for sure. But it&#39;s certainly bigger than that. </p>

<p>We should equally critique many forms of exceptionalism and feigned superiority. We should critique untruth wherever it blossoms, and continue our work against crime and corruption no matter who perpetrates it. To single out an ethnic group that is internally as diverse as any other arbitrarily chosen group strikes me as utterly worthless, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not &quot;Jews&quot;, its <em>fake</em> Jews and people don&#39;t ever take the time to research things.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t hate a country because it&#39;s leaders are run by the rothchilds, place blame where blame is due. The reason they want to rebuild the temple is not for the Jewish people, it&#39;s because they see solomons temple as important to the occult as well(a king who later let his wives turn him to occultism and was said to be one of the wisest men that ever lived)...even the Bible says the antichrist will rule from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a stunningly good lecture by Gideon levy on Israel. He says that the indoctrination for the hatred of Palestinians is built into their DNA. It’s a societal probelen and you cannot even discuss it in most circles. If you do the Israelis Jews will tell you to straight up leave Israel. There are very few on the left who think critical of the state, majority is completely brainwashed. One thing he said struck out with a chill. He says Israelis are the only victims and the best victims, and perhaps one of the only times the victim is actively the oppressor. Fuck Israel.</p>
