        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Men of r/conspiracy, it is now more important than ever to have your testosterone levels tested, and for good reason.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a study published in 2007, there was found to be &quot;a “substantial” drop in U.S. men’s testosterone levels since the 1980s, but the reasons for the decline remain unclear. This trend also does not appear to be related to age.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The average levels of the male hormone dropped by 1 percent a year, Dr. Thomas Travison and colleagues from the New England Research Institutes in Watertown, Massachusetts, found. This means that, for example, a 65-year-old man in 2002 would have testosterone levels 15 percent lower than those of a 65-year-old in 1987. This also means that a greater proportion of men in 2002 would have had below-normal testosterone levels than in 1987.&quot;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Could the United States Be Deliberately Producing a Mass Population of Docile Men Lacking Leadership Abilities?:</strong>
&quot;In the latest study, researchers evaluated the hormone levels of male executives in an executive education program at Harvard. They found that managers who had greater leadership responsibility had higher levels of the hormone testosterone, which stimulates the development of male sex organs and has been shown in numerous studies to be associated with leadership qualities like aggressiveness and risk-taking.&quot;
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Low Testosterone Symptoms</strong>
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Depression
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Fatigue
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Brain Fog Irritability
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Muscle Weakness
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Loss of Muscle
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Weight Gain, especially in the stomach region
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Reduced Sex Drive
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Erectile Dysfunction
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Low Semen Volume
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Infertility 
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A WORD OF WARNING</strong></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>After having your testosterone levels tested, your levels will most likely fall within the range of 280 to 1,100 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). A total testosterone reading of 280 to 1,100 ng/dL is considered to be in the &quot;normal&quot; range. However, many doctors are not specialists on hormones or hormone therapy, which can be problematic for you. While 280-1,1000 ng/dL is considered &quot;normal,&quot; when you begin to look at testosterone levels by age range, you may find that you have lower testosterone levels than what would be considered normal for someone your age. Keep this in mind, your doctor may suggest that your testosterone levels are perfectly normal, when this simply isn&#39;t the case. <strong>If you do get your testosterone levels checked, be sure to go early in the morning upon waking, so that your testosterone levels are at their highest, most accurate numbers. Testosterone decreases throughout the day, so going to get tested at 4pm may result in a false reading.</strong></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Personal Anecdote</strong></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
I am a 25 year old man with with total testosterone levels of 440 ng/dL. I went to the doctor to be seen for depression, fatigue, brain fog, lack of motivation, etc. The doctor told me that my reading of 440 ng/dL was perfectly okay and that I had nothing to worry about. However, consider the median testosterone levels based on age below.
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Average Total Testosterone Available, Based On Age</strong>
25-34: 617 ng/dL
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>35-44: 668 ng/dL
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>45-54: 606 ng/dL
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>55-64: 562 ng/dL
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>65-74: 471 ng/dL
&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>85-100: 376 ng/dL</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, as a 25 year old man, my testosterone levels were comparable to that of a 75 year old man. This can be extremely debilitating for individuals, especially if they suffer from the many undue effects that low testosterone levels can bring. Many attribute the rise in low testosterone levels among men to outside environmental factors, as well as the food we consume daily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BPA</p>

<p>&quot;First synthesized in 1891, bisphenol A came into use as a synthetic estrogen in the 1930s. Later, chemists discovered that, combined with phosgene (used during World War I as a toxic gas) and other compounds, BPA yielded the clear, polycarbonate plastic of shatter-resistant headlights, eyeglass lenses, DVDs and baby bottles.&quot;</p>

<p>Sippy Cups, Baby Bottles, Regular plactic cups, plates, cutlery, etc.</p>

<p>At least 2 generations of Western Men were dosed with Synthetic Estrogen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many generations it will take to repair the damage to us and our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obesity and daily alcohol consumption cause more harm than soy which they&#39;re likely not eating anyway and imaginary level drops caused by birth control in the water(which also controls you mind!) ;)</p>

<p>But seriously, obesity is one of the biggest factors, i used to be 350lbs and had the T levels of a 50 year old at 25, now I&#39;m 30 and a competing Strongman/Powerlifter at 260lbs with above average levels using no drugs, I will later use them to combat low T as i age and to compete at higher levels, but I do not see the need outweighing the risk yet even with safe use.</p>

<p>Also happy to recommend natural ways to raise your T if anyone wants advice, but dropping body fat and regular exercise including resistance training is the best way.</p>

<p>Low carb diets can lower T too, unless combined with high fats &amp; protein properly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Sean Vigue on YouTube. Loads of free content and great stretching/yoga when you&#39;re ready. Do not start with yoga. You won&#39;t get much out of it. Most athletes don&#39;t get much out of it. The body must be relaxed and stretched before you can start moving in true yoga form. </p>

<p>What is the best? Maintaining proper form. Stretching is a martial art. You are working against your own body. You will begin to realize your muscles move a lot differently than your mind thinks. You only move the way you do due to stress and muscular tension. This is relieved by listening to every word the expert says. Feel the breath. Feel the stretch. You&#39;re positioning yourself to move freely and effortlessly. That is strength.</p>

<p>Breath is the most important thing, I cannot give you any stretches as I do not know your tensioned parts. But if your hips and power back are tight it&#39;s due to tight hamstrings: which means your glutes arent activating, hence the stress and tension in the hip and back. Stretching is the realizing of the problem areas aren&#39;t the problem. It&#39;s the symptom of the problem. The problem is elsewhere in the body due to tension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obesity plays a role, but the effect still exists even after you control for obesity. There are many different factors at play, and one of the biggest are all of these weird chemicals were are exposed to. </p>

<p>Sperm counts and testosterone have been dropping in men for many years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sperm counts among men in the west have more than halved in the past 40 years and are currently falling by an average of 1.4% a year.</p>

<p>It was a chilling and alarming revelation. Western nations – although not developing countries – appear to be facing disaster. But what could be triggering this decline in sperm? And what can be done to counter it?</p>

<p>The work was an analysis of more than 100 previous studies in the field...Professor Chris Barratt, at Dundee University, described it as a landmark study “that should ring alarm bells”, while Manchester University’s Professor Daniel Brison said its “shocking” results should act as “a wake-up call to prompt active research in the area”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/29/infertility-crisis-sperm-counts-halved">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/29/infertility-crisis-sperm-counts-halved</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Studies show that men’s testosterone levels have been declining for decades. The most prominent, a 2007 study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, revealed a “substantial” drop in U.S. men’s testosterone levels since the 1980s, with average levels declining by about 1% per year. This means, for example, that a 60-year-old man in 2004 had testosterone levels 17% lower than those of a 60-year-old in 1987. Another study of Danish men produced similar findings, with double-digit declines among men born in the 1960s compared to those born in the 1920s.</p>

<p>The challenges to men’s health don’t end there. Rates of certain reproductive disorders (like testicular cancer) have risen over time, while multiple European studies have found that sperm counts are sinking. These trends coincide with a decline in musculoskeletal strength among young men: In a 2016 study, the average 20- to 34-year-old man could apply 98 pounds of force with a right-handed grip, down from 117 pounds by a man of the same age in 1985. Though grip strength isn’t necessarily a proxy for overall fitness, it’s a strong predictor of future mortality.</p>

<p>What’s behind all the downward trends? The answer is complicated. The decline in testosterone levels is almost certainly linked to higher rates of obesity (which suppresses testosterone) and may be linked to lower rates of smoking in men (since nicotine is a potent aromatase inhibitor). In the 2007 study, however, <strong>the age-matched declines persisted after controlling for these variables. Many observers put more weight on increased exposure to environmental toxins, such as pesticides, parabens, and chemicals common in household products like phthalates and bisphenol A.</strong></p>

<p>soy which they&#39;re likely not eating anyway </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with most of what you&#39;ve said but this statement is inaccurate. Soy is a common preservative in many frozen/pre-made foods. I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s surprisingly difficult to avoid consumption of soy if you&#39;re not consistently cooking your own meals. Obviously it&#39;s not the only cause of low testosterone but  it&#39;s one of the many pit falls set out for us little people. </p>

<p>The idea is to cast a wide net, attack the hormone levels with many different factors and the common man is bound to expose themselves somehow. Vigilance is the only real weapon against unwitting consumption of poisons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>right though.  i tried mining BTC back in like 09-10 when they were really new and worth less than a penny.  I couldn&#39;t get the software to work and gave up to try later.</p>

<p>i did end up trying again but this was when GPU mining became a thing, it took about 2-3 weeks to mine 1 bitcoin and I would sell them right away for $100.</p>

<p>the idea that your friend would be a billionaire is faulty as well.  most likely he would have sold at $10 or $100 or whatever number he decided in his mind was as high as BTC would go.</p>

<p>people DID predict that BTC could be worth $10k someday but that someday was like 2050.  no one could have predicted it would rise this fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that diet and exercise are paramount for increasing testosterone levels, they are not enough in a society that is actively poisoning us. </p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s body is different, but I&#39;ve found that if you can get a legit source of Tongkat Ali, it is a very effective natural supplement for testosterone. It may not work for everyone but it works for me.</p>

<p>If anyone is thinking about trying Tongkat Ali, take it with some Stinging Nettle Root. That will help to prevent your body from turning the excess testosterone production into estrogen. I&#39;ve  also found that supplements like Pygeum, P5P, &amp; L-Arginine also help tremendously with testosterone and overall male health (prostate, muscles, sex drive, etc.). </p>

<p>I used to have a light case of Gynecomastia and after almost 2 years of Tongkat Ali, the majority of the breast tissue is gone. I believe Gynecomastia is a sign that we are being manipulated on a hormonal level, since I was never overweight in my teenage years and developed breast tissue during puberty at 13.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert on health and wellness and I don&#39;t claim that this will work for everyone. But it worked for me so I&#39;m sharing my anecdotal evidence. I believe our bodies are capable of healing on their own more than we know. </p>

<p>There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that ties back to jacking it (especially too often) as being detrimental to health, especially Mental Health ... depression, anxiety, social anxiety, yatta yatta.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I look at masturbation like I look at cigarettes. I mean I quit smoking (also drinking), but I don&#39;t waste 4 hours a day looking at porn either. If anything once or twice a week for maybe 15 min total?</p>

<p>My depression/anxiety(social) etc is definitely from my childhood and being abused which was then made worse with my experience in the military. </p>

<p>For me honestly I was thinking about trying to end it again and it&#39;s weird to admit, but LSD saved my life. Took pretty much everything away. The depression, the suicidal thoughts, the anxiety it&#39;s all gone. I am more at center with myself then I have ever been. All the negativity from my life has washed away. I don&#39;t feel like piece of shit anymore. I now MD once a month. And all the pills from the VA are gone. I&#39;m now pill free and feeling like I did when I was a teen. (late 20&#39;s now)</p>

<p>I will look more into nofap and see if I can benefit any further from it. Probably just eliminating porn for 90 days to see where that goes would probably help. I can understand how watching porn can affect the brain. I found out about porn when I was like 7 and didn&#39;t have anyone to explain to me what it was. But also didn&#39;t let it control my life. </p>

<p>I&#39;m married now so I could care less about the attractivity of other women, but I can see how you would feel more confident about yourself and less shame about it. Even though no one should. The old saying goes, men cum to their senses.</p>

<p>Thanks for the insightful response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Everything in context. To be aware that some affect is happening is crutch.  </p>

<p>As we grow up, how much True education do we get about sex, it&#39;s impact, it&#39;s role, it&#39;s use in our lives?<br/>
The main message we get, is that &quot;it&#39;s natural&quot;, &quot;express yourself&quot;, &quot;some is good, more is better!&quot;  ... blah blah.  It&#39;s a tough bag.  It&#39;s hard to disagree with fun.  </p>

<p>To a discerning mind, an affect is noticed.  It is pondered.  It is investigated.  </p>

<p>Everything is linked.  </p>

<p>Your story gives me hope for my boyfriend. I want to suggest that he gets his bloodwork done to check his hormone levels, but he has been really sensitive lately and I don&#39;t want to risk hurting his feelings. (Yes, I realize our gender roles sound flipped, that&#39;s the problem)</p>

Sex is not against life, life wouldn&#39;t be here without it. Shame on those who insert unnecessary shame into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bit simplistic if the t-levels are on average (!) 60% lower than they were in the 80s. The (freaking) frogs are dying and you are blaming internet porn? 
I&#39;m really into sports but I&#39;m pretty certain I have below average t-levels (hard gains, high voice, no beard). Always considered making a testosterone therapy when I hit 40 or 45 but reading this makes me want to at least take a test. On the flipside it sure isn&#39;t great being hooked on drugs for the rest of your life. </p>

<p>PA&#39;s thinking for the lack of Vitamin D is folks just don&#39;t go outside anymore so we fall behind on the Vitamin D.

    <div class="md"><p>This has been a big concern of mine for a while. Thanks for bringing this to everyone&#39;s attention. This is something we need to actively be speaking out about and bringing to people&#39;s conscious awareness. It&#39;s also very troubling to know that LabCorp lowered their standard of testosterone levels in men, rather than address the issue of lowering T levels and how to fix it. Along with the chemicals in our food and water, I think technology has a big role in all of this as well. Too much screen time, bad posture, less movement, porn, radiation, etc. Not to mention our mental and emotional states we are in. A lot of this is psychosomatic I believe. I think in conjunction with making conscious decisions regarding our diet and exercise, we can help expedite the healing process with our thoughts and intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BPA</p>

<p>&quot;First synthesized in 1891, bisphenol A came into use as a synthetic estrogen in the 1930s. Later, chemists discovered that, combined with phosgene (used during World War I as a toxic gas) and other compounds, BPA yielded the clear, polycarbonate plastic of shatter-resistant headlights, eyeglass lenses, DVDs and baby bottles.&quot;</p>

<p>Sippy Cups, Baby Bottles, Regular plactic cups, plates, cutlery, etc.</p>

<p>At least 2 generations of Western Men were dosed with Synthetic Estrogen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many generations it will take to repair the damage to us and our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that diet and exercise are paramount for increasing testosterone levels, they are not enough in a society that is actively poisoning us. </p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s body is different, but I&#39;ve found that if you can get a legit source of Tongkat Ali, it is a very effective natural supplement for testosterone. It may not work for everyone but it works for me.</p>

<p>If anyone is thinking about trying Tongkat Ali, take it with some Stinging Nettle Root. That will help to prevent your body from turning the excess testosterone production into estrogen. I&#39;ve  also found that supplements like Pygeum, P5P, &amp; L-Arginine also help tremendously with testosterone and overall male health (prostate, muscles, sex drive, etc.). </p>

<p>I used to have a light case of Gynecomastia and after almost 2 years of Tongkat Ali, the majority of the breast tissue is gone. I believe Gynecomastia is a sign that we are being manipulated on a hormonal level, since I was never overweight in my teenage years and developed breast tissue during puberty at 13.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert on health and wellness and I don&#39;t claim that this will work for everyone. But it worked for me so I&#39;m sharing my anecdotal evidence. I believe our bodies are capable of healing on their own more than we know. </p>
