        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/afooltobesure.html">afooltobesure</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just happened to catch a few minutes of Trump’s speech at the campaign rally for Rick Saccone, and I noticed quite a bit of manipulative language. One thing that stood out to me was his repeated use of the phrase, “they want to take it away from you”.</p>

<p>Trump really is a brilliant leader, and it’s clear that his speeches are meticulously designed to impart a feeling of inclusiveness and camaraderie.</p>

<p>He seems to have convinced people that they personally are in a battle of good against evil, and that the evil democrats want to “take away” their livelihood. He appears to be catering to the forgotten white underclass, convincing them that he has “given” them something that will be taken away from them if democrats regain power.</p>

<p>Did anyone else happen to catch the speech? The pure ecstasy those in the audience seemed to be in reminded me of a cult. His introduction of Saccone, his boasting about the 2016 election, all of it was hyped and spun to an extreme extent.</p>

<p>It came across to me as exactly the type of speech that would be given by a rising fascist dictator. America wasn’t great before, but now it is, and you need to vote for me to keep it great.</p>

<p>Factual information was sparse aside from the 15 minutes he spent talking about the various “points” he “won” during the election, and appeal to emotion was at an all time high. Typical strategies like having a group of plants initiate a rythmic chanting were on display. The church choir was on display singing comforting and godly songs.</p>

<p>Scared the hell out of me, and I worry that we are honestly moving toward what is effectively a dictatorship. I think Trump knows exactly what he’s doing, and obviously he has help.</p>

<p>There are various videos and other records of the powerful speeches given by past dictators, and I suspect they would appear very similar to Trump’s speech today at this rally.</p>

<p>Does Trump have higher ambitions than even the presidency? Is he set on attaining ultimate power over us by uniting a majority against the various minorities of our nation?</p>

<p>I fear so. Compare and contrast:</p>

<p>Trump’s speeches to tick all the boxes: <a href="https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042814025919/1-s2.0-S1877042814025919-main.pdf?_tid=a20aafba-2ff9-46bc-9db8-84d7d1f74be8&amp;amp;acdnat=1520742722_9cab824045baa96c35c95d4cbe0244a0">https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042814025919/1-s2.0-S1877042814025919-main.pdf?_tid=a20aafba-2ff9-46bc-9db8-84d7d1f74be8&amp;amp;acdnat=1520742722_9cab824045baa96c35c95d4cbe0244a0</a></p>

<p>Highlight commonality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Religious values</li>
<li>Subjective narration of history</li>
<li>Patriotic value</li>
</ul>

<p>Justify current policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Depicting evil picture of foreign/internal enemies (mainly presumed)</li>
<li>Present current policy as the best</li>
<li>Solutions for current problems</li>
</ul>

<p>State orders:</p>

<ul>
<li>Euphemizing</li>
<li><p>Wish for further success</p></li>
<li><p>Legitimation: Unequal power relationships are created and maintained by being represented as legitimate
and as being in ‘everybody’s’ interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Dissimulation: This occurs where relations of domination (such as gender inequality) are denied, hidden or obscured.</p></li>
<li><p>Unification Hegemonic or dominant ideology unifies members of a society into a collective entity usually in opposition to a real or imagined ‘enemy’. This serves to further deflect attention away from the unequal power relationships between the rulers and the ruled</p></li>
<li><p>Fragmentation Hegemony is achieved and maintained through dividing or fragmenting the potential
opposition and thus reducing or removing the perceived ‘threat’ they might otherwise pose. In short, the powerful adopt a ‘divide and rule’ approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Reification: Unequal social structures are represented as being ‘natural’ and ‘inevitable’. Relations of domination are represented as if they were divorced from history and were without specific economic and political contexts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Mubarak uttered the following sentences to euphemize his command and quell the opponents:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Egypt&#39;s safety and stability.The enemy is cruel and implacable. He is out to seize our lands, watered with our sweat, to seize our grain and oil secured by our labor. He is out to restore the rule of landlords, to restore Tsarism, to destroy national culture and the national state existence of the Russians, Ukrainians, Byelo-Russians, Lithuanians, Letts, Esthonians, Uzbeks, Tatars, Moldavians, Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaidzhanians and the other free people of the Soviet Union, to Germanize them, to convert them into the slaves of German princes and barons</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m spotting many similarities...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great example and fuck Obama! Glad you mentioned this, as it is crazy to me that people can’t see the similarities. It was cult-like then and it’s certainly cult-like now. The only difference I can really see is in the style of the delivery, with Trump focusing more on himself personally winning and Obama focusing more on unity.</p>

<p>The ends are the same, of course, and it’s a good thing Obama didn’t get to enact the dictatorship he surely wanted to.</p>

<p>That may have been his downfall though, is that Obama focused not enough on himself and his own personal victories but the hopes and dreams of his followers. Trump’s strategy of building a true cult of personality around himself means that he doesn’t even have to be sneaky like Obama did. He can be totally upfront about his intentions and his followers won’t care because they have unconditional faith in him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that the difference between an authoritarian figure and a leader? A leader tries to inspire the country to do their best, to make a system that will allow that to happen. An authoritarian says that only he has the answers and that the country needs to trust him because there is only him to stop the great evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ere&#39;s the UN&#39;s article on genocide: <a href="http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.html">http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.html</a></p>

<p>It states:</p>

<p>Article II of the Genocide Convention contains a narrow definition of the crime of genocide, which includes two main elements:</p>

<p>1) A mental element: the &quot;intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such&quot;; and</p>

<p>2) A physical element, which includes the following five acts, enumerated exhaustively:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Killing members of the group</p></li>
<li><p>Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group</p></li>
<li><p>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</p></li>
<li><p>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group</p></li>
<li><p>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Points 3, 4 and 5 are happening as we speak</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Bad economy(which everyone could see coming a mile ahead, yet no one wanted to do anything about). Constant reminders of how bad the economy is. Increasing low-skilled illegal immigrants. Pushing women to work which added more people to the work pool without new jobs to go with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Requiring everyone to have a degree and/or experience even for the most menial jobs. Turning down people for being &quot;overqualified&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Affirmative action, diversity quotas, age/weight discrimination, certain groups needing lower scores than others to get into top colleges.</p></li>
<li><p>Convincing Whites that they are racist and are awful people who are responsible for all minorities shortcomings and shouldn&#39;t be having full white kids.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased advertisement and exposure to sex and increasing acceptance of it. Jill from the Hill doesn&#39;t look too appealing when you can watch pornstars anytime who look like goddesses and make you think that they will do anything to please your urges. And even better, when you are done, you can turn them off and not have any possible repercussions.</p></li>
<li><p>The media&#39;s constant pushing of interracial relationships and homosexuality. If you were to watch any TV show or movie, you&#39;d think this was an extremely common behavior since almost every show has one of the two, when the numbers in real-life don&#39;t back it up at all. </p></li>
<li><p>The media&#39;s constant attack on Catholic religions, while being 100% supportive of Islam and Judaism.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant pushes about how we are destroying the earth and how the world will soon be coming to an end</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Making divorce acceptable</p></li>
<li><p>The push and advertisement of condoms and birth control</p></li>
<li><p>Increased push for homosexuality and transsexualism</p></li>
<li><p>Continued push of FWB&#39;s, sex with non-spouses</p></li>
<li><p>Bad economy</p></li>
<li><p>Treating any Whites with large numbers of kids as backwards hillbillies, while saying nothing about black and hispanics doing the same</p></li>
<li><p>Encouraging Whites to date outside their race for diversity</p></li>
<li><p>Constant pushes about how we are destroying the earth, making people fearful of having kids</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Anchor babies/Birthright citizenship - Just have your kid here and they are now American!</p></li>
<li><p>Pushing kids to become homosexual or trans</p></li>
<li><p>George Zimmerman = &quot;White person&quot;</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you not doing the very thing that the right accuses minorities of relying on: victimization and deflecting from the source of the real issues to excuse their shortcomings (opiate abuse, income inequality, domestic violence, etc). </p>

<p>The outdated trend of identity politics is not going to help you. It is dangerous and best avoided. When you wake up in the morning, are immigrants, homosexuals, Wall Street, abortion clinics, SJW’s, and the everyday people you see going to and from work immediately cross your mind as issues that you face after you get out of bed and prepare yourself for the day?</p>

<p>Nobody is trying to destroy you or your ethnicity. Stop the victimization and be an adult.</p>
