        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In January my 87 year old grandfather fell climbing into bed at the nursing home, and cut his head. They did an x-ray of his upper body when they gave him some stitches, everything was fine, but they saw an inconclusive shadow on his right lung, and determined he needed an MRI. Medicare delayed the MRI, and the nursing home then decided he was terminal and had cancer so they started pumping him full of opiates.</p>

<p>Despite being 87, he was sound of mind, able to walk 100-steps on his own power, and was ultimately healthy aside from diabetes and arthritis.</p>

<p>After two weeks of hallucinating, becoming bedridden, and losing his ability to speak from being on high doses of opiates mixed with psychiatric medications (which he didn&#39;t need, and we didn&#39;t know they put him on), my Mom and I finally found out what happened. The rest of the family failed to inform us he had even fallen.</p>

<p>We weened him off the opiates, and he began to recover. We finally got the MRI approved, and he was fine. He had a cold, the shadow on the x-ray was mucus. He did not have cancer. He was not terminal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we were too late. The withdrawals nearly killed him. When we tried to get him off the psych meds after he barely made it through opiates withdrawals he spiraled into a depression and stopped eating and drinking and died last Friday.</p>

<p>He repeatedly told us he did not want any more drugs, yet the nursing home put him on antidepressants a week into his fast, and gave him morphine the day before his death. He wasn&#39;t in pain, the morphine simply made him more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>My grandfather decided he would rather die than be force fed medications against his will, and have to rehab and learn to walk again. Unfortunately, my Uncle was the executor so we didn&#39;t have any legal say, and he just did whatever the doctors told him, and believed them. Even so, the doses of drugs they put him on far exceeded what they told my Uncle, and the nursing staff keep rotating shifts so often they were often double drugging him.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this whole experience has reminded me of how cruel and fucked up the medical system is. Without evidence, the doctors and nursing home decided to euthanize my grandfather with opiates and psych meds despite the fact there was nothing wrong with him. At least we were able to get him off the meds so he could die a more natural death, but even then they continued to drug him against his will. Obviously, I never would have put him in that nursing home, but my Mom nor I had any legal authority as my grandfather gave all authority to my idiot coward of an Uncle. Who now claims my grandfather was broke, he wasn&#39;t, and wants to have him cremated in a card board box despite the fact his church is opposed to cremation.</p>

<p>Fucked up times we live in. To think the pharmaceutical industry has people so brainwashed that they think its okay to disrespect a mans dying wishes to die a natural death and insist on drugging people to death instead.</p>

<p>Doctors are more likely to do something to make the situation worse these days. Not because they want to, but because they&#39;ve been indoctrinated by the pharamitical industry to simply push drugs as the solution to everything, even when people don&#39;t want the drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mother-in-law is currently in the hospital for PCP pnemonia. They insisted on giving her bactrim for nearly a month with no success even though we repeatedly told them it wouldn&#39;t work as she used to use it for every cold she ever had and had built up a resistance to it. She is also from a place where Bactrim-reaistant PCP Pneumonia is common. We finally convinced them to try an alternative I had to research myself and she is finally recovering. </p>

<p>On top of that, they insist she is HIV positive even though she tested negative a few months before she got sick and they continually try to scare her into taking the poisonous antiretroviral meds even though we have repeatedly refused them. They can actually make her condition worse yet they tell us she will die without them. </p>

<p>It is insane how brainwashed Dr.&#39;s are by the pharmaceutical industry to push toxic meds on patients. Why use gasoline to put out a fire? Only reason I can come up with is $$$.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree, especially on the authority/arrogance thing. I spent countless hours reading/researching the best course of action given my mother-in-laws past medical history as well as where she is from to find out the best possible solution for her. They only followed guidelines drawn up by the pharmaceutical companies/medical cartel and didn&#39;t look any further to diagnose the real reasons for her illness as well as best possible treatments given her unique circumstances. They insisted that we should trust them and if we don&#39;t follow their regimen than we are basically disrespecting them and their years of schooling. </p>

<p>Apparently the countless medical journals/scientific studies I read for weeks to come to my conclusions was nothing better than listening to bloggers and that I should bend to their authority. Every valid point I made was considered veering off treatment course and brushed aside. When they finally switched to the treatment I had recommended, they wrote in the charts that they had planned to switch all along even though they did not make the decision to do so until after I questioned them for sticking to a failing treatment when there was another alternative available with nearly identical success rates.</p>

<p>The level of arrogance and indoctrination in these Dr.&#39;s was staggering. Had we stayed with their pharmaceutically-approved regimen, my mother-in-law would be dead instead of having the fighting chance she has now.</p>

<p>I now use alternative medicine first, and basically use western approaches as a last resort.</p>

<p>Supplementing with mushrooms like reishi, cordyceps, and lions maine have changed my life. Its amazing how something as simple as the right fungus can have such a crazy impact on your health, but yet no doctor would ever dare suggest them as a treatment for anything despite mushrooms being critical for gut flora health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were so concerned, did it ever occur to you to take your grandpa into your own home? My parents took my grandmother in (even when it was hard to make space, they did) and she got to die surrounded by family and under a familiar roof.</p>

<p>Point being, your whole family had adequate time to figure this all out and if it was that concerning, make accommodations. I don&#39;t understand how anyone from a loving household can calmly send their parents to a nursing home. They raised you and wiped your ass, what&#39;s the stigma against doing the same? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story short, we tried. My Uncle lived closest to him, and has two kids. They were taking care of him, but then my Uncle got divorced, and his kids moved out. My grandfather refused to come live by my Mom and I, and we had offered multiple times. He didn&#39;t want to leave the other side of our family. In the end, it was his decision to stay there with them, and he gave my Uncle full executorship and control of all his assets.</p>

<p>In his culture, you are supposed to rely on your first born son, and not your Daughters for support. So my Mom got the short end of the stick. It&#39;s likely a decision my grandpa regretted in the end. By the time my Mom and I knew what was going on she spent the last 2 months by his side, and was with him when he passed.</p>

<p>Trust me, it was painful to be powerless in this situation. By the time he realized his son betrayed him, and that he should have trusted his Daughter (my Mom) instead, it was too late.</p>

<p>My Uncle was clearly a factor in not understanding and allowing the nursing home to abuse him. He still to this day doesn&#39;t understand he shouldn&#39;t have listened to the doctors and done some research as to what they were actually doing to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We thought he was being properly taken care of, and lived 4 hours away, and my Uncle was literally less than a mile away from the nursing home. We visited as much as we could. I guess it was a matter of pride not to tell us the truth when we called and visited. Or perhaps he didn&#39;t even realize what they were doing to him and just thought he was getting older. In retrospect a lot of the things he use to complain about, like being dizzy, were likely side effects and we just weren&#39;t connecting the dots that he was being drugged.</p>

<p>We did try, but I do wish we had pushed harder. It&#39;s in the past now so I&#39;ve got to let that regret go, but it will probably haunt me for a while.</p>

<p>That sounds quite biased. I would imagine people checking into hospitals aren&#39;t the healthiest when they walk in, so of course your chances of dying are higher if you decided to check into a hospital.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying seatbelts caused more injuries in car accidents, when they actually just caused fewer people to outright die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Unfortunately this is what they do in these situations. If the doctor determines someone is terminal, they think they&#39;re doing them a favor by just killing them with morphine.</p>

<p>It is even more messed up when they don&#39;t tell them that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>In some situations it is totally warranted, like when my girlfriends grandma ended up in the hospital with organ failure. She had an infection, didn&#39;t tell anyone, didn&#39;t go to the doctor, and didn&#39;t treat it until her organs failed. There was nothing anyone could do at that point, she was in pain, but was going to die a slow and painful death. So they gave us the option to put her on morphine, and we asked her if thats what she wanted and she told us she did. That I&#39;m okay with. If the person knows they&#39;re terminal, is in pain, and consents to dying that way then fine.</p>

<p>However, putting someone on morphine who has stated they want a drug free death is not okay. Even worse, is giving someone morphine who might not have even been terminal in that moment, not explaining it will likely kill them, and then killing them anyway.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for your loss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The really sad part about this is older people think that if the doctors prescribe the drugs to them they must need them and the doctors know what they are doing. These doctors had my 78 year old grandma on fentanyl patches that just stayed on she also took a morphine pill twice a day and hydrocodone as needed for pain. I personally know that she has some pain because she is old and has arthritis but most of her pain I think is opiate addiction which she thinks cant happen to her as long as she is following doctors orders. She is crazy to believe that way. But simple minded people that is the way they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen that happen a lot as well. My cousins literally told me I shouldn&#39;t be Googling the drugs they put him on, and should just listen to the doctors. They&#39;re freakin brainwashed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case with my grandfather. We don&#39;t know why they had him on a fairly high dose of gabapentin. He did not have seizures, or a mood disorder. They claim it was for his diabetic nerve pain, but he didn&#39;t have diabetic nerve pain. He&#39;s had diabetes for decades and always managed it without incident. I looked it up, and that drug is only 15&amp;#37; effective for diabetic nerve pain anyway, which basically means it doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I believe they put him on it as a mood stabilizer to shut him up, and make him more manageable at the nursing home. I think it was a calculated decision because they weren&#39;t use to having an 87 year old who was so clear of mind. It was incredible really, he had no signs of memory loss or dementia. He was fully there, just physically old with arthritis. They wanted to control him, and when he slipped a fell they saw it as an opportunity to get a kick back from the drug companies and clear a bed in the nursing home. Pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why my Grandpa left everything in my Uncle&#39;s name, we offered to get him out of the nursing home when my Uncle first dumped him there but it meant moving him at least 3 hours away from my Uncle, and his kids.

We didn&#39;t know about all the drugs, and he had never told us about them until all of this happened. Pretty sure they weren&#39;t even telling my grandfather everything he was on, why he was on it, and what the doses were.

    <div class="md"><p>Doctors hand out opiates like candy here, which gets many normal people hooked on opiates who do not need them. Granted, I don&#39;t really want to tell people what drugs they can and cannot take, however they do not warn people that even &quot;prescribed&quot; usage causes dependency. Many people find themselves addicted to these drugs with little to no education on them. They&#39;re a leading cause of drug overdoses in this country, and also fuels the heroine epidemic. Many people get hooked on opiates by their doctors, then if the doctors cut them off they switch to heroine. It&#39;s completely destroyed entire cities and states, fuels the homeless population, and causes a lot of civil unrest all over the country and its all bought and paid for by big pharma and the CIA. Apparently they&#39;re also forcing these drugs on the elderly as well as what just happened with my grandfather. Wish I was making this up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all anecdotal I guess.  But it&#39;s a true story and happened to my nieghbour about ten years ago.  This spinster neighbour in her early 60&#39;s frequently admitted herself to the nearby public hospital with lung problems, and was given morphine one time.  At the time the nurse friend of another neighbour commented to us that this was odd and suspicious, because in her experience morphine was only given to the dying (which this lady wasn&#39;t).  This lady somewhat recovered but went rapidly downhill after that morphine treatment and died within the year.  Also, during her stays at this nearby public hospital, this lady had been convinced to leave her entire estate to the hospital.  I think at some point, once the will was sorted, they saw her as a pest taking up a bed, and her time was up.</p>

<p>My daughter just turned two, so she just got her two-year vaccines. The Doctor swore up and down to me how safe vaccines were and how over-blown the debate was. Well, within 3 days she got the worst case of chicken-pox I&#39;d ever seen. Her body was covered in a painful itchy rash and she cried for two  days straight. Most cases of chicken pox that I&#39;ve seen were pretty mild. This was way different. She wasn&#39;t around any other kids either, so I know it was the vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is broken.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your Daughter, I hear it is important to break the vaccines up. Its annoying because you have to go back and forth to the doctor, but it prevents the immune system from going into over-drive. Something to look into if you continue vaxing. Getting multiple shots at once has been shown to cause those kinds of reactions more often.</p>

We don&#39;t yet know what the end-goal is but it will become apparent soon enough. They&#39;ll use it to push some kind of new legislation or re-energize the &quot;war on drugs&quot; or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm from a conspiracy standpoint thats backwards from what I understand. The &quot;war on drugs&quot; was so that the CIA could control the flow of opiates into the US themselves, and take the profits and invest into operations off the books. Opiates are basically the CIA&#39;s cash crop because they&#39;re the only ones who can provide a supply.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they sell opiates to the big pharma companies and pocket off them that way potentially as well. Largest source of opiates is Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I am not sure what the intention of the MSM narrative is, and like you I am suspicious. But these drugs are pushed on people, and they are killing people unfortunately.</p>

<p>OP I&#39;m very sorry for your loss and your feelings about the circumstances. Perhaps take comfort knowing that your grandpa had 87 years, health care, was diagnosed with cancer then told it was a mistake (!), and had people who he loved who loved him back. Many people in this world aren&#39;t lucky enough have even one of those lovely gifts. Perhaps you can take comfort in celebrating the rewards while grieving the loss?

    <div class="md"><p>Very sorry for your loss. I&#39;ve buried five family members (mom, dad, and three grands) in the last six years and their end of life experiences have impacted me heavily. By the last one - Dad - my sister and I had enough experience to know how to navigate the medical/rehab/hopsice systems well enough to give him a good death - peaceful, at home, surrounded with love. The other four were highly medicalized and just awful. </p>

<p>I&#39;m considering becoming a death doula to help others through the process. Hospice is great, but inadequate. Families need advocacy in the medical realm when their loved ones are dying, not to mention that there are people who have to face end of life with no one. The more I see people come and go, the more I believe that doctors shouldn&#39;t have anything to do with a normal birth or death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah SSRIs are no joke. They can seriously mess you up. The problem is when you’re on them you’re so numb you don’t even realize the damage they’re causing, and people think it’s the drug working. It isn’t. As soon as you try to get off you realize the reality of what these drugs actually do to the brain and body, and it can take years to recover. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And some people wonder (my sister included) why I don&#39;t put my mom in a care home. It is because of shit like this. I worked in a care facility for a little over a year and saw far too many examples of this level of care. How we are choosing to treat our elderly is horrific.</p>

<p>As an aside, I injured my shoulder last summer and, long story short, the doctors I saw didn&#39;t even try to fix me but instead just threw drugs at me. I had to see them again because I discovered that opiates don&#39;t work well on me and the docs response was to &quot;just take more&quot;. Instead I found an awesome physical therapist who not only fixed my injury but also correctly diagnosed it. </p>

<p>Health care in the US is laughable and we could get better care by finding a friendly shaman, medicine woman, or witch doctor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s horrible, something similar happened to an extended family member of mine. He was diagnosed with cancer, put through all the treatments only to find out he never had cancer. He was in his late 30s I think and ended up dying from the treatments before he could sue. I don&#39;t really know the details I only heard the story through what my mom told me but that&#39;s the gist of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Good luck with your loved one. It’s not easy. Detoxing properly is incredibly important. Lots of fluids. With the withdrawals are over there can be weeks or even months of depression after as they have to learn to level with their pain again. </p>

<p>Acupuncture, herbs, and supplements can help depending on the kind of pain they’re trying to treat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>she has gone through withdrawal more times then i can count.  Rehabs, jails, everything i could think of.     Depression is the real problem.   It was a problem before the opiate addiction.  Its massively exacerbated with the withdrawal.   Lasts months.  Suicidal months.    I appreciate the kind words though.   Shit is rough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the depression is the toughest part. Sounds like that’s why they went to opiates in the first place.</p>

<p>I know this might sound like hippie-dippy shit, but meditation really helped me over come my depression. So did a healthy diet, more active lifestyle, and learning to let the past go. It isn’t easy, and it’s a daily struggle but I’m proof it can be done. </p>

<p>Best of luck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My Mom has a rare disease called Parasupernuclear Palsy. This is when your muscles stop working properly and you become stiff. Your brain can&#39;t tell your body to move your muscles properly and it is degenerative. My Mom went from planting in her garden  walking and driving her car to barely being able to walk to the washroom with a walker on her own within a year. Not much is known about this disease but it ngers me that she is on tons of meds that she doesn&#39;t even  know what it&#39;s for. Doctors seem so quick to prescribe medications and you don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s a correct dose or the correct medication for the symptoms. Luckily she&#39;s not in any pain.</p>

<p>She is terrified to be put into a care home because of all the abuse and horror stories and I don&#39;t blame her. My Dad and I have been taking credit of her and have decided that she will be staying at home for her final days. </p>

<p>I m sooo sorry for your loss and I definitely know what it&#39;s like to see your loved one start to fade away because of the drugs prescribed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a similar story which happened 6 months ago.
My grandmother was in a hospice unit in Chicago after a fall and broken hip.
She was on recovery approximately 2 weeks after hip surgery and was doing extremely well. She awoke one day to mild pain and for some reason the Dr. Put her on a high dose of morphine.
She was a zombie and had no clue who me and my brother were upon visiting her.</p>

<p>During the visit the nurse said it was time for her vitals and meds and instructed us to leave the room.</p>

<p>We came back after about 15 min and the nurse informed us my grandmother was dying and only had a short time to live.</p>

<p>We get back to the room and my grandmother is dying before our eyes.
It was almost like the nurse gave her a fatal dose of morphine and they did nothing to help her as she had a DNR clause.
To this day I am convinced that nurse killed her and there was nothing we could do about it.</p>

<p>Something needs to be done to reform opiate usage as I feel as if it is assisted suicide to keep costs as low as possible</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We didn’t put him on the drugs in the first place.</p>

<p>What we did do was wean him off slowly over time, and did everything you can do in that situation. It took weeks, and he recovered.</p>

<p>It was ultimately the psych meds that spiraled him into a depression and he took his own life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Unfortunately this is what they do in these situations. If the doctor determines someone is terminal, they think they&#39;re doing them a favor by just killing them with morphine.</p>

<p>It is even more messed up when they don&#39;t tell them that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>In some situations it is totally warranted, like when my girlfriends grandma ended up in the hospital with organ failure. She had an infection, didn&#39;t tell anyone, didn&#39;t go to the doctor, and didn&#39;t treat it until her organs failed. There was nothing anyone could do at that point, she was in pain, but was going to die a slow and painful death. So they gave us the option to put her on morphine, and we asked her if thats what she wanted and she told us she did. That I&#39;m okay with. If the person knows they&#39;re terminal, is in pain, and consents to dying that way then fine.</p>

<p>However, putting someone on morphine who has stated they want a drug free death is not okay. Even worse, is giving someone morphine who might not have even been terminal in that moment, not explaining it will likely kill them, and then killing them anyway.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for your loss.</p>
