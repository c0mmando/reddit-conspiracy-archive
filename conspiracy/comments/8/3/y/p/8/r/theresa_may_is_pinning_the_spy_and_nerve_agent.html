        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of the top posts in the worldnews subreddit right now have to do with a spy being killed by nerve-agent, and how Theresa May is going to pin it on Russia.</p>

<p>I guess I have a few questions about this situation...</p>

<p>First off, WHY would Russia bother with nerve agent? It seems extremely over-the-top, cold-war era, super super obvious, might as well have left an autographed picture of Putin on the scene as well. If I were Russia, and wanted this guy dead, wouldn&#39;t a bullet have been easier, and less suspicious? Or maybe just put the guy in a locked duffel bag in his bath tub, because nothing wrong was found the last time that happened.</p>

<p>Second, what evidence do they have that it was Russia? At least right now, the public only knows that it was a nerve agent. Where did that nerve agent come from though? Do we have communications that say that Russia was directing its use?</p>

<p>Third point, and really related to the first question, if I were Britain or the United States and I wanted to create a false flag operation to make people angry at Russia, isn&#39;t this kind of thing the perfect situation for it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Russia didn&#39;t do it. Most likely, the intelligence community has some sort of actual evidence that points to Russia that isn&#39;t privy to the public.</p>

<p>But. This really sounds like something we should be certain about, instead of jumping to the obvious conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but the evidence in this case would likely cause panic due to the fact a deadly nerve agent was easily smuggled in and used in a foreign country by them, though I do not doubt it exists as Putin truly is a supervillain come to life in his actions. He&#39;s basically what happens when Lex Luther become president, except he was a vicious killer first with a military mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likely in medical glass with a rubber/plastic cap, safest way to transport assuming a caustic liquid(which many nerve agents are) and the transport would be undetectable as its sealed for safety in a medical type setting and can be concealed easily. I know it&#39;s easy to transport them, it&#39;s the public that&#39;s upset by things like that, which is why governments control information flow especially in incidents like this.

    <div class="md"><p>To say this would be like saying &quot;The Clintons have people killed all the time, so obviously Seth Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton.&quot; Rumors of many assassinations in the past does not prove that a new assassination can be attributed to a single person. If evidence points in one direction, and motive fits too, then that&#39;s an excellent reason to have a proper criminal investigation, but without an investigation, it&#39;s not appropriate to assert guilt. It&#39;s not reasonable to assume guilt before innocence like that. </p>

<p>Your confidence in his guilt despite lacking a formal investigation just makes me even more worried that it could have been a frame job. If people are willing to accept this evidence as if it&#39;s direct proof of culpability, then that means that it&#39;d be REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY easy to frame Russia. That makes me really uncomfortable, because although Putin is awful and Russia is a corrupt oligarchy these days, there are murderous scumbags involved in oligarchy around the globe who might have a vested interest in framing Putin. </p>

<p>There&#39;s two explanations for this, either it was another group entirely and it just so happens and is purely coincidental that an ex Russian Spy got caught up in it or it was Russia all along and they&#39;re denying involvement. </p>

<p>We know Russia won&#39;t confess. The next few days will be interesting. I don&#39;t see it escalating but if other countries decide to wade in to help the UK out then it could prod the bear, so to speak. </p>

<p>I certainly would, if I were Russia. What gives them the right to make such a demand?</p>

<p>If I were Russia, I would just not release a statement until 24 hours after the deadline, and say &quot;our condolences, but it wasn&#39;t us&quot;, and &quot;we do not appreciate your hostility, but we understand why you would jump to these conclusions, as it does sound like an entertaining Hollywood plot.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. #4 seems to be most beneficial to the powers that be and suit the narrative that &quot;Russia is coming&quot; very well. #1 seems to be least logical IMO, especially under the current political environment - I don&#39;t think Russia is itching to look provocative. And as another poster points out, the location just happens to be right around the corner from a nerve agent testing (testing - lol - let&#39;s be real here) plant.</p>

<p>This is an excellent point. Russia is trying to slow-push their expansion right now, most recently with Crimea and eastern Ukraine. They have to seem reasonable and non-threatening to the rest of the world though, in order to accomplish it.</p>
