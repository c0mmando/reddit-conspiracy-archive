        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Read the discussion in the politics sub about the upcoming walk outs. It&#39;s disgusting to see all these teachers saying they are willing to illegally mark students as present, even if they are walking out to express their political views. Then these leftists (I&#39;m not conservative) pat themselves on their back for exercising their right to protest and encouraging the students to adopt these attitudes while claiming the students are acting out of their own political passion. Kids are kids. They want to be heard when they yell. They want to be seen when they act out. Most of them don&#39;t truly care about the political causes they are being manipulated into championing. </p>

<p>Ask these teachers if the students can walk out for other issues that they feel passionate about, and suddenly being present in the classroom is the most important thing. The teachers are encouraging the kids to walk out as a form of protest, but they&#39;re simultaneously encouraging them to register to vote, because, of course, not voting can&#39;t be considered a form of protest as well. </p>

<p>They&#39;re all talking about how the GOP manipulates laws to discourage 18 year olds from voting but they don&#39;t see how the Dems manipulate social issues in order to encourage the 18 year olds to vote. Neither political party cares about the people having a say if what the people are saying goes against the interests of the party. Complete control happens when you think that your team captain is free and that the other captain wants you to be slaves. Both want you as their slave. Stop pretending one side is better. </p>

<p>That being said, I do support protests. We should be doing them for the right reasons. Who the fuck cares about a few gun deaths when our whole country is a few years away from complete collapse? Maybe we&#39;ll need the fucking guns after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I liked the plan from another user&#39;s school district that they were relegating the march on a Saturday. </p>

<p>I mean, if the protests are simply kids wanting to protest violence, I&#39;m cool with that, but this all seems like very left-leaning, anti-2nd amendment political rallies that I&#39;m not comfortable with tax funds and admin salaries going to. Mobilizing students for something so political conjures up images of student marches in Hitler&#39;s Germany for me- just the opposite side of the same coin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Faking attendance has got to be fraud. If schools want to be on the up and up about their walkouts, they should be honest about reporting and take the consequences as far as a funding deduction. The other thing they can do is call it a &quot;snow day&quot; and add an extra day to the end of the calender or start school a day early next term. Lying about attendance is shady and telling kids it is ok to fudge numbers and cheat taxpayers is disturbing to me. </p>

They don&#39;t really care about the issue because guess what,  there is no issues of too much gun violence in schools,  that&#39;s the true conspiracy.

We know these attacks are scripted just too get us to react and give up our rights. It&#39;s so sad we can&#39;t see this and do something about the real issue of government conspiracy to plan and carry out a false flag attack on the population for reasons to manipulate us and change policies to further their agenda.
