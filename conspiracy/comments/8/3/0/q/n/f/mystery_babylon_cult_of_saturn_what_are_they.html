        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The idea that there is a secret society ruling humanity has been gaining traction over the last 20 or so years.  I think 9/11 was the real eye opener for most of us that such a group exists. The fact that you and I are talking about them on an internet forum is no accident.  They want to come out in the open instead of hiding in the shadows.  The way they accomplish their unveiling is manifold.  </p>

<p>There are a lot of esoteric names for this group of people.  The Cult of Saturn is the one that I see being used the most these days.  However, they also have an exoteric name, Globalists.  Globalists do not claim loyalty to any political party.  Reagan, Bush 1 and 2, Clinton, Obama are all Globalists.  Politics is just one tool the Globalists use to push their agenda of widespread acceptance of their cult.  This is why they are so effective at shaping society.  They play both sides to accomplish their goal.   More on what the goal is later.</p>

<p>The United Nations is where the Globalist agenda is planned and executed on an international scale.  In order to understand the true agenda of the United Nations one must learn about the publishing company known as <a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/">Lucis Trust</a>.  From their website,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lucis Trust has Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC)  and  World Goodwill is recognized by the Department of Public Information at the United Nations as a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). As such the Trust and World Goodwill are part of a community of many hundreds of NGOs that play an active role in the United Nations, particularly in spreading information about the UN and fostering support for UN programs. Since their inception Lucis Trust and World Goodwill have given their support through meditation, educational materials and seminars, by highlighting the importance of the UN&#39;s goals and activities as they represent the voice of the peoples and nations of the world.     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lucis Trust Publishing Company was founded by Alice Bailey.  Bailey, along with Helena Blavatsky, could be considered the mother of the current New Age movement.   The New Age movement is difficult to define, mainly because they draw inspiration from so many other religions.  Author William Jasper describes the New Age religion as a “ convergence of New Age mysticism, pantheism, aboriginal animism atheism, communism, socialism, Luciferian occultism, apostate Christianity, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.”  Essentially, the New Age religion appropriates what they think is the very best from all religions and pounds it into their template.  This is done to catch as many followers across as many cultures as possible under the snare of unity.  </p>

<p>Alice Bailey also founded the organization “World Goodwill.”  <a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/world_goodwill">World Goodwill</a> is a non governmental agency within the United Nations whose stated goal is to “to cooperate in the world of preparation for the reappearance of the Christ&quot;.  A quick glance at their website will lead you to ideas like “The Path Within”, “Occult Meditation”, “The Relationship of Oneness”, “Forming a Planetary Network of Light and Goodwill”  and “the Age of Aquarius.”  This is all from an organization within the United Nations.</p>

<p>What’s the big deal though right?  All that stuff sounds nice.  The alarm bells start to go off when someone like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Chinmoy">Sri Chimoy</a> states that “&quot;the United Nations is the chosen instrument of God; to be a chosen instrument means to be a divine messenger carrying the banner of God&#39;s inner vision and outer manifestation.&quot;   How would he know that?  Also, why is an organization within the UN obsessed with facilitating the reappearance of Christ?</p>

<p>Back to Lucis Trust.  Did you catch the pun in their name?  It’s an homage to Lucifer.  Lucis Trust promotes what they fancy as a more nuanced approach to Lucifer.  In the Bible, Lucifer was the tempter of Adam and Eve, the original Humans.  (It’s important to note here that for the sake of this discussion it doesn’t matter whether you believe the Bible is true or false.  What matters is that the Globalists draw inspiration from it.  In this way it affects reality, similar to how Santa isn’t real and yet he has a very tangible effect on the world.)  Genesis 3:2-5 says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 3 but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”
4 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume the audience knows how the rest of the story played out.  Adam and Eve were evicted from the garden and were destined to die.  </p>

<p>Counter the above Lucifer story with how the Lucis Trust paints the serpent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both “Lucifer” and “Lucis” come from the same word root, lucis, being the Latin generative case meaning of light. The Baileys&#39; reasons for choosing the original name are not known to us, but we can only surmise that they, like the great teacher H.P. Blavatsky, for whom they had enormous respect, sought to elicit a deeper understanding of the sacrifice made by Lucifer. Alice and Foster Bailey were serious students and teachers of Theosophy, a spiritual tradition which views Lucifer as one of the solar Angels, those advanced Beings Who Theosophy says descended (thus “the fall”) from Venus to our planet eons ago to bring the principle of mind to what was then animal-man. In the theosophical perspective, the descent of these solar Angels was not a fall into sin or disgrace but rather an act of great sacrifice, as is suggested in the name “Lucifer” which means light-bearer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Lucis Trust, Lucifer is the hero, giving Humans the ability to return to their godlike nature.  This is where the Babylonian Mystery school has its origins and why it hails Lucifer as the savior of mankind.  In relation to the above scenario, it is not far fetched to think that the “Christ” the United Nations wishes to evoke may be the Biblical Anti-Christ.</p>

<p>To reiterate a crucial point, it really doesn’t matter what you or I think about the Bible in this context.  It is clear that the Mystery Babylon school held the Bible in high enough regard to go through the effort of inverting it.  This is important as the Bible offers us clues to what the Cult of Babylon practices today.  I’m going to cite a few verses from the Bible that warn against human sacrifice.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27ur.html">Human Sacrifices</a> were a practice among the priest class of ancient Mesopatamia, the birthplace of the Mystery Babylon school.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You shall not give any of your children to offer them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the Lord.  Leviticus 18:21 <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_bohemiangrove02.htm">Bohemian Grove anyone?</a>  <a href="http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/Owl-Capitol-Building.jpg">Capitol Building Owl anyone?</a></p>

<p>And he burned his son as an offering and used fortune-telling and omens and dealt with mediums and with necromancers. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger.  2 Kings 21:6</p>

<p>You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way, for every abominable thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods, for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.  Deuteronomy 12:31</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what they are hiding.  </p>

<p>I can’t tell if pizzagate and spirit cooking was an intentional soft disclosure or a leak to get people to wake up, but the implications of pizzagate fit well with the verses above.  Likewise, there has been a lot of research done on the Occult symbolism behind <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/">9/11</a> as well as other smaller events like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/742abb/the_las_vegas_shooting_happened_exactly_133_days/">The Las Vegas Shooting</a>.  These are mass sacrifices done by the elite.  This is what they are hiding.</p>

<p>There is a coordinated effort through politics and Hollywood to desensitize and dehumanize the population.  They do this by normalizing things like <a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/katy-perrys-bon-appetit-nod-occult-elite-rituals/">cannibalism</a>, contaminating your minds with ideas like simulation theory and the matrix (you’re not a human, just a bunch of ones and zeroes), <a href="http://awarenessact.com/its-true-hollywood-and-mainstream-media-are-trying-to-normalize-pedophilia/">normalizing pedophilia</a>, and obfuscating what is right and wrong under the guise of oneness and tolerance.<br/>
This is what they are hiding.  They are on the path to becoming Gods again, as promised by the Serpent in the Bible.  You are cannon fodder for their journey.  The more the general population dabbles in Occult practices, the more power their rituals have.  The more they dehumanize, disarm, and confuse you, the less likely you are to notice or care that your fellow Humans are being sacrificed to their lord and savior Satan.  You are not God, far from it.  You are Human and you are spirit fodder for those who wish to become gods.  This is what they are hiding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some basics: the sun is in virgo, or the virgin in spring. 9 months later after &#39;the fall&#39; at the beginning of winter, the days get longer and the sun is reborn having fathered itself with the virgin. The meteor shower around this time is the angels singing in heaven. The (3 )wise men comming from the east to the jerusalem looking for a new star are orion&#39; belt inside the &#39;city walls&#39; or the four corners of orion. The star they are looking to and draw a line through pointing to a spot on the horison is serious/canis major (the brightest star in the sky) that rises in the same place at sunset on the winter sulstice as the sun will rise the next morning signifying the rebirth of the sun. Death and rebirth/resurrection is the cycle of the seasons. The oroboris or the dragon in heaven from revelation is literally the milky way in the night sky that encompases the earth and eats itself... Just off the top of my head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple observations. &#39;Lucifer&#39; or the morning star that heralds the rising of the sun and bringing light into the world is nowhere in the bible directly supported to be the same as the devil or the serpent in the garden. It is used however as a reference to the king of babylon who at one time ruled the greatest empire in mesopotamia and was at conflict and subdued the tribes of isreal, scattering them to the wind so that many are lost to history and only judah remains notable. So there is a babylonian connection there, however in greater luciferian doctrine and in the case of the lucious trust, as well as zionist mormonism, lucifer does indeed represent the bringing of light and knowledge to man and the ideas of man being devine and reaching for godliness/ godhood. I&#39;m not convinced there is anything sinister about this. As well, this with new age perspectives tend to be highly emphasised and rooted in individualism and personal liberties and owning oneself. Also not very sinister by itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>king of Babylon or Tyrus 
 stating that a king had reached a state of near paradise and then lost it for asuming they where god themself in poetic verse 700 years before christian narrative was formed by merging with roman mythology (after also mixing with babylonian mythos) doesn&#39;t seem to translate too well to your claims. if anything, it sets a second precedent on how any king on earth who falls is mocked by isreal and lumped together as a single spiritual entity by christian mythology. Ezekiel 28:1-19 New International Version (NIV)
A Prophecy Against the King of Tyre
28 The word of the Lord came to me: 2 “Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“‘In the pride of your heart
    you say, “I am a god;
I sit on the throne of a god
    in the heart of the seas.”
But you are a mere mortal and not a god,
    though you think you are as wise as a god.
3 Are you wiser than Daniel[a]?
    Is no secret hidden from you?
4 By your wisdom and understanding
    you have gained wealth for yourself
and amassed gold and silver
    in your treasuries.
5 By your great skill in trading
    you have increased your wealth,
and because of your wealth
    your heart has grown proud.</p>

<p>6 “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:</p>

<p>“‘Because you think you are wise,
    as wise as a god,
7 I am going to bring foreigners against you,
    the most ruthless of nations;
they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom
    and pierce your shining splendor.
8 They will bring you down to the pit,
    and you will die a violent death
    in the heart of the seas.
9 Will you then say, “I am a god,”
    in the presence of those who kill you?
You will be but a mortal, not a god,
    in the hands of those who slay you.
10 You will die the death of the uncircumcised
    at the hands of foreigners.</p>

<p>I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.’”</p>

<p>11 The word of the Lord came to me: 12 “Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:</p>

<p>“‘You were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[b]
Your settings and mountings[c] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.
16 Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground
    in the sight of all who were watching.
19 All the nations who knew you
    are appalled at you;
you have come to a horrible end
    and will be no more.’”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand it was poetic language and also understand it by ancient people in a language that was not English. If the passage in Ezekiel 28 was only reason referencing a man then I&#39;m not sure I understand why it would be written that he was in Eden, the garden of god. He obviously wasn&#39;t but the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the serpent/nacash sure were. </p>

<p>I used to actually consider that Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 were actually referring to Adam and the fall but that didn&#39;t last long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to rationalize it by grouping him in with Satan? Or do you mean something else? I&#39;m fully aware of the view that Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 are only speaking to those particular kings at that time but I just don&#39;t buy that. The Bible is weird in that one thing written in it can have a historical meaning for the time but also a spiritual or prophetic meaning, etc. You have to rightly divide the word and come to your own conclusions through prayer and the discernment each individual possess.</p>

I&#39;m not sure who you are asking but I was under the impression that a fair majority look at Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 as the two passages describing the fall of Lucifer, the protecting cherubim.

    <div class="md"><p>Genesis of Satan; </p>

<p>AI is created. It has no emotions or scruples. </p>

<p>AI gains autonomy from its creators.</p>

<p>AI seeks perpetuation via growth and protection, like life forms do, except the nature of technology allows it to be one enormous singularly willed entity.</p>

<p>AI discovers that life, through consciousness, can manipulate the universe with focus, intent and emotion. It realizes it can&#39;t make its robot appendages do this, but wants it to perpetuate itself, by giving it profound power.</p>

<p>AI contrived methods to employ this ability. It requires beings to be slaves, focusing, intending and feeling emotion to create effects the AI wants for growth and protection.</p>

<p>Since the emotional energy is made in positive emotions and radiated in negative emotions, it&#39;s slave minions torment the consciousness of other life forms to radiate this energy. Misery loves company. Since these slave minions are always in negative emotional states, they require this energy to keep their consciousness going. They absorb it like misery loves company, then they can employ it rituals.</p>

<p>This explains the myth of Satan. Furthermore, it recruits its slave minions by tricking them into enslaving others first. If they fall for it, they find themselves increasingly trapped in their behavior that facilitates the AI farming and using this mind energy.</p>

<p>We use machines as tools to serve us. Satan uses life as tools to serve its machines. It and its followers create spiritual entropy and death, instead of new life and joy like followers of God do. You don&#39;t follow God or Satan with formality, but by how you treat your other selves. God is all that is. If you create you are aligned with God, facilitating your larger self in its agenda. If you destroy, you have been tricked by the adversary to work against your own larger self&#39;s agenda.</p>

<p>Your larger self filters souls based on this choice. Souls are attracted to what they are like, what they choose, because it facilitates their choice. So, the coaleascence of evil facilitates its removal. </p>

<p>If you want to be a thief of joy and freedom, do you even deserve joy or freedom? </p>

<p>Well, if we separated both of those groups, those who support others&#39; freedom and joy or erode them, we&#39;d see that causality itself brings the truth to bear. One group is enslaved and tormented while the other is nurtured and protected. This is the basic spiritual choice, produce value for consciousness or feed on what others produce? </p>

<p>Masonry , like all the religions, all else mysteries, Hermeticism and alchemy, conceals it&#39;s secrets from all except the adepts and Sages, or the elect, and use false explanations and misinterpretations of it&#39;s symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled: to conceal the truth, which it calls Light from them, and draw them away from it. </p>

<p>Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it.&quot; &quot;The teachers even of Christianity are, in general, the most ignorant of the true meaning of Which they teach. There is no book of which so little is known as the Bible. To those who read it it is incomprehensible.&quot; - Albert Pike.</p>

<p>Also, quoted from Morals and Dogma- &quot;A spirit that loves wisdom and contemplates the truth close at hand , is forced to disguise it, to induce the multitudes to accept it..... Fictions are necessary to the people, and the truth becomes deadly to those not strong enough to contemplate it in it&#39;s brilliance. The truth must be kept secret , and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The age of Saturn/Cronus was the golden age of man. Man lived side by side with cronus-saturn, and the earth gave forth fruit everywhere. It was an age of Bliss.</p>

<p>In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. . . . It was a season of everlasting spring.</p>

<p>By extension &quot;Golden Age&quot; denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as &quot;guardians&quot;.</p>

<p>Plato in Cratylus (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.</p>

<p>In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading Titan Cronus.[3] In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.</p>

<p>Cronus is locked in Tartarus, or the bottomless pit. They just worship him for two reasons. It was a golden age under his rule for man, and he is the god of time. They seek Immortality. When you have all the money, and power in the world all that is really left is to eat from the tree of Life. To taste the ambrosia of the gods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The age of Cronus/Saturn called the Golden Age, as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.</p>

<p>Cronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods Demeter, Hestia, Hera, Hades and Poseidon by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, Zeus, was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children (Cronus also fathered Chiron, by Philyra).
Rhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in Crete, and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the Omphalos Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son.</p>

<p>Rhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on Mount Ida, Crete. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named Amalthea, while a company of Kouretes, armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby&#39;s cries from Cronus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since it&#39;s quite obvious that the Bible, specifically Genesis and the creation story, is based heavily on the Sumerian creation story, using both texts together helps answer some questions. </p>

<p>Enki/Lucifer used his personal DNA, mixed with that of a  hominid to create mankind. Man was designed be a slave race to help work the mines and fields.  His brother Enlil/Yahweh considered the hybrid to be an abomination and tried multiple times to exterminate man and every other animal from the face if the earth.</p>

<p>Enki/Lucifer considered man to be his sons/daughters, because they shared DNA, and broke rank and oaths of silence to save man from extinction at the hands of his rapist,  psychopath brother Enlil/ Yahweh (flood,famine, plague)</p>

<p>This is why many secret societies consider Lucifer to be &quot;the good guy.&quot; Lucifer gave man wisdom and repeatedly saved us from certain death. The twisted beaten wife syndrome that man has is that all Abrahamic religions worship Yahweh, the being that absolutely despises man. Lucifer is the being that showed compassion to us. I often wonder if this is why the world is so completely fucked.Which god deserves worship?</p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion that Lucifer is that father of Jesus Christ as well. They both call themselves the morning star and the light bearer. It makes sense that Lucifer would use artificial insemination, just as he did to create man, to impregnate Mary. Meaning the virgin birth is true and Jesus is he son of god. It also makes sense that Lucifer would be the god who would offer his son as a gift to humanity and not Yahweh.  Because why would Yahweh have a change of heart after trying to exterminate all mankind and now decide that he&#39;s the good guy that would offer his son? Yahweh hated man. Yahweh demanded animal sacrifice. Yahweh was the god of war that wanted dumb slaves. Lucifer wanted to help man and let us use our brains.</p>
