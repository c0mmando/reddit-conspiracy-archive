Also that&#39;s not a body they&#39;re carrying, I believe it&#39;s a bag. Very well could be a body, but I have my doubts. Please take a deep breath. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is more likely to me that the entire explanation of Mirarmar SWAT in the building at the same time as the shooter is fabricated in order to explain away the eyewitness reports of multiple shooters with differing descriptions. In my opinion, if Nicholas Cruz wasnt the only shooter, than whoever else pulled the trigger doesnt matter, who paid them does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree some people can pay others to do this stuff but I cant believe people who were in the force for so many years will get the call that they now need to go into a school and shoot a bunch of kids.</p>

<p>But I do believe that they probably had multiple people shooting, but not the people who have been apart of the force for most of their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI gets tipped off about Cruz, handler gets sets in to aid in his plans and ensure he goes through it.

<p>SWAT families threatened or they are blackmailed, eyewitness reports armed man with guns shooting. Drill comes to light. David hogg is created.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really get how an alternative explanation would work. They were in on it, so then their department suspended and publicly embarrassed them? </p>
