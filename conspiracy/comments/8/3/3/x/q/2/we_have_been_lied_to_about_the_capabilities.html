<p>The historians have tried to paint a picture of northeast Asia as rustic and wooden. When that couldn&#39;t be the furthest thing from the truth. We see huge megalithic ruins far north.</p>

<p>We see very fine brick work often times 2 meters thick. And the surviving temples often have cast iron floors that never rust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really believe the plurality of the population is &quot;waking up&quot; to something when we&#39;re more divided and polarized today than ever before, most people believe whatever mainstream media and any other authority throws at them, and people are generally more interested in the Kardashians than the fact that slavery and genocide is more prolific today than at any time in recorded history?</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m sorry, my friend.  At the best, the population is accelerating its descent into blissful ignorance and spiritual slumber.  At the worst, the chakra balancing you reference, and other practices of the occult, are hastening the process, if not totally responsible for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reprimanded and fired from my job as a data scientist by a politically-vocal liberal HR manager and Director of Operations because I made the comment that &quot;liberalism is a mental illness,&quot; and because I had a Bible at my desk.  I can&#39;t sue since Virginia is a An-Will state, but I was given the reason that &quot;I just wasn&#39;t a fit with the &lt;company-name&gt; culture.&quot; I was damn good at my job -- I now own my own consulting business, and am currently on a contract earning $70/hr, 40 hrs/wk, for 700 hours -- with a line-up of other work.</p>

<p>I remember a time when I could be as politically outspoken as I want, and share my faith whenever it came up, because we were all adults, and understood that people were welcome to believe whatever they wanted.  That isn&#39;t the case, anymore.</p>

<p>You can be as skeptical as you want, but if you think employers can&#39;t be vindictive and spiteful -- especially liberal employers who&#39;ve been offended by the conservative politics and religion of an employee -- you&#39;re putting your head in the sand with regard to how toxic certain settings can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, Do you really think a highly conservative workplace would keep me if I started saying things like &quot;conservativism is a mental disorder&quot; and had a statue of Baphomet on my desk? Aside from the fact that one comment plus a bible definitely sounds like r/thathappened I definitely think that someone holding extremist views like that is not welcome in the workplace. At the very least it&#39;s only a matter of time until drama starts happening because of a comment and then the whole workplace sucks to be in. I&#39;ve seen it happen time and time again. If you can&#39;t leave your politics and religion alone for long enough to make it through the work day you don&#39;t belong on my crew, doesn&#39;t matter the belief.</p>

<p>I think the biggest unknown isn&#39;t necessarily the <em>when</em>, but the <em>what</em> -- meaning, <em>what</em> does the snap look like?  <em>What</em> happens after things snap?  <em>What</em> are the consequences?</p>

<p>Also, <em>who</em> gains as a result?  <em>How</em> do we know that any major upheaval isn&#39;t itself engineered by those currently maintaining the dam in the river?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely not saying we are 100% doing the best we’ve ever done, just that as of right now we are being more mindful as a species because the majority sees exactly how destructive we are to the environment and ourselves and have become active </p>

<p>We still have civil wars but no nuclear or world wars because at this point it’s not just affecting us but them too and as much as they hate it they are forced to sit in the boat along side. This may explain the current space race and many other things as well. </p>

<p>I agree with this and have the same question It’s true if only a few gain then we all lose in the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To your last (and most important) point: </p>

<p>Incorrect. It is the path to self alignment with the One. Christianity has truth, hidden in a sea of lies. No different to mainstream (or even non-mainstream for that matter) religious beliefs. Anything peddled by humans is flawed, based on the premise that humans are flawed. We are here to experience divinity, not here to waste time worrying about what other people do or don&#39;t do, or what they decide to tell us. </p>

<p>To your first:</p>

<p>Us and them is nothing new, and has always been there since humanity&#39;s inception. What you have experienced w.r.t to losing your job is a symptom of the same issue. I understand it sucks, but you can look at it as a message from God. Your job sucked. It was not there for your highest good. If they cannot accept your beliefs, why should you work there? I wouldn&#39;t want to work with them if they can&#39;t accept a different opinion. Better things are coming. Trust. </p>

<p>As for people waking up, they are. You don&#39;t realise it because you are looking at it from the perspective of the media. When it comes down to it, people are more aware of their health, more aware of spirituality (true belief, not through indoctrination), more aware of the machinations of the dark elite (there are grey zones within the higher circles too; not all are pedophiles and torturers) etc etc. </p>

<p>and the &quot;not rusting, cast iron floor&quot; claim is dumb. people maintain those floors and protect them from getting rusted. show me a picture of a cast iron floor that was left to the open environment and not rusted. you can&#39;t. the last photo of the &quot;steel columns&quot; shows walls stabilized by archaeologists with iron bars. and do any of those other photos really show &quot;ancient&quot; construction? <em>shrug</em> maybe, maybe not. there&#39;s no sources. </p>

<p>So in relation to your title: nobody depicts all our ancestors as dumb brutes, Plato is still considered a great Philosopher, Da Vinci is still considered one of the best minds to have ever existed, and Eratosthenes measured the Earth&#39;s radius using a well and a rod more than 2000 years ago.</p>

<p>In relation to your post: I can&#39;t for the life of me understand your point. You go from one artifact to another without explaining what their relation is, from chapels to statues to pictures of stones in unnamed imgur albums.

    <div class="md"><p>That really depends on where you went to school and how attentive your were so I can&#39;t comment on that.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, I&#39;d say there&#39;s no way I&#39;d have thought that when any history class shows how ingenious man needed to be in order to survive (learning how to make and keep fire, grinding stones to make tools, inventing writing...), conquer (forts defenses, weapons engineering...), etc... Any history class is accompanied by a list of human technological achievements that were used for bad and/or good. Did you think man used to be ignorant when studying maths/physics ? The Pythagorean theorem is ~4000 years old.</p>

<p>And all of this is studied during the early years of secondary school (again, depending on the country but basically when students are 11-12 years old)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thats true of course, but there are lies in all school textbooks, not just omissions or inaccurate data although, those are plentiful as well. To the best of my knowledge there is no school textbook that doesnt paint an inaccurate or false picture of the ancestors of humankind. 
There is a lot more to ancient history than the so called &quot;dawn of intelligence&quot;. Humans have been a lot smarter for a lot longer than most people would believe. Also, none of these textbooks get but a tiny bit into the occult and secret socities(which are very important parts of our history) and when they do its always a misrepresentation or just a quick look at the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is both. The teachers are ignorant as most people are and the people that write the textbook are likely ignorant and have guidelines to follow when writing these books. When it comes to textbooks its not really the case that we are being intentionally lied to(not by the writers anyway, though im sure there are exceptions to that) its more so that the lies that are within the textbooks have been proliferated in the minds of people for so long that many people would not even think to question their validity. In this way lies have taken the form of truth in minds of the people, including most teachers and the people that write these books.</p>

<p>The lies in textbooks were told a long time ago, itd be impossible to pinpoint exactly who told it. Is that a claim you can back up. You know for a fact that no one lied about any of the information in these school textbooks? Scientis lie and fudge numbers more of then you seem to think.</p>

<p>Also, what field of research are you talking about? I wasnt referring to any particular field, just to the general falsehood of the information in textbooks.</p>

<p>You want a keyword? United fruit company. If you cant find any lies in the history textbooks about them then you probably cant find anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were talking about history classes and systematic lies being told by someone with an agenda. You&#39;re listing a 20th century thing where a company was hiding their fuckups. You yourself are saying the stuff was told a long time ago. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s gonna be shady stuff, but this is not an example for a systematic lie being told by scientists.</p>

<p>You know why I&#39;m asking for any evidence? Because I currently believe there is none but would be interested in anything that would show me otherwise.</p>

<p>And for all your questions:</p>

<p>The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever. However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn&#39;t been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious reasoning.</p>

<p>Example: Bertrand declares that a teapot is, at this very moment, in orbit around the Sun between the Earth and Mars, and that because no one can prove him wrong, his claim is therefore a valid one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah yeah ive read all about the logical fallacies. People often site these thinking that they are properly utilizing &quot;logic&quot; but often lack the ability see when they themselves are being illogical. The disinclination to disprove a claim does not render it valid OR invalid nor does the disinclination to prove something render the claim invalid. It works both ways. You missed the point of me asking you if you could back up your claim. I wasnt dissmissing your claim, just questiining it? You said that i made the claim so i should back it up.  So I wondered if you would be willing you were to  backup your own claim. You werent of course as most people who make dishonest inquiries wont be. There really isnt any such thing as the &quot;burden of proof&quot;  on the internet in a conversation between strangers as there is nothing obligating me to provide proof to you. I can choose to do so or i can choose not to do so. If i choose not to, my claim will be rendered moot, but not invalid so it would be illogical to dismiss it  and it would be illogical to just accept it, without any prior evidence that is. A lack of evidence(or in your case a percieved lack of evidence) does not render a claim invalid. They only real way to KNOW wether a claim is invalid or invalid is to research it and test it against the facts youve gathered. Problem is, absolute facts are hard to find because in this day and age facts must be tested as well.</p>

<p>Its irrelevant whether or not you believe there is evidence, it only matters if there matters if you KNOW there is no evidence and the only way to do that is to look.</p>

<p>Also, i never said the lies spread in textbooks were systematic(unless you believe telling lies with the purpose of misleading is systematic) nor did i say that they were told by &quot;someone with an agenda&quot;. Though i will say it now, due to how propaganda works its likely that there are lies that were spread systematically. I dont know that for a fact. What i do know for a fact is that there are lies in text book and there are agendas behind them.</p>

<p>And the fact that you think the united fruit company  was just a &quot;company trying fi hide its fuck ups&quot; proves to me that you arent to throurough in your research, if youve done any at all.</p>

<p>This whole conversation started with you making a claim that I challenged due to the lack of no evidence. I wonder why you had time to write that long text but none to point me to anything substantial. </p>

<p>If you want to be taken serious, you should feel obligated to back up your claims. This is how humanity and science gained scientific knowledge that brought you your smartphone and sent people to the moon. </p>

<p>We were taught the Neandethals had no language--which has now been proven to be false. (I never believed it.) We also know some of them built boats and sailed. There were never more than 60,000 in all of Europe. Yet they had art, buried their dead, had mastered fire. (Evidence was found in a French cave.) And yet they&#39;re always portrayed as grunting, stooped idiots. And there&#39;s a theory now they may have just suffered from cretinism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you tell some recent anthropologists, historians or archeologists which tell us some of those things you claimed?</p>

<p>Well in the 19th century and in the early 20th century there were several people, qualifying the neanderthals as primitive beings compared to homo sapiens, but at least since some racists tried to use them for their ideology by relating several ethnicies or races close to the neanderthals i haven&#39;t seen any serious and halfway educated person claiming that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it often comes from the modern/recent history white/western superiority movement, we can&#39;t have these &quot;savages&quot; of the past actually being acknowledged as humans, very capable and intelligent ones at that while conducting terrible acts of inhumanity, like slavery, colonialism, imperialism and exterminations.
Instead, if we make the <strong>other</strong>  to be less intelligent/capable than <strong>us</strong>, it makes it much easier to justify the actions of our recent past and justify things of tomorrow (e.g. NGOs <em>saving</em> developing countries, look at what missionaries did to natives in the name of helping people).</p>

<p>The exact same approach is used by the mass media to make eating animals more palatable.
If we all agreed that they were as capable as our pets (dogs, cats, parrots, etc, for which there exist huge amounts of evidence), then putting them in prisons and into gas chambers would be a terrible act. Objectification and dehumanization have been used in history well bt powers to manipulate and manufacture consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP conflated two things.</p>

<p>I do believe that we&#39;re missing pieces of history, and that there&#39;s a good chance we had advanced civilizations pre-ancient Egypt. </p>

<p>With that being said, I don&#39;t think anyone is hiding anything from us, except maybe Egyptologists, but that isn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>

<p>In terms of historical recordings, almost all of the information is lost. We have multiple flood stories which may be based on real events that ushered the end of the Younger Dryas period, but that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>I disagree with OP about the lies and misinformation, however. The only people I could possibly ascribe to trying to stand in the way of new information are Egyptologists, but even then it isn&#39;t some grand conspiracy. I believe many people in this field discount new evidence, for example that the Sphynx could be tens of thousands of years old, not because of some grand conspiracy but because it would invalidate their life&#39;s work.</p>

<p>To conclude: lost historical information probably due to a cataclysm of sorts, and now we have some historians that don&#39;t want to accept new historical evidence because it would mean admitting their interpretations of ancient civilization are wrong.</p>

<p>It kinda weeds out the crazy stuff from the stuff that is worth talking about. This subreddit should not be fictional or based on feelings, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that it is a pretty mainstream thought that as long ago as 50,000 years ago humans had more intellectual potential than humans today? That we don&#39;t know why other hominids died out, and that we know they were advanced and interbred with homo sapien sapien. The introduction of most early technology probably wasn&#39;t even by homo sapien sapien and we just happened to be the first to agriculture and won the war of attrition.</p>

<p>50,000 years ago humans were master trackers, could identify smells, memorize geographical locations, had knowledge of plants, rudimentary manufacturing, agricultural knowledge, hunting knowledge, and were entirely self-sufficient. Technology has just allowed mentally inept people to proliferate.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m sorry, my friend.  At the best, the population is accelerating its descent into blissful ignorance and spiritual slumber.  At the worst, the chakra balancing you reference, and other practices of the occult, are hastening the process, if not totally responsible for it.</p>
