<p>It is super weird how DNC Dems never wanted anybody talking about it, though, even after the idea started getting seeded around that it was &quot;the Russians&quot;.</p>

There was such a massive push back against that (it of course has faults) but fuck, the news instantly calling it debunked and it being removed from trending on all social media...since when does google/Facebook/Twitter care about a pizza shop enough to use its collective power to stop that.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Pizzagate got similarly intense pushback, but I guess that didn&#39;t set off as many alarm bells for me because it was pretty out there, without any evidence of an actual crime, just a bunch of weird stuff strung together by a disturbing -- but hyperpoliticized and still largely speculative -- narrative.</p>

<p>Similar pushback against the Seth Rich story was a lot harder for me to wrap my head around, because it really <em>is</em> an unsolved murder with no other leads, and some compelling circumstantial evidence that there could be a link with WikiLeaks, but journalists seemed bizarrely intent on burying the story instead of properly investigating that angle and ruling it out like you&#39;d expect based on journalistic norms. It made absolutely no sense. And yet here came hordes of people flooding into communities they weren&#39;t part of, insisting &quot;nothing to see here&quot;, guilt-tripping with emotionally manipulative garbage <em>straight from a DNC operative sent to represent the family</em>, jumping to the conclusion that I and anyone else talking about the case were pro-Trump nutbags (when that couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth in my case), stubbornly refusing to cede ground on even a single point in conversations that felt nothing like normal human conversation without ulterior motive... So creepy. I&#39;ll never forget it.</p>
