        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last week, an ex Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned in a shocking assignation attack that all sensible observers attribute to Putin&#39;s regime.</p>

<p>At the time, despite it being horrible, it didn&#39;t seem that worrying. </p>

<p>However, in the last few days it has transpired that a police officer was also hospitalized in the attack and the poison used (which they still haven&#39;t named) might be much more contagious and deadly then we were initially told.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 500 people who dined at the same restaurant that the ex Russian spy is believed to have bene poisoned at were being told &#39;to wash all their belongings&#39;.</p>

<p>People who live in the town where the attack happened are seeing men from the army in fully sealed boiler suits.  </p>

<p>Could this poison attack be a lot worse than we&#39;re being told?</p>

<p>Seeing the British Terrorist Spooks knocking off their own retired traitors for the propaganda value of having &quot;evil&quot; Putin on the front pages of your propaganda rags is tired. </p>

<p>MI5 and MI6 regularly terrorize and murder their own citizens to maintain the dystopian surveillance state and focus attention on enemies of their corporate masters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s an ongoing investigation. They found trace amounts of it inside of a couple restaurants, and told the people who went there during that time to clean their clothes as a precaution just to make sure they won&#39;t get any kind of poisoning. The U.K. government also deployed the British military and others who are trained to deal with chemical attacks to help with the situation. </p>

<p>Things don&#39;t happen instantly, but they are working incredible fast to try and figure out who did this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they recently found trace amounts of the nerve agent in those areas. Maybe it was an aerosol spray of Sarin that traveled through the air to those areas that weren&#39;t fully investigated yet by the army and whoever else. </p>

<p>They did say it was trace amounts so this is just a type of precaution telling people who were in those areas to wash their clothes and belongings just to be safe. </p>

<p>If it was far worse the people around that area would feel those affects of the nerve toxin and should have to get medically treated. This nerve agent did not kill anyone and the main target is in stable condition so he survived not sure about his daughter but at least 21 people were sent to the hospital. So it&#39;s not the most dangerous type of nerve agent that would actually kill someone very fast like the NX nerve agent used against Kim Jong Un&#39;s half brother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those weren&#39;t even Kim Jong Un&#39;s agents. They were just random women from different countries who were trained a lot of times to do a prank spraying a liquid in peoples face and covering it with a cloth for 100$ each time. </p>

<p>Neither of the attackers were from North Korea except for the actual 4 agents who trained the women to do the prank but they never disclosed they were North Koreans. Luckily the women didn&#39;t get killed by the same thing. </p>

<p>Really smart way actually to get people to commit an assassination without realizing it, but now those women face the death penalty. You should read about that attack it&#39;s on Wikipedia.  </p>

<p>This looks more and more like a smear campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what I don&#39;t understand is why putin could be so idiot to order the assassination a few weeks before his re-election as president. he could just wait a month. or even better, just order the killing in a more &quot;simple&quot; way.</p>

<p>said this, all these presidents of powerful countries have the option of killing people they don&#39;t like or they think are a threat for their country.</p>

<p>So is not a discourse of putin will never do this and that, is just that it make no sense to do it like this and at this moment in time.</p>

<p>Seeing the British Terrorist Spooks knocking off their own retired traitors for the propaganda value of having &quot;evil&quot; Putin on the front pages of your propaganda rags is tired. </p>

<p>MI5 and MI6 regularly terrorize and murder their own citizens to maintain the dystopian surveillance state and focus attention on enemies of their corporate masters. </p>
