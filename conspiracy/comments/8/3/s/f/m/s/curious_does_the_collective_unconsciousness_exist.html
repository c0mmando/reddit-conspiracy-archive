    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of collective unconscious is that it is something that people of a cultural background share. Other words are l&#39;eprit de loix (spirit of the people) or a Zeitgeist (time mind). This collective unconscious is a sort of unconscious ideology that takes shape in fears and violent reactionary positions. There are then two ways to discover what the collective unconscious of a politick is: either deep introspection or the rehtoric of proto-fascist leaders. Proto-fascist leaders espouse the fears of the people for power and capitalize on the collective unconscious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all true. But the leaves, being an extention of the tree, are also the tree itself. The part helps make up the whole. The bark is the tree, as well as being the bark. The branches are the tree, as well as being branches. Without the tree the leaves wouldn&#39;t even exist. Sure, we can refer to all of the parts when they&#39;re put together as &quot;the absolute&quot;/&quot;God&quot;, but all the parts by themselves, despite their apparent limitations, also carry that essence/spirit of the whole within it. Like the DNA in an individual cell contains the information to recreate the entire organism, ones own individual (sub/un)consciousness contains the information to recreate the entire universe and every possible expression of it. And that&#39;s the essence of God there. Limitless potential within a limited vessel.</p>

<p>Tree of life is a model for how we are one but split, if you kill a leaf the tree perseveres.</p>

<p>Return to source and you can sprout a new tree with equivalent leaf(s). The details I understand from human cloning provides solid logic to the theory, also a good motive to separate the cloners from noncloners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of people fulfill desires, literally millions around the world will be fulfilling desires as we speak.</p>

<p>The rest don&#39;t because they sit and expect it handed on a plate rather than tune into that subconsciousness and try and find what your looking for.</p>

<p>Like it or not, subconscious is proven, there is evidence of collective consciousness. It&#39;s a theory that is at least as close to the traditional god if not closer, think about a prayer, are you praying to a god or focusing your subconscious mind? The technique of prayer is exactly the same as how a person would speak to their subconscious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. In some areas the collective unconscious seems to be the driving force behind action, but on other areas it&#39;s effect is practically negligible. It exists as an underlying property to the universe, and if every conscious individual were to act passively then the collective unconscious would absolutely dictate reality. But everyone doesn&#39;t act passively. As conscious individuals, we generally act actively, with a mix of passive action in there via subconscious programming (ie: consumerism, politicism, the daily grind etc).<br/>
Like boats in the ocean. If they all sat around with their engines off then the tides and currents would dictate all action of the boats. But boats use their engines. And in doing so that provides the potential for action against the underlying currents, or enhanced action in utilising the currents. And then the action of the boats themselves ultimately effects the underlying tides and currents themselves to some extent.<br/>
This is a decent analogy, but not perfect, because boats aren&#39;t a product of the water cycle. They were introduced to it externally. Whereas conscious individuals are a direct product of consciousness, which acts as a universal underlayer, giving rise to matter, which in turn gives rise to physics, which gives rise to chemistry, which gives rise to biology, and psychology, and sociology yada yada. It&#39;s all systems within systems; emergent, yet in their own right independent, of their preceding systems. All ultimately stemming from the same source, but exhibiting their own properties with respect to their own parameters and limitations. And that&#39;s fractality.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the analogy. Do you think astrology could sort of work in the same way? As maybe the &#39;fates&#39; or energetic alignment when we are born influence our personality and probable life path unless we consciously work on self improvement or addressing our shadow side?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, thanks for reading! Yeah, I do think astrology follows the same general mechanics. I used to write off astrology as bullshit though until very recently. I mean, obviously all the generic stuff you read in the newspapers and magazines is nonsense, but recently I&#39;ve been reading a little into Vedic astrology and considering it from the holographic conscious universe perspective - which I believe the Hindu religion actually describes, albeit via metaphor - and I think there definitely seems to be some general underlying influence with how one lives their life in accordance with the alignment of particular planets and astronomical bodies on their date of birth. Ones own birth is an absolute fixed point in time and space. And due to the quantum entangled nature of spacetime there will be further points through time in which the planets&#39; positional influence will resonate or harmonise with that point of birth (constructive interference). These times will likely be times of high energy and momentum. Consequently, there will also be points through time which exhibit dissonance with that point of birth (destructive interference). But above all, despite the general guidelines that astrological charts can show your life to follow, these are not absolute. You are a conscious individual and you completely have the ability to go against whatever subconscious guidelines may exist within your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people here are confusing collective unconsciousness with consciousness.  The collective unconsciousness is the akashic records of all our collective experiences, our collective memory. Consciousness is the difference between what the eyes or the senses are physically/unconsciously picking up and what we actually pay attention to. You can look straight ahead, but in fact be checking out the tits of the woman walking past you. You can be surrounded by noise and conversation, but only hear what your partner is saying. The consciousness that experiences is the same in all beings, that is the collective consciousness, if you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, God is literally everything and anything that ever is, was, and will be (though this timeline is an illusion). We are all one, everything is one, occurring at all times, in the form of Now. We are the finite figures of an infinite Source that is entirely interconnected. The idea that we are different is the ego, something which everyone has to a degree, and it creates the illusion of self. Being unconscious is being spiritually disconnected from the Source, so I say it&#39;s more personal. However, a society of people who are unconscious can create more of this unconsciousness.</p>
