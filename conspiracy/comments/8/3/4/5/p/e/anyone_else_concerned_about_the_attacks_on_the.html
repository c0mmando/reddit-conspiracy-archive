       The latest lawsuit against Google highlights this. Supposedly they won't hire white/Asian males.

       Maybe I'm stretching here but it feels like white people are soon to be the oppressed.  Every white person seems to be lumped in with the racists.

       I hate the term 'reverse racism'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that it is implying to the original, historical racism in Western cultures (particularly the US), with racism against blacks.  But; I feel the term is incorrect.  It's just plain racism.  Judging an individual based solely on the color of their skin, is just plain racism, and evil.  Whichever direction it's going in.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the male aspect, until recently, it was just CIS male.  I recently have noticed pushback from the feminist movement against white male gays, which they were allied with for last couple of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this bothers me greatly, as it is undoing all the work that has been put into cleaning up the race and gender relations issues over the last 5 to 6 decades.  It is dividing us back to the point of segregation.  And could take another couple of decades to correct again once all the hooplah is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the plus side... I have been seeing signs of the alt left starting to eat itself.  Not only have the feminist movement started to attack white gay men, but also alienating white female members, at least half their number.  I expect 2018 to be the year that we get to say, was when we witnessed the beginning of the great SJW meltdown.  Unfortunately, I don't think it will be as quick a process as I would like.
      </p>

       To those of you suddenly left out in the cold, alone and scared.  Join us on the reasonable center line.  We will welcome you, give you cookies, and then show you where your good ideas and Nobel efforts turned into idiologies that frustrated, harmed, and embarrassed the majority of citizens of Western society.

       Reverse racism implies that the only future racism, due to the past, can only be against blacks or other oppressed people. I mean it is absolutely disgusting, the fact anyone discriminates on skin color is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree that gay has been very normalized now which is great! But this movement has gone way too far. There is never enough for the SJW and it is all a power grab. I agree more people are joining the center, or kicked out of the left, but it seems as if the center is default conservatives. Either way can't wait to laugh and watch as the SJW movement crumbles in slow-mo over the next year.

       I think people are using the term incorrectly nowadays. I tried to explain my thoughts on what reverse racism used to mean, but had to delete it, as I realised my points weren't clear enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, as you say, racism against white people is still racism. It's a peculiarly American affliction, the belief that white people can't suffer from racism.

       If you look at recent events as a pendulum then it doesn't seem so bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get used to a certain standard of living, and when things get worse they push back. When you benefit at others expense and an external force attempts to equalize the benefits for everyone then you'll push back.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look stop looking at racial/gender inequality you'll see that literacy across the world has never been higher (in terms of percentage and sheer number). Poverty is at an all time low, and even those below the poverty line have support through various private organizations.

       It's political correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
       In their view, you've got oppressors and victims. Oppressors are the majority or the people who they see as having too much power. Everyone else is either a victim or oppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In real life, this translates into a reversal of discrimination and stereotyping. Make a joke about women, gays or any ethnic group and it's politically incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a joke about hetero white males, Christians etc. and it's OK because you're "contributing to equality".
      </p>
      <p>
       But what this really adds up to is just trading one kind of intolerance for another, one stereotype for another. It's more of a novelty than a solution and it splits people up into a bunch of tiny little groups instead of building any real sense of community.

       there's a temptation, when listening to the media, to take, the somewhat new celebration of art and culture that comes from the non white male (minority) perspective as some sort of threat.

       it probably seems disproportionate given its relative absence in the recent past.

       Some of us here, who realize that the real problem with the world is wealth, or lack of, are probably disappointed to be confronted as if guilty of oppression we likely had no part in.

       Crying about both racism and "reverse racism" will play into the hands of divide-&amp;-conquer politics.  Suck it up and fight against the controllers, not the masses.  Otherwise getting caught up in a race-war will contribute to our fight negatively and make our points dismissable.

       Also, nazism has been on the rise alongside sjwism.  A quick glance at voat or 4chan will easily reveal this polarized fascism in our youths (yes it's mostly edgey kids).  So that is to say that the attacks are not entirely unfounded - but it is moreso an issue that these attacks are purposefully misdirected at libertarians and alternative-media (hence all these recent youtube channel takedowns)

       Explain. With evidence. Don’t just say things and not back them up. I have not noticed this what so ever. What I have noticed is black men being more celebrated and less degraded which I think is fantastic and will help lift the African American youth culture today to grow stronger tomorrow.

       Of course but the people who use that are crazy feminist, and no one really listens to them, or takes them seriously, I laugh in their faces all the time, and I am all about woman and woman equality as I am a woman, but no one is bringing down men if anything men are bringing down men, by keeping the stigma that men need to continue to be ultra masculine, I think certain men are afraid that if they don’t act a certain way they will be perceived as weak and as a society we are trying to break down that barrier because it is insane to hold men to a standard of being strong , burly,  always masculine men forced to mask their feelings. It’s absolutely ridiculous. My boyfriends fucking parents got divorced after 40 years of marriage and he cried a tiny bit and apologized to me for not being manly, and being weak and letting me see him cry and I had to assure him that society makes him feel that way and it is okay for him to cry most definitely when something rocks his whole world. It mad me incredibly sad to think so many men repress their feelings because it’s not masculine what a load of fucking bullshit. You can fuck me like a savage and talk about your feelings. You can lift weights and have a nice haircut, maybe even use some product, you can I don’t know chip down a damn tree and watch a romantic comedy and shocker enjoy it. It’s called being a human and finding balance.

       The are plethora of no zones for whites in America. If a white goes to the wrong neighborhood in LA, Baltimore,Miami, NOLA, etc. they are putting their lives in danger. This is a far cry from a crooked cop shooting a black guy in a white neighborhood scenario. It is accepted as fact that white people should avoid these areas because of the local population.

       I know some people live in mixed neighborhoods. I have lived in a neighborhood where white people usually don't live. Being there as a lone white guy(before sunrise/after sunset) isn't a great idea. I still did it because I used public buses/trains. That being said there are places I won't go.

       not at all. There will always be dopey groups who the media will hold up as an example of all (fill in the word). 
examples:   Let's say BLM is 10K people (it's not), thats no-one in the scheme of 350M.
                  And who hasn't heard of westboro baptist church, a bus full of trailer park christians from florida, held up as an example of christians.

       Now ask yourself, do you know anyone directly that spews any of that crap from either side of the isle?

      <pre><code>I'm in direct contact with thousands of people per month, from all walks of life that don't espouse anything that the media would have us believe is somehow "mainstream"

       Yeah so, how is this a conspiracy theory? I know this sub has become a tilted right crybox but I'd like at least the
       <em>
        illusion
       </em>
       of posts being about conspiracies.

       Here is a conspiracy element.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Why is our country being pushed by media outlets to divide use so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who?  Who's agenda is pushing this divide?
      </p>
      <p>
       What?  What is the reasoning behind the agenda.  What's the end game when we are worn out fighting each other?
      </p>
      <p>
       When?  When will they make their move to "fix" our society, while simultaneously putting us under more decisive control.
      </p>
      <p>
       There, this just turned from "right wing cry babying", into a conspiracy theory on how to break a populace down in preparation for accepting socialist control.

       this is why you see the rise of movements like MGTOW and TheRedPill.

       It's political correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
       In their view, you've got oppressors and victims. Oppressors are the majority or the people who they see as having too much power. Everyone else is either a victim or oppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In real life, this translates into a reversal of discrimination and stereotyping. Make a joke about women, gays or any ethnic group and it's politically incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make a joke about hetero white males, Christians etc. and it's OK because you're "contributing to equality".
      </p>
      <p>
       But what this really adds up to is just trading one kind of intolerance for another, one stereotype for another. It's more of a novelty than a solution and it splits people up into a bunch of tiny little groups instead of building any real sense of community.
