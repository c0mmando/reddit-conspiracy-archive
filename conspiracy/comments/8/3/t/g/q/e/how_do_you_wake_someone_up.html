        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just had a conversation with a co-worker about people in power having ill intentions and trying to manipulate the masses using social engineering and propaganda. I used examples from history of Elites manipulating the masses to control them. Such as World War II being financed by International bankers. I gave him modern-day example of such as George Soros, Bilderberg Group,  shareblue, and the Koch brothers. He basically refused to acknowledge any of my view points and called it a stretch. </p>

<p>He asked how come none of the people at the top have come forward? Why the masses of people like us conspiracy theorists haven&#39;t created a movement yet.
He also asked why should he care if he can&#39;t stop it or it doesn&#39;t affect him directly... </p>

<p>I basically countered all of his points but he refused to give up....it&#39;s annoying when someone like that refuses to give up.</p>

<p>I believe in the right to have guns but I was playing Devil&#39;s Advocate about gun control for fun with him.  He just refused to concede any of the points I was making. How do you get through to people like this who refuse to see that the citizens of our country are being manipulated by both political parties?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vintage is right, its a gradual process. If you hit someone with a million facts at once, or some too scary to even consider upfront it scares them. Its easier to call someone else crazy and continue on with your day then re evaluate the world you live in. Also, people don&#39;t go into a debate to have their minds changed. They are there to defend their own beliefs, not to open up to new ones. Humans are frustrating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say they aren&#39;t intelligent enough. Its a willingness to accept a mass change in perception. And I try not to use the terms good and evil as such things don&#39;t really exist. Many people wouldn&#39;t see &quot;elites&quot; as the source of their &quot;evil&quot;. They&#39;re the source of their problems. But the problem is, we are all integrated into the system, regardless of awareness of the situation. Most people dont have problems directly caused by ruling classes. Interestingly the ruling class doesnt cause problems for individuals, but for the planet as a whole, or to those distant enough away as to not bother the people being directly subjegated. After all, a happy populace is a compliant one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned long ago not to try to wake people up.</p>

<p>There is a great Alan Watts quote that I think is pretty spot on in regards to this:</p>

<p>&quot;I realize the less I preach the more likely I am to be heard.&quot;</p>

<p>And I think it&#39;s very true. People hate to be preached to. People hate to be &quot;wrong&quot;, especially when it has to do with how they are living their lives.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to wake people up. Let them wake up on their own. They will eventually start connecting the dots, it may just take them a very long time, or they will be content living their lives the way they have always lived them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q anon is prob the best way to wake some one up. Just tell take q intel leaks as your own seer prophecies. Once said person starts to believe you and see you as messiah, then you tell them the truth and call them a gullible idiot.</p>

<p>Then when there worldview crumbles and they sink into despair/nihilism, sweep in and help them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are people crazy as it sounds who don’t want people to see the world for what it is and sometimes talking about certain things say for instance in you place of work can cause you problems. In my younger days I tried to show anyone and everyone the truth and my career suffered for it I feel. Not trying to sound looney but yeah that shit happens all the time to folk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to give them a clue, something that gets them motivated to research for themselves and have some ownership of it. Like poopy says, people don&#39;t like to be preached to or be wrong. But if you give them that one thing that they are motivated to research and find out the truth on their own, then they can take ownership of it and hopefully continue to research other areas. One of the things that did it for me was flouride. If it affects our daily lives and that of our children, we become motivated to learn the truth. I continually plant ideas on FB. Post meme&#39;s or little tidbits of information that maybe someone will look into. That is the only way. You can&#39;t beat them over the head with it, they will just resist. And when you do get into a discussion with others, make sure and know your subject matter thoroughly, and do your best to sound calm, sane and credible. Don&#39;t rant like some crazy lunatic. Give them all the evidence, but if they argue and resist, you gotta let it go. You can lead a horse to water.......</p>
