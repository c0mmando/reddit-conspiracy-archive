<p>TopMindsOfReddit, you magnificent bastards - you pulled it off and the &quot;TopMinds&quot; don&#39;t even suspect</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep playing my part in Operation SantaRosaCheesePizza but have to say, this is simply awesome.</p>

<p>CBTS_Stream was a brilliant idea. I really don&#39;t think some people there (and the people from the_donald and /conspiracy have no idea) get that it is a satire sub (and I am playing my part engaging &#39;them&#39; there).</p>

<p>Do you think they know about OperationQchan or the &quot;ChristopherColumbus&quot; flat earth operation underway? My fav is the Axe(o)PayATroll account and how it was compromised some time ago in order to give freak(fly)tape the boot.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have to work early in the morning with my deepstate folks(+++ ++ +++++ Hillary, podesta, who is Waldo and where is he??) so I have to get to &#39;bed (3 letters, no ACF, bed is 3 letters out of six - true patriots will understand, #ReleaseHillaryVideo).</p>

<p>This world is getting darker daily. With that being said, I must have had some strong influence if they have to lie this much about me.</p>

<p>long time ago i got called a jew hating anti semite for asking too many questions about 9/11 </p>

<p>at the time, i was solely looking at the evidence, and had not gotten around to looking at alternative suspects</p>

<p>but this trolls behavior made more sense later when i started looking at alternative suspects </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She admitted use of psycidelics on multiple occasions, albiet most times as a cautionary tale against them.</p>

<p>There are multiple incidents on her sub r/conspiracyundon in the false narrative if the Holocaust, as well as bans against those who prove the death of millions of Jews. </p>

<p>Posts on seeing 50+ UFO&#39;s, as well as a constant diatrab on how there were death threats, yet NEVER any proof of them. I don&#39;t think anyone would have faulted her if she posted with the user and the message, but none ever came. The ones she did post we&#39;re not remotely anything regarding a death threat. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame her for erasing her history, especially in the recent events. But let&#39;s not put them on a pedestal.</p>

<p>This weekend, I got another threat, and it just was kind of the end of the rope (yes, I reported it). Yes, I think the user was a <a href="/r/tmor">/r/tmor</a> of user. I am going to be vague about this threat, but it was disturbing. I told the mods on my sub that I was done. I had to say goodbye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real or not, I just realized this was not worth it anymore. I cannot keep coming online trying to guess what is real, and what is not. I cannot keep having anxiety about posting on Reddit. As my sub was growing, I knew that it was only going to get worse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conspiracy is that this is allowed. Why do these people hate me so much? I think half of them are paid shills, and I am not sure about the other half. Again, though, they are desperate to try to link me to Nazism, and as a teacher that is dangerous. In no way shape or form have I ever in anyway indicated the support of Nazism. They claimed my sub encouraged Nazism, but you all can take a look at <a href="/u/conspiracyundone">/u/conspiracyundone</a> and tell me if you think that is true.</p>
