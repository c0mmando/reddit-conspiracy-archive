       There is a wealth of information at our disposal regarding false flag operations and hoaxes. There is a verifiable crisis industry with several of these crisis simulation businesses having websites viewable to the public. At this point, the people who peddle official narratives about 9/11, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, etc. deserve to be lambasted. They've had ample time and opportunities to "wake up". We as "conspiracy theorists" have had to deal with gas lighting from normies for a long time. It's time to turn the tables.

       To me, it seems incredibly short sighted. It boils down to, okay ... Lets say, before we get ahead of ourselves here, say I say "The Russian intelligence forces interfered in the US elections" - if you think "So what, you think the CIA hasn't interfered in anyone's elections?!" is an appropriate, relevant response to that - then we don't have the basis for a conversation because I think you're a fucking idiot.

       Some Russians make some social media posts and everybody shits their pantsâ€¦meanwhile Israel both directly and indirectly through their various lobbying groups meddle in US affairs every single day and no one bats an eye.

      <p>
       It wasn't just some Russians, and they didn't just make normal social media posts. This was a coordinated effort to subvert US democracy. They weren't just normal people on the internet like me or you, they were there only to spread disinformation and propaganda. They used targeted ads, they targeted voter rolls, they used social media and message boards to influence people, and with all that they pumped Russian money into the GOP machine. We're not talking about a few Russian kids making a meme on the internet. This was a coordinated, military-style operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what about Israel? Does that make it okay what Russia did? I will say, at least with Israel, the US gets the strategic benefits of having an ally in the mideast. There's at least something they get out of the relationship. It's a shit sandwich, but at least they don't have the end goal of weakening the US as a whole.

       No, really - what about Israel? Saying "But they do it too!" isn't an argument, and I hear it all the time from you people. Is there a step-two to that train of thought? Or does it really just start and end with "but they do it too!"? Genuinely curious, if you could provide an answer that'd be appreciated.

       I was simply commenting on the OP's comment. If the same people that turn a blind eye to Isarelis meddling in every single aspect of US affairs care a lot about alleged Russian meddling then they are straight up hypocrites.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, frankly, your comment that "Israel does it too", is nonsenseâ€¦they have far more influence in US affairs and have had for decades. They influence where and when the US goes to warâ€¦they have dual citizens in various levels of gov. Their largest US lobby group doesn't even register as a foreign agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, Israel has done and does do far more and far worse than Russia ever has or ever likely will.

       The official narrative is set by the mainstream mockingbird CIA whore media. The news says Russia colluded with Trump in order to win the election but I know that's phony. Hillary was just goddamn terrible as a candidate and her plan to "elevate" Trump blew up in her face magnificently. Just for the record I'm not pro-Trump, didn't vote, he's clearly a Zionist and supporting the latest false flag so that's nothing new.

       So they lie about the big stuff like pizza-gate and false flags, but they're allowed to show some wiggle room on the little things like collusion and foreign spying? I ask because I know people that only watch Fox and think the whole Russia thing is, well pretty much exactly how you described it, and I know people that watch CNN and other news networks, and they think this is the biggest political conspiracy maybe ever. So, what? It's all theater?

       I'd rather just keep telling the truth and pointing out how globalism leads to a loss of national sovereignty and eventually will end with total capitulation to a government that isn't our own, a government that already has demonstrated a desire to spread our wealth and success to "lift up" the 3rd world.

       I don't want to ostracize them even though I fail to keep my cool at times.  I want them to understand.

       this is the wrong idea. we shouldn't attack people for what they believe and in fact one can't really be certain that all what he believes is true. Everyone should have the right to see the evidence for himself and make up his mind without prosecution or gas lighting what you propose is against the fundamental values that I believe this community stands for.( of course I can't speak in the name of everybody)

       You yourself have attempted to ostracize op on the grounds that you believe him to be an idiot. It's funny that you're doing exactly what op is advocating, lambasting apparent idiocy, except pointing the lambasting at him for suggesting that idiots deserve to be lambasted. Amazing. Did you realize you were doing this? Either op is right and idiots deserve to be ostracized, or you're a hypocrite for disagreeing but then still trying to ostracize someone you've judged to be an idiot.

       If someone is repeating lies or bullshit, they deserve to be set straight. Especially if they are just repeating lies or bullshit talking points from corporate propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ostracize" might be a strong way of putting it, but liars and the people who support those lies should be seen as lesser for doing that shit. We have to fight against that, show these people when they are wrong, and not give in to the mass deceptions. If someone says "there were weapons on mass destruction in Iraq, we had to invade," we have to tell them off for being wrong. We can't let lies stand unchallenged.

       Some Russians make some social media posts and everybody shits their pantsâ€¦meanwhile Israel both directly and indirectly through their various lobbying groups meddle in US affairs every single day and no one bats an eye.

       If someone is repeating lies or bullshit, they deserve to be set straight. Especially if they are just repeating lies or bullshit talking points from corporate propaganda.

       "Ostracize" might be a strong way of putting it, but liars and the people who support those lies should be seen as lesser for doing that shit. We have to fight against that, show these people when they are wrong, and not give in to the mass deceptions. If someone says "there were weapons on mass destruction in Iraq, we had to invade," we have to tell them off for being wrong. We can't let lies stand unchallenged.
