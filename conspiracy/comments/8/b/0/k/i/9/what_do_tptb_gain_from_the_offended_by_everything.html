<p>Is it just a way to send society into chaos so people ignore the real issues? Is it a way to slowly remove any meaniningful ideal or topic from the world so they can control everyone even more?</p>

<p>Just a little thought tidbit for your Monday morning. Curious to see what others think about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure? Because I see the opposite, and the so-called SocialJusticeWarriors have no qualms doxxing, using racist terms like Uncle Tom or House-n****r towards conservative black people, saying how they want to &quot;kill all white people&quot; etc. They are miserable people that bully people and call their family and jobs and get them fired over simple misunderstandings. Successfully.</p>

<p>The whole &quot;being nice now&quot; is a lie they use to justify their narcissistic BS behavior.</p>

<p>They get a dopamine-rush being offended by things every single day and it has replaced reality television for these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s mostly reverse psychology and identity manipulation.</p>

<p>For example notice how the politically-corect bathroom-militant pink-hair SJW was introduced to the world - shortly before we started hearing that human rights and not waging war all the time is akin to political correctness. Remark also how the most outrageous carcicatures are always the most vocally anti-Israel and pro-BDS.</p>

<p>If anyone actually falls for the 1st-degree propaganda (and becomes a bathroom militant triggered by words), they are a side-effect, not an intended consequence.</p>

<p>Observe the same dialectic with BLM last year. You were either pro crazed neurotic and racist thugs, or pro militarization of police. You are against the warrior cop? You must be a Ferguson-demonstrator type! They effectively slowed down the conservative opposition to the police state (and allowed Trump to overtly express authoritarian ideas with little to no opposition from those who had criticized similar Obama ideas).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the critical elements of their plan is the balkanization of the world.  Even though the nations are always in conflict, none of them gain any real territorial advantage.  Keeping the countries split into hostile ethnic groups keeps the process moving forward.</p>

<p>But the U.S. is on the brink of being too big to handle, if anything goes very wrong for them.  So the way to manage this is to keep us on the brink of self-destruction, in case anyone ever needs to hit the &quot;big red button&quot;.</p>

<p>Socially, we&#39;re constantly on the brink, and financially we&#39;re in a construct so flimsy and artificial that it could be blown over by a few ultra-rich conspirators.</p>

<p>By finding nonsensical &quot;issues&quot; to fight over, we&#39;re kept weak and prone to turning against ourselves, instead of the ones who rule us.  And even though America is directly under the management of these evil bastards, their &quot;nuclear option&quot; for us is to instigate a civil war if we become too big to manage.</p>

<p>One example of this is the media&#39;s eagerness to play up the bad cop stories.  Many cops are evil, and we do live in a borderline police state, but the &quot;conflict&quot; they promote is unwinnable.  By propping up &quot;cops as enemies&quot;, it ensures that whenever the anger boils over, we&#39;ll be fighting amongst ourselves (citizens vs police gangs) instead of directing it at the source of evil in our country.  I.E., Congress, white house, intelligence agencies, the fed, etc.)</p>

<p>If the cops were on our side, instead of prowling around mugging and murdering people, we would be pretty formidable.  We both together could rise against the tyranny of Washington.  But as long as we&#39;re separated and pitted against each other, no matter who wins, we lose.</p>

<p>The &quot;sjw&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; issues are just a subtler version of this same divide and conquer strategy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s being raised up to be crushed in the future.  It lines up with the alleged letter written by Albert Pike (33rd degree Freemason).  It&#39;s part of their plan to bring forth the Luciferin one world order (order out of chaos).</p>

<p>&quot;We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.  &quot;Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s democrats and leftists in general, their whole belief system is built on the foundation of white supremacy, ie blacks and minorities are inferior to whites so we must level the playing field with laws and regulations to hold back whites and promote minorities, they would never be able to succeed otherwise. The ultra sensitivity to racism and bigotry is just them overcompensating to cover their own and projecting it on to others as a reflection of their inner self which they&#39;re ashamed of; normal people don&#39;t go around focused on, and judging people&#39;s value by their race or other identifiers that make them outliers in the population, instead people are judged by their character and likeability.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in a &quot;just world fallacy&quot;, and I don&#39;t believe in systemic racism; the world isn&#39;t fair, life&#39;s not fair, and racism <em>does</em> exist but not systemically... Name one law that discriminates based on race. I can actually think of a bunch. Actually, name one law that discriminates against blacks or minorities; you can&#39;t, any law targeted at them is to their benefit. But yeah, racism exists, some of us realize it&#39;s completely normal and a relic of our distant tribal past; we don&#39;t feel the need to overcompensate to make up for some injustice that some white people (not my ancestors, and not most white American&#39;s ancestors) may have done to their ancestors; I reject the concept of &quot;white guilt&quot;. Most racism blacks deal with today stems directly from the issues with black culture, specifically the parts that glorify crime, are anti-education because they don&#39;t want to &quot;act white&quot;, and promote disrespect for authority figures; this creates children who grow up to be maladjusted adults who don&#39;t fit well in society and fosters stereotypes among other races and cultures, because like I said, we have tribal roots. Now, this isn&#39;t all their fault, they aren&#39;t inherently unfit for society, I place a large amount of blame on their 70% single parent households, fathers are extremely important for children, especially boys, like they say, &quot;women can raise boys but they can&#39;t raise men&quot;. Of course, the blame for that can be laid with... the Democrats! Their regressive welfare laws reward single parents and punish 2 parent households financially, causing this cycle to repeat over and over. It works for them though, because people dependent on the state will ALWAYS vote democrat.</p>

<p>That reminds me of Woodrow Wilson screening <em>The Birth of A Nation</em> in The Whitehouse, singlehandedly giving rise to the re-emergence of the KKK (a Democrat founded organization). There are also parallels between the Clintons and their &quot;prisoner-slaves&quot; (?) and the left&#39;s insistence that illegal aliens perform a vital function in that they do the work nobody else will do and you don&#39;t even have to pay them minimum wage.</p>
