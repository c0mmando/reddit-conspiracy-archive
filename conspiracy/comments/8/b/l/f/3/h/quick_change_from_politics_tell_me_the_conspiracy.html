To be fair i&#39;m not sure, but i also do not care. I&#39;m sure there is a logical explanation outside of the government covering up the ground getting higher or buildings sinking (interchangeable really). what do they stand to gain from hiding that information. and if it IS a secret why is this picture allowed to exist</p>

<p>Social Darwinism / Elitism</p>

<p>The elite believe they are a more advanced form of human. In order to justify their belief they grafted Darwin&#39;s theories of biological evolution onto social organization to create Social Darwinism. Over the centuries they have referred to the public variously as cattle, sheep and &quot;its&quot; (as Plato did in The Republic) and Social Darwinism is merely the modern expression of this attitude and their elitist belief system. Under this belief system only those that have proven their worth over many generations of dominance and control are worthy of entrance into high elite circles.</p>

<p>aliens and reptiles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space aliens would require abiogenesis to be fact, which over thousands of years of observation and over 100 years of scientific testing, science has only confirmed to prove what we already know; life only comes from pre-existing life. Scientists have been repeatedly trying to create life from scratch but have failed over and over again. This is why I personally think aliens is an unlikely conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot understate this one: contrails, contrails, contrails. It is the stupidest fucking thing I&#39;ve ever heard of. Apparently somehow we load poisonous population-controlling gasses into 1000s of airplanes that take off every day all over the country and nobody has spilled the beans over the last 5 decades. Oh, and even though we have 10s of millions of cars polluting into the atmosphere a day allegedly not voluminous enough to cause substantial health issues, somehow some spray from a plane 7 miles in the air is potent enough to cause the premature death of a measurable percentage of the elderly. I mean, I&#39;d be mildly suspicious of what those lines might be, if there wasn&#39;t undisputed, <em>reproducible</em> scientific explanations for why water-vapor forms behind airplanes.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What’s a conspiracy you believe 
The British royal family are Nazi sympathizers and are involved in ritualistic child abuse/trafficking. Princess Diana was murdered in part for discovering elements of this activity, particularly relating to Prince Charles and his links to the deceased paedo/necrophiliac Jimmy Savile. Forces within the British establishment, ranging from the courts to the police also help cover up this ring of abuse.</p>

<p>What’s one you do not believe 
The Rendlesham Forest UFO encounter. One of the key witnesses received &quot;ASCII&quot; encoded English from a spacecraft, which is ridiculous. Maybe it was a genuine landing of a craft, but Pennistons account of telepathically receiving ASCII ultimately discredits the entire event.</p>
