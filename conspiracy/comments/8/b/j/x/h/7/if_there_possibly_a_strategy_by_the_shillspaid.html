        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Actually, racism and homophobia too. If you go on 4chan or Voat (Reddit seems to have &quot;hate speech&quot; under control or they enforce stricter rules) you see tons of use of racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and there is definitely no shortage of Jewish hate speech. A lot of the times these users also have a blatant partisan right/conservative bias, and they use hate speech so blatantly, that they seem to be spreading that stuff on purpose. </p>

<p>My question is this, what if this is being done intentionally, to sow a hatred for Jews among the conspiracy community, and create a fixation on hatred for an ethnic group of people and blame them for all of our problems? </p>

<p>In reality, it is the wealthy 1% of elites that truly dictate society and have enslaved us, and they consist of people of <em>all</em> colors and creeds. Whites, blacks, asians, women, men, jews, catholics, mormons, ect. Wealth and influence is all that matters in the &quot;big club&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel like if they can spam that hate speech and racial slurs all over the conspiracy community, not only will it deter any new lurkers from joining the cause, but it will also make the culture think that the Jewish people are the cause of all of our problems, and we&#39;ll be branded as a hate group. </p>

<p>Could the paid infiltrators and shills be spamming this language throughout all of the popular conspiracy forums of purpose, as part of a strategy to destroy our image?</p>

<p>Could the CIA be starting the anti-semitism fire online and letting it burn organically from there? They&#39;ve tried to discredit conspiracy theorists in the past, we know this. CIA is filled with Catholics, and <a href="/r/romerules">/r/romerules</a> has some great research regarding Jesuits using Jews as scapegoats. This includes a theory that Jesuits are the real owners of media and finance, but hire Jews for management positions and to be the face of the company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a tricky question for me. On the one hand, I feel like &quot;hate speech&quot; is a made-up and meaningless term. I think that stereotyping is a pretty normal, human thing to do. On the other, I do agree that such speech on the Chans or Voat or wherever probably does push many normal people away. But there is part of me that thinks that is a good thing, and it can help to produce more productive conversation. So yea, I&#39;m a bit conflicted.</p>

<p>Why do you have a desire to &quot;pin&quot; this system on one ethnic or religious group in the first place? Thats pretty unfair, because there are people from all colors and creeds that run this globalist system. </p>

This is one reason why  (for years) the AIDS/HIV conspiracies have been around.  Look in history to see all the hate against the evolution theory and today with global climate change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I think its possible there is an effort to paint people who ask the wrong questions as &quot;alt right&quot; or whatever there are also some other factors. </p>

<p>Firstly, people tend to gravitate toward others who share their ideals. So some message boards will get taken over by people with racist leanings and yes the lack of rules is likely a contributing factor in what places become more extreme. Places like 4chan are built on the idea of anything goes... that is attractive to people who hold unpopular views.  </p>

<p>Secondly, some of these issues are complex things to unpack. Its not the same thing to be anti Zionist as it is to be antisemitic. Moral busy bodies love to take things out of context and call people racist these days. So you&#39;ll have people who distrust Israel as a state actor and speak to that who might sound as if (or be accused of) disparaging all Jewish people under the sun. This is like blaming the actions of the US government on every person in the county... doesn&#39;t make much sense. I think some people get confused by nuances.    </p>

<p>Waking up to the JQ requires navigating past the shills casting their seeds of doubt. Attaining clarity in the face of a life of indoctrination into the false dichotomy of Jewish victimhood and White supremacy brings one in line with the counter-Semitic position shared by your entire ancestral lineage. Unless you’re descended from Cain, all of your ancestors decided at one point or another that the Jews should no longer live among them.</p>

<p>Do you have anything other than a photo of the headline of a NYT article that&#39;s over 70 years old, that proves the New World Order is a project solely of the Jews?</p>

<p>Also, why are you trying to drag me into an argument convincing me that the Jews run the world? My entire post is about the <em>hate speech</em> and blatant intentional racism I&#39;m seeing on forums like this, and you never addressed that. </p>

<p>Actually, it seems like you don&#39;t have much of a problem with the hate speech, almost like you&#39;re trying to defend and enable it by reinforcing the &quot;Jews run the world&quot; rhetoric in your comment.  </p>

<p>Lol, piece of cake. I found these in literally 5 minutes of browsing Voat. 4Chan is simply too easy. I&#39;ll dig through reddit and find some more for you. </p>

<p>I <em>really</em> find it hard to believe these aren&#39;t provacateur agents spreading hate and anti jewish rhetoric on purpose to make us all look bad. </p>

<p>Free speech comes with assholes. Assholes pointing out Jewish power isn’t racism, and their being an asshole doesn’t make them wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One Issue is the fact that Israel is very important to the Jewish race, and that anybody for or against Israel can&#39;t differentiate the two. Yes, you can be anti-zionist without being anti-semitic, but it&#39;s a fine line. If you want Israel to no longer exist, what do we do with the 6 million plus Jews currently living in Israel? </p>

<p>I personally believe a lot of the hate stems from the crucifixion of Jesus, as Jews are still to blame for that. I find that silly, as 1) Romans ruled the land back then. They were in charge of executions, they were in charge of the Jews, and the crucifix was a Roman style execution, not a Jewish one, and 2) For Christianity to even become a religion, a human sacrifice was needed. Shouldn&#39;t Christians be happy Jesus was crucified for their sins?</p>

<p>Shills for sure may play an issue here as a way to get more people to hate Jews. However, back in &#39;99 when I first started with conspiracy forums, there was the same anti-semitic talk. I think an issue is the fact that most people don&#39;t speak out unless they&#39;re angry, and that group of people will be heard the loudest (even when it comes to something small like yelp/amazon reviews).</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you (OP) in the sense that I believe the 1% is completely behind it. Their entire agenda is to get the 99% completely split on issues and start hating each other. Do you remember a few years back in 2011 when the wall street protests were happening? People started waking up realizing what the 1% were doing. People started uniting..... then in Feb of 2012 Trayvon Martin was shot and all of a sudden, based on the media, is was whites vs non whites. That&#39;s all that mattered anymore. Without a doubt that was orchestrated, just like any other social issue, all so we don&#39;t look at the 1%.</p>
