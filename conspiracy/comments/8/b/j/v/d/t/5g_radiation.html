    <div class="md"><p>Yes and perhaps you should look up the way its written. They look at heating and shock dangers of RF exposure, and do not even consider many of the adverse effects to be adverse effects because they dont constitute physical damage to the tissue via heating or electrostimulation. It does nothing to regulate the other health effects that these RF cause, because it doesnt even require testing for them in order for devices to be acceptably safe under the standard.</p>

<p>You seem to be unable to grasp the idea that something can cause cumulative damage. Just because the RF source doesnt burn you or shock you, doesnt mean that it has no health effects. How do you not get this?</p>

<p>I am talking about EMF output and EMI being higher than stated under real world usage, because outdated models are used during EDA phases.

<p>Yea, I&#39;d like you to link those studies.  The standard I leak has several peer-reviewed sources that say you&#39;re wrong, so I&#39;d love some proof that you&#39;re not spouting nonsense. </p>

<p>Signal injection on conductors/semicondux
ctors and constructive/destructive interference in the propagating wave (EMC/EMI) has different modeling &amp; experimental methods than testing for fluctuations of action potentials and induced heating of poorly- conducting human cells/tissue (SAR).  Unless these &#39;shit/consumer electronics&#39; you keep mindlessly droning on about are <em>outputting 2-40x more current to the 5G antenna</em> in the same package, meaning those shit electronics are actually extremely advanced, the fact they&#39;re more succestible to interference has absolutely 0 effect on human safety because the antenna is by far the largest radiation source in regards to human safety.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outdated testing methodologies dont give a complete enough picture of the danger. Plus data dredging can make anything look safe, when in reality its not.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you find me what is outdated about 2nd-order finite-conductor FEM modeling used in the standard to confirm results measured in DAISY 2 &amp; DAISY 3 testing? (which BTW is used in pretty much every commercial eoctrostatic, magneto static, and electromagnetic application). You keep repeating &#39;outdated testing methodologies&#39; but if you can&#39;t actually answer what they are, you just sound like an entry-level test engineer mindlessly applying E&amp;M theory</p>

<p>Read through these articles and the studies they cite. Its not hard to google things for someone as smart as you, is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, and looks like you didn&#39;t dive into any of these &#39;sources&#39; because their assumptions &amp; test setups differ greatly, for example here&#39;s just the first source:  </p>

<p><strong>The setup is based on the HP-8510C VNA for which an HP-83558A millimetre wave module and an HP-83623 sweep oscillator were used as the source</strong> So a test from a 20-dBm source fed through a wave-guide concentrated on human tissue 100 mm away shows you can heat up sweat glands just enough to break the IEEE limits... well sure, but in the real world the inverse-square law exists and the air is not a waveguide... so nothing in this test implies the new 5Q antennaes 10m+ away from people is gonna break C95.1 limits.  HORRIBLE CHOICE OF SOURCE!   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They may be missing clocks or there is extra jitter. Or there is dielectric breakdown. And anytime something breaks down, there is an avalanche of new things you have to worry about. A lot of aging models advanced in an era where electronics were used sporadically. Now chips are running all the time. Inside of a chip, blocks are heating up, so aging is accelerated. From that you get all types of weird phenomena. A lot of companies have not revised their aging models, either. They assumed these devices would last three to four years, but they may fail sooner. And given that design margins from the beginning can be flimsy, aging can throw them off.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, &quot;effect&quot; in the article you listed has 0 probability of increasing the current to the antenna by a factor of 2-40 and the models used for SAR testing don&#39;t have the flaws like the models in the source you linked, so the radiation the human body gets is unaffected.  So your 4th attempt at going &#39;hurdur shit electronics&#39; as a argument why the radiation will be much higher still is an utter failure, care to try a 5th or are you gonna finally read the IEEE standard?  (rhetorical: of course you&#39;re not, you&#39;ve already died on you hill)  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law</a>  Sitting right next to a cell site on a light pole will microwave you a lot more than being half a mile away from one high up on a tower.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the one that says <strong>for a current/voltage applied to an identical source</strong> the radiation decreased proportional to fourth power for for emissions?  Yea I&#39;ve heard of it, but you do realize the power to the light poles are gonna be insanely lower than the power going to these antenna towers right?  You also do realize that currently the radiation from your cell phone antenna is 10-20x closer to the Standard C95.1 limits compared to that from the tower, right?  (Again rhetorical: because your argument is based on you not understanding this)   </p>

<p><strong>TLDR You&#39;re not intelligent enough to realize the incorrect assumptions every source you have linked makes when attempting to apply the results to the issue at hand e.g. SAR testing.  I have pointed out these errors in detail, so I&#39;m gonna end this convo and hope we have this discussion in the real world in front of subject-matter experts (going to any of the IEEE power or magnetic conferences per chance? no? shocker!) so you get laughed at and maybe change your opinions</strong>   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so you cherry pick one of the tests and that invalidates them all?

<p>I picked the first one which is the logical thing to do, which was link to a blog by the way not the study itself, and read through it.  Yes it&#39;s possible this one is the only source that has minimal parallels to what real 5G systems will be, but so far I have zero reason to give you benefit of the doubt that the other resources are any better.  A technical paper takes a while to read through and digest, <strong>so I&#39;m not gonna spend another 10-15 minutes per source since you obviously didn&#39;t</strong>.  Yes no test setup is going to encapsulate every 5G network because they aren&#39;t all the same, but <em>none of them</em> are using waveguides and the subject is never gonna be that close to the source so <strong>this is a bad reference</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because so far every argument you have had was based on incorrect assumptions due to an ignorance of the IEEE C95.1 standard and SAR testing in general.  At this point you&#39;ve been proven wrong so many times over, it&#39;s your job to tell me why any of the other setups are valid and have derived actually fields radiated from the 5G networks you are so worried about.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The EDA article was an example of the general principle of outdated test methods giving incorrect results. You could also look at the replicability crisis or data dredging for a similar problem.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean more principles/issues <strong>that have no effect on the SAR values this whole conversation is about?</strong>   I&#39;ve blatantly asked you what is wrong with the testing and modeling methods <strong>in regard to SAR measurements</strong>, and you keep coming up with generic issues that exist in EMI/EMC <strong>without realizing those issues don&#39;t exist in the SAR modeling/testing methods</strong>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope you arent actually suggesting that the implication was that the EDA testing was directly related to the radiation issue... if you couldnt see that its an analogous problem for illustrative purposes and not directly related, i wouldnt go making claims about anyone else&#39;s intelligence   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As long as you keep spouting the same generic claims <strong>that don&#39;t apply here</strong> and creating illustrations <strong>that don&#39;t apply here</strong>, I will question your intelligence.  Not all E&amp;M modeling and testing methodologies are obsolete/flawed just because the ones the EMC/EMI communities&#39; are, and the fact you haven&#39;t realized this after ~5 comments makes your intelligence level pretty obvious</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not just applicable to EMC. Its applicable to all fields of engineering, medicine, scientific research of any kind and building complex systems be it a new semiconductor node or a network of RF transmitters that have never been used in applications like this. </p>

<p>You can sit there saying that the standards are being adhered to until you&#39;re blue in the face, but you sound like Zuckerberg testifying before senators and congressmen &quot;of course we respect your privacy and have a million page terms of service to weasel word our way around the reality that we dont&quot;.</p>

<p>If you bothered to read any of the other articles or sources, you&#39;d find that researchers from around the world understand that the safety of 5G is extremely questionable. Especially with reports of a significant increase of health problems once the(according to you) harmless 5G transmitters go up in an area. How do you accout for the widespread negative health effects in the area that only started immediately after 5G was trialed? </p>

<p>Heres a hint, because the standard you keep quoting only really looks at two effects: heating and electrostimulation, and the standard was actually relaxed in 2005 i believe.</p>

<p>Why only look at those two things when determining if a RF source is safe? It doesnt take into account the other damage modes caused by electromagnetic radiation in the areas of the spectrum being used for 5G: like the non heating or electrostimulation effects of increased DNA breaks, the physiological changes to the immune and nervous system noted in the various studies you refuse to look at. The standards basically look at whether a device will immediately cause damage via heating or shocking you. That is a terribly incomplete look at the effects of RF in these frequency ranges on biological systems. </p>

<p>That was the point of bringing up the complexities of EDA at smaller nodes: unexpected effects in the real world testing because the models for verification of the design were incomplete.</p>

<p>If you look at the research that says that 5G and cell phone radiation is more dangerous than people are led to believe, its because they look at other damage modes than heating and shocking. Microwaves increas BBB permeability, but that doesmt get taken into account when assessing a devices safety. Same thing with its effects on DNA. Its the flawed assumption that the standard is sufficiently comprehensive to assess the safety of these radiation sources, when it doesnt even bother with any of the detrimental biological effects that would be cumulative. </p>

<p>Show me in IEEE C95.1 where it does take these biological effects into account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isnt how radiation works. Specific frequencies/wavelengths interact with different compounds and physical(biological) structures in different ways.</p>

<p>There are areas of the EM spectrum that are harmless, beneficial, detrimental, and it has to do with how specific molecules and structures absorb, attenuate or resonate with specific frequencies.</p>

<p>5G encompasses some extremely biologically actjve and detrimental frequencies of RF from 20-80GHz. Electromagnetic radiation in that range has health effects from neurological problems to heart and immune system problems.</p>

<p>5G is the first communications standard of its type. Thus far everything for cell phones has been below 5GHz. </p>

<p>No, the whole point of mini cell sites is to blanket an area with 5G coverage and 24 feet is a lot closer to your body than the current cell transmitters, which are on rather tall cell towers that put the point sources of radiation quite far from humans.</p>

<p>And 5G mini cells will use beamforming antennas so they WILL be aiming directly at you from tens of feet away at 20--80GHz instead of being a kilometer or more away.</p>
