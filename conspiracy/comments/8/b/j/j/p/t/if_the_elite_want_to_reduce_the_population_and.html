<p>1) Many people associate Doomsday Preppers and the like with paranoid schizophrenics, so after watching such shows, many people will actually be <em>less</em> likely to take the threat of some population-decimating catastrophe seriously. TPTB exploits the flat Earth-movement in much the same way.</p>

<p>2) If shit gets real, it won&#39;t matter if you&#39;ve prepped or not. An airborne bioweapon will get to you whether or not you&#39;ve got five dozen cans of beans and a hunting rifle.</p>

<p>Actually, the only ones they&#39;ll want to save will be themselves. Once strong AI has been achieved, all human beings--even loyal ones--will be an unproductive liability. Even if they <em>do</em> want to save some portion of the population for whatever reason, it would be pretty easy to integrate the antitoxin into vaccination schemes or something like that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because this plan is very much long-term; even the most optimistic estimates (or pessimistic ones, depending on your POV) put the date strong AI will be achieved beyond 2040. They&#39;ll have to keep us nicely subjugated in the meantime. Pushing so hard for gun control also serves to control the narrative and keep our attention away from the <em>real</em> issues.</p>

<p>All we know for sure is that we&#39;re looking at some sort of black ops facility. To extrapolate from the existence of such a site, which could be anything from a Gitmo-esque prison camp to a black research lab, that FEMA must be planning to stuff us all into death camps strikes me as more than a little ridiculous. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and all that.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t losing control, they&#39;re in more control than ever. Actual opposition in the form of socialism, communism, and anarchism is all but dead. People embrace this way of life and think it&#39;s both natural and liberating for 99% of the population to generate wealth for 1%. The elite have even convinced you that all the opposition to the Actually-Existing-World-Order that made them rich and powerful are the <em>real</em> bad guys who want to enslave you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and a total takeover has been their goal for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>They already had their take over a hundred years ago. The entire world is a plantation for them, and people do it all willingly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have a feudal state totally in place, where they plan to issue a global one world currency, under which every living being is subject to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck do they care about the currency, the mere substance of wealth exchange, when they own all the wealth? It doesn&#39;t matter to them whether it&#39;s valued in dollars or yen or ameros.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They refer to this goal as the New World Order, and they have been working at this for a very long time. Thats the conspiracy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Actually-Existing-World-Order right now is global capitalism, and it&#39;s produced a tiny cabal of disgustingly wealthy, transnational elites who exploit the labor of each and every one of us to finance their lifestyle with minimal administrative overhead, 1000% more efficient than any kind of centrally planned world order. They have, and are continuing to get, everything they want under the current system of capitalism.</p>

<p>All these NWO theories are completely out of wack and missing the actual situation in front of us. They don&#39;t need to enslave us to become rich and powerful, they already are rich and powerful, and we&#39;re enslaving ourselves and each other in order to keep it that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you underestimate the limits of technology. After all, we humans are just very elaborate machines, so anything a human can accomplish a robot must be able to as well. Our body has plenty of systems to repair itself, so why could a sufficiently advanced robot not have those either? Hell, a robot unbound by the constraints of organic chemistry should by all reasonable estimates be <em>more</em> capable than we are, not less. It is easy to look at the state of robotics today and say that nothing good is ever going to come of it, but you&#39;d be making the same mistake as a 19th-century gentleman witnessing telegraph lines and discounting the possibility of the internet.</p>

<p>As for women: cloning is a thing.</p>

There was an episode where a guy basically bragged that if sh*t ever popped off, him and his crew would just rob people. Perform home invasions, etc the whole 9 yards.

    <div class="md"><p>To demotivate, demobilize, and alienate the people from each other.  The individualistic lens through which these show are used to prevent people from thinking of collective solutions that could be attempted to prevent doomsday, or to prepare communities as whole to survive it.  The framing makes doomsday scenarios seem too overwhelming for most to even attempt prepping, and encourages the most capable and well-resourced to focus on themselves instead of preemption or community.  The paranoia they foster also makes it harder for people who are preparing to trust each other, ie to form resilient communities that might produce sustained and reproducing resistance to an apocalypse or overt coup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might not answer your question, but one thing strikes me when watching Doomsday Preppers: almost every episode is about folks with deep pockets and considerable property. It makes it seem like average people, people with not much money or don&#39;t own any property can&#39;t prep. It&#39;s not about the basics of hoarding food, supplies, and water, and having even a basic plan, which everyone should do no matter where they live. It&#39;s more about turning a schoolbus into a tank, digging a giant bunker with booby traps under your 10 acre ranch, and other ridiculously expensive stuff. The show presents prepping as hopeless if you&#39;re on a budget.</p>

Longer answer: I think the American faction of TPTB love the fact there is a growing population of people planning for the worst. Worst comes to worst, Preppers maintain some semblance of order is certain pockets of the country. When a reconstituted Government is formed, they will roll into these areas an give them a &quot;Great jobs guys, but we&#39;ll take it from here&quot;.</p>
