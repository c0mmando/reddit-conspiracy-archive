       You could even even use the pages as TP in a pinch, but I doubt a prepper wouldn't have a decent supply of

       For two reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Many people associate Doomsday Preppers and the like with paranoid schizophrenics, so after watching such shows, many people will actually be
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       likely to take the threat of some population-decimating catastrophe seriously. TPTB exploits the flat Earth-movement in much the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) If shit gets real, it won't matter if you've prepped or not. An airborne bioweapon will get to you whether or not you've got five dozen cans of beans and a hunting rifle.

       Why would you want to go through the bother of locking people up in camps? You'd run the risk of revolts and the cost of the operation would be positively
       <em>
        enormous
       </em>
       . Just design an airborne agent and give an antitoxin to the people you don't want to die. It's easier, cheaper and all-around more effective.

       How would they administer an anti toxin? Im sure they know which people they want to "save", the ones that can be reeducated and trust the establishment, and can be assimilated into the one world government, but how do they get them to take it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if they don't actually intend on confiscating or restricting the 2nd amendment (if they're going with the bipweapon route), why are they trying to hard to get them? You make good points for sure, I just have those questions.

       Also, it's on record these FEMA facilities exist. Here's footage of a short tour of one of them from the 90's.

      <p>
       Actually, the only ones they'll want to save will be themselves. Once strong AI has been achieved, all human beings--even loyal ones--will be an unproductive liability. Even if they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       want to save some portion of the population for whatever reason, it would be pretty easy to integrate the antitoxin into vaccination schemes or something like that.

      <p>
       Because this plan is very much long-term; even the most optimistic estimates (or pessimistic ones, depending on your POV) put the date strong AI will be achieved beyond 2040. They'll have to keep us nicely subjugated in the meantime. Pushing so hard for gun control also serves to control the narrative and keep our attention away from the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       issues.

To extrapolate from the existence of such a site, which could be anything from a Gitmo-esque prison camp to a black research lab, that FEMA must be planning to stuff us all into death camps strikes me as more than a little ridiculous. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and all that.

       Why would they do any of this? We already go to work every day for a system that makes them stupendously wealthy, then go and spend the fraction of the product of our labor we get back in wages on the very goods we ourselves produce at a markup. So they rip us off both ways, are stupendously wealthy as a result, and we all go along with it willingly because we think this is what "Freedom" looks like.

       They aren't losing control, they're in more control than ever. Actual opposition in the form of socialism, communism, and anarchism is all but dead. People embrace this way of life and think it's both natural and liberating for 99% of the population to generate wealth for 1%. The elite have even convinced you that all the opposition to the Actually-Existing-World-Order that made them rich and powerful are the
       <em>

       What the fuck do they care about the currency, the mere substance of wealth exchange, when they own all the wealth? It doesn't matter to them whether it's valued in dollars or yen or ameros.

      <p>
       The Actually-Existing-World-Order right now is global capitalism, and it's produced a tiny cabal of disgustingly wealthy, transnational elites who exploit the labor of each and every one of us to finance their lifestyle with minimal administrative overhead, 1000% more efficient than any kind of centrally planned world order. They have, and are continuing to get, everything they want under the current system of capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these NWO theories are completely out of wack and missing the actual situation in front of us. They don't need to enslave us to become rich and powerful, they already are rich and powerful, and we're enslaving ourselves and each other in order to keep it that way.

       Yes, but it's also systematically destroying the planet and will lead to permanent ecological collapse within a few generations. Every mouth they feed and provide with consumer goods demolishes the Earth just a tiny bit further. Once AI has become so sophisticated that they no longer need the plebs to keep the world turning, you can be sure that they'll get rid of us one way or another.

       You're assuming a catastrophic implosion that wakes people up, and I think that's an optimistic fantasy. In reality it'll look like much of the third world: a slow, steady, and gradual decline that lowers expectations one peg at a time. Once everyone is living in makeshift shacks, weak with starvation and disease, they don't pose a threat to anyone.

       I think you underestimate the limits of technology. After all, we humans are just very elaborate machines, so anything a human can accomplish a robot must be able to as well. Our body has plenty of systems to repair itself, so why could a sufficiently advanced robot not have those either? Hell, a robot unbound by the constraints of organic chemistry should by all reasonable estimates be
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       capable than we are, not less. It is easy to look at the state of robotics today and say that nothing good is ever going to come of it, but you'd be making the same mistake as a 19th-century gentleman witnessing telegraph lines and discounting the possibility of the internet.

       What about them?  There's no evidence iirc that they were put an place by anyone associated with TPTB, and there's certainly no evidence that TPTB want anything to do with their recommendations.

       a slave owner wants to cull the herd, to get rid of the less productive, sick, feeble minded - the 'useless eaters'. the slave owner also wants to make sure no smart, educated and rich slaves will pose a danger to his status and power, killing all rebellious slaves who think slavery is a bad thing. hence the war on middle class.

       Money. Thoae shows are popular. BTW, 99.999% of the people who watch them are just fans, they do not live the lifestyle nor are they interested in it anymore than on tv. First 7 days of no food, water, or power because of a natural disaster and they will most likely be among the dead or dying.

       I agree. Ratings. Attract as many eyeballs as possible (preferably) those with Neilson boxes. 
 They are characters. I love watching the family dynamics. I love watching which families are all aboard, and which wife has those vacant eyes, and checked out kids.

       One of my faves where "The marauders". 
There was an episode where a guy basically bragged that if sh*t ever popped off, him and his crew would just rob people. Perform home invasions, etc the whole 9 yards. He was also a convicted felon, and his episode featured him shooting many guns. He was promptly arrested when his episode aired.

       To demotivate, demobilize, and alienate the people from each other.  The individualistic lens through which these show are used to prevent people from thinking of collective solutions that could be attempted to prevent doomsday, or to prepare communities as whole to survive it.  The framing makes doomsday scenarios seem too overwhelming for most to even attempt prepping, and encourages the most capable and well-resourced to focus on themselves instead of preemption or community.  The paranoia they foster also makes it harder for people who are preparing to trust each other, ie to form resilient communities that might produce sustained and reproducing resistance to an apocalypse or overt coup.

       It might not answer your question, but one thing strikes me when watching Doomsday Preppers: almost every episode is about folks with deep pockets and considerable property. It makes it seem like average people, people with not much money or don't own any property can't prep. It's not about the basics of hoarding food, supplies, and water, and having even a basic plan, which everyone should do no matter where they live. It's more about turning a schoolbus into a tank, digging a giant bunker with booby traps under your 10 acre ranch, and other ridiculously expensive stuff. The show presents prepping as hopeless if you're on a budget.

       Anything that causes people to fear and panic will result in an increase in stress. Stress leads to a higher mortality rate. So the reason why they allow shows that promote apocalyptic ideology is that by promoting such ideologies, they reinforce their own efforts.

       Short answer : Easier to enter them into their "Data base". 
Longer answer: I think the American faction of TPTB love the fact there is a growing population of people planning for the worst. Worst comes to worst, Preppers maintain some semblance of order is certain pockets of the country. When a reconstituted Government is formed, they will roll into these areas an give them a "Great jobs guys, but we'll take it from here".

       TPTB are just training Americans to stay put and shoot each other over tins of spam while the rest of the world moves somewhere unaffected like NZ. 350m less people to compete with and build a big wall to stop them fleeing south. A well stocked yacht would be much better than a container in the ground but the rich don't want crazy preppers cluttering up marinas.

       It's 'pear shaped', during WW1 England used balloons as observation posts over the trenches, when the Red Baron et al came along they would shoot them, as the gas escaped they would collapse and form the shape of a pear.

       It's called hiding the truth in plain site. They put a lot of truth in fictional movies and TV shows.... even if it's a reality TV show... So the ones who still believe the gov't are good, will defend the gov't against... for example, there are aliens on the moon already, you watched transformers darkside of the moon. Get it?
