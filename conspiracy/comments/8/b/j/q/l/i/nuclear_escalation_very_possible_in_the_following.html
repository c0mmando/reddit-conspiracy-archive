    <div class="md"><p>This is very accurate. You may be able to stock up on food but if nuclear war breaks out realistically it wont matter. Pray that you&#39;re killed instantly or are far enough away and the winds are right that no radiation hits you. Anything else will be misery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nukemap site is fantastic. You can&#39;t predict which bomb they&#39;d use, but you can put an average kiloton and see if you&#39;d be hit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>realistically it wont matter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. Look again on the map and see if you&#39;d be out of the different radii. If you&#39;re not too close to a base, important infrastructure such as a power plant, revervoir, etc, or population center, you could survive staying in and getting under a makeshift, or prepared fallout shelter, putting mass between you and any fallout dust, and not being like foolish neighbors who will pile onto the street to find out why their windows broke while fallout could be falling out.</p>

<p>In the end, I think there&#39;s a good chance nukes are a hoax, so honestly, I&#39;m not too worried about it. Bombs are real, total nuclear holocaust is probably nothing to lose sleep over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the size of the bomb, and if it&#39;s air blast you wouldn&#39;t even get any fallout. 1 hour away from a smaller blast is well within safety, unless they use the largest of bombs. Think of how many power plants there are, how many targets they&#39;d need to hit, how many cities, how many bombs would have to get through our defenses and not get shot down. Prepare for the worst, but total nuclear war is unlikely. Official talk of the threat of it is just fearmongering.</p>

<p>I can never tell if this is a joke. Is it really happening this time? If it doesn&#39;t happen, I assume it will soon? As for prepping, it&#39;s not too late unless the stores are looted. Just make sure to actually <em>pre</em>pare, even if only a little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the problems with living in a nation that has troops in half of the countries in the world and that has been at war somewhere on the globe since 1945 is a total desensitization to risk.  I saw another recent post, I believe from Russia, tracking a plane leaving Wright Patterson and the comments were ominous.  I also saw a video in a recent post that reportedly offers advice to Russians to stock up on water and get a gas mask in the event of war.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I just picked up lunch at the Chipotle near work in Chicago and the topic of conversation between two tables was tomorrow nights episode of Return to Jersey Shore.   Apparently the constant state of war serves as an inoculation against fear porn.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A massive exchange of nuclear weapons is followed by a secondary exchange of chemical weapons, then bio-weapons. </p>

<p>Then after a few weeks/months, a second massive exchange of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons occurs (Submarine based as a most obvious example). </p>

<p>Thrown into the mix somewhere in there are the classified superweapons, and banned weapons too insidious and horrific to possess etc. (But oddly enough they DO exist)</p>

<p>That&#39;s well documented fact.</p>

<p>If you manage to survive that, I feel very sorry for you. (Even if you have a top money survival shelter, supplies run out, malfunctions occur, cabin fever is very real) The world you would inhabit is an alien world, largely barren, poisonous and inhospitable.  The residual radioactive halflife of the fallout is the least of your problems. Weapon platforms and systems exist to make absolutely SURE you won&#39;t be able to live on earth&#39;s surface for the forseeable future(Read hundreds of years). The survivors would be the ones to lament the death of earth. It&#39;s no treat. Your death will not be in a glorious unparelled lightshow and bloodbath, it far more likely a withering painful slow wasting. </p>

<p>So in closing: Life will continue here, we just won&#39;t know about it. Relax, &quot;Get right with jesus&quot; and live your life without fear. </p>

<p>Have whatever supplies you need as perscribed by your local authorities for emergency preparedness. </p>

<p>You likely will never use them in this scenario, Megadeath has been Big Business for around 80 years. It specializes in making sure the death is complete. There really is no escape. The only defense it to try to make sure we never have that initial day of death.</p>
