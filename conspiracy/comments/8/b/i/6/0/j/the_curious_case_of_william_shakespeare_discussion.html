       I would like to discuss William Shakespeare and see what
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has to offer on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       My primary source is
       <em>
        The Secret Teachings of All Ages
       </em>
       , authored by a young Manly P Hall, who's wife, Marie Bauer, would later die while fighting congress to get approval to dig up the body of Sir Francis Bacon to prove that he was, in fact, the mastermind behind Shakespeare's work.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no record of Shakespeare having ever left England.  In fact, the breadth of writing he gave to the world seems to be an impossible measure for someone of a small village as he, with low intellect and very limited educational resources at his disposal. Hall writes:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yet who but a Platonist, a Qabbalist, or a Pythagorean could have written The Tempest, Macbeth, Hamlet, or The Tragedy of Cymbeline? Who but one deeply versed in Paracelsian lore could have conceived, A Midsummer Night's Dream?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It is even said that the death mask of Shakespeare bears more of a resemblance to Bacon than to Shakespeare himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout the 20th century, many researchers tried very hard to unearth truth about the origins of Shakespeare's work, but were often shouted down or dismissed by media.  However, the most compelling piece of evidence comes in the form of a cipher that appears on the original manuscripts and first editions of Shakespearean plays.  The same cipher appears in several books authored by Bacon as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will close with this quote in hopes that this starts an interesting discussion on the life and works of William Shakespeare:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
It is quite evident that William Shakspere could not, unaided, have produced the immortal writings bearing his name. He did not possess the necessary literary culture, for the town of Stratford where he was reared contained no school capable of imparting the higher forms of learning reflected in the writings ascribed to him. His parents were illiterate, and in his early life he evinced a total disregard for study. There are in existence but six known examples of Shakspere's handwriting. All are signatures, and three of them are in his will. The scrawling, uncertain method of their execution stamps Shakspere as unfamiliar with the use of a pen, and it is obvious either that he copied a signature prepared for him or that his hand was guided while he wrote. No autograph manuscripts of the "Shakespearian" plays or sonnets have been discovered, nor is there even a tradition concerning them other than the fantastic and impossible statement appearing in the foreword of the Great Folio.
"  - Manly P. Hall

       I'm inclined to agree with at least a portion of Hall's analysis, that he (Shakespeare) was using a pseudonym, utilized esoteric symbolism in his work reflective of an individual initiated into the mysteries, likely a Freemason and Rosicrucian of his era, possibly a member of the Order of Unknown Philosophers, and may very well have been none other than Francis Bacon, if not John De Vere or even John Dee. I suppose the juries still out on that one.

       I am always very skeptical of masonic ties, for the reason that I don't believe them to be inherently corrupt.  While any organization of men is certainly
       <em>
        corruptable
       </em>
       , the teachings espoused through masonry are not that.  This is not to say that secret oaths are violated by people of power with ill will.  Hall himself was a mason and I am certain he would habe made mention of Shakespeare's membership.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all being said, I have read that Bacon was also the infamous 'Christian Rosencreutz', which I find to be remarkably compelling.  Hall certainly believes Bacon to be a Rosicrucian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, thanks for the links, I look forward to reading them!

       I don't consider them inherently corrupt either. There are some who are, certainly, as with any large group or segment of the population. If I recall, Manly P. Hall became a Rosicrucian prior to becoming a Mason, but that's neither here nor there. Not sure about Bacon being C.R. as I always considered Johannes Valentinus Andreae, along with Christoph Besold and Tobias Hess to be the prime candidates. Feel free to drop by

       at that time in England pretty much anyone who was slightly rich was a freemason and it'd be hard to believe Shakespeare wasn't one, whomever he was he had a successful theater company going at least. it'd be a crazy conspiracy theory to say he was NOT a freemason

       Maximilian Frederick's successor as the Elector of Bonn was Maximilian Francis, the youngest son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and he brought notable changes to Bonn. Echoing changes made in Vienna by his brother Joseph, he introduced reforms based on Enlightenment philosophy, with increased support for education and the arts. The teenage Beethoven was almost certainly influenced by these changes. He may also have been influenced at this time by ideas prominent in freemasonry, as Neefe and others around Beethoven were members of the local chapter of the Order of the Illuminati.[14]

       Fun, and a nice aside from the norm!! 
Appreciate the deviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shakespeare’s father was among the wealthiest in Stratford (was the High Bailiff, not a position wherein his son would be uneducated). As well, any person familiar with Bacon’s Aristotelian-influenced philosophical output would NOT confuse him for a poet! Twain may have had more to do with this than is understood today (in his
       <em>
        Is Shakespeare Dead
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Was going to dig further but this is apt, and known. 
Asimov wrote a fine paper titled
       <em>
        Bill and I
       </em>
       and shows how Bacon was far too OVERQUALIFIED to be mistaken with the Bard.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem more relevant to have suggested the 17th Earl of Oxford as the author of Shakespeare’s output. Edward de Vere has (for near a century) been a more popular potential. He was a patron of theatre and players (as was his father), and has been a more popular choice amongst those haggling over the Bard’s authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly all Shakespearian scholars reject both of these persons. The authorship question arose in the 19th century when Shakespeare was consider amongst the greatest of all writers.

       All the sources one could find are as arguable as the sources claiming Masonic and Satanic ties. 400 years stands in between. According to immediately accessible historical footnotes, William Shakespeare’s father was: a bailiff, a glover, an alderman, an assistant playwright (to his son and otherwise), ale-taster, a farmer, a loan shark, a leather (and/or wool) trader, a tanner, a business owner, a general civil servant, aaaaaaand.....

       I think there's a whole lot of elitism going on in the Shakespeare conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that we don't know a whole lot about the man.  We don't know that he was uneducated.  We don't know that he was educated.  We know nothing at all about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not terribly unusual.  We actually know more about Shakespeare than we do a few of his contemporary playwrights.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do know that at least one of his contemporary playwrights, Ben Jonson,
       <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/13/bookend/bookend.html?_r=1">
        wrote quite a bit about Shakespeare
       </a>
       .  Jonson would be in position to know if Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble I find with most of the "Shakespeare isn't Shakespeare" scholarship is that they mistake absence of evidence for evidence against.  Also, they hype up pure speculation about more upper class possibilities, like Bacon and Marlowe, as if it's evidence.

       Well I am not sure what you mean by 'elitism' in this context.  What we do know about shakespeare is that he had a limited education and, if you read the quotes I cited from Hall's research, he is quite clear about the breadth of knowledge Shakespeare would have had to have held at a very young age.  Qaballah, for instance, is something I have studied for years and I still couldn't write about it, let alone cloak it's principles ingeniously in a theatrical manuscript anywhere near the level of writing as Macbeth or Hamlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this is why it's a
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       .  I, nor Hall, nor anyone else here, am not putting this forward as a
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       .

      <p>
       We, in fact, don't know that.  We know nothing at all about his level of education or his lack of education.  It's a black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also not like Shakespeare didn't make mistakes either.  The most famous of which lies in "The Winter's Tale" where he talks about a ship reaching Bohemia when Bohemia was a landlocked country.  There's others, like the fact that Hamlet was a pagan, yet his father's ghost talks about purgatory and absolution, a distinctly  Catholic tradition.  There's a clock in "Julius Caesar" more than a thousand years before clocks were invented.  I could go on.

       Shakespeare was familiar with seven foreign languages and often quoted them directly in his plays. His vocabulary was the largest of any writer, at over twenty-four thousand words. According to James Davie Butler, "the total vocabulary of Milton's poetical remains is more nearly seventeen than eighteen thousand (17,377); and that of Homer, including the hymns as well as both Iliad and Odyssey, is scarcely nine thousand. Five thousand eight hundred and sixty words exhaust the vocabulary of Dante's Divina Comedia." (The Once Used Words in Shakespeare)

      <p>
       I guess a better way to put it might be he knew 8,000 more words than Milton, and 19,000 more than Homer.

       Some but they weren't the actual myths but works created and retold. What I was saying is Homer could of had a much higher vocabulary than we know of but due to passing it down by word of mouth for centuries the vocabulary became dumber and unimaginative.

       Shakespeare got credit for inventing words that were recorded elsewhere earlier.  Scholarship with the aid of computing is only now beginning to catch up with this.  He's now credited with only inventing less than 500 new words, (or rather, the first recorded use of such words are from his plays) putting him in the realm of Milton, Jonson, Chaucer, &amp; Moore.

       De Vere traveled to all the countries mentioned in the plays, he wrote at a time when being an artist was degenerate (for an Earl), and fed the scripts to Shakespeare, an actor.

       Many experts in the field (like Orson Welles, Charlie Chaplin, Sigmund Freud, Mark Twain, etc.) believe that the guy from Stratford-upon-Avon did NOT write the plays. Most of them believe that Edward de Vere was the most-likely candidate for the plays, since his life matches up with the plays (whereas William Shakespeare's life doesn't). De Vere, by the way, was called "Spear-Shaker" in parliament, due to his family crest showing a lion shaking spears. You can see his crest here:
       <a href="http://deveresociety.co.uk/public/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/crest.jpg">
        http://deveresociety.co.uk/public/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/crest.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Tempest starts with the shipwreck of a ship in the Caribbean. As coincidence would have it, that ship was owned by de Vere.
      </p>
      <p>
       De Vere also visited every country that Shakespeare wrote about (whereas the man from Stratford-upon-Avon) didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       De Vere was also a lawyer . . . like the man who wrote Hamlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       A book is quoted in Hamlet that de Vere's father-in-law translated for the first time into English (but that wasn't widely available at the time the play came out).
      </p>
      <p>
       But to me the biggest problem with the official Shakespeare narrative is that they want you to overlook the massive dialect gulf that existed in England at the time. Before mass-communication (radio, cinema, television), the country was riddled with dozens of different languages and dialects. Only in London (where the elite were descended from French-speaking Normans) did English have the massive Latin vocabulary that Shakespeare uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of London, you wouldn't have encountered what we think of as "standard Middle English". You would have immediately run into Welsh-speakers, Cornish-speakers, Manx-speakers, Yorkshiremen, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time that Shakespeare lived, Stratford-upon-Avon spoke with a dialect that is very similar to the Yorkshire dialect, which most English-speakers find incomprehensible (since it's based on Norse).
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, "to earn some money" is to "addle some brass" in the Yorkshire dialect. "Lowp ovver t'yat" means to "Jump over the gate".
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember reading "Wuthering Heights" [which came out in 1847] and the English characters are always perplexed with the Yorkshire groundskeeper talks. None of them can understand him, and it's a running joke throughout the novel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing: The Yorkshire dialect was even more Norse and incomprehensible back when Shakespeare walked the earth in the 1500s. In fact, there are records of translators being needed when men from Strateford-upon-Avon were drafted into the army.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shakespeare arrived in London as a 28 year-old.
      </p>
      <p>
       He would NOT have sounded like the surrounding Londoners. Nor would he have had the mass-media to have allowed him to listen in on their accent or vocabulary. Yet he shows up in London and speaks exactly like an upper class Londoner (like Edward de Vere).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more perplexingly, not a single term, phrase or sentence from his native dialect ever makes it into any of the one plays.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Ben Jonson wrote, his accent, vocabulary and background are evident in the plays. When his child died, he wrote about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man from Stratford-upon-Avon had a child die, too. Yet it's never in the plays. Or in any of his other writings. (It's like it never happened.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Christopher Marlowe's works, too, is consistent with his class and educational background. He was a Londoner and spoke like a Londoner. It would have been odd in the extreme if he, say, wrote in Welsh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because that wasn't his background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, London-English was NOT the William Shakespeare's background. So why does he sound EXACTLY as if he were raised and educated in the background of Edward de Vere?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what modern Shakespeare biographies mess up. You'll see Hollywood movies about it (like "Shakespeare in Love") and they have everyone speaking the same brand of English. As if the nation in 1550 had the BBC, with everyone going to state-run schools and watching the same TV and movies. That is NOT how it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a 28 year-old showing up in London for the first time should NOT have been speaking and writing like Edward de Vere.

       If de Vere visited all of these countries, he would have likely known that Bohemia doesn't have a coast (A Winter's Tale) that there aren't cliffs in Elsinore (Hamlet) that Delphi isn't an island (Coriolanus) that it was impossible for Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to travel from Denmark to England in the time that they did (Hamlet).  He likely wouldn't have given the characters in Measure for Measure, set in Austria, Italian names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shakespeare was a master of language, not geography (He wasn't a master of history either, his plays have a bunch of anachronisms in them) so the argument that de Vere wrote the plays because the man from Stratford-Upon-Avon didn't travel is a weak one.  The author of Shakespeare's plays wasn't a big traveler.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that London then, as now, was a hodgepodge of accents.  However, the accents were different than modern accents of the same areas.  There is a lot of interesting work being done by a father and son team, David Crystal and Ben Crystal, to find the accent that was used in Shakespeare's day.  As for Shakespeare's accent being incomprehensible to Londoners, he was an actor.  He got work as an actor.  His speech was comprehensible enough to find work as an actor for a London audience.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/9FF5K8VlcRI?t=2903">
        Here's a bit of Ben Crystal talking about the accents of the Elizabethan/James I era
       </a>
       .  Certainly, a lot more scholarship needs to be done in this area, but I think it proves that our common understanding of accents in Shakespeare's era is lacking enough that we shouldn't speak definitively on what Shakespeare's accent sounded like.

       You're confusing plots that he actually wrote and plots from pre-existing plays.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Hamlet,
       </em>
       for instance, was NOT original to Shakespeare as a story. It was a centuries'-old tale that had recently seen a revival in Shakespeare's time with previous versions of the play appearing in France and later in England. Shakespeare did
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       version of it; but the only thing original about it is the language. The characters and plot are all from pre-existing plays.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Shakespeare didn't have a choice in the setting. The play was set in Denmark, because that's where the earliest versions of it were set.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Austria and Italy . . .
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize that they share a border, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       That there are portions of modern Italy that
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       to be Austria. And parts of Austria that
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       to be part of Italy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at neighboring Switzerland. It has an Italian section.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your argument that Austrians couldn't possibly have Italian names is like the claim that "No Swiss could possibly have an Italian name".

       Famous sculptor Alberto Giacometti was born in Borgonovo, Switzerland.

       Or how about Giuseppe Bonno? Sounds like an Italian, right?

       Shakespeare was a single individual.  I know this because I have read all of his works, including the Thomas Moore play, and there is a cohesion to the themes.  He was involved in the secret societies of his day, no doubt, but most people were.
      </p>
      <p>
       An additional mystery I would like to point out is the date found on the bottom right side of his folio cover.  The date clearly starts with an 'I', not a '1' - just look at the letter 'I' found elsewhere on the page.  During this time, the powers that be were trying to add ghost years to the calendar - at least 1,000 years to be exact.  This was done to prove the legitimacy of certain ideas TPTB wanted to promote as being well established, including Christianity.  It is not difficult to assume that Shakespeare was part of this movement, and that his purpose was to promote specific ideas TPTB wanted to become main stream.

       That's not Hall's only material on this. The chapter
       <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/roscrucian_and_masonic_origins.htm">
        Rosicrucian and Masonic origins
       </a>
       within "Lectures on Ancient Philosophy" says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During this period several books were in circulation which, to a certain degree, registered the pulse of the time. One of these documents—More's Utopia—was the picture of a new age when heavenly conditions should prevail upon the earth. This ideal of establishing good in the world savored of blasphemy, however, for in that day heaven alone it was assumed could be good. Men did not seek to establish heavenly conditions upon earth, but rather earthly conditions in heaven. According to popular concept, the more the individual suffered the torments of the damned upon earth, the more he would enjoy the blessedness of heaven. Life was a period of chastisement and earthly happiness an unattainable mirage. More's Utopia thus came as a definite blow to autocratic pretensions and attitudes, giving impulse to the material emphasis which was to follow in succeeding centuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another prominent figure of this period was Sir Walter Raleigh, who paid with his life for high treason against the crown. Raleigh was tried and, though the charge was never proved, was executed. Before Raleigh went to trial, it was known that he must die and that no defense could save him. His treason against the crown was of a character very different, however, from that which history records. Raleigh was a member of a secret society or body of men who were already moving irresistibly forward under the banner of democracy, and for that affiliation he died a felon's death. The actual reason for Raleigh's death sentence was his refusal to reveal the identity either of that great political organization of which he was a member or his confreres who were fighting the dogma of faith and the divine right of kings. On the title page of the first edition of Raleigh's History of the World, we accordingly find a mass of intricate emblems framed between two great columns. When the executioner sealed his lips forever, Raleigh's silence, while it added to the discomfiture of his persecutors, assured the safety of his colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the truly great minds of that secret fraternity—in fact, the moving spirit of the whole enterprise-was Sir Francis Bacon, whose prophecy of the coming age forms the theme of his New Atlantis and whose vision of the reformation of knowledge finds expression in the Novum Organum Scientiarum, the new organ of science or thought. In the engraving at the beginning of the latter volume may be seen the little ship of progressivism sailing out between the Pillars of Galen and Avicenna, venturing forth beyond the imaginary pillars of church and state upon the unknown sea of human liberty. It is significant that Bacon was appointed by the British Crown to protect its interests in the new American Colonies beyond the sea. We find him writing of this new land, dreaming of the day when a new world and a new government of the philosophic elect should be established there, and scheming to consummate that end when the time should be ripe. Upon the title page of the 1640 edition of Bacon's Advancement of Learning is a Latin motto to the effect that he was the third great mind since Plato. Bacon was a member of the same group to which Sir Walter Raleigh belonged, but Bacon's position as Lord High Chancellor protected him from Raleigh's fate. Every effort was made, however, to humiliate and discredit him. At last, in the sixty-sixth year of his life, having completed the work which held him in England, Bacon feigned death and passed over into Germany, there to guide the destinies of his philosophic and political fraternity for nearly twenty-five years before his actual demise.

       Its been an open question for a while now, so not really a conspiracy. There was even a thing on the BBC about the possibility of bacon being Shakespeare. I find it unlikely, as would you write all that and die without leaving any evidence it was you ? But that’s just using common sense. In reality we’ll never know. But isn’t Shakespeare a little more romantic sounding than Bacon ?  Sometimes you just got to live with the little white lies just to make the world a prettier place.

      <p>
       Bacons’ Romeo and Juliet ?  Just no.

       While alone is an interesting coincidence. but lets add in PSALM 46 in the King james bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       46 words from the beginning is SHAKE 46 words from the end is SPEAR. in 1611 when the KJV was translated was when Shakespeare was 46 years old.

       As for the works of shakespeare he was one of the great programmers. his plays and drama acted like the first televisions shows.... and how many stories do we have that are  inspired from his works... Hes quite a force in this world and yet few acknowledge that he isnt just a man . HE is WILL the WILL of I AM.....

       I think the truth of this world is so different then what we think, i think that secret societies form on both sides of the ally. Some want to reveal the truth to save humanity, and the other side wants to conceal the truth to save humanity. The idea that we cant handle the truth, REVELATION and APOCALYPSE mean the same thing.

       Not so scary  is it..... but it is... as the knowledge is forbidden... but by whom is it forbidden. We are made to fear the unknown, things that challenge our foundational beliefs are ignored for the laziness and fear of having to alter ones beliefs. That question of "what if im not quite right"

       Appreciate the courtesy of research. Have you looked into any other oddities of the bible? The genesis triangle being the first WHOA dude for me followed by the research of the Meru institute. Stan Tenon shows that GEN 1:1 derives a geometric shape that when viewed from a particular angle casts all of the shadows of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. He also shows that the Meaning of each letter has significance to where the shape is placed in relation to the human body.

       I'd have to say that Manly P. Hall's own background hardly presaged any indications that he'd become the leading and foremost expert on all occult matters in his early twenties after only a few years of study devoted to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite literally an overnight success, well supported by wealthy patrons that enabled him to travel the world in style, accumulate over 50,000 books on occult and esoteric subjects and spend his life comfortably writing books of his own on those topics and giving occasional lectures about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having read and studied Shakespeare I can only add the following in contrast to Manley's claims...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford, England, into a prosperous family of wool and leather merchants. His father, John, was also a minor government official in the area. 
There is practically nothing known of his early life and childhood and the next time his name appeared officially was in 1582 when he married Anne Hathaway. Although there is no clear record of when, why, or how, Shakespeare became interested in the theatre, it is known that he spent the time between 1582 and 1587 as an actor, stage manager, and a "provider of plays" for several acting companies near Stratford."
       <em>
        Taken from the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, Nelson Doubleday.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And from the Encyclopedia Britannica we get the following...
      </p>
      <p>
       "During his own lifetime and shortly afterward, Shakespeare enjoyed fame and considerable critical attention. The English writer Francis Meres, in 1598, declared him to be England’s greatest writer in comedy and tragedy. Writer and poet John Weever lauded “honey-tongued Shakespeare.” Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s contemporary and a literary critic in his own right, granted that Shakespeare had no rival in the writing of comedy, even in the ancient Classical world, and that he equaled the ancients in tragedy as well, but Jonson also faulted Shakespeare for having a mediocre command of the Classical languages and for ignoring Classical rules. Jonson objected when Shakespeare dramatized history extending over many years and moved his dramatic scene around from country to country, rather than focusing on 24 hours or so in a single location. Shakespeare wrote too glibly, in Jonson’s view, mixing kings and clowns, lofty verse with vulgarity, mortals with fairies."

       So from all appearances Shakespeare was a real person who could very well have been just what he is generally portrayed as being, which is one of the foremost playwrights of the Elizabethan period along with Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, George Chapman, Ben Jonson, John Marston, and John Fletcher that owing to antiquity and the nature of those times there isn't much more than their plays to attest to the fact they existed and were among his contemporaries.

       Sir Francis Bacon is highly regarded by the Rose &amp; Cross secret society (Rosicrucians). The Rosicrucians still have a strong influence in the United States and worldwide today. If Sir Francis Bacon really was Shakespeare, then this would finally give me an explanation as to why I had to fucking suffer trying to read this fuckin shit in high school. I could never understand what was so fascinating about him or the books, and why it was mandatory. There is absolutely no other reason why my grades, which can effect my job opportunities and income in the future, should depend on my understanding og Shakespeare's fuckin 400 year old books. It only makes sense if it matters to TPTB and they want to force it on the kids.

       I dont want to believe secret societies push their teachings in public schools, but they also taught us how to translate our names into Egyptian hieroglyphs in grade 4. Thats a great skill needed for us young kids growing up in small town Canada. Oh, and the one time they brought an animal inside the gymnasium for us to see during assembly, just a large yellow snake stretching the entire length of the gym. Nothing occult about that. And they made us line up single file to walk along and pet it.... and the trigonometry in high school.... I could go on and on
