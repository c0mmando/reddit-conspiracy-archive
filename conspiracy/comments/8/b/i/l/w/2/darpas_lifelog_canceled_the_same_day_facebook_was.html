&quot;take in all of a subject&#39;s experience, from phone numbers dialed and e-mail messages viewed to every breath taken, step made and place gone&quot;</p>

<p>For those who haven&#39;t heard of &quot;LifeLog&quot;, I highly suggest you read both the Wiki and Wired article I have linked below. If any of you have additional articles related to this, I would love some more information myself. </p>

<p>The Wired article that mentions that the project was cancelled due to the invasion of privacy it would create. The is the earliest article I can find that references this. The date of th article also happens to be the same date Facebook was founded. Could be a coincidence? The core part &quot;conspiracy&quot; is not only the date, but also the objective that LifeLog was attempting to achieve, and the similarities of what Facebook had become. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it is justified? Of course it is justified. The only funny thing is why people are suddenly so upset about a Facebook breach when there is much worse going on and has already being proven including exactly what is described in the Wikipedia page.

    <div class="md"><p>No not &#39;can&#39; do or could do. Do.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica stuff is important but far from &#39;the big story&#39;. For example let&#39;s look at their parent company SLC tha has worked with British military.</p>

<p>Guardian covered it but it didnt get much attention.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/mod-cambridge-analytica-parent-company-scl-group-list-x">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/21/mod-cambridge-analytica-parent-company-scl-group-list-x</a></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2014, MoD (Britain&#39;s Ministry of Defence) officials worked with SCL Group on “Project Duco” to analyse how people would interact with certain government messaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCL_Group">CA&#39;s parent company is SCL Group, formerly Strategic Communications Laboratories</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After an initial commercial success, SCL <strong>expanded into military and political arenas</strong>. It became known for alleged involvement &quot;in <strong>military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting</strong>&quot;. </p>

<p>According to its website, SCL has participated in over 25 international political and electoral campaigns since 1994.</p>

<p>According to its website, <strong>SCL has influenced elections in Italy, Latvia, Ukraine, Albania, Romania, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Mauritius, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Colombia, Antigua, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. While the company initially got involved in elections in the United Kingdom, it ceased to do so after 1997 because staff members did not exhibit the same &quot;aloof sensibility&quot; as with projects abroad.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to their <a href="https://sclgroup.cc/customers#federalcivillian">website</a> <strong>they&#39;ve worked for the UK MOD, NATO, and groups in the US DoD</strong>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is quite the coincidence. You could be right because this has happened before. Do you remember DARPA&#39;s &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; program? It used a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wIAFw">logo</a> with an all-seeing eye watching over the entire globe. After the controversy, caused in part by the creepy Illuminati logo, the program was &quot;formally suspended,&quot; but it came back to life through other agencies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Total Information Awareness (TIA) was a program of the United States Information Awareness Office that began during the 2003 fiscal year. It operated under this title from February until May 2003, before being renamed as the Terrorism Information Awareness.</p>

<p>Based on the concept of predictive policing, TIA aimed to gather detailed information about individuals in order to anticipate and prevent crimes before they are committed. As part of efforts to win the War on Terror, the program searched for all sorts of personal information in the hunt for terrorists around the globe. Admiral John Poindexter referred to it as a &quot;Manhattan Project for Counter-Terrorism&quot;. According to Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), TIA was the &quot;biggest surveillance program in the history of the United States&quot;.</p>

<p>The program was defunded alongside the Information Awareness Office in late 2003 by the United States Congress after media reports criticized the government for attempting to establish &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; over all citizens.</p>

<p>Although the program was formally suspended, its data mining software was later adopted by other government agencies, with only superficial changes being made. The core architecture of TIA continued development under the code name &quot;Basketball.&quot; According to a 2012 New York Times article, the legacy of Total Information Awareness is &quot;quietly thriving&quot; at the National Security Agency (NSA).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I researched the Lifelog/Facebook rebrand a while ago.  Even back in 2004 people were suspicious:
<a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/lifelog-from-your-defense-advanced-research-projects-agency.12806/">https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/lifelog-from-your-defense-advanced-research-projects-agency.12806/</a></p>

<p><strong>Not to mention, DARPA was asking for proposals to help build the tech.  My guess is that Zuck&#39;s platform won:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals to develop an ontology-based (sub)system that captures, stores, and makes accessible the flow of one person’s experience in and interactions with the world in order to support a broad spectrum of associates/assistants and other system capabilities.&quot;</p>

<p>Notice comment #6:
&quot;This seems rather strange... this LifeLog project comes from the defense agency when this program could have anything less to do with defense. While the benefits may seem neat (like auto-recording statistics and data when pencil isn&#39;t available), the potential for the information to be used against you seems to be great.</p>

<p>Sure it may help computer A.I. in computer games, but to go to those lengths to get it? Id rather have my computer A.I. buddies act stupid so I can waste them without them knowing it. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is allegedly a White House insider giving clues and telling everyone that Trump is taking down all the evils of DC/around the world. It started back in October, IIRC. Many say it is a LARPER, many think it is legit. Q communicates on the chans, not sure which one.  I&#39;m sure someone that follows Q can tell you much better than I. I just saw this one this morning and figured I would share. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anything about Lifelog, but someone should point out the obvious.
Arpanet was cancelled in 1990. We&#39;re using it now.
Their motto is essentially: &quot;DARPA buys down the risk until the industry is brave enough to take things on&quot; 
That GPS we use now was a DARPA project. A lot of our medical advancements were originally DAPRA projects, and so forth. They aren&#39;t coy about their funding, so if Zuckerberg was a recipient of a grant it would be public knowledge. </p>
