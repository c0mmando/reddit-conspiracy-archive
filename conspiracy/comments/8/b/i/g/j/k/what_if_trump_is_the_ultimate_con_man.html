       What if he was actually installed by the establishment and the powers that be as a ruse to dupe the masses? What if it was actually Trump's intention all along to push further into Syria but he needed plausible deniability first so that's why he came out days before the supposed chemical attack to say publicly that he wanted US troops out of Syria? What if he is the ultimate con man—
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick">
        confidence man
       </a>
       —used as a vassal in order for the establishment to clamp down on the internet and social media via this Russia scandal? Bob Mueller and Trump met and talked to one another the day before Rosenstein wrote the letter appointing Mueller as Special Counsel—what if that was merely an interview for a role in a manufactured play the establishment wanted to orchestrate? All a manufactured game and a ruse while our rights and privacy are taken away under the guise of Russiaphobia? And Trump is in on it. The ultimate divide and conquer scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't it Trump in the primaries screaming about Bush lying us into war and lying about WMDs? It was. The ultimate ruse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump sold out his associates and friends in order to gain the Presidency.

       If that were the case, he would not have installed Sessions, there wouldn't have been 6000+ pedo arrests, 4000+ MS13 arrests, and a border threat.  Trump and Sessions are actively shutting down the human trafficking business and making it impossible for them to sustain.

       Can you point me to any reliable sources about the pedophile or MS13 arrests? I see that ICE claims to have arrested about 800 MS-13 members in 2017, but other sources claim that they are inflating that number by labeling unaffiliated people as "MS-13". Regarding pedophiles, what's the latest evidence of the numbers?

       It is like you failed to read what I wrote. If Trump sold out in order to gain the presidency—throwing Manafort and others under the bus—and this is all an act then Sessions is in on it and their fighting is playacting.

       So him stopping human trafficking suddenly absolves him? Or answers my questions? He has to at least to appear to DO SOMETHING and tackling human traffickers and pedophiles and gangs isn't that hard.

       I think you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       this to be a deep state conspiracy but it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, Manafort is a fall guy, he is loyal to whomever is paying him more. Flynn will be pardoned as he threw away any validity of his own testimony by admitting he lied.  He may get a slap on the wrist but nothing major.  I have followed Sessions for my entire life and he has always fought the establishment - he is one of the few men in our govt with true integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, stopping human trafficking does absolve him.  That is a billion dollar black market business that
       <em>
        your government
       </em>
       has
       <strong>
        allowed
       </strong>
       to happen for your entire life.  Obama, Bush, Jr., Clinton, Bush Sr. all turned a blind eye to the human trafficking trade and made MINIMAL effort to halt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has put it on a full stop in his first year.  He has demolished their networks and stated he plans to make high profile arrests with his sealed indictments.
      </p>
      <p>
       You suggesting that this isn't a hard thing to do is complete nonsense.  This has been carefully planned and is costing the powers that be in America a lot of under the table wealth. To pretend like 10,000+ arrests in a year 'isn't that hard' tells me that you are relatively new to this.

       this one cites a Neon Nettle (called "fake news" even by ardent pizzagate truthers) article that claimed 3,000 were arrested.  That article no longer exists, and the 6,000 number came from someone stating "well since it was 3,000 in April must be 6,000 now!  Not a great source.

       Ah, here is Liz Cronkin's article.  First, note that this lumps in a LOT of sex crimes, mostly just johns and street-walkers, not just pedophiles.  Secondly, the data she cites contradicts her claim.  "less than 400 sex trafficking-related arrests in 2014 according to the FBI," but the FBI specifically states that the 400 number is a small slice of the action and in no way should be taken to be a complete tally of arrests.  Thirdly, most of the arrest that she credits Trump for were non-Federal arrests, which Trump has no influence on.  So thanks, but none of this is evidence of anything.

       Call a spade a spade. Anyone overly defensive and defending at all costs a politician of one political party in a conspiracy subreddit isn't enlightened. Both sides are of the same coin and defending one over the other is how the divide and conquer tactic works. I don't mince words but hey, I obviously hurt someone's feelings so I deleted it.

       Hence why I deleted it. But it isn't like the word isn't used constantly, daily, by numerous posters. I can use the word in general right but not specifically aimed at one individual poster, correct?

       The bp stings have been in the works for years... yet every time a related arrest makes news recently, some groups seem togo to extremes trying to make it look like someone is responsible? Do these groups think the rest of us are stupid? Or are they?

       Nope. Human trafficking arrests peaked under Obama in 2016, and have dipped by 18% in 2017 under Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       1,952 arrests with 631 convictions in 2016 (highest figures ever), 1,602 arrests and 578 convictions in 2017.

       It's themost current official information you can find. And it pretty clearly disproves the narrative that Trump is cracking down on human trafficking/pedos.

       where are your pedo arrests stats coming from?I think most of what op is suggesting probably is closer to truth than Donald Trump champion of human trafficking crackdown... I sincerely think if you make it on to a stage in the presidential debates these days you are 100% bought and paid for. The BANKS own Trump have since the 90's he isn't dictating anything to anybody IMO

       Agree that he is definitely a con man. All the people who believed him during his campaign fell for it which helps legitimize him stealing the white house. Can't say much as far as what you see the establishment as, but as far as cold war

       Can we not like either Obama or Trump? Why does it have to be either or? If you glance at my post history I've actually been defending Trump against the Trump-Russia narrative for months. This isn't partisanship, at all. Anyone at this subreddit that has been here for awhile should be beyond ideological boxes.
