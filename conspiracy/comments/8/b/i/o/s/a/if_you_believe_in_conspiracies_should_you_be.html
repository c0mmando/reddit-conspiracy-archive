       Hello fellow Redditors,
      </p>
      <p>
       I am curious how this sub feels. While most of us don't believe every single conspiracy under the sun, most of us would agree governments have a long and wide history of lying, stealing, killing and have even committing genocide in order to further their own interests with no interest of helping humanity. With the recent calls for gun control in the US and many companies changing policies towards firearms related companies and some even calling for the repeal of the 2nd amendment. Do you support the 2nd Amendment? (please be civil, I know this can be a hot button issue)

       Really? I apologize. I've been lurking/enjoying this sub for a few months but haven't run across it being addressed directly, I did a quick search too. However, I think you are right. The people who are generally anti-gun also believe their government will protect/save them.

       I posted because I was genuinely curious. I personally support it but I don't assume others feel the same way and I wanted to know.
I wanted to see if there is a correlation of people who don't blindly trust their government and support gun rights. As for criminals I m not sure how they feel...if guns are legal it does give them a larger pool of people to steal guns from.

       Yes, you don’t understand what I’m saying. I may not have been clear. The 2nd amendment protects the first, I get that. The 2nd amendment shall not be infringed. If you don’t support that you don’t support the constitution and in fact you’re not living under one.

       You are free to say no. It is a “do you support” question. You can answer “ Yes, no, partially”  or just screech if you wish. There is no wrong answer per se, I’m simply asking for opinions.

       To find out why people support or oppose the 2nd ammendment is to analyze it's root causes and demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The largest determining demographic is location, rural vs urban. This also explains why most gun prohibiting laws come from Republicans while the Democratic base is pro gun control. Simply put Republicans in government hail from larger cities. A democrat and republican are equally likely to support or oppose guns when sampled in the same location.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we know the cause, let us analyze the triggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rural areas have guns and exposure at a younger age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rural areas use guns for hunting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Urban areas have increased crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Urban areas have a higher percentage of homicides.
      </p>
      <p>
       The support or lack thereof in this sub is simply due to the statistics of location.

       Fascinating. I think there is a lot of truth to this.
Personally I may be an outlier.
I grew up very rural, was raised anti-gun.
Moved to super anti-gun downtown Los Angeles and had my door kicked in by a man with a knife at 3am. I lived 5 blocks from the police station and when I called 911, I was told "Is the attacker inside? No? Ok, we will be there in 45-60 minutes"...and they never showed up. The next day I applied to become a gun owner. However, in my new state which is much more 2A friendly, even in the city many are anti-gun. While rurally (the majority of the state) they are pro-gun.

       Thank you for your insight! I too grew up liberal but support 2A. Now I’m not sure what I am..maybe a libertarian possibly. But not really any party. But I agree, when governments disarm civilians it gets scary. Was just reading up on Wounded Knee...scary stuff. Also visited the killing fields in Cambodia, horrifying.

       But an Enemy of America would be very much Pro second amendment. Their argument would be: Go ahead arm yourselves to the teeth. Kill each other, become more and more crazy and entrenched in your Idiologies. Show the world your true faces. Vote for people that embody your Faith, live with the consequences of your own wishes. Why spend billions to destroy america and what it was and stood for, when those useful idiots do it all by themselves...willingly and very happy about it.

       Not sure why you hate America so much but glad you don’t live here either! Japan famously mentioned our 2nd amendment rights as reason not to invade the mainland during WW2 and I suspect other countries would as well. Thank you for your blind hatred though, it’s very productive and shows reason and thought. Please  take the time to leave an additional follow up comment that I definitely won’t read.

       Depending where he lives he has plenty of reason to hate us. Also once our dollar crashes and it will it's gonna take his country with ours! I would hate us too.

       Plus it's not us it's the Government and it's corrupt at a global level. Americans don't have much say even though they shove it down our throats saying we do!

       This is very true! Which is exactly why I believe the 2nd amendment is so important. Like people from most countries, Americans aren't bad...but our government does some evil stuff.People all over the world for the most part are all the same. They just want to be left alone, have their families, food, shelter and peace. Its the people who seek to disrupt that in the name of money and power that we all have to watch out for.

       Absolutely they use these false flag events to control with fear and to persuade Americans into accepting things they would otherwise say no to. We have no choice in how much money goes to our military budget or anything. We are simple people that don't want war .  The majority anyways. Le sighe I mean follow the money trail America has funded all of this.

       There’s a false equivalency going on here, where liberals are portrayed as wanting to take away all gun rights, repeal the 2nd Amendment, and even confiscate all guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is more nuanced, with most “liberals” arguing for stricter controls on gun ownership and education.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s basically like “conservatives” are saying that anyone in the country should be allowed to purchase and operate an automobile with no checks aside from signing up online and being mailed a driver’s license. When someone says that there should be a driving test and insurance requirement, they are misrepresenting this as a call for automobiles to be completely banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really people just want some restrictions so we don’t keep having random psychopaths buying guns and then going on killing sprees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even something as simple as a psychological evaluation for non-hunters would probably have stopped half of these catastrophes. And we can of course invoke the slippery slope fallacy and say that people would be denied gun ownership because of their political beliefs, but in reality there have to be ways to make it fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s why I don’t think guns will ever actually be banned outright like people are afraid of. In fact, it’s starting to seem like this whole thing has been manufactured to divide us and make it seem like there are only two choices, no restrictions and complete restrictions, so that we completely forget about everything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like there is a conspiracy to polarize the gun control debate to make conservatives think liberals want to take all their guns, and to make liberals think conservatives want everyone to be able to buy guns like they buy groceries.
