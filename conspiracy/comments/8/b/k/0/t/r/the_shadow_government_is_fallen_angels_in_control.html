<p>Project Jehovah: How Satan Controls Human Government
by: Gary Stearman on January 29, 2015</p>

<p>Originally written in January 2003</p>

<p>Following a general trend that has been visible for the last decade, students of Bible prophecy have lately become vocal about what constitutes “permissible discussion” within the limits of traditional biblical interpretation. Subjects that involve the contemporary interactions of Satan, fallen angels (nephilim), spiritual phenomena, and the connection between the powers of heaven and Earth have often been declared “off limits.”</p>

<p>This article attempts to show that we are now living in the times called the “last days,” or “latter days,” by the prophets and Apostles. That being the case, it can be expected that certain concealed phenomena will become increasingly visible in the times that immediately precede the seven-year period when the Lord judges the world. The discussion of formerly taboo biblical subjects must, therefore, be widened.</p>

<p>The prophet Joel writes of frightening heavenly phenomena and earthly disorder “before” the Day of the Lord arrives. It seems that we are living in that period of time. Malachi says that the prophet Elijah will be sent to the spiritual leaders of Israel during this same transitional period. Upheavals will occur, including pestilence, earthquakes and numerous wars. Many believe that since Israel’s 1948 statehood, there has been a “quickening” – the increasing appearance of dark spiritual phenomena, as sinister powers in the heavens realize that the time of their earthly rule during the days of the Antichrist draws near.</p>

<p>The Bible makes it very clear that dark forces exert a strong influence over world affairs. The Apostle Paul often made reference to these rulers of the darkness in heavenly places. He believed that they were the real power behind the despotic governments that constitute the world system.</p>

<p>But for the most part, Christians of the contemporary era tend to relegate these spiritual powers to an otherworldly background role. Though most Bible-believing Christians will admit the existence of angels – either in God’s service or in Satan’s – they stop there. In the ancient world, angels were readily recognized as interacting with human beings on a daily level.</p>

<p>Modern man places them closer to the level of superstition. That is, the possibility of an angelic presence is acknowledged, but the actuality of it is denied.</p>

<p>In fact, the dark spiritual forces of this world play a major role in the development and direction of human governments. Since 1947/48, marking the birth of modern Israel, their influence has been characterized by increasing openness.</p>

<p>Many will be surprised to discover that they have literally forced their way into the halls of government. In the United States, their presence has formed a hidden – and unconstitutional – establishment. It is variously known as “Majestic-12,” “Majic,” or a secret branch of the National Security Agency. For decades, this group has headed what President Dwight D. Eisenhower called, “the military-industrial complex.”</p>

<p>In his parting speech as president, he sounded a warning that this secret group was growing dangerously powerful. At the time, no one could have known what he meant. Today, however, important information has been brought to light. The truly evil outcomes implicit in his warning are now becoming quite clear. Almost unbelievably, they can be traced back to an operation called, Project “JEHOVAH.”</p>

<p>To be given the Lord’s Old Testament name in the years following World War II, this secret government operation must have been regarded as supreme…even transcendental. Eisenhower, himself, was a devout Christian, and knew the importance of that name. Without a doubt, this operation was regarded by government leaders as preternatural. In fact, it was that, and more. Dark and powerful forces had intruded into the inner workings of our constitutional republic.</p>

<p>Battling Angels</p>

<p>Before we look further into this amazing event, let us recall the ancient days of the Old Testament. There, the presence of angels is seen as a normal phenomenon.</p>

<p>First, we see that the Lord’s angels fight on behalf of the faithful. This is beautifully illustrated in the account of Elisha and his servant. It as about 800 B.C., and the king of Syria made war against Israel. Through the prophet Elisha, the Lord gave instructions that directed the defense of Israel’s kingdom.</p>

<p>When the Syrian king heard of this phenomenon, he naturally wanted to rid himself of the pesky prophet. Upon learning that Elisha and his servant had gone to the city of Dothan, the foreign king’s troops followed him. During the night, they surrounded the city. Their goal was to capture and kill the prophet early the next morning.</p>

<p>At this point the biblical narrative takes up the story:</p>

<p>“And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! How shall we do?</p>

<p>“And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</p>

<p>“And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha” (II Kings 6:15-17).</p>

<p>This historical account illustrates that angels do, indeed, assert themselves into the affairs of men. Perhaps it is not stretching matters to say that they direct the events of history.</p>

<p>The Syrian army, with its horses and chariots, had besieged the little city of Dothan. In human terms, Elisha and his servant were trapped…doomed. The Lord had used them to tip the balance in favor of Israel. When the servant saw the army, he naturally interpreted events from the human perspective. In his eyes, the two were as good as dead.</p>

<p>Then Elisha entreated the Lord on behalf of his servant. In answer to his prayer, the dimensional barrier that lies between us and the spirit world was momentarily lifted. The servant then saw the actuality of the situation. Horses and chariots of fire were waiting to fight on behalf of Israel.</p>

<p>Two facts emerge here. One, angels can physically intercede in human battles. And two, they can take on the form that suits the culture and situation of the moment. Chariots of fire have been seen for millennia. They are regularly seen today. However, no one today sees them being pulled by horses. In the present cultural medium, such fiery chariots would be interpreted by twenty-first century eyes as “high-tech.” Perhaps they would look like rockets or saucers ringed by fire.</p>

<p>But the angels were there for one purpose, to make sure that Elisha was protected, and that Israel went undefeated. In this incident, they made sure that Israel survived, according to the will of God.</p>

<p>In another well-known biblical example of this sort, the angel of the Lord came to Daniel the prophet, in response to his three weeks of fasting and prayer. By the time the angel came, he was in a weakened state. But the angel told him that his trip had taken three weeks, because he had been resisted by a dark, angelic opposition force:</p>

<p>“Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p>

<p>“But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>

<p>“Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days” (Daniel 10:12-14).</p>

<p>Here, the dark angel has a title: the “Prince of Persia.” No doubt, his function at the time was to act on behalf of the despotic human regimes that controlled Persia. How this evil being interacted with his human counterparts is unknown. But the angel who spoke with Daniel brought a prophetic message. And as he departed, he mentioned yet another dark power:</p>

<p>“Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? And now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</p>

<p>“But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince” (Daniel 10:20, 21).</p>

<p>Here, Michael, the archangel is mentioned as an opponent of two dark angelic forces, the princes of Persia and Greece. In Daniel’s day, Persia was at its apex of prominence. After that, Greece came to power. Still later, Rome rose to its era of world dominance. Today, the influence of Rome is still felt, as the Western Alliance carries the historical weight of the Holy Roman Empire into the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>Daniel’s prophecy states that Rome, as the fourth world power, will experience a reawakening in the latter days. At that time, humanity will be weakened by the forcible corruption of the race. Before the flood, the dark forces physically manifested themselves to the human race, taking wives and producing an unclean race of sinful half-humans.</p>

<p>In the last days, the Bible predicts that the same, identical phenomenon will once again manifest itself. Rome, the iron empire, will degenerate into iron and clay:</p>

<p>“And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay” (Daniel 2:43).</p>

<p>Here, as we have noted in other studies, “they” are outsides…alien intruders. As they did before the Flood, they will attempt to corrupt the human race, producing hybrids to do their bidding. Furthermore, their leader, Satan, knows that if humanity could be successfully infiltrated by an alien genome, the Lord’s redemptive process could be short-circuited. But as the prophecy clearly states, their efforts will not succeed.</p>

<p>All such activities are moving toward a state of open warfare in heaven. Today, Satan and his followers have access to heaven. They are free to intercede in our affairs, hatching their evil plans and conspiracies. They operate in semi-secrecy, masking themselves in forms that will be readily acceptable to the culture of the moment. Today, they appear as aliens coming from one star system or another. Actually, they are able to appear for a time, then retreat behind the cover of the heavenly dimension.</p>

<p>As counterfeit “space aliens,” they pretend to bring peace and the solutions to man’s problems. In fact, they pretend to be here to save man from himself, as he pollutes his environment, and threatens to annihilate himself with the nuclear poison of a world war. In the future, their cover will be removed. As given in the book of Revelation, Michael will defeat the dark powers, once and for all banishing them from the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>“And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</p>

<p>“And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p>

<p>“And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him” (Revelation 12:7-9).</p>

<p>This event will mark a great change in the affairs of the world. No longer will fallen angels and demons be able to circulate behind the scenes in the world’s chambers of power. They will be cast to earth, and judged. In the parlance of the spymasters, their cover will be blown. But what a horrendous phenomenon for humans who are alive in that day!</p>

<p>The point is this: Today, the dark powers of this world are free to wield their influence in a torrent of lies and deceptions. They really exist, and they really have the power to shape and control human governments. They are as real and as palpable as human beings, but have the momentary advantage of being able to disappear, when it is in their favor to do so. On this point, Paul’s statement is the clearest statement in the Bible:</p>

<p>“Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</p>

<p>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places” (Ephesians 6:11, 12).</p>

<p>The phenomena of the occult stretch across a broad spectrum of observable events. These “principalities” (archons) are directly answerable to Satan. They are the evil equivalent of archangels. Their “powers,” (delegated authorities) are the lesser angels – demons and the like – who rule the darkness. They operate at night and in the darkness, but their spiritual wickedness penetrates into the “high places” – the vaults of power, both in the heavens and on Earth.</p>

<p>One has only to think of Hitler’s well-known vision of the “superman,” to fully visualize this phenomenon. He told the story that once, while alone in his office, he was visited by the spirit of the ideal man. Its power was such that he both respected and feared it. But he saw it as the ultimate reason for the Third Reich, which would, he thought, bring a utopian kingdom to planet Earth. Actually, he was guided by demons.</p>

<p>The occult power behind his throne was called “The Society of the Golden Dawn.” Hitler and his followers felt that they were being led into a new science and technology by divine theosophical powers.</p>

<p>Here, it must be noted that the Nazis’ power rose upon the ashes of Israel’s Twelve Tribes. In a moment of history, the throne of Hitler was raised up against the throne of David.</p>

<p>That moment came to a dramatic conclusion in the year 1947/48, with the birth of Israel. It can be argued that this moment was the central idea of the twentieth century. Everything changed when Israel became a nation on May 14, 1948.</p>

<p>Shaping the U.S. Government</p>

<p>Hitler was gone, but the satanic conspiracy behind it was alive and well. The United States had defeated Germany in two wars. Some had called Hitler the Antichrist. Certainly, he was a type of the evil man. But the real Antichrist would be poured from the crucible of a demonic conspiracy yet to come.</p>

<p>In this country, the roots of this plot go back to that critical year 1947. In that year, the events of Roswell, New Mexico, and the UFO crashes there, changed the shape of our government. From the biblical perspective, it must be remembered that the central work of the fallen angels is to mold human governments into the form that is most useful to them.</p>

<p>Taking a retrospective view of this change, one must ask about the approach that would be taken by Satan, if he wished to infiltrate a representative democracy such as ours. Though corrupt in many ways, America was (and is) a nation pervaded and strongly influenced by the Christian ethos. How then would the dark powers take control of a government of, by, and for the people?</p>

<p>Science As Religion</p>

<p>In simple terms, they would create a crisis. Then they would create a branch of government not directly answerable to the people. And this, they did, taking advantage of man’s current belief system. Since the industrial revolution, the Achilles’ heel of the Western powers has been its belief in science and technology. Before that, religion and a host of superstitions controlled society’s perceptions.</p>

<p>For example, in the Middle Ages, the physical, chemical and biological sciences all fell under forms of spiritual interpretation, either secular or sacred. In the former case, alchemists and conjurers were the authorities; in the latter, religious powers decided the course of a matter. In either case, religious or pseudo-religious philosophy made up the mind of society. Angels were angels and demons were demons.</p>

<p>By the mid-19th century, “science” began to reign, progressively replacing religious authority as a guide to popular belief. Steam, gasoline, electricity, gunpowder and dynamite shaped the accelerating growth of Western society. Then came modern chemistry and physics, with the mathematics of relativity and nuclear power. Men in white lab coats became the modern priesthood. Angels and demons were now thought to be quaint anachronisms.</p>

<p>Under the thinking of this new “modernism,” any creatures who popped in from elsewhere were explained in the light of science, not the spirit. Thus, in the great “airship flap” of 1897, the many sightings of strange ships and odd creatures were either attributed to human scientific experimentation or visits from citizens of the moon or Mars. In the former ages, they would have instantly been branded as demons.</p>

<p>That, by the way, was the year of the first World Zionist Congress. The next great wave of sightings came fifty years later, in 1947, as events were shaping modern Israel.</p>

<p>Among those who document the historical occurrences of unidentified aerial phenomena, a curious relationship has been observed. Crucial events in the life of Israel seem somehow tied to the public appearance of “extraterrestrial phenomena.” Having investigated this premise on several levels, there is a great deal of evidence for its veracity.</p>

<p>Israel’s wars of 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, were all accompanied by mass appearances of unidentified aerial events. From the modern “scientific” perspective, this makes no sense at all. But when we take the biblical, spiritual view of a war in the heavens, there is a perfect fit.</p>

<p>The war between Michael and his angels, as they battle the great dragon and his angels, seems somehow to “bleed over” into this dimension during critical moments. When earthly battles reach fever pitch on the surface of this planet, they seem to be accompanied by similar crests of activity on the heavenly plane.</p>

<p>But more importantly, for the purposes of this discussion, these occasional physical intrusions into our world are intentionally used to produce an illusion that will play into the human lust for power.</p>

<p>Project “JEHOVAH” </p>

<p>Such was the case in 1947. Bit by bit, the truth about Roswell and its “crashed saucers” is emerging. Over the past fifty-five years, the tight ring of secrecy around the matter has steadily broken down. Military men on their deathbeds have confessed to their families that things really happened. Hundreds of secret documents have been leaked. More than one crash site was reported.</p>

<p>There were strange craft and “alien bodies” that were taken to secret sites around the country. Studies were undertaken to understand how humanity would be affected, should the secret ever be revealed. Many of the intelligentsia decided that society couldn’t take the news without suffering some sort of collapse. At the highest levels of government, the decision was made to classify any and every event that pertained to the “extraterrestrial” question. And thus it remains to this day. Documents from the 1950s reveal that officials regarded these secrets as more delicate than the famed “Manhattan Project,” that had developed the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>At that moment, a major death knell was sounded for representative government as it had been known in America since the days of the founding fathers. The top-secret National Security Agency and its many branches were given carte blanche authorization to function autonomously.</p>

<p>At first, they reported to the executive branch – directly to President Harry S. Truman. Later, during the Eisenhower administration, their duties were “farmed out” and compartmentalized, so that only the extreme “need to know” would enable one to gain access to their ongoing research.</p>

<p>The result was a government whose leadership became ensnared in a scheme that would lead them progressively into a pit of spiritual darkness. Byzantine secrecy would soon characterize the inner circles of U.S. military and industrial planning.</p>

<p>During the last decade, many researchers have documented these developments. Leading the way is an aerospace engineer, named Dr. Robert Wood. He has painstakingly cataloged, documented and published many of the documents of the era. They are called the “Majestic-12 Documents.” This, of course, refers to the above-top-secret group assigned to deal with the apparent crash of extraterrestrial vehicles.</p>

<p>Among them one finds a July 16, 1947, letter signed by U.S. Army/Air Force Headquarters, Commanding General Nathan Twining. It refers to an “Incident Report on Flying Discs,” and mentions “Proving Grounds in New Mexico.” This date follows the famous Roswell crash date of July 3, 1947, by only 13 days.</p>

<p>Another, carries the evocative title: “Code Word White Pebble Majcomsec Intelligence Eyes Only.” Beneath these words, on a line by itself, we see the words, Project “JEHOVAH.” Following that, are words that, if true, are truly epoch-making in their importance:</p>

<p>“Subject: National Security Agency code breaking of alien codex and historical research of the Central Intelligence Agency’s MJEBEN program and Department of Defense U.F.O. identification and detection ‘Project Firestone.’</p>

<p>“Prepared by MJ-12 group Technical Advisory Panel (MTAP-12)</p>

<p>“For Use By: Emergency Combat Communications (ECOMCOM)</p>

<p>“Completed On” October 2, 1962</p>

<p>“Approved By: Executive Committee (EXCOM) on October 24, 1962, 10:00 A.M., Meeting No. 3.”</p>

<p>All this sounds like so much science fiction. But there is great evidence that they are quite true. Imagine that an elite group decides that it is in the military’s favor to know and understand how to decode alien UFO communications. All the while, through various media outlets, they are vehemently scoffing at the reality of flying saucers, labeling them as “swamp gas” and optical illusions.</p>

<p>Then imagine that these brilliant men have given this task the very name of God in the Old Testament. Jehovah is the highest name of the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David and the prophets! It is as though these men believe that they are dealing with God, either personally, or through His representatives. This is blasphemy of the first order. To assign the name of God to the work of devils is the highest form of delusion. It leads to corruption, greed and lying on a mass scale.</p>

<p>Project “JEHOVAH” was already a long-standing undertaking by 1962. One of the documents referenced by Dr. Wood is a two-page letter written by Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is dated November 4, 1953. It recognizes the MJ-12 documents:</p>

<p>“I cannot overemphasize the need for the utmost discretion and understanding in exercising the authority set forth in these documents. Accordingly, I would like you to find some way to brief the various Authorizing Commanders on the subject to ensure that all are of one mind as to the letter and spirit of these instructions. Preferably, I would like to see this done in a closed meeting to be arranged through the Director of the National Security Agency, yourself, and representatives of the MJ-12/Special Studies Project. I specifically want Project JEHOVAH director Professor Albert Einstein and Doctor Robert Oppenheimer to inject any useful comments to the briefing as they are most informed on the physics related to the subject. Perhaps the annual Quantico conference could provide an opportunity to do this without the publicity which would call attention to a special meeting.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Dwight D. Eisenhower”</p>

<p>It is astonishing to realize that while publicly ridiculing the idea of extraterrestrial contact, our leaders were secretly devoting huge amounts of money and brain power to the problem. Ostensibly, they were trying to “protect” the citizenry from the shock of learning that we are not alone.</p>

<p>In fact, they had been duped by creatures that any other age would have been rejected as dark powers…demons who had materialized in our world.</p>

<p>The name of the Project … ”JEHOVAH” … tells us that the brilliant men who struggled to understand the windfall from a New Mexico desert ascribed godlike properties to it. The theoretical mathematics and physics, understood only by men like Einstein and Oppenheimer, were called upon to decipher a new physics. What records that have been gleaned from their operations tell us that they failed to make sense of what they found.</p>

<p>Ironically, they were the ones who had unlocked the power of the atom. Now, they struggled in vain to make sense of a strange alien intelligence.</p>

<p>The MJ-12 documents show that they studied the wreckage for signs of German or Russian language traces. They found none. They found a compartment on one craft, thought by Dr. Oppenheimer to be an “atomic engine.”</p>

<p>They discovered – and described – flexible glass cables wrapped in a woven sheath, thin sheets imprinted in pure silver, with thousands of microscopic connections. These, we now know to be fiber optics and printed circuits.</p>

<p>They saw bladeless turbines, power that seemed to flow endlessly, structures that seemed to be molded, rather than welded, and perfectly formed components without welded joints, fasteners or soldered joints.</p>

<p>Along with our leading scientists, the Majestic Twelve Project included a wide list of the top men in the Truman administration, including Dr. Vannevar Bush, who chaired a panel that included men like General J. Lawton Collins, Deputy Chief of Staff, United States Army, and General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Vice Chief of Staff, United States Air Force.</p>

<p>Other scientists were also included. In addition to Einstein and Oppenheimer, the panel featured Jerome C. Hunsaker, MIT, National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Director of Aeronautical Research, NACA, and Dr. James H. Doolittle, then associated with Shell Oil Corporation.</p>

<p>All these names – and more – appeared on a 1948 report called, “A Review of the President’s Special Panel to Investigate the Capture of Unidentified Planform Space Vehicles by U.S. Armed Forces and Agencies.”</p>

<p>It was reported that, in addition to a phenomenal inventory of undecipherable hardware, the government had collected a number of tiny bodies at the crash sites. They were said to be the size of children, with large heads and huge eyes. One of them was even said to have been kept alive for a time. Reports say that it communicated by thoughts, rather than speech. The details of these accounts are perhaps less important than the fact of their sudden appearance in our world.</p>

<p>Where had they come from? To this day, say the experts, this question is unanswered. Some say that they are “Pleideians,” or “Zeta Reticulans,” named after star systems visible to our astronomers.</p>

<p>More likely – and biblically – they are from right here on planet Earth. They are none other than followers of “…the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” (Ephesians 2:2). Over the millennia, the air, or atmosphere, has witnessed tens of thousands of curious comings and goings. Soldiers of Alexander the Great reported huge “flying shields” over their armies. Servants of the pharaohs reported exactly the same thing. Medieval monks saw flying vehicles, and remembered scriptural accounts of fiery flying chariots.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that our country has not been visited by benevolent messengers from the stars. They have not come to save our planet from nuclear radiation or air pollution. Rather, they have come to subvert and undermine the spiritual basis of our governmental system. Paul was right.</p>

<p>In a way, it is as though we – the United States – have made a deal with the devil. In exchange for the wealth that could be gained through advanced technology, our leaders created a so-called “black-ops” system of undercover activity. Some authorities, like Dr. David Jacobs of Temple University, say that our leaders have, in effect, been bribed to look the other way, allowing dimensional interlopers to abduct and experiment upon human subjects.</p>

<p>Their object is to create a human/alien hybrid…one who can survive in this physical dimension for extended periods of time. Such creatures would be literal spies in the service of the dark world mentioned by the Apostle Paul. Walking undetected among humans, they could confabulate incalculable evil in our society.</p>

<p>Other experts, like Colonel Philip J. Corso, in his amazing memoir called, The Day After Roswell, say that American industry was allowed to reap the benefits of the windfall for pure profit. He maintains that he oversaw the “seeding” of alien technology to the leaders of industry. He provides persuasive evidence that integrated circuit chips (microchips), fiber optics, lasers and super-strength fibers all came as a result of reverse engineering.</p>

<p>That is, bits and pieces of the new technology were studied and duplicated. One of the devices that was discovered aboard the downed discs was the laser. It took a while, but scientists found out how it worked, and now, it is a staple of our science and technology.</p>

<p>In everything from construction to space travel, it is indispensable. From this device alone, profits in the billions of dollars have been realized.</p>

<p>Where could our government have gotten the idea that their newly-acquired alien technology came from Jehovah? Could it have been from the first chapter of Ezekiel, in which the prophet saw a whirling fiery chariot that came and landed before him?</p>

<p>Its wheels within wheels and crystal dome “firmament,” stretching over the head of one who sat on a throne is highly suggestive of technology beyond man’s wildest dreams.</p>

<p>“And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</p>

<p>“And then I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>

<p>“As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake” (Ezekiel 1:26-28).</p>

<p>The “LORD” mentioned here is none other than Jehovah, Himself. The glorified Man before Ezekiel is none other than the preincarnate Christ.</p>

<p>Those who would imitate Him ply the airways by night as rulers of the darkness. Increasingly, they are capable of materializing on this plane, where they present themselves as “christs,” avatars, or astronauts of various kinds.</p>

<p>But their real purpose is to capture the hearts, souls and minds of ordinary mortals. Then, they are free to shape the course of governments and human history.</p>

<p>Even worse, they inject uncleanness into our society. Inter-species traffic is now more than just a science fiction movie. It is a nightmarish fact.</p>

<p>We should never forget one thing. The Lord told us that the genetic corruption that plagued earth in the days of Noah would come once again, just before His return:</p>

<p>“And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man” (Luke 17:26).</p>

<p>The famed military-industrial complex is far more than a financial power group. More accurately, it should be called, “The Military-Industrial-Mystical-Occult Complex.”</p>

<p>Roswell changed our world. The question is, how many other “Roswells” are there? Reverse engineering has produced many modern miracles, but it was really a Trojan horse. In these days, when science is seeking to penetrate the interdimensional veil, it is becoming openly apparent how those “principalities and powers” really rule human governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deceived?</p>

<p>Can you give me 1 piece of actual proof that Jesus actually existed? 
Why are all of the gospels written in Greek and not Aramaic? 
Where are actual forst hand accounts of so-called biblical history? Surely the apostles were not the only witnesses to his miracles? 
Why is the flood story of Noah the same as the one written in the Epic of Gilgamesh which was recorded almost 1000 years before?
While om on that one...why is the flood story almost the same across 15 different cultures? (I&#39;m actually mot denying a flood occured..but for totally different reasons) 
Why is it that until the time of Jesus , every Jewish &quot;Messiah&quot; was a war leader who fights to bring freedom to the Jews...but then when the Flavians came to Jerusalem...tje Messiah suddenly begs the common people to &quot;Render into Ceaser that which is  Ceasers&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask the Vatican.</p>

<p>Just because there are story&#39;s written before the bible was written means nothing. God used humans to write the bible in his time. Of course there are going to be other tails written about Noah&#39;s flood and of course there will be other Messiah&#39;s. The Jews were deceived because they were not looking for there Messiah to be a mere man completely debunking there traditions of men written doctrine.</p>

<p>It is absolutely impossible for mere man to have written the bible. These are books that were written over a span of 6,000 years apart. You have got to be deceived if you think that man has been able to write a book and fullfill the thousands of prophecy&#39;s over time just to make people pay their taxes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>God in the eternal past (Ps. 90:2; 93:2; Mic. 5:2; Heb. 9:14). </p></li>
<li><p>The drafting of God&#39;s plan (Heb. 1:3; 11:3; Eph. 3:11; 1 Pet. 1:20</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of the heavens, including the sun, moon, and stars (Gen. 1:1; Col. 1:15-18; Ps. 8:3; 90:2; 95:5; 102:25; Isa. 40:12, 26; 45:12; 48:13). </p></li>
<li><p>Creation of the spirit-world before the earth was created. (Job 38:4-7; Cor 1:15.-1 )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is when the spirit world was created including demons. There are many kinds of demon spirits, fallen angels and other spirit beings mentioned in scripture. It is certain they were not created wicked. They were originally created perfect and sinless and became fallen and unclean. Even the prince of demons is spoken of as being “perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, TILL iniquity was found in thee” (Ezek 28:11-17). God could not and did not created anything sinful. Everything in the spirit and human realms that is wicked and rebellious has become this way because of sin and because of free choice.</p>

<p>The fallen angels, demons and other beings are all rebels in connection with the planet Earth. They have sinned with the ORIGINAL rebellion on Earth under Lucifer, or they would not be confined in prisons under the Earth or be operating on the Earth now against God. That those below have sinned in connection with the Earth is clear from the fact that they are confined in the abyss underneath the Earth.</p>

<ol>
<li>Creation of the Earth. The Earth made perfect the first time, not creating it in vein. (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-7; Isa. 45:18; Heb. 11:3). </li>
</ol>

<p>The sons of God shouted for joy and all the stars sang when God created earth. (Job 38:4-7) So this means they were made before hand. So I would assume logically that God created heaven…and then all its inhabitant and then God created Earth and all its in habitants in that order. </p>

<p>Everything God created was created perfect THE FIRST TIME. God does not create anything void waste and empty and in chaos. So earth was not created void and without form.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Creation of &quot;the world [kosmos, social order] that then was&quot; (2 Pet. 3:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; 45:18; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17).  </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer&#39;s reign over &quot;the world that then was&quot; (Isa. 14:12-14; Jer 4:23-26; Ezek 28:11-17; Col 1:15-18) The length of his rule unknown.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>2 Peter 3:6 is not talking about Noah&#39;s flood because that world did not &quot;Perish&quot; for Noah and his family survived. It is talking about 3 worlds. The world that then was, the world that is now and the world that is to come.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Other thrones, dominions, principalities and powers of the universe (Col. 1:15-18; Eph. 1:21; 3:10; 1 Pet. 3:22). </p></li>
<li><p>The Kingdom of God universal; God the Supreme moral governor of the universe, and all in harmony with Him (Job 38; Dan. 4:17, 25, 32, 35) Length of the rule of the universal harmonious kingdom, before Lucifer started his rebellion is unknown. </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer, the original ruler of the planet Earth, conceives the idea conceives the idea that he can get the co-operation of other angelic beings of the universe, dethrone God, come the exalted supreme ruler of the universe (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer carries out his plans and through pride falls and foments rebellion by slander and accusations against the Almighty. He causes his own earth-kingdom subjects and over one-third of God&#39;s angels (Rev. 12:7-12) to rebel against Him. The Earth enters its first sinful career (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). The length of the uprising is unknown. </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer instigates rebellion and persuades everyone possible to rebel. He openly breaks relations with God and His government, and leads his rebels from the appointed place of mobilization on Earth into Heaven to dethrone God; but he is met by Michael and the faithful angels, and is defeated and cast as lightning back to the Earth (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; Luke 10:18). </p></li>
<li><p>God completely destroys Lucifer&#39;s kingdom on Earth, judges the earth with Darkness, just as Darkness is used for judgment or evil throughout almost every other place in the bible (why would Gen 1:2 be any different) and curses the Earth by destroying every bird, animal, fish, city, inhabitant, and all vegetation. He then turns the Earth upside down and by means of a great flood makes it empty and a waste (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17; 2 Pet. 3:5-9). The length of the pre-Adamite flood on the Earth is unknown. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Jesus, Peter, Paul and John all teach the overthrow of the pre-Adamite world. I can prove this through the study of the greek or katabol in the new testament.</p>

<p>Now here is Jeremiah </p>

<p>Jeremiah 4:23-26</p>

<p>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</p>

<p>24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.</p>

<p>25 I beheld, and, lo, <em>there was no man</em>, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</p>

<p>26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</p>

<p>He saw Genesis 1:2 and what else did he see there? He saw broken down cities, a wilderness, birds that were fled and <em>no man</em>. Which implies there was something inhabited on the earth at this time as well as animals and some kind of being that that built cities. </p>

<p>These had to be earthly subjects because God created the earth to be inhabited. They also built cities that could be broken down. These were not Human but man. Just like when someone take the mark they will no longer be human. The redemption period or trial period must have been like the angels. Nobody knows how long it lasted. They were made perfect and without sin though. God only makes perfect things. Just like in Noah&#39;s day they were destroyed after God&#39;s long suffering ran out. (Isa 45:18) It will always be inhabited with earthly subjects. Even after the Millennium. </p>

<p>Earth was in a state of judgment (Darkness) and broken down and destroyed by God&#39;s fierce anger. Darkness everywhere in the bible is referred to has judgment or evil. Just as in Gen 1:2 Because God is light and in Him there is no darkness.</p>

<p>So now you see Lucifer weekend these nations and tried to invade heaven ALREADY way before the war in revelations. This is why he fell and was in the garden when Adam was there.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-4 op" data-depth="4" data-id="dx7dpnj">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ilikerealmaplesyrup.html">ilikerealmaplesyrup</a> 2018-04-11</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Now go to Ezekiel 28:13-15: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold; the workmanship of they tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou are the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee”.</p>

<p>Lucifer was made perfect he was the most powerful being next to God and walked in a garden of eden on earth before Adams garden. UNTIL iniquity was found in him and he got filled with pride and went and trafficked all the land with his earthly subjects and deceived them. Then when he invaded Heaven his tail drew a third of the angels (rev 12:4) Which basically means he deceived them as well.</p>

<p>So when they &quot;ascended to heaven&quot;, it really makes you wonder if they had some incredible technology or if it was only the angels. Why would Satan need to deceive everyone on earth if they were not going to join him in a war? &quot;<em>just like he is doing again</em>&quot;  History repeats itself.</p>

<p>Now this verse is talking about two things as well as the antichrist if you read all the context. So you really have to connect Isaiah and Ezek together. And then just use some logic. His kingdom had to be on earth if he was going to ascend above the clouds and stars.</p>

<p>Rev 12:4 is talking about the war in heaven from the dateless past. As we already understand that 1/3 of the angels are ruling the earth now.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:5 we read this:</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;For unto the angels hath God not put in subjection the world to come of which we</p>

<p>speak.&quot; In other words, The World Tomorrow, the Kingdom of God, will not be under</p>

<p>subjection to angels. The present one is under subjection of fallen angels. The</p>

<p>demons, and the devil who is their head, rule this present earth and sway its</p>

<p>inhabitants. </p>

<p>but verse rev 12:15 is talking about the future war in heaven (rev 12:7 and 20:1-10)</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 2:4 is only talking about the antichrist, not Satan. It is only a man, the son of perdition that exalts himself above all that is called God. But he is really just a man.</p>

<p>So now we get to the war in heaven in Revelation 12 So the proper verses to link these to are Danial 11:45-12:1; Isaiah 24:21-22; 25:7-8 and 27:1</p>

<p>This war in heaven will be the last actual struggle between Satan and God over the possession of the heavenlies where Satan reigns as stated in EPH 2:2 and 6:12</p>

<p>Satan does not live in heaven but still has access to accuse but after this casting out he will never have access again has stated in Job:1:6 2:1 and also in Rev 12:7-12 and it also says it in Zech 3:6-9</p>

<p>Now the war predicted here in revelation that takes place in future could not have been the same war in heaven that took place in Isaiah 14:12-14 because it would not make any sense. Luke 10:18 clarifies this. For Satan cannot cast out Satan. This war was in the dateless past before the recreation of Genesis 1:3 started. The only thing in Rev that references the war in heaven in the past is Rev 12:4 which is symbolic for of the third of God’s angels that rebelled with Lucifer and showing how many will be with him in the future war in heaven under the 7th trumpet.</p>

<p>This war in heaven is in the future because ALL events from revelations 4:1-22:5 must be after the churches And the war in Isaiah was talking about when Satan Fell in the past and how he would be defeated in the future. (God’s grand plan)</p>

<p>It is interesting because if you read all of Psalms chapter 2 it is clearly a conversation with 3 people (The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.) I just don&#39;t know which one is talking when but they are describing how people fight against God and how they are scoffing at the evil world that is so foolish</p>

<p>The Antichrist is going to get a lot of the earthly inhabitants to actually wage war against God like he did in the kingdom he ruled over in the dateless past. History repeats itself. This is what transhumanism will probably do. Create Satan&#39;s army to wage war with Christ when he returns. </p>

<p>The battle of Armageddon will not be an ordinary battle between two sets of earthly nations. It will be a battle between the armies of heaven under Christ and the armies of the Earth under the dragon, the beat and the false prophet. On the side of Christ will be earthly Israel (Zech 14:1-15), the angels of God (Matt 25:31-45;  2 Thess 1 :7-10) and the resurrected saints of ages (Zech 14:1-5; Jude 14; Rev 19:11-21). On the side of Antichrist there will be the devil and his angels and demons (Rev 12:7-12; 16:13-16; Rev 20:1-3) the ten kingdoms who will have been recently conquered by Antichrist (Dan 11:44; Ezek 38, 39; Rev 16:12) and many other nations that will co-operate with the Antichrist through the ministry of the three unclean frogs (Rev 16:13-16; Zech 14:1-5, 16; Ezek 38, 39)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Spirit of God begins to move upon the flooded Earth and in the darkness which covered the waters to restore the Earth to a habitable state, and to create new land animals, fish, fowls, vegetation, and Adam as the new ruler of the Earth (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:6-9). Length of the re-creation is six days (Gen. 1:3-2:25; Ex. 20:8-11; 31:15). </p></li>
<li><p>The Earth is made perfect a second time and all things in the universe are again in harmony with God as before Lucifer&#39;s rebellion; except Lucifer and his spirit rebels are still at large in the heavenlies to further God&#39;s plan in the probationary periods of the human race should man fall (Gen. 1:3-2:25; Eph. 2:1-3; 6:10-18; Job 1:6; 2:1; Rev. 12:7-12) . </p></li>
<li><p>THE FIRST PROBATIONARY PERIOD-The Dispensation of Innocence. The length of this period was about six days. (Gen. 2:17-3:24). </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer (now the devil or adversary of God and man called Satan) enters the restored Earth, using an intelligent creature of God that as a will of its own, that could apparently already communicate (when have you ever heard of Satan using a creature of God to talk to a human after this incident?) with man before the curse, willingly lets Satan use him as a tool to tempts man and causes his fall, thus regaining dominion of the Earth and all things therein (Gen. 3; Luke 4; John 12:31; 2 Cor 4:4; Rev. 11: 15 ; 20:1-10). </p></li>
<li><p>Rebellion starts again on the Earth by the second ruler of Earth. Man is judged, the Earth is again cursed, the serpent is punished for life and enters its second sinful career, and all creatures are brought under the bondage of sin and corruption (Gen. 3; Rom. 5:12-21; 8: 19-23)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The heavens and the earth which are now&quot; since the restoration work of the six days, and since the new curse on the Earth await the time of the second renovation and third perfect state of Earth. Called the New Heavens and New Earth (2 Peter 3:5-13; Rom 8:19-23; Heb 1:10-12; 12:24-28; Rev 21-22)</p></li>
<li><p>THE SECOND PROBATIONARY PERIOD—The Dispensation of Conscience (Gen. 3:1-8:14). The length of this period was 1,656 years (Gen. 5:1-29; 7:11)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe you have ever read it. God limits himself according to His own revelation of Himself. He is bound by his own laws of the universe, which is the reason why he can only operate through man having Faith in Him. It is truly a choice.

<p>Unfortunately, I have read it more than ten times and had this STUPID FUCKING BOOK read to me at least three times.  Your God is extremely limited and is not the God of the universe.  I&#39;m glad you think belief is required for salvation and that you have created all these provisions in your belief system for the various rules of &quot;God&quot; you have constructed.  None of it is true.  The God of the universe does not make mistakes, have shit stolen, create plans in time and scheme with &quot;believers&quot;.  All of these things point towards the workings of a creature(s) incumbent by time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think he might be onto a good discussion point. Or rather a question. I know your answer already but here it is: Does God make mistakes? Dies he even care and if he does then why is it that he is only seeming to care when something good happens? Why can he not be given responsibility for the bad things as well.</p>

<p>Before you hurriedly type a hateful answer think on this person: Job.</p>

<p>The story as it is written (and in paraphrasing here) is basically God and Satan make a bet that no matter how much be suffers this guy won&#39;t renounce God or his love for him. </p>

<p>I love my wife deeply and my son equally in different ways...nut I&#39;m not going to hurt them to see if they renounce or hate me just to see of that love is pure.  That&#39;s a real asshole move on God&#39;s part to pit this poor guy thru so much pain. 
I have had the unfortunate fortune to see some pretty horrible things in my life. War, death, children who have been killed for nothing other than belonging to a different tribe, women abused and killed by a &quot;man&quot; who is supposed to love them..and everyday we see things like this and worse in the news. </p>

<p>Im going to quote one of my favorite tv shows (Supernatural) and sat &quot;There is no God  and if there is...he checked out a long time ago.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I will try to explain. There is no hateful answer from me too legit questions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does God make mistakes? Dies he even care and if he does then why is it that he is only seeming to care when something good happens? Why can he not be given responsibility for the bad things as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God does not want beings forced. He wants free moral agents that choose Him. He created Angels and earthly beings way before humans. 1/3 of the angels and everyone on earth came against him and tried to take over. So everything happening I just have to believe is the plan of God and is the only way it could be done. A system of choice on a cursed earth. God says that his knowledge passes all understand. His ways are not our ways. (If you read a few posts up you can see where I have the gest of the bible in chronological order) </p>

<p><strong>Job did not have the Gospel and Satan and God did not make any deals. Let&#39;s go over this verse by verse.</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 1:1  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
Job 1:2  And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
Job 1:3  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
Job 1:4  And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
Job 1:5  And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</em></p>

<p><strong>As far as biblical history is concerned this is the second reference to sanctification, inasmuch as Job is no doubt the oldest book of the Bible and the it records took place before the law of Moses was given. The first reference to sanctification concerns setting apart a day for God to rest (Gen_2:1-4). Here in Job it means that a father simply went through religious ceremonies before God in the hope that He would have mercy on his children. He set them apart in his own mind and religious acts; but this did not save them or protect them even from physical death. There is no hint of their being cleansed from sin; the idea is that of dedicating them to God, which is all any parent can do. The actual salvation of children happens when they meet God’s requirements for salvation. The mention of offerings here shows that sacrifices had continued from Abel’s time (Gen_4:1-26) until now. They were practiced through all the ages up to the time of Christ.</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 1:6  Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</em></p>

<p><strong>There was a day when angels in heaven came to present themselves before God. This happened twice (Job_1:6; Job_2:1), implying regular days for angels to do this. Worship no doubt happens regularly on the planet heaven, just as it does on earth and other planets with intelligent life. Scripture states that the invisible things are understood by those that are visible (Rom_1:20; Col_1:15-18; Rev_4:9-11; Rev_5:8-13; Rev_19:1-10). </strong></p>

<p><strong>The expression &quot;sons of God&quot; is used five times in the O.T., always of angels (as proved in Job_38:4-7; Gen_6:1-4, notes). The scene (both here and in Job_2:1) is in heaven before the Lord.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here we have the earliest mention (historically speaking) of Satan by name. Not even in Genesis is he mentioned by name—and the time of Job was early in history, for he was the son of Issachar, the son of Jacob (Gen_46:13). It is clear in Gen_3:1-24 that there was an invisible enemy who caused the fall of man, but in the passage he is shown using the serpent as a tool, the same way that he used Peter (Mat_16:23). In Job_41:1-34 he is symbolized by a great dragon. He is the evil spirit working in the children of disobedience throughout the ages (Eph_2:1-3). Here he is named and spoken of as a real person and shown to have access to heaven with power to accuse the brethren and seek their destruction (Rev_12:9-12). The word Satan means adversary.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now let&#39;s get to your main question.</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 1:7  And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
Job 1:8  And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</em> </p>

<p><strong>Do you actually think God brought up Job on his own. Surly God already knew exactly why His own created being showed up? Satan was just walking up and down the earth looking for someone to accuse. In fact Youngs literal translation actually says <em>&quot;Have you set your HEART on my servant Job&quot;</em> Much more accurate translation.</strong></p>

<p>Job 1:9  Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
Job 1:10  Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>

<p><strong>Well look here, Somehow Satan already knows Job fears God and that God has a hedge a protection around all that he has. Right after God &quot;brought up His servant Job&quot; too Satan. So He had to have been watching Job for a long time now. He HATES Job because God protects him. Job is the RICHEST &quot;christian&quot; (God serving human&quot; In the world at this time. Could it possibly be that Satan has come to God (The judge) with Job already set on his heart because he found an accusation against him that Job might have no idea about?</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 1:11  But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</em> </p>

<p><strong>This is not a persuasion of Satan convincing God this is something God actually must do by His own laws. Satan is just being Satan and assuming this is what he is going to get out of it (more accusations against him in court for the future because he found an open door)</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 1:12  And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</em> </p>

<p><strong>This shows that God is simply telling Satan his limits based on whatever God knows already (the bible says he is a just judge. So I would simply have to trust his judgement)</strong></p>

<p><strong>So then I will skip all the bad things that happen to him and now we read</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 1:21  And said, Naked came I out of my mother&#39;s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. 
Job 1:22  In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Two Great Mistakes of Job
1.    Claiming: &quot;the Lord hath taken away&quot; (Job_1:21)
2.    Questioning: &quot;shall we not receive evil?&quot; (Job_2:10)
Job was like many who think that sickness, disease, calamity and other evils come from God, and Satan has nothing to do with them. Some declare that these are the heritage of believers, and those who go through them are in the perfect will of God. It is true that Christians experience tests of faith, persecutions, injustices, and trials of life, but they are not required to suffer sickness, disease, or poverty in order to be saved and in the will of God.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So even though Job did not sin he still accused God (and of course I doubt Job even had any idea of who Satan was) So now Satan comes back to God for more.</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 2:4  And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 
Job 2:5  But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</em></p>

<p><strong>Now let&#39;s skip to a few verses</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 2:9  Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. 
Job 2:10  But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</em></p>

<p><strong>Now, can you see what is happening here? Satan is trying to tell God that Job is going to curse Him and coincidentally Jobs wife looks at him in the midst of his suffering and tell him to curse God and die. Wonder who was whispering into his wifes ear? Still though he accuses God ignorantly for the evil that is happening.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So how did Job let this happen in the first place? FEAR. In the very beginning Job was making all these sacrifices for his sons because they were evil. Job let Satans thoughts take over his life. Job tells us this here...</strong></p>

<p><em>Job 3:25  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. </em></p>

<p><strong>Job did not have the gospel like we do today</strong></p>

<p><em>Ecclesiastes 10:8, &quot;He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>Fear is actually a sin. This is way Jesus tells us not to fear and only believe.</strong></p>

73.    You oppose me (Job_30:21).
74.    You have lifted me up to the wind and have dissolved my substance (Job_30:22).</strong></p>

<p><strong>All 74 of the above statements are false, because it was Satan who took away his substance (Job_1:12-19), terrorized him, and did all the other cruel things to Job (Job_2:6-7; Job_42:10). At first Job did not sin with his lips or charge God foolishly, but after his friends came and he endured long months of suffering, he began to do so. For this he repented (Job_40:1-6; Job_42:1-6).</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the end, God healed and blessed Job materially beyond anything he had experienced before his trial, and such is the plan of God for all men—not just Job. It is clear from Scripture that Job’s trouble was from Satan, not God (Job_1:6-19; Job_2:1-7). The Lord was Job’s deliverer (Job_42:1-10). If He delivered Job from Himself, He was fighting against Himself, which could not be. Christ came to heal all that were oppressed by the devil, not oppressed by God (Mat_8:17; Luk_13:16; Joh_10:10; Act_10:38; 1Pe_2:24). To follow truth we should stop blaming God for sickness, pain, poverty, and calamity, and count them as curses or enemies of both God and man, then cooperate with God and look to Him for deliverance and immunity from such.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answers to life and what God is are not in this stupid fucking book.  Read Leviticus.  Don&#39;t just pretend that your God did not say a bunch of bullshit.  Read about the punishments and murders God has people commit in the Old Testament.  Why would God kill people?  Now, pretend all that fucked up shit was not said, and did not happen.  Read the New Testament stories about the sun-God traveling with the twelve constalations performing miracles before dying in December, just as the sun dips in the sky.  Read the strange babblings of mad men who follow this religion longing for more murders and mayhem.  Sure did read it.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. If you look up the &quot;Younger -Dryas event&quot;, I believe this is the actual event that caused most of the surviving cultures of the world to have very similar &quot;flood&quot; mythos.</p>

<p>As for the converting aspect of the story: I would posit that this is seen in alot of Christian culture...just look at the myth of  Jesus birth. Most modern scholars agree that in December in the middle East, there is no way a baby would&#39;ve survived being born in a typical cave like manger. That plus the convergence of stars to create the &quot;Anunciation &quot; (I think that is it&#39;s title, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) could&#39;ve happened in April..yet we celebrate his birth on December 25th..Why? Because it was one to the winter Solstice which is one of the most important pagan holidays and it signifies the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the sun. There are alot of holidays that are similar in nature yet have been assimilated into the Christian faith as a way of making the conversion of the pagans easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I do not thinl that it was written just for the sake of taxes. That was one example. 
The bible was essentially put together over the course of about 30 years. 
I mention the Greek vs. Aramaic difference because Aramaic was the language spoken by the people of the area of Jerusalem at the time of Jesus. 
And using bible quotes to prove that the veracity of its claims is a poor way of trying to convince me of its truth. That&#39;s like saying &quot;of course Aliens took Elvis..it says so right here in the Weekly World  News! ( if you don&#39;t know what that is..look it up)</p>

<p>And yet all of your arguments and you still haven&#39;t given <em>one</em> credible piece of evidence that Jesus ever existed. </p>

<p>Also answer this: Why is the Vatican in Rome? Why not in Jerusalem or Galilee? Why center a religion based upon the teachings of a middle eastern man in Europe? </p>

<p>While we are at it...When the council at Mycea gathered together to edit the Bible to make it point to Constantine as a true man of faith, why were certain books and references (such as Josepchus&#39; work &quot;Antiquites) deliberately left out and/or edited?</p>

<p>Why would any proof of (what was probably a real person) named Yeshua and his actual.marriage to a woman named Mary be hidden? Could it be because proof of the real man who is set up as the &quot;Christ&quot; and his all to real existence be enough to cause the church to lose its already tenuous hold on the people of its time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Job was ignortly accusing God and was not sinning during all this UNTIL his friends came along and then Job accused God 74 times...</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.    &quot;The Lord hath taketh away&quot; (Job_1:21). Really, Satan did this (Job_1:6-19).
2.    &quot;Shall we not receive evil?&quot; (Job_2:10). The truth is, God cannot tempt men with evil (Jas_1:13-16). We are to pray &quot;deliver us from evil&quot;—not &quot;deliver us from God&quot; (Mat_6:13).
3.    &quot;God had hedged in&quot;—with calamity (Job_3:23).
4.    The arrows of the Almighty are within me, and their poison drinks up my spirit (Job_6:4).
5.    &quot;The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me&quot; (Job_6:4).
6.    God scares me with dreams, and terrifies me through visions, &quot;so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than life&quot; (Job_7:14).
7.    You have &quot;set me as a mark&quot; against You (Job_7:20).
8.    You do not pardon my transgressions (Job_7:21).
9.    He breaketh me with a tempest&quot; (Job_9:17).
10.    He multiplies my wounds without cause (Job_9:17).

12.    &quot;He fills me with bitterness&quot; (Job_9:18).
13.    He destroys the perfect and the wicked (Job_9:22).
14.    &quot;He will laugh at the trial of the innocent&quot; (Job_9:23).
15.    He has given the earth to the wicked (Job_9:24).
16.    He hides the faces of the judges so that they cannot discern right and wrong (Job_9:24).
17.    If I made myself ever so clean, yet You will plunge me into the ditch (Job_9:30-31).
18.    You oppress and despise me (Job_10:3).
19.    You &quot;shine upon the counsel of the wicked&quot; (Job_10:3).
20.    You know that I am not wicked, yet You destroy me (Job_10:7-8)
21.    You have &quot;poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese&quot; (Job_10:10).
22.    If I sin, then You mark me and will not forgive me (Job_10:14).
23.    You hunt me as a fierce lion (Job_10:16).
24.    You renew Your witness against me, and increase wrath upon me (Job_10:17).
25.    &quot;The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure,&quot; into whose hand God brings abundance (Job_12:6).
26.    &quot;Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him&quot; (Job_13:15).
27.    You hide Your face from me and count me as Your enemy (Job_13:24).
28.    You write bitter things against me, and make me possess the iniquities of my youth (Job_13:26).
29.    You put my feet in stocks (Job_13:27).
30.    You destroy the hope of man (Job_14:19).
31.    He has made me weary (Job_16:7).
32.    He has made desolate all my company (Job_16:7).
33.    He has filled me with wrinkles (Job_16:8).
34.    He tears me in wrath (Job_16:9).
35.    He hates me (Job_16:9).
36.    He gnashes upon me with His teeth (Job_16:9).
37.    He has delivered me to the ungodly, into the hands of the wicked (Job_16:11).
38.    He has &quot;broken me asunder&quot; (Job_16:12).

43.    He does not spare me (Job_16:13).
44.    He pours out my gall upon the ground (Job_16:13).
45.    He breaks me with &quot;breach upon breach&quot; (Job_16:14).
46.    He runs upon me like a giant (Job_16:14).
47.    He has done all this for no injustice in my hands (Job_16:17).
48.    He has made me a byword of the people (Job_17:6).
49.    God has overthrown me (Job_19:6).
50.    He has captured me in His net (Job_19:6).
51.    He does not hear me (Job_19:7).
52.    There is no justice from Him (Job_19:7).
53.    He has &quot;fenced up my way that I cannot pass&quot; (Job_19:8).
54.    He has set darkness in my paths (Job_19:8).
55.    He has stripped me of my glory (Job_19:9).
56.    He has taken my crown.
57.    He has destroyed me on every side (Job_19:10).
58.    He has removed my hope like a tree.
59.    He has kindled His wrath against me (Job_19:11).
60.    He has counted me as one of His enemies.
61.    His troops raise up their way against me, and encamp around my house (Job_19:12).
62.    He has put my brethren far from me (Job_19:13).
63.    He has estranged my acquaintances (Job_19:13).
64.    The Almighty troubles me (Job_23:16).
65.    God has taken away my judgment (Job_27:2).
66.    He has vexed my soul (Job_27:2).
67.    He has loosed my cord (Job_30:11).
68.    He has afflicted me (Job_30:11).
69.    He has cast me into the mire (Job_30:19).
70.    I cry to You, and You do not hear me (Job_30:20).
71.    I stand up and You do not regard me (Job_30:20).
72.    You are cruel to me (Job_30:21).
73.    You oppose me (Job_30:21).
74.    You have lifted me up to the wind and have dissolved my substance (Job_30:22).</strong></p>

<p><strong>All 74 of the above statements are false, because it was Satan who took away his substance (Job_1:12-19), terrorized him, and did all the other cruel things to Job (Job_2:6-7; Job_42:10). At first Job did not sin with his lips or charge God foolishly, but after his friends came and he endured long months of suffering, he began to do so. For this he repented (Job_40:1-6; Job_42:1-6).</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the end, God healed and blessed Job materially beyond anything he had experienced before his trial, and such is the plan of God for all men—not just Job. It is clear from Scripture that Job’s trouble was from Satan, not God (Job_1:6-19; Job_2:1-7). The Lord was Job’s deliverer (Job_42:1-10). If He delivered Job from Himself, He was fighting against Himself, which could not be. Christ came to heal all that were oppressed by the devil, not oppressed by God (Mat_8:17; Luk_13:16; Joh_10:10; Act_10:38; 1Pe_2:24). To follow truth we should stop blaming God for sickness, pain, poverty, and calamity, and count them as curses or enemies of both God and man, then cooperate with God and look to Him for deliverance and immunity from such.</strong></p>
