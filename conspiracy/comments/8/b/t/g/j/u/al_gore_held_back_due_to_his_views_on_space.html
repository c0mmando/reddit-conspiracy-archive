        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello there</p>

<p>I will admit Gore V. Bush occurred when I was 6 but I was just watching his new film An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power on Netflix and an hour and 14 minutes in he mentions something quite interesting to me.</p>

<p>As Vice President he had the 2nd photograph of the planet hung in his office and called up NASA asking for an updated photo to which they replied there really wasn&#39;t one at the time, he questioned why we didn&#39;t just have a satellite giving us a daily picture of The Earth (and may have wanted to start a program to do so) as well as commissioned a satellite equipped with all manner of devices for detecting solar storms and other local anomalies but it was first cancelled then stripped down to just a few instruments before The Bush Administration had it launched as The Deep Space Climate Observatory.</p>

<p>Still to this day while we have the live feed on The ISS we don&#39;t have a satellite simply taking pictures of the planet for wide release, most new photos of The Earth are stitched together with some elements of photoshop.</p>

<p>So maybe if more is going on up there then they want us to know about right now Al Gore suddenly coming in and asking around, not playing ball like Bush would be an issue for those in the know.</p>

<p>Was just wondering what some people who were a bit more aware of the goings on in the world at the time might think?</p>

<p>Here is an idea. Put the fucking camera on a servo, when we hit the dark side, swing the camera 180 and let us watch the starts? The milky way should look fantastic from there. That would be nice. ISO problems? Okay, use a different cameras with night settings. I&#39;m sure NASA can afford that making 52 mill a day. </p>

<p>It would take quite a bit to find again but last year I watched a video showing how The inside of the ISS almost looked like some kind of advanced VR set with the astronauts in harnesses, one of them reached for a pen that was floating as if in low gravity and the pen clipped through some of his fingers like in a video game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it for two seconds. You&#39;re asking questions that were answered 170 years ago. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect">The Doppler effect</a> comes into play. The video and audio links are not transmitted directly to earth because their relative velocities make that very difficult. They are instead bounced off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_and_data_relay_satellite">these things</a>.</p>

<p>So, you have an antenna on the ISS which is moving at 5 miles per second. That is pointing at one of those tracking and relay satellites. The signal is bounced between those satellites until it reaches the one above White Sands in New Mexico. If any of those antennas are misaligned the signal could drop. If anything passed between those satellites and interrupted the signal, the signal could drop. If a significant weather system lay between the last satellite and White Sands, the signal could drop. A Solar event could cause the signal to drop. A power fluctuation in the ISS or any of the relay satellites could cause the signal to drop. </p>

<p>Being able to aim a radio signal at the Earth is not enough. That&#39;s not how it works anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.. what you&#39;re telling me is that we can&#39;t have a 24/7 live feed from ISS in LEO in 2018, because it&#39;s too difficult. with a 52 million dollar a day budget they can&#39;t make that shit work? Got it!!  you believe what you want, and i&#39;ll do the same. But what you provided me was no proof. a wiki link to the Doppler effect? Are you joking me? Since you are fond of the Doppler effect, maybe you should look into Halton Arp&#39;s work. Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think the Doppler effect is not the major obstacle to overcome?</p>

<p>If the frequency of the signal is changing because the antenna is moving at 5 miles per second, don&#39;t you think it would be difficult to tune the receiver to the carrier wave? </p>

The Earth is the same pixels wide as it is tall. In other words, it&#39;s a perfect circle/perfect sphere even though they say it is pear-shaped with flattened poles and a wider equator. I measured this one and another &quot;image&quot; of earth which was 3000 pixels wide, which should have been 7 pixels wider than taller, but wasn&#39;t. Neither have flat poles. </p>

<p>Pick one: is this a fake picture of Earth, or do they lie about the shape of the Earth? </p>

<p>1) It&#39;s a camera, not a million-kilometer long set of calipers, so there&#39;s gonna be some fuzz;</p>

<p>2) Presumably the atmosphere also makes some difference;</p>

<p>3) The satellite isn&#39;t perfectly over the equator, because it&#39;s in line with the orbital plane and the equator is tilted about 20 degrees off.</p>

<p>Combine this idea with the one above and youll realize how dumb it is. </p>

<p>SO you mean to tell me the gubmint is funneling money to NASA to the tune of a whopping 52 million bucks a day which is about 0.4% of the budget? </p>

<p>WHY ISNT NASAs BUDGET 40% IF THE BUDGET!?!?! </p>

<p>THe DoD get nearly 14% of the budget, are you suggesting the entire war effort is a CGI creation using actors? </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty circular, the equatorial bulge is like 26 miles, against a diameter of 7900.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not quite right -- the reason you couldn&#39;t see stars on the moon is that it was daylight.  Think exposure times: a shutter speed that&#39;s fast enough to not get washed out in the light isn&#39;t long enough to capture stars.  This camera is between the sun and the earth, so looking at the earth as it reflects full on straight daylight. If you have an exposure short enough to not get washed out in the reflected light, it&#39;ll be too short to capture the dim light of the stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There wouldnt be much of a point to just sending back a picture of the Earth from that far away for the sake of it. Satellites cost millions of dollars to launch and the ones taking pictures of Earth tend to be spy satellites.</p>

<p>Theyre stitched together because, in order to get the high resolution images where you can see cars, houses and people(or read a newspaper from space which is what the classified imaging is capable of) you cant have a huge area in each shot, so you take thousands of high resolution images and stitch them together to make Google Earth imagery. Its done by many satellites in different orbits at different times of day, and they dont all get updated constantly(some images are years out of date next to images from recent passes). Some places are intentionally lower resolution because there are spy bases and military facilities that obviously need to be hidden since Google Earth is public.</p>

<p>The funny thing is NASA actually does do this.  The Deep Space Climate Observatory is parked at the Lagrange point between the earth and sun constantly monitoring both, and they use one of the cameras onboard to post <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov">daily photos of the earth on their website</a>, basically for the sake of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI: Gore won the election</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Al Gore, not George Bush, should be sitting in the White House today as the newly elected president of the United States, two new independent probes of the disputed Florida election contest have confirmed. </p>

<p>The first survey, conducted on behalf of the Washington Post, shows that Mr Gore had a nearly three-to-one majority among 56,000 Florida voters whose November 7 ballot papers were discounted because they contained more than one punched hole.
The second and separate survey, conducted on behalf of the Palm Beach Post, shows that Mr Gore had a majority of 682 votes among the discounted &quot;dimpled&quot; ballots in Palm Beach county. </p>

<p>In each case, if the newly examined votes had been allowed to count in the November election, Mr Gore would have won Florida&#39;s 21 electoral college votes by a narrow majority and he, not Mr Bush, would be the president. Instead, Mr Bush officially carried Florida by 537 votes after recounts were stopped. </p>
