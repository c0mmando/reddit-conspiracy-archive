        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During the last election, the county was pretty much divided... Everyone expected a certain someone to win. But she didn&#39;t . Was this on Purpose ?</p>

<p>Image someone you were told for months was going to win... gets blown the fuck out. And not only Blown out... but... she lost because of what many...(Not me) this are stupid archaic rules (But, She won the Pop vote ). This is neither here not there.</p>

<p>Because &quot;She was SUPPOSED TO LOSE&quot;. Her loss was the springboard to the great Divide.. the left vs the right. And you fell for it. Hook line and sinker.</p>

<p>Many are Pissed. She Lost. Now how do we piss you off further ? Every day we hammer the winner. He&#39;s Racist, He&#39;s a Billionaire Swamp Creature, He&#39;s so and so&#39;s Puppet...He fucks porn stars. He&#39;s crazy... Left get more mad... ( I could go on and on here)...
Now it&#39;s time to piss off the Right... Your Winner is Not what you thought he was. He&#39;s a war monger. He&#39;s a criminal.. Let&#39;s investigate him...Let&#39;s arrest People close to him ( Guilt by association). Let&#39;s tell them the Deep state is going after him... let&#39;s ransack his lawyer&#39;s office...let&#39;s show the right on a daily basis that the deep state will not allow him to NOT be impeached. the right get Pissed...</p>

<p>Everyone is pissed the fuck off.</p>

<p>Right vs Left</p>

<p>So now TPTB want to have more fun.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pay a few Pot Stirrers (PAID SHILLS) to whip up the crowd on Face book, on Reddit... And You FALL FOR IT !!! HA HA HA.</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#39;s make the Left Right and the Right Left....&quot;</p>

<p>The left (HIPPIES - LOVE trumps hate) Hates war.. fuck it let&#39;s do some False Flags to make them LOVE war... want war.. With Syria, With Iran with RUSSIA!!!!</p>

<p>The Right(Have no problem with war if there is a Reason) Make them NOT want war... Make them Hate WAR... Get out of Syria... Syria was a False Flag...Russia are our friends</p>

<p>Again I am missing so much shit but you get the Idea...</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about TPTB playing games... It&#39;s a FUCKING SHOW for them. They want a War.. but not against other countries... they want an internal War... Right against Left.</p>

<p>However, TPTB are fucking Idiots.</p>

<p>There are millions and Millions of Americans. And we couldn&#39;t care fucking less. We have Mcdonalds, We have Wal-Mart , We have Costco. Sure there will be some fucking Idiots who get all riled up and will proabbly end up killing each other over this bullshit.. but in the end... most just do not fucking care.</p>

<p>The Hate that TPTB are trying to create is just not there. Did you really give a flying fuck when you saw that fat girl die in West Virginia ? Or did you stand up when you saw the Mental kid almost scalped in Chicago ? Nope you didn&#39;t you sent your prayers and wishes... and went to the Outlet Mall to get some new sneakers.</p>

<p>God I love America. Fuck TPTB !!!</p>

<p>Americans don&#39;t really fight over politics like this in the real world. Much of it is fake and paid for. It&#39;s a television show for the media to get ratings. They always fan the flames, like it was the Jerry Springer Show. Trump is merely the new storyline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Nero&#39;s defense- the height of the Roman Empire was still almost a century away, and Rome was a BFD in the West for another 400 years and the East for another 1400. The Brits, though no longer in possession of their once vast physical Empire, have joined their fates with us Yanks- and as the poster below you pointed out, the Brits still have an <em>incredible</em> amount of soft power, and the City of London is still the heart of world finance. The Brits have far more power than you might realize.</p>

<p>The question for America isn&#39;t what will happen to our position on the world stage- that is clearly untenable. We occupied an unprecedent position as sole-world superpower, something that hadn&#39;t been achieved since Rome (though in very different contexts), and the rest of the world, especially the East, is finally catching up. The question for the US will be if we use what strategic geopolitical and economic advantages we have left to turn ourselves into a domestic powerhouse- will we give healthcare to, feed, and clothe all our citizens? Will we transition to a self-sufficient green economy? Will we overhaul our entire domestic infrastructure? Will we invest in higher education, to keep it world class, while guaranteeing it to all our People? These are the things that will keep us as a competitive force well into the future- even if we aren&#39;t <em>the</em> competitive force. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not in the form you would think. I explained already how Britain has maintained her status in the world- the City of London plays an important role here. The Roman government collapsed in the West in 476 and the East in 1453, but the Roman Church still exists. It is the oldest Corporation in the world, with a continuous history going back some 2,000 years. It is a thoroughly <em>Roman</em> institution, straight from antiquity. So while the Roman state may be long gone, the Roman Church most definitely still exists- and with its ages comes power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are not each one about a half the life span of its predecessor? And I didn&#39;t even mention the Egyptians!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I made no argument there- you are talking about land mass and superpower status- meaning being relatively unrivaled within their sphere of influence. However, being an overt superpower isn&#39;t the only form of superpower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are watching the decline of the American empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as I said- we are watching the decline of American global hegemony, which can be considered Empire. However, there are things that can be done by America to ensure it remains an important player on the global stage, <em>the</em> important player in the Americas, and a domestic powerhouse both culturally and economically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it is the word <em>empire</em> that is confusing you. Yes reminants of Rome and Britain exist. But they ain&#39;t fucking empires. Not like they were. The sun never set in the British Empire, at one time. Now the sun slowly fades over them entirely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you are using the word &quot;empire&quot; too rigidly. There are different types of Empire, and not all require them to be visibly enforced as were those of old. There are power structures that exist and interact in this world, with their own way of enforcing their wills, and an illusion of choice granted to those underneath them. </p>

<p>The Holy &quot;Roman&quot; Empire wasn&#39;t Roman. It was German, and it was granted its &quot;legal&quot; authority from the crowning of Charlemagne by the <em>Roman Church</em> on Christmas 800.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The British Empire is dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I ask you to look into the City of London, or the fact that Queen Elizabeth and Charles still have veto power over Parliament. You should also look into the Black nobility and the Papal nobility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rome and Britain are still a thing, yes.</p>

<p>There may be some sort of empire-ness to be found with both.</p>

<p>Again, this should tell you something. I highly recommend you dive down the rabbit hole a bit deeper. Rome, London, and DC (the Corporation of which is specifically separate from the US) are all highly important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a written record (via letters) that testifies to its &quot;chain of custody&quot; so to speak. Prominent Italian thinkers sent these texts to one another during the Renaissance, after discovering them in monasteries. We have their letters saying, in effect: &quot;Hey, I found this manuscript, I&#39;m sending it to you, let me know what you think&quot;. Obviously this is a paraphrase but you get the point.</p>

<p>Now, you could make the case that even these letters are forgeries, but Occam&#39;s Razor tells me that isn&#39;t likely to be the case. This is also how you trace manuscripts back further. A 15th century MSS is a copy of, say, a 12th century MSS, which was in turn a copy of a 9th century MSS. You can trace their connections to one another on a couple of counts. First- the &quot;hand&quot;. The &quot;hand&quot; is the handwriting involved in copying the MSS, which can be regionalized and dated. The second is their similarity. MSS&#39; with the same mistakes, interpolations, or lacunae can reasonably be assumed to share a common source, even if that source is now lost. </p>

<p>What makes you think that all these sources referencing each other directly and indirectly, the chemical analysis, the library indices and bills of sale are forged to make a specific  text appear forged? </p>

<p>How likely is it that all these sources and records are forged? What standard is required to know something? For something to be probable? Likely? Most likely? </p>

<p>What about refining and building on knowledge or must everyone rediscover every step and piece themselves es?</p>
