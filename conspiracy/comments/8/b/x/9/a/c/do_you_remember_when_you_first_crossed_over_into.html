    <div class="md"><p>I feel like there are shitty people who take advantage of the trust of basic civility, certainly guarantee a conspiracy, and at the higher the social/class levels, the more elaborate the actual conspiracy can be. </p>

<p>Basic psychological evaluation and breakdown of how certain personality types/social classes coexist, react, and work with others would show that certain people are just made to lie and deceive, and many political offices have been festered by people easily manipulated and dissected by richer people with a bigger agenda. </p>

<p>Anyways, I digress, but I remember having these type of thoughts even as a kid and thinking that conspiracies in a logical sense make sense. Out a endless amount of people, there&#39;s not going to be a group of people trying to work the loopholes to try and gain an advantage right under the general public&#39;s noses??? Of course there will be! From us working with friends to cheat on a school test, to negotiating and purposely leveraging bankruptcy for a tax lien, this is all stuff that has happened, will happen, and continue to happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I one hundred percent agree. For anyone else reading this a TLDR of u/GrownUpTurk ‘s comment would be that a lot of people are bad and logically they will conspire in order to gain advantage. As for why I agree, pretty much I’ve worked in behavioral therapy for the past 3 years, and there is clear evidence that people conspire Even amongst children. It’s just human nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 was the trigger.  </p>

<p>From there, it took me over a decade to progress from &quot;bush and the top level republicans at least knowingly allowed it to happen&quot;, to &quot;holy shit, they were <em>all</em> in on it (media, L.E., politicians) and they come from an ancient family that&#39;s been ruling over us for thousands of years!&quot;</p>

<p>There was a lot of depression, hopelessness, dead ends, and misguided notions along the way, but I&#39;m mostly better now :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. I can’t pin down a single moment, but it was a very quick process, I have absorbed just incredible amounts of information in the last 2 years, year and a half. </p>

<p>I used to be a Liberal and I listened to these Liberal podcasts. Then they started lying about Trump. Trump said something about Saddam Hussein like “one good thing about him was that he killed terrorists.” The next day the media runs articles saying that Trump was praising a dictator. Clearly not though. Blatant lie and exaggeration.</p>

<p>Also I had a teacher that was a Liberal, but he served in the military. He talked about radical Wahhabism and things like that over in Iraq. He was an Obama supporter. So even when I was a Liberal I was somewhat shocked when the Liberals got so mad at Trump when he said he wanted extreme vetting. I’m thinking to myself these are dangerous people that want us dead, why the hell wouldn’t we want to have extreme vetting? </p>

<p>Also Trump was right when he told us our jobs were being outsourced. Because of this I thought for a while and came to the conclusion that raising taxes would be a bad thing and lowering taxes would actually help bring jobs to America. As Trump mentioned we lost a ton of manufacturing jobs under Obama. </p>

<p>So basically I had this whole new view of Trump. He wasn’t this racist, sexist pig, he was a good businessman and he had ideas for how to restart the economy. I was already big on YouTube. But then I started stumbling into Paul Joseph Watson, Mark Dice, and Alex Jones videos. Exposing the Social Justice Warriors, who are truly a scourge on the left, and exposing the lies of Hillary Clinton and the media against Trump. And with Alex Jones comes Conspiracy Theories. I started viewing him as a reputable source because the things he was saying made sense to me. Sure I didn’t like all the fear porn and the deep state is trying to kill Trump nonsense but it did for sure seem like the media was against Trump more than anyone else. Like he was enemy number 1 even though he really didn’t do anything that bad. And with Alex Jones comes a more conspiratorial view of the world. I also got interested in Anonymous, the hacker group a little bit.</p>

<p>Then this summer I don’t know what got into my head but I thought to myself if they lie about Trump and treat Trump this unfairly, what’s to say they wouldn’t lie about Adolf Hitler in the same way? I mean this guy with a quirky mustache being the most evil man history? I started listening to the audiobook of Mein Kampf and it honestly sounded pretty good to me. He was talking about these ANTIFA like people in society that would destroy property, they hated the country and all of its history, and they praise the dumbest and most useless members of society and think the government should pay for their existence. It rang a buzzer in my head. This was exactly what’s going on here and now and Hitler spoke about it brilliantly to me. Hitler also spoke of ideas on how to unite Germany in Mein Kampf. Mentioning that we are all very divided in terms of age, occupation, status, class, things like that. He wanted to get rid of trade unions because they always pitted the workers against the owners, and that’s not the way it’s supposed to be. We need to be united, rich and poor, come together. I suggest you read Mein Kampf btw. </p>

<p>After this I started doing my research on Jewish power and Israeli power but I still listened to some of the Alex Jones type Conspiracies. Sorry for making this so long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I loved this reply! Exactly what I was asking for. I love hearing other peoples stories because I clearly remember when it struck me— though it&#39;s STUPID, it was all the illuminati gossip like 8 years ago. As a Christian, things like good and evil aren&#39;t really shocking or foreign to me, so  the illuminati stuff was very believable. I was reading vigilantcitizen.com. I still don&#39;t have a definitive &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; on whether it&#39;s even real, but part of me thinks we just give different names and formats to the same general thing. Deep state, Luciferians, cabal, globalists, illuminati, etc etc etc it&#39;s kind of all the same to me.<br/>
Oh and SO interesting about Hitler! You know they say he never shot himself and was actually exiled to South America ;) And Alex Jones- I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the Bohemian Grove videos. WTF!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was more of a gradual thing. At first, I looked at conspiracy theories cause they just ‘sounded wack’, ya know, like some of those conspiracies about celebrities and clones, all that mainstream stuff. Then I evaluated different types of conspiracies on a more serious level to understand why people would believe them. Then I started looking at the evidence for &amp; against conspiracies. Some I believe, some I don’t. I’m still researching and learning more about different conspiracies and I feel like there’s heaps more that I <em>should</em> know. I guess that’s just experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like there are shitty people who take advantage of the trust of basic civility, certainly guarantee a conspiracy, and at the higher the social/class levels, the more elaborate the actual conspiracy can be. </p>

<p>Basic psychological evaluation and breakdown of how certain personality types/social classes coexist, react, and work with others would show that certain people are just made to lie and deceive, and many political offices have been festered by people easily manipulated and dissected by richer people with a bigger agenda. </p>

<p>Anyways, I digress, but I remember having these type of thoughts even as a kid and thinking that conspiracies in a logical sense make sense. Out a endless amount of people, there&#39;s not going to be a group of people trying to work the loopholes to try and gain an advantage right under the general public&#39;s noses??? Of course there will be! From us working with friends to cheat on a school test, to negotiating and purposely leveraging bankruptcy for a tax lien, this is all stuff that has happened, will happen, and continue to happen. </p>
