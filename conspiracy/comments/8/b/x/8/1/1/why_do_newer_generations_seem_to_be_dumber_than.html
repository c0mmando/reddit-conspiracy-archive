        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently 19 years old, I&#39;m a student of industrial engineering and I love what I do, kind of, I&#39;m also part of what is called &#39;Gen Z&#39;, which is the next generation before Milenialls. I asked that because since I entered to high school, I&#39;ve been realizing how many people of my age follow the same type of lifestyle. By that I refer to using lots of time using smartphones to chat l, share jokes, make funny comments, post an snap, take selfies, etc. When socializing with others, their topics tend to be about random stuff of their lives, with a big sense of humor so they do laugh a lot normally. A big percentage of these people prioritizes their social life before everything else, so their weekends are all about parties, socializing and drinking. Most of them have actual zero interest on informing about the events going on around their country and world, and have never had read a book in their life and if they have, it&#39;s of real fiction. </p>

<p>Do you know somebody who is like this? I want to know because this describes the average adolescent among where I live. If I write this is because of course I don&#39;t consider myself to be one of them, in fact, I constantly like to inform myself about something new every day, and this has helped me so much to perceive the world with a much mature perception of it. I do know that this is quit normal around people of my age. </p>

<p>Anyway, I wonder if the advance of technology and capitalism is affecting the new generations by making them addicted to its products, impacting negatively in their future and so on, or if it I&#39;m completely wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to not think of it as different not better/worse. </p>

<p>If you lived in the Middle Ages rather than now, you’d probably live on a farm and be poor and/or be pressed into military service because every other generation there’s an ethnic cleansing and/or die of a horrible disease at 40. In our time, man,  you could be a millionaire drunk in Vegas who fell off a skyscraper or a starving child in a third world country, forced to <em>witness</em> the wealth and prosperity of industrialized nations. </p>

<p>Then again, back then in the olden days without technology <em>I could truly own land</em>, it was always the Wild West, whoever had the biggest voice, the greatest idea or skill, they led the people; often the encounters with others were violent. No one could tell me to “<em>not do that</em>” on my land because <em>no one could hear me through a phone.</em> </p>

<p>You see there’s always challenges, always darkness to go with the light. In tribal times, man, it must of been awesome; but being in a forest tribe <em>doesn’t get me to the moon</em></p>

<p>It’s the sacrifices we’ve made. We traded true freedom for absolute order, long ago; 18th-19th Century is when it really got going; nation states. The world was mapped out, stripped naked, and repeatedly raped for centuries now. All to quench our thirst for the big question(s); “is there a god or aliens?” “Can we travel the stars and the high places in myths and legends?” </p>

<p>We’re all one mind, technology has both revealed and corrupted this truth. It’s a truth many knew lonnnnng before the modern era. </p>

<p>History is either linear or cyclical and if it’s cyclical (which I believe) this has happened before, hence all the crazy knowledge ancient people had. We’ve discovered some of the same things but through different avenues. </p>

<p>You seem like someone who wants to know the truth, and I beseech you, always take everything and everyone with respect, but know when opinions or ideas are superior or inferior to the base, standard human consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re doing fine, OP. Admitting you know nothing is a pretty aware statement. The society you were shaped in was designed to create that archetype of person. As an early millenial, i&#39;ve watched and participated in the expansion of technology and media into our daily lives. If you have the time, watch the joe rogan with russell brand podcast... you are not alone and everyone, even your peers, ARE waking up. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason seems to be your pair of nostalgia goggles, coupled with a (un)healthy dose of confirmation bias. Our ability to socialise with each other and exchange highly detailed information is reason #1 why our species has been so succesful, so <em>of course</em> mechanisms have evolved to ensure its central position in our lives. What you perceive as a new development has been the case since the dawn of man; life in the 70s, 60s, 50s, the 19th century or whatever time period you have chosen to idolise was just as centred on small talk as it is now, if not even <em>more</em> so. The only difference is that it&#39;s now happening via a screen.</p>

<p>I myself adhere to the point of view opposite to yours: Gen Z is not necessarily smarter, but certainly media-savvier than those who came before. The older generations are still very much inclined to believe something just because it is written in the papers. Young people are usually far more skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think you can compare Gen Z to its predecessor. More than anything, the hippies, the punks and the ravers were rebels who were actively pushing against the system. That kind of violence burns out quickly and usually results in conformist citizens later down the line. Gen Z, meanwhile, sees itself forced to participate in a system that they don&#39;t support because they don&#39;t see a way out. That kind of latent, brewing anger is much more suited to being leveraged for political change, for more abrubt manifestations tend to burn out before anything can be accomplished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common core, pharmaceuticals, lackadaisical parenting and a culture that is no longer chiefly based upon ones merits and work ethic. I also wonder what a lack of using your imagination as much has done to the development of kids. Delayed gratification also has many positive effects and in today&#39;s culture of &quot;i want it now&quot; we&#39;re not seeing a net positive in that regard as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they have knowledge without wisdom - just google it, don&#39;t learn why or how or any details about a topic, just take tidbits of information and spit them out without a foundation or the logic and reasoning behind it.  Deal in absolutes based on first search results and Wikipedia-like entries you find.  Don&#39;t discuss - make emotional statements of facts and refuse dialogue on any counterpoints.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like an old soul. Sending virtual hugs!</p>

<p>I remember being a teen but not, you know? I was lucky to get to know a broader range of young people through my interest in the performing arts, and that&#39;s where I started to meet real friends. Creative and interesting people with a sense of purpose and power.  Maybe a similar environment would help you with your social life? Like, volunteer to help
build sets for a play, or try am open mic night at a comedy club or join an interesting group of another kind where people are doing cool things. Go someplace where people aren&#39;t looking at their phones so much because the nature of the space is about interaction.</p>

<p>Just some thoughts! I know that I was very lonely for a long time before I found members of my &quot;tribe.&quot; Kids back then seemed so boring and in lockstep with mainstream culture and nothing really changes, cell phones or not!</p>
