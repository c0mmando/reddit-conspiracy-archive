       I was reading about DEA agent Camarena's killing and that the CIA was accused of helping kill him. Apparently Camarena discovered that the CIA was involved in drug dealing and became a great threat to the black op. I was wondering if the war going on in Mexico between cartels could be a divide and conquer strategy by the US Deep State as well?

       I believe he's talking about the US,  as in,  the cartel wars are allowed to spill over the border into the US because it weakens us as a nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Obama administration intentionally weakened our national security by tying the hands of border patrol and ensuring our Southern border was not adequately defended. They were creating problems on purpose, and their actions were blatant and obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember,  a goal of the NWO is to disassemble the United States.   They intend on causing more damage here with refugee hordes (just like Europe) pushing up from the South, created by engineered destabilization in Central America and Mexico.

       On the contrary, I think the NWO wants to expand the United States. Look at the back of the dollar bill, it says "new order of the ages". And I remember one congressman wanted to rename the country to "United States of Earth".

       There’s likely other motives, but personally I can’t offer any evidence to what they may be. Something about globalism, probably.

       There is actually a rumor circuling around the north of Mexico, saying that Obama send special ops around 2012 to help exterminate the rival gangs cause the cartle's were in a battle for power.
       <br/>
       Anyways, 2012 was a crazy violent year but afterwards the cartel moved their operations to another region and that is the popular belief around Tijuana, that it was all due to Obama's intervention from the shadows.

       You obviously didn't read the article.  Trump has already allocated 1.3 trillion dollars in American taxpayer money to fun the wall and promises to spend more.  So no...Mexico will not be paying.

       I think we could learn a lot from Israel’s wall. They have tunnel detection. They also have women in bases the drive remote controlled ford raptors with turrets on top patrolling the wall.

       There a various technologies the U.S. can use to detect tunnels, but all have their limitations. Ground penetrating radar does a poor job at detecting anything before 40 feet. This does little good considering that one tunnel discovered between San Diego and Tijuana traveled at a depth of almost 100 feet below the surface. Ground radar readings are also affected by ground conditions, and give poor results in urban settings or in damp, clay-rich soils.

       You do realise that the wall is a corporate agenda concerning (notably) the CIA and the most prominent of Mexican cartel(s), right?  Here's what's going to happen...
      </p>
      <p>
       The small time coyote, foot runner smuggling drugs, and swamp slogging illegals will all be a thing of the past.  The only illicit way across the border will be to use a tunnel co-owned by the aforementioned multinational conglomorates.  This creates a monopoly on relevant drug trades excluding boating and flying in favor of the wealthiest 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't hope for the wall to be built, I hope for it to be built right.  This means excavating the border to bedrock for all 1900 miles of the border and equipping seizmographic sensors in the foundation of the wall.  Only then will the 99% actually benifit from the wall.

       Members of the US and Mexican government both want the cartels to keep going. The US could send troops south of the border and help Mexico wipe out the cartel within a week if we all really wanted to stop this so called war on drugs. But they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       On. Side note..when I was researching history about Los Zetas I learned that their original members were traines none other than by Israeli forces. Pretty strange huh? It seems it was in the 90's prior to 9/11. Maybe they needed an allie to move all that opium into the US from Afghanistan eh?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After Osiel Cárdenas Guillén took full control of the Gulf Cartel in 1999, he became involved in a violent turf war. In order to keep his organization and leadership, Cárdenas sought out Arturo Guzman Decena alias el Z-1, a retired Army lieutenant who lured more than 30 army deserters of the Mexican Army's elite Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales(GAFE) to become his personal bodyguards, and later, as his mercenary wing.[20] These Army deserters were enticed with salaries much higher than those of the Mexican Army.[21] Cárdenas' goal was to protect himself from rival drug cartels and from the Mexican military.[22][23][24] Some of the original members, who had come from the GAFE unit, had during the 1990s reportedly received training in commando and urban warfare from Israeli Special Forces Units and American Special Forces units, which included training in rapid deployment, marksmanship, ambushes, counter-surveillance and intimidation.[25]

       The cartels are competition (laughable competition) for the CIA's drug trafficking programs. The FBI allied with one of them ostensibly to "fight the others", but conveniently the Sinaloa cartel is allowed to bring in trailer trucks every year with a guarantee of not being searched. So the FBI is profiting from them, the CIA tolerates them unless and until their own operations are under threat

       It's no surprise they would have feelers across the border. The real clear evidence is that the Mexican special forces once shot up a car in an ambush that they knew to contain two drug lords that turned out to be CIA agents.

       I don't believe for one second that Deep State can operate a fleet of over 8,000 MQ-9 Reaper drones armed with Hellfire missiles and flaunt all Intl treaties and Geneva Conventions and just extrajudicially assassinate anyone they "nominate" on "Terror Tuesday" in a dozen shithole Muzz countries, but when it comes to turning el Chapo into a crater, a monster who was easilly the #1 worst terrorist in the world, who was personally responsible for the murders of tens of thousands of people, and who made billions pouring poisons into the streets of US cities--all of that yet Deep State blinks in hestitation saying "we wouldn't want to make the Mexican Govt angry at us for droning Cartel bosses."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck that. I don't believe it. Deep State, DEA, CIA, alk of'em are LIARS and TRAITORS to the American people and worst of all they are just as guilty as el Chapo for lollygagging with their thumbs up their asses doing nothing just watching el Chapo and Narcos exceed ISIS in hyperviolence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only rational explanation for an insane situation is the Deep State at the highest levels lets el Chapo and other Cartels operate with impunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why, since whatever the reason is it can only be irrational. Perhaps CIA protected Sinaloa and Zetas because they work with them, for the insane idea that a Known-Known bad guy is easier to triage than an Unknown Unknown. Just like CIA did between 1944-1973 when they worked with the Mafia, and when J Edgar Hoover denied any Mafia even existed to coverup the FBI and CIA were mobbed up the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps some Egg McMuffin decided to assist the Cartels to keep Mexico destabalized and barely on the verge of total anarchy, all because CIA wants millions of Mexicans to flee to the US as part of CIA's long term plan to destabilize America by flooding us with illegal aliens to erode our Nationalist Identity down into a Globalized Gumbo Stew population with no loyalty to any ethnicity nor to any religion and who will vote for Hillary and cheerlead WallSt expanding Neocolonial plunder and who will happily live as serfs in urban favelas like Los Angeles.
