       Spread awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are spiritually inclined and believe, like I do that humanity in its collective makes up one field. That we share a collective unconscious, as even Jung suggested as well as many mystical teachings, that we are a collective in the psychic and noetic sense, not only in the ways that seem physically obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you subscribe to that theory, there is plenty you can do. If that is true, then all of your thougts, emotions, decisions, your psyche,  directly influences the psyche of all humans,  or even furher, all inhabitants of this planet, including plants and animals. Thus it is prudent to let go of fear, anger, hate, guilt, remorse, grief....any pain you may encounter within. Thus it is prudent to meditate, to journal, to introspect, to engage in contemplative practices, to make the right decisions in life, those that lead you to greater happiness and freedom. Thus it is prudent to be kind to both yourself and all of life you encounter. It is wise to take care of not only your mental and emotional , but your physcial health as well, as all of them are interrelated.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is prudent to wake the fuck up, becaue humanity is awakening with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means that as we wake up, humanity wakes up. As we move to peace and become.more conscious, the rest of humanity does as well. It means we all share a collective field, a collective psyche and every being has an influence on this field.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why fear and manipulation through media is so effective.  Not only because people are tricked and herded through the information on the physcial level, but becaue the fear and brainwashing comes into our collective psyche and influences us all. That is why one person can start a revolution, becaue they are just the trigger for the collective psyche's keg of gunpowder.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to evolve, but many forget that we primarily we need to evolve and become conscious within. That will spring into positive action but it will also
       <em>
        directly influence the collective human psyche
       </em>
       . And that is how we can be saved, how we can save the world when all seems lost.

       Call me Devil's Advocate; but which of Gustav's thoughts are you describing?
      </p>
      <p>
       A collective unconscious?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, what do you see as the root of it? (in the opinion of Carl Jung)?

       Note:

      <p>
       I reserve judgement on Jung's Red Book, as I haven't read it myself. It's only a stage of him, anyway (and a rather 'psychotic one' as seen by his contemporaries).

       Well said, thank you. Looks like I'm doing everything I can then, by focusing my energy on spreading love and light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really enjoyed the perspective Terrence McKenna puts on this, he says something to the effect of don't focus our energy on waking people up. It's frivolus. He says the only thing we can do is foucus on on own awakenings, and the rest will follow in time as we plunge deeper into our own awakend states.
      </p>

       Keep spreading that light friend, it's much appreciated.

       We may need to save our souls and get right with God, but we also can't simply say everything is playing out as expected and forget about the world. It's not determined for everything to go to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       End-times in my book simply means we are living at the end of an era and the current paradigm has to change before humanity is truly free and truly in touch with the Divine. But the end times don't have to mean WW3 or a major apocalypse.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can get right not only with the infinite feedom and love that is God, but with ourselves and each other, while we also need to carry that divinity into the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my view on it of course.

       Really ignorant thing to say. A family member who fought in vietnam died in the last 3 years with much of his arms and face still disfigured and pitted and scarred from being on combat operations in areas targeted with Agent Orange. It didnt just fuck with the enemy troops but the american, australian and other forces.  Those agent orange affected areas had huge amounts of people in them fighters and civilans... to say it was just used against plants is a real innacurate thing... perhaps thats what the person selling the chemical to the government said but its certainly not how it was used in practice. It might have been a defoliant by design but it did a lot more damage to humans than plants

        What is Zyklon B?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Zyklon B was a brand name for a product developed by a German company, a pesticide  intended to be used as a fumigant to treat commodities and structures. The active ingredient being hydrogen cyanide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zyklon B was, we are told, later misused by the Nazi Regime as an agent to murder countless people who had been locked in confined spaces where the agent was then released, killing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carbon monoxide, the product of engine exhaust, was reportedly used in for the same diabolical purpose: as an agent of execution/ murder in confined spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trapping victims in confined spaces was essential for the efficacy of these agents. In open spaces, they are ineffective for such purposes, as they disperse too rapidly, and hydrogen cyanide, being lighter than air, quickly rises into the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       For military purposes, or attacking civilian populations, Zyklon B is no more a "chemical weapon" than is simple engine exhaust.

       As an agent of execution, not as a weapon of war, deployed against military or civilian populations in a battlefield scenario, as Sarin, mustard gas, and chlorine have been used. This is how "chemical weapons" are defined in the present context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rope is used as a tool for execution, and to murder, including captured enemy combatants. But It is not a "weapon of war", per se.

       Zyklon B / hydrogen cyanide is virtually ineffective unless deployed in a tightly confined space against victims who are trapped within. It is not a weapon of war.

       For arguments sake let’s say it is oil or some other resources that they want. You mean to tell me THATS the only place on the planet that has them? Syria? In the middle of a civil war?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me I’m no Assad sympathizer but I really think he’s being set up here. Mattis said they haven’t seen any evidence yet it was Assad. It’s just odd to me while Trump has a wait and see approach many on the left are beating the war drums of “we have to do something!” A lot of things don’t add up and I hope Trump doesn’t do anything.

       Oh I emphatically agree that this is a setup. I've watched a lot of Assad interviews - I think he's doing the best job that anyone could under the sort of outside pressure he's getting. He's a very logical communicator (one of the reasons we'll never see him on US television except in horrible images like the one where he's waving but it looks like a Hitlerian salute).
      </p>
      <p>
       But I just have no idea what's at the end of this agenda to overthrow Syria and Iran. I guess just securing US oil for the longterm or maybe there's something else. It all feels very desperate from the West - like "if we don't do this, our entire establishment will collapse". Maybe it will.

       My opinion is that The US deep state wants the region destabilized so ISIS can grow further. Assad is the only thing stopping them in this region. And the CIA funded ISIS and supported them with weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad is providing the same service that Saddam Hussein did: stabilizing his particular region and knocking down terrorists
      </p>
      <p>
       As bad as Hussein was, he hated terrorists just as much and his death, on top of the oil argument, served the Elite in destabilizing the Iraq/Iran region and allowing ISIS to form. Ive always assumed ISIS and Islamic Extremism was fostered by the Elite as a weapon to spread and ruin western civilization

       The main reason (I suspect) people want this regime change to happen is that if Assad is overthrown and a West friendly leader takes control, then a pipeline from S.A. through the Middle East and Turkey could supply Europe with oil and natural gas. This would allow Europe to not be so energy reliant on Russia as they currently have the only physical pipeline to Europe.

       Trump supporters! Your use of “the left” was a dead giveaway. If not, idk how you could possibly think Trump adopted a “wait and see” approach. Or should I link the tweet promising swift action against Assad and him definitively saying Assad gassed the civilians? You are either woefully ignorant or just attributing the stance you want Trump to have to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a hawk, his cabinet is full of hawk, he fellates the Military Industrial Complex, and I find it appalling that people like you give him a pass and instead act like the left is suddenly the pro war side, which is demonstrably untrue, or do I need to link votes for other military actions taken in the Middle East?

       What name calling? I'll admit asking if you were dropped on your head was childish and immature, but you do realize that you started with the insults and then using my response chiding you for using insults to attempt to undermine my argument by saying all I have is insults was pretty silly, no?

       Idk that I would call them trolls, but misguided or misinformed for sure. It really is common knowledge, but they are fighting it tooth and nail. Absolutely bizarre tbh, seeing Republican supporters fighting to make the left be hawkish, after spending decades trying to convince people that they were pussies.

       Right, Obama screwed up royally on the Middle East, on surveillance, on the TPP, and on any other issues, which is why I criticized him on those things, but he was still the less hawkish option in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. Idk who I could have possibly voted for that would have not done what Obama did in the Middle East, as others have pointed out, the President has for decades been an interventionist hawk, regardless of party, however that is NOT representative of your the average person you might consider a Liberal or Conservative (or someone who leans more left than right on issues of international conflict).

       My fine friend, I know full well that the President is unilaterally a hawk (or pushed to hawkish actions) but I was not comparing Presidents, but rather how the average Liberal vs Conservative views intervention.

      <p>
       Dems OVERWHELMINGLY were opposed to the Iraq war, while Repubs OVERWHELMINGLY supported it, I'm not talking about politicians, which GENERALLY lean towards the MID regardless of Party (although demonstrably less so for Dems).

       If you think that, you genuinely don't know your history, or you are conflating "Democrats" as being purely representative of the "left" which isn't the case. Not to mention that the Neocon Dems in charge are HARDLY representative of Liberal or "left" values in and way shape or form (there is a VERY big divide between the average Liberal and a Democratic Senator/Congressman), but regardless, let's look at the Iraq war.

       I realize that the new generation of Trump supporter Republicans likely do not want to think of themselves as having joining and supporting the hawk party, but that is simply the reality of the Republican party. Also, the idea that Trump is somehow anti-war is so ridiculously absurd that is makes my head spin that people on REDDIT CONSPIRACY bought that baloney.

       I think trumpeters are under the false impression that they've "bucked back" on the system or that trump is some grenade that's changing things up. They think he's new... So history doesn't matter to them because Trump is a new era. A new kind of president to battle the trans feminazi sjw kneeling-during-the-anthem socialist scurge that has infected our once great country. So make America great again, like how it was in the 50s before the Civil rights movement.

       So your argument is some on the right wing don't want intervention, therefore they are "democrat's wars" compared to my argument, which is the actual statistics showing that most Democrats don't want intervention while most Republicans do. Sounds about right.

       Your comment history shows this to be untrue, at least on a superficial level, since all you do is attack trump/GOP while defending and apologizing for democrats.

       I'm actually old enough to remember the 90s Republican health plans when they were happening, and they are basically the ACA. I'm honestly disgusted by comments from some of my friends (also Republicans) when they talk about the ACA, when these same people were broadly in support of the Republican proposals then (and when asked about details of the policy are broadly in support of it). I think if you go back to around the time I created this account you'll see that I went from lukewarm Clinton support, to what is basically full on support as a strange non-fact based narrative has evolved around them (particularly in far left and far right wing circles) where they are singularly evil, terrible, powerful people that just isn't supported by logic. I voted HW in 92 and Dole in 96. Also one of the reasons I have left the Republican party is the insistence of ideology over pragmatism (the reverse used to be true).

       I'm old enough to remember the bipartisan smear against third parties which happened in the 90s. I guess we can thank your boy Trump for helping torpedo the Reform party.

       I had a pre existing condition which I got in 2009. It was so bad my insurance company (bcbs) dropped me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to pay for ongoing treatment every week, which ended up costing me 1000+ a month, out of pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was very much in favor of the ACA on paper, since I thought it would help me. Here's what happened: the I seance companies simply created special "pre existing condition plans" (at a special marked up rate) that sucked ass and covered nothing. Not a single aspect of my physical therapy or follow up surgery maintenance was covered. I'm in So cal, fyi.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I was given the boon of having to pay a special, extra high premium for the
       <em>
        privilege
       </em>
       of getting my condition "covered"... when, in reality, the plans didnt even cover my out of pocket costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, I was required to pay a premium I wasn't paying before (Or pay a "tax"), on top of continuing to pay all my medical costs out of pocket...
      </p>
      <p>
       Really benefited people with pre existing conditions, huh? I know several people in the same or similar boats. I actually don't personally know a single person who benefited from the ACA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, thanks for that. Thanks for the corporate gift at my detriment. I'm still paying PT out of pocket, btw, 8 years later.

       Not going to respond, but just don't want you to think it's for any reason other than you're complete misrepresentation of what a Pre-existing condition plan is in the very first part of the comment (which made it clear that your story was fake which is super ironic lol), not even going to get into the rest of the inaccuracies here.

       Yes. The premiums I paid for PCIP plans was absurd, and they did nothing for me, so it was money I wasted thinking I'd get some help with my PT and my surgeries. In 2014 I was given a 16-month grace period in which i couldn't get coverage for my condition, but after which i would be covered. Until I wasn't. Since I can work with my injury, it's non-essential, and isn't covered. I've made 3 appeals with hospitals and surgeons to this company with no avail.

      <p>
       Now, please, tell me how much h better off I am for having forked over all this money to absolutely no benefit?

But agian your story isn't true, because that previous plan you had would have been required by law to cover your condition at the end of the PCIP coverage at no rate differential from any other plan you could get.

       Why are you saying I didn't need it? Just because I was able to afford it? This is the same logic currently being used by the insurance companies right now- you worked for this many years with your fucked up condition, therefore therapy and surgeries aren't essential.

       You literally couldn't even keep your story straight in between 2 of your own comments. Honestly LARPing as someone with a preexisting condition is disgusting. On the off chance that you are just super confused about the order of events and how insurance actually works, I'm very sorry you've had a hard time of it, but if this is the case you very clearly need to go find an insurance agent you trust and get them to explain how this actually works.

       Honestly if you think any of these comments are Lefty comments, then you have been blinded by partisanship. I'm happy to go through these 1 by 1 with you (rather than copy your whole list I'll just use numbers):
      </p>
      <p>
       1- The DNC emails are overblown, go ahead and link the one you think is most damning
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Yep I guess I'm the crazy one for not thinking Obama saying that the constitution is just a piece of paper that requires people to put it into action makes him a fascist dictator and makes me a lefty
      </p>
      <p>
       3- Asking how is the ACA hurting Americans makes me a lefty?
      </p>
      <p>
       4- It's literally just a link to her campaign funding, I guess facts make you a lefty?
      </p>
      <p>
       5- Reciting the top 3 politics stories and the top 3 The-D stories to show that while both are bad 1 is categorically more bad makes me a lefty?
      </p>
      <p>
       6- Again a link to literal vote totals makes me a lefty?
      </p>
      <p>
       7- Being ashamed of Trump makes me a lefty? Also saying I was ashamed of Clinton while he was in office makes me pro-Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       8- Links to information around the ACA and academic studies about its effects make me a lefty?
      </p>
      <p>
       9- Saying that the right pulled its support from a bill (that the right had pulled its support from) makes me a lefty?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean really? Jesus man, half of these are literally just links to hard data. People like you are a lot of the reason I left the Republican party.

       You skipped the first one.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - the emails revealed that the DMV conspired to hurt the Sanders campaign. You hate Sanders and love clinton, though, so I can imagine why youd choose to pretend they didnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- it's Obama apologetics, plain and simple. You asked what makes you appear to be left. I don't really know who would so passionately (and repeatedly) defend democrats without identifying as left.

      <p>
       You're on here repeatedly promoting the ACA, Obama's great legacy. This is just one instance in a pattern of defending Democrats, which appears to be your MO

      <p>
       I mean, do you deny that this is apologetics for Clintons campaign financing? The only way you win this one is if I'm a Trump supporter, and I'm quite the opposite. As the numbers you linked show; the money flowed into Clintons camp at a far greater rate than into Trumps. Clearly this is just pro-clinton/Democrat narrative pushing on your part; no different than a trumper pushing pro-trump narratives. This is especially clear when you consider that you ignored my link earlier showing that Clinton has
       <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/top.php?display=M">
        contributed more to the revolving door
       </a>
       than any other congressman or candidate.

       I'd say that defending either one of those hyperpartisan cesspools in favor of the other males you pretty clearly a partisan. They are both nothing but botnet-driven hives of propoganda.

      <p>
       You didn't say that, though. You used the word shameful in reference to "an episode", not Clinton or his actions. You then described his handling of said shameful episode with "dignity and respect for the office"... pretty glowing terms for someone you apparently
       <em>
        arent
       </em>
       defending.
      </p>
      <p>
       8- you were in an anti-trump sub promoting the ACA... and that makes you, what, right? Come on, man. Again, people can evaluate this stuff for themselves and come to their own conclusions, but it seems obvious to me that you are very much in favor of left wing politicians and their legacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       9- no, the defense of democrats does. "Is that the D's fault, too?"

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       And yet you ignored the hard data I linked earlier on Clinton. So, you knowingly choose to acknowledge
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       data which supports democrats, while ignoring data which may paint them in a bad light. Your partisan tendencies look pretty clear.

       I vote third party. In my life, I've never once registered or voted republican, and have voted Democrat twice. Most of my top comments are anti-trump/GOP.

       I agree that left and right are used improperly, but I mean how do you differentiate between people who are pro vs anti abortion, pro vs anti-tax cuts, pro vs anti gay marriage or any other issue. I mean saying left and right is a false dichotomy implies there is a consensus, which there isn't.

       Outside of perhaps the military and the higher echelons of governance, it's not I think that they are all the same, but rather that people are so different and being pigeon holed into A or B rather than having a slew of choices to make a meaningful one.

       They were just examples, pro vs anti single payer health care, pro vs anti isolationist, pro vs anti free trade, I mean you have to have some tool to quantify people, otherwise it just becomes impossible to discuss in any sort of macro way.

       are you trying to claim that "isolationism" (pretty much a Bernays-ian propaganda term used by the Woodrow Wilson admin to push America into WW1, btw) or anti-free trade positions are currently represented by either party in the US?

       So, one guy on Fox News doesn't support intervention and have now concluded that the left is the pro-war side.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a quote from Trump?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"
       </p>

       Can't you smell the non-intervention oozing from that tweet?

       I’ve never understood why the US has such an infatuation with Israel. The narrative of “they are the only democratic government in the Middle East” has gotten old. I use to think it was related to Biblical prophecy where those who oppose Israel would be destroyed. But that doesn’t really work anymore either. Unless it’s still the sympathy for what the Jews suffered in WWII. Idk.

       There is a difference in being nuked where you’re almost instantly vaporized as opposed to sarin or chlorine gas. I work around gaseous chlorine and let me tell you even if you are exposed to a tiny amount of it in a gas form it’s goddamn excruciating. So if I had to choose then I say nuke me all day.

       So...give Syria nukes? No, i'm just saying chemical weapons will swiftly find your enemies (albeit indiscriminately). Extermination has a crippling affect where conventional warfare may be lacking when fighting guerrilla insurgents. It's fast and effective. Assuming there are no real consequences as we have witnessed time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does extermination bring peace? We know it pushed nearly 6-10 million refugees in to NATO countries. Does it become our responsibility to get involved then?

       All is as it should be. We must have these conflicts to teach us peace. We must see through the missteps and obvious hints and hold onto to the seat of the rollercoaster. It’s
       <em>
        just a ride
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the ride is the magic of everything, but it’s not under any threat from these Washington posers.
       <em>
        Everything is/will be okay.
       </em>
       The illusion of time hides this fact from us. Heroes will rise! They must! They have!
      </p>
      <p>
       When a million Persian soldiers invaded Greece a force a a few hundred elite Spartan soldiers held them off for two days, long enough for the rest of Greece to prepare a successful defense. The time is soon coming again when heroes will rise among us from the commoners. Revolutions, catastrophes, and wars might multiply but so long as one brilliant human scientist survives, the species can survive, and beyond that, without humanity the rest of the universe would continue on to new adventures.

       The Cabal has capitalized on your fear of
       <em>
        loss

       But you have
       <em>
        nothing to lose

       There were nowhere near a million Persians. Sparta had Assyrian allies. Mark Millar writes a good story but it’s hardly historically accurate. I see the point you’re trying to make but especially in terms of modern warfare open confrontation is a foolish way to try to fight an asymmetrical conflict.

       Well,  your question makes it absolutely clear that you haven't bothered to look into it AT ALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should I bother explaining something to you when you're  simply too lazy to care?  If you don't bother to educate yourself on a issue, and just want to spout MSM propaganda,  nothing I explain for you will matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because it is contradictory information,  and you've already demonstrated that you actively ignore anything which compromises your false reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it doesn't fit with your preferred beliefs,  you ignore it as if it doesn't exist. Most people do; you aren't unique in that respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't point a finger at me,  however,  and blame me for your insistence on not understanding. That is entirely your fault,  and,  your conscious decision if you care to only consider one perspective.

       Yeah but the question is have you been paying attention? The only justifiable way for the us to overtly  go into a country uninvited is to go after chemical weapons or terrorists, Assad and Putin are also aware of this fact, also they are not retarded, they reached the top of their respective countries dominance hierarchy, Putin by his own doing, Assad inherited the position from his father, if you turn on any western media channel all you see is what kind of monsters they are and how they probably kill their own people personally.. do you remember the last 2 "chemical attacks" ? And what preceded them ? Obama had his line in the sand and the first attack was like a day later, then the 2013 attack happend, and according to
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-1500-killed-in-syrian-chemical-weapons-attack-us-says/2013/08/30/b2864662-1196-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html?utm_term=.16e3bc6dfcd1">
        this Washington post article

       the us government has "overwhelming evidence" on Assad being responsible
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/08/syria-chemical-weapons-not-assad-bild">
        yet 5 years later we are still waiting to see any of that
       </a>
       , and not a week after Trump declares he wants to get out of Syria the exact same thing happens as in 2013...

       Those are things worth considering, but they don't really prove that it's 'fake'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend watching the documentary
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM">
        Hypernormalisation
       </a>
       , as it provides a ton of explanations behind Assad's actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes (arguably correctly) that all of the problems in the middle east stem from the US preventing his father from creating a unified Arab nation in the 70's, and he hates the US for it. These things could just as well keep happening right when we 'draw a line' or 'declare we want to get out', because Assad just DGAF and is showing he really doesn't care what the US says. He knows we won't actually do anything because we don't want a MAD war with Russia, and he just doesn't care and isn't afraid to show it.

       I cannot follow this reasoning, you somehow believe Assad is happy us forces are in his country funding the people they claim to be fighting ? Did I watch a different version of hypernormalisation or is that documentary explaining how the us has wanted Assad gone since the 80's and has been pushing for regime change ever since but failed ridiculously? I mean blaming Assad's father for shit they know Gadhafi did? What kind of "proof" would satisfy you ?

       Nope - they've kept it classified. And that is a perfect reason to be skeptical.

       Again, if we can't prove or disprove something, we shouldn't just 'pick a side' - we get vocal about it not making sense until one of the 'sides' show their evidence.

       That theory makes more sense than a false flag. The US has no substantive goals in Syria now that ISIS is defeated. There’s no benefit to regime change given the protection levied over Assad by Russia. Remember that Saddam had no one protecting him. That’s why he was vulnerable. Assad is not vulnerable. And there’s also the very real possibility that it was a mid level commander that unilaterally decided to use the chemical weapons. That’s far more likely and requires less far flung assumptions than a false flag. Sometimes dictators and their underlings do crazy shit. Is that so hard to believe?
      </p>
      <p>
       More than that, is Russia credible at all? They lied about invading Ukraine. They lied about the downing of the Malaysian airliner. Putin himself came to power in what was almost certainly a false flag event. Idk how
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       can discredit the US narrative without also discrediting the Russian narrative. Furthermore, did everyone forget that France is corroborating the narrative that the Assad regime committed the attack? Did everyone forget that France was staunchly opposed to the war in Iraq? Is French credibility diminished just because they agree with the US? Wtf even is this timeline?

       Have you read any of the Wikileaks regarding France, ghadaffi, the league of Arab nations and the golden dinar? Fuck France's credibility, and you wanna go down this road of who lied the most ? You realise what sub you are in right ? The us lied to get in Vietnam then lied to stay longer, they lied about iraq, dont get me wrong here I am not defending Assad or Saddam, but I also remember who helped put those guys in power in the first place

       Nice but Gaddafi and Assad are different people in different circumstances. You can’t extrapolate one lie into more lies. And you cannot discredit one side for lying in the past without also discrediting the other side if they too are just as much a liar. Why would the West want to get bogged down in another war, especially one where they have essentially no interests worth the cost? Come on. Think with your head.

       All right. But just saying "why would Assad gas his own people, he's winning right now and it only gives the West a Casus Belli" isn't looking at it from all sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I haven't seen the evidence so I won't make my judgement about what happened but there is a reason why Assad would do it. He feels that he's invincible or at least heavily protected by Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       He allegedly used it in 2013, US did nothing. Then last year the retaliation was one bombed Airfield that as far as I know was back up and running shortly after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assad knows that no one wants WW3, so maybe he doesn't fear the response from the West?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why he used it specifically? There are still pockets of rebels which don't seem to be giving up. They hide in the general population and a gas attack spreads much more fear and defeatism in the ranks of the rebels and sympathisers than conventional weaponry would.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is looking at it from both sides in my opinion.

       You said I am self-censoring, okay. If that's true help me with some sources of yourself. I know pretty well not to trust the US government when they are trying to gear up for war. Irak was enough of an example for that.

       I said we should be skeptical. We don't know if it's true or not. We can vocally demand evidence, but we can't dismiss that it's all phony because... of a gut feeling?

       circle of friends is definitely a perspective problem. none of my friends pay attention to any news/headlines and never have any idea that anything is happening. sometimes it makes me feel like

       is willfully uninformed.

       IME it's the old folk who know a lil better than the young folks. Not always the case, but many college age folks buy into it. I went to a state school where the truth came from the professors (some), in "analysis of the media" "analysis of poverty" "the nuclear dilemma" classes. I understand that is not usually the case on campuses.

       It seems like the MSM is pulling slightly back from the war drum banging as of this morning. Probably because a majority of Americans tempature for a Syrian war is low right now. Which will only intice America (or their allies) to perform a much worse disturbing false flag to sway the populace to further the narrative that, atrocities like "this" will not be tolerated. It will be interesting and incredibly frustrating to see how it plays out.

       Do you even hear what you're saying? So basically the US sprayed as you would describe a 'herbicide' over millions of hectares of a foreign country to destroy plant life.. And for what reason would they do that? "Oh whoops didnt know that unknown chemical would do that kind of damage.. Sorry lads we'll be more careful next time when we try and poison the environment of a foreign country". If thats your argument then it makes the US look like the most retarded bunch of inbred imbeciles on the planet! Of course they fucking knew what it would do.

       The understanding was that the herbicide's effect would be temporary. I believe it's still marketed (as Roundup etc) with this misleading message. It wasn't sprayed with the intent of denuding the entire countryside of Vietnam of plant life. The
       <em>
        intent
       </em>
       was to denude known or potential hiding places of Viet Cong. The idea was flawed. They should have known the effects were going to be what they were. There were voices speaking against it at the time. But - it's the military-industrial complex. No more needs to be said.

       Corporate-capitalist (communist too) advertising-media complex for sure has pulled the wool over on consumers worldwide.

       If you knew your country was going to get sprayed with millions of gallons of air freshener you wouldn't be happy about it because of the possible health implications let alone something that is made to destroy any kind of life.. They knew it could do damage but they did it anyway.

       I was about draft age when this was going on and was active in protests. Spoken to a number of vets who had AO literally raining down on them. It didn't only affect Vietnamese. I've also been keeping informed about environmental events - former Sierra Clubber. I'm confidant in my facts.

       How does the Trump admin have anything to do with Agent Orange?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the third time we’ve been on the verge of conflict. The two previous times (previous [false flag carried out by the deep state] Syria chemical weapons attack and North Korea) ended in not only no conflict but possible denuclearization of North Korea the previous Syria chemical attack resulted in Trump bombing a base that supposedly had their chemical weapons but IMO this video explains that situation perfectly
       <a href="https://youtu.be/4VCgU1v0c3I">
        https://youtu.be/4VCgU1v0c3I
       </a>
       TL:DW- Trump bombed an empty base in Syria (with Assad’s permission) to destroy the Deep States narrative that Trump is in cahoots with Putin.

       Also, by your logic, every citizen is complicit in the crimes of their government.  If that’s the case, the world needs more tax protesters who refuse to be complicit in those crimes.

       Kind of! I see myself as cog in a big ass machine someone else is controlling. I can't help but feel a bit responsible. A start could be to  be presented with a summary of where all of our tax dollars are going whenever we get a paystub.

       That’s true. But in reality you and the 1% are seen as equals when abroad . 
Whether you’re a U.S., Italian Brazilian or from wherever citizen you will be seen as basically an ambassador of that country even if you are a janitor.

       I’m a US. Citizen but wasn’t born here and even have an accent, but when I travel back to my home country and speak with the locals (non tourist areas) I usually get responses such as “YOU guys over there” Insert subject. 
Versus “the guys over there”

       To a point yes, but if you are inciting that I should take more action than to just vote then you are wrong. I am by no means obligated to start a civil war in my country because of the people I didn’t vote for has a shitty foreign policy.
What we all peasants need to remember is that if you are a Russian peasant or an American peasant, we all we be the first casualties in any war, we are the ones brainwashed into think your side is worse than our side and until WE ALL put down our guns and go back home because we don’t want to kill each other then this will continue like it has through our history...

       They're not sitting on the bench. Far from it. Check any subreddit and see the average opinion of Americans there. A large number of them are pro-war just like the leaders that THEY voted in. They deserve all the criticism they're getting.

       Yes I am a true American, but in my very humble opinion the way we work is far better than how other countries work...even with all the dirt, blood, life, drugs, wars, and oppression that is involved in democracy...there is not one thing at this moment that could replace it and would not let everything turn to shit...Dictatorships, communism, religions all have failed at this notion. I will never tell anyone else that my country has not fucked up but I will say that for us to go to war over it is pathetic and those that want it just haven’t woken up yet...this change we all want will come but it’s very slow.
I also hear where you are coming from, and I do not agree at all with our foreign policy, but civilization has always been a mess...honestly we the rate we are going if we don’t put down our pitch forks and just simply say I would rather go get high that to go war, and everyone did that and I mean everyone we could change the system...it’s like I say about out shitty internet and phone services where I live...if everyone just did not give into the ridiculous prices they would change but unfortunately we all have been raised to serve the master...all’s I’m saying is we are all on planet earth which is a rocket ship hurling through fucking space and none of this shit matters.

       I don't know why you're getting downvoted. The truth hurts, I guess.

       Americans should indeed know that people are most probably going to judge them for their government's actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a democratic nation after all and you're the ones who bring your bloodthirsty leaders into power. You do have a responsibility to the world since American leaders are totally incapable of minding their own business and keep fucking up the rest of the world. So, yes you shoulder some of that responsibility. Sorry but you can't keep burying your head in the sand.

       Yeah, I've sadly noticed that many can't take any critcism.

       A person doesn't even have to travel all that much to know how much damage the US administration is doing to the world. They can learn all that from the comfort of their homes. So it's either laziness, arrogance or ignorance. Probably a mixture of all of the above. Honestly most of the time, it feels like some Americans are just drunk with power and simply don't give a shit about other countries.

       EVERYONE that lives under democracy is responsible for their government. that's LITERALLY the definition of democracy. If more people in America took their responsibility to give a flying fuck about their government seriously, then the 2016 election wouldn't have been decided by the white nationalists and conspiracy nuts who were manipulated by the fake news campaigns coming out of macedonia and russia.

       I frequent all those subreddits and really haven't seen that happening? I do see a lot of Russia blaming, and a lot of comments unrelated to America going to war at all.. maybe you can link me a good example?

       For example top story on worldnews right now is about syria, and I don't see a single comment calling for war....

       They're defending a possible war. That's not pro-war to you? I do agree that my comment was provocative but it was because it was in response to another person who was saying that not attacking would only benefit Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Right, so ask, who does America not attacking benefit?
Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full disclosure, I do support attacking Assad, because, tbh, he has killed about 500,000 people and I would love to see him pay for his atrocities, even chemical weapons aside. I'd say I feel weird agreeing with Trump on this, but I have a feeling he's going to wimp out. He's already wavering. "

       "Who the fuck isn't sure who used the chemical weapons? The only people with chemical weapons used them. Fucking Assad. If a country uses weapons of mass destruction international law is explicitly clear. We bomb the shit out of them. The idea behind the bombing would be to deter the future use of chemical weapons. If they continue to use them after maybe it is time to over through the Assad regime, maybe it is time to look at Russian aggression as escalating, and maybe it is in the national security interest of all NATO nations to kick the shit out of Russia and destroy the mob that runs it. Putin's goal is the reestablishment of the USSR (maybe a little less red this time), we need to be willing to prevent that by any means."

       You must recall that the system is designed by them to keep them in power. If you do not like the Republicans, you get the Democrats, and visa-versa. There is no possibility of 3rd party winning. Even when the people choose the Democrats, if the Republicans want in, they will just cheat their way in.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no we do not allow to remain in power. They suppress us.

       What's sad is that I get personally attacked for taking an anti-war stance while also stating that the chemical attack made no strategic sense. That's typical neoliberal and neocon Reddit though: blindly follow the corporate controlled media without being able to think for yourself. God willing there isn't a serious escalation.

       I agree. And Iraq is a great example. This fundamentally is the ethical dilemma. What is the US role in international affairs? Should the US be responsible for mistakes our predecessors created? When does the burden of responsibility stop? History doesn't start on a blank page, only your memory of it does.

       Liveleak and search for prison and jail videos. In almost all of them excessive force is used. Often with chemical riot control weapons are used on one person. I'm glad there are some worker taking a risk to wear a camera or leak videos. It's beyond shameful.

       As for who used the gas in Syria let's look at the situation using the rare and oft unused gift of Common Sense:
      </p>
      <p>
       When all parties are known liars look at who has the most to gain from their lie. That leaves Assad out and Russia by proxy already has Syria in their pocket, both of them could only lose by starting a war. The CIA, McCain's Terrorists and the UN would only win. It don't take a genius to figure this stuff out.

       Trump wants to get into a fight with Russia so it makes him look innocent of collusion or w.e his crimes are. What's the best way to get people off your back? Start a conflict. Honestly I think he'd be ok with starting a nuclear Holocaust if it saves his own skin.

       Israel, a foreign country, is about to manipulate the US government into another Middle Eastern war, but the teevee tells us that Russian boogeymen are pulling the strings. It is almost as if Israel manipulates the US MSM, too.

       So, one guy on Fox News doesn't support intervention and have now concluded that the left is the pro-war side.

      <p>
       How about a quote from Trump?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"

       That’s true. But in reality you and the 1% are seen as equals when abroad . 
Whether you’re a U.S., Italian Brazilian or from wherever citizen you will be seen as basically an ambassador of that country even if you are a janitor.

       So your argument is some on the right wing don't want intervention, therefore they are "democrat's wars" compared to my argument, which is the actual statistics showing that most Democrats don't want intervention while most Republicans do. Sounds about right.

       I'm actually old enough to remember the 90s Republican health plans when they were happening, and they are basically the ACA. I'm honestly disgusted by comments from some of my friends (also Republicans) when they talk about the ACA, when these same people were broadly in support of the Republican proposals then (and when asked about details of the policy are broadly in support of it). I think if you go back to around the time I created this account you'll see that I went from lukewarm Clinton support, to what is basically full on support as a strange non-fact based narrative has evolved around them (particularly in far left and far right wing circles) where they are singularly evil, terrible, powerful people that just isn't supported by logic. I voted HW in 92 and Dole in 96. Also one of the reasons I have left the Republican party is the insistence of ideology over pragmatism (the reverse used to be true).

       That theory makes more sense than a false flag. The US has no substantive goals in Syria now that ISIS is defeated. There’s no benefit to regime change given the protection levied over Assad by Russia. Remember that Saddam had no one protecting him. That’s why he was vulnerable. Assad is not vulnerable. And there’s also the very real possibility that it was a mid level commander that unilaterally decided to use the chemical weapons. That’s far more likely and requires less far flung assumptions than a false flag. Sometimes dictators and their underlings do crazy shit. Is that so hard to believe?

       More than that, is Russia credible at all? They lied about invading Ukraine. They lied about the downing of the Malaysian airliner. Putin himself came to power in what was almost certainly a false flag event. Idk how
       <em>

       can discredit the US narrative without also discrediting the Russian narrative. Furthermore, did everyone forget that France is corroborating the narrative that the Assad regime committed the attack? Did everyone forget that France was staunchly opposed to the war in Iraq? Is French credibility diminished just because they agree with the US? Wtf even is this timeline?

       You skipped the first one.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - the emails revealed that the DMV conspired to hurt the Sanders campaign. You hate Sanders and love clinton, though, so I can imagine why youd choose to pretend they didnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- it's Obama apologetics, plain and simple. You asked what makes you appear to be left. I don't really know who would so passionately (and repeatedly) defend democrats without identifying as left.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Asking how is the ACA hurting Americans makes me a lefty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're on here repeatedly promoting the ACA, Obama's great legacy. This is just one instance in a pattern of defending Democrats, which appears to be your MO
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        4- It's literally just a link to her campaign funding, I guess facts make you a lefty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I mean, do you deny that this is apologetics for Clintons campaign financing? The only way you win this one is if I'm a Trump supporter, and I'm quite the opposite. As the numbers you linked show; the money flowed into Clintons camp at a far greater rate than into Trumps. Clearly this is just pro-clinton/Democrat narrative pushing on your part; no different than a trumper pushing pro-trump narratives. This is especially clear when you consider that you ignored my link earlier showing that Clinton has
       <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/top.php?display=M">
        contributed more to the revolving door
       </a>
       than any other congressman or candidate.

      <blockquote>

        5- Reciting the top 3 politics stories and the top 3 The-D stories to show that while both are bad 1 is categorically more bad makes me a lefty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'd say that defending either one of those hyperpartisan cesspools in favor of the other males you pretty clearly a partisan. They are both nothing but botnet-driven hives of propoganda.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also saying I was ashamed of Clinton while he was in office
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You didn't say that, though. You used the word shameful in reference to "an episode", not Clinton or his actions. You then described his handling of said shameful episode with "dignity and respect for the office"... pretty glowing terms for someone you apparently
       <em>
        arent
       </em>
       defending.
      </p>
      <p>
       8- you were in an anti-trump sub promoting the ACA... and that makes you, what, right? Come on, man. Again, people can evaluate this stuff for themselves and come to their own conclusions, but it seems obvious to me that you are very much in favor of left wing politicians and their legacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       9- no, the defense of democrats does. "Is that the D's fault, too?"
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jesus man, half of these are literally just links to hard data.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And yet you ignored the hard data I linked earlier on Clinton. So, you knowingly choose to acknowledge
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       data which supports democrats, while ignoring data which may paint them in a bad light. Your partisan tendencies look pretty clear.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        People like you are a lot of the reason I left the Republican party
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I vote third party. In my life, I've never once registered or voted republican, and have voted Democrat twice. Most of my top comments are anti-trump/GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im finding it increasingly impossible to believe anything you say.

       There is a difference in being nuked where you’re almost instantly vaporized as opposed to sarin or chlorine gas. I work around gaseous chlorine and let me tell you even if you are exposed to a tiny amount of it in a gas form it’s goddamn excruciating. So if I had to choose then I say nuke me all day.
