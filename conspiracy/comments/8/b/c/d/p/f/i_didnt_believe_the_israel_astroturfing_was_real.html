        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will admit it now, I am a supporter of Israel. Call me a Nazi, or whatever you want, that is fine. I am also a supporter of Palestine. I feel that both nations should either coexist, or become one binational state. One state or two, it does not matter. These two peoples need peace. Because I am a supporter of Israel and democracy, I believe in strongly criticizing, inhumane, unjust, and otherwise evil actions, especially when it comes to a country I feel has the responsibility of upholding an adequate civil standard, as any functioning society should.</p>

<p>It was when I started voicing this very opinion over recent events that I found out that to some people, when it comes to Israel, it&#39;s unwavering support or anti-Semite. I find this particularly hilarious because I am a half Israeli Jew. Any critical opinion is met with downvotes and hatred. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not just crazy if you think this is happening to you, it happens even to Israeli supporters who don&#39;t unequivocally tow the line. I hope one day Israel and Palestine are at peace, because I want both to prosper, but sometimes it feels like the hatred is too deep. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Zionist Jews in Israel and the Occupied Territories are free, are protected by the military and the police.  The Palestinians are not free and are not protected by any military and are subjugated by the military.  This situation has been deliberately conceived and carried out by the Zionist Jews who run Israel and who enforce the military occupation.  If the Zionist Jews wanted peace with the Palestinians, if they were willing to give Palestinians freedom and equality and protection under the law then there would be peace.  The Zionist Jews refuse to do this, so there is no peace.  It&#39;s entirely in the hands of the Zionist Jews who run the jail and make the laws.  It is they who must allow freedom, equality and safety for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl">Theodor Herzl</a>, original champion of Zionism:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Altneuland, Herzl outlined his vision for a new Jewish state in the Land of Israel. He summed up his vision of an open society:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is founded on the ideas which are a common product of all civilized nations ... It would be immoral if we would exclude anyone, whatever his origin, his descent, or his religion, from participating in our achievements. For we stand on the shoulders of other civilized peoples ... What we own we owe to the preparatory work of other peoples. Therefore, we have to repay our debt. There is only one way to do it, the highest tolerance. Our motto must therefore be, now and ever: &#39;Man, you are my brother.&#39;&quot;[86]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>He wanted a safe homeland for Jews, but he wasn&#39;t worried if it was in Africa, or South America, or the Middle East.  And had a less colonial approach to gaining that land:  </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When we occupy the land, we shall bring immediate benefits to the state that receives us. We must expropriate gently the private property on the estates assigned to us. We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country. The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discretely and circumspectly ... It goes without saying that we shall respectfully tolerate persons of other faiths and protect their property, their honor, and their freedom with the harshest means of coercion. This is another area in which we shall set the entire world a wonderful example ... Should there be many such immovable owners in individual areas [who would not sell their property to us], we shall simply leave them there and develop our commerce in the direction of other areas which belong to us&quot;,[89]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
