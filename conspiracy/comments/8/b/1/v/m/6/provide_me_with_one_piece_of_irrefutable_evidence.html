<p>I don&#39;t deny the brutality of German, Russian, Ally, or any other concentration camp. Millions died from disease, starvation, extrajudicial executions etc. However, this is very, very, different to a deliberate policy ordering the use of gas chambers to exterminate a race of people. Which, I am still looking for evidence for. </p>

<p>Yes, but you and I both realize there is <em>nothing</em> you will consider &quot;irrefutable&quot; since your goal is not to understand, but rather to sow doubt that the holocaust happened. You&#39;re obviously asking this in bad faith.</p>

<p>You cannot possible ascribe a personality trait to an entire people, use it in an insulting way, and think you have the high ground. You don&#39;t.  So just don&#39;t go there. It&#39;s not a convicing argument and most just turn off at the sight of it and you lose what little attention eyes have for your thoughts. It&#39;s counter productive.</p>

<p>No such video exists since cameras at the time were exclusively human operated and there werent a whole lot of Nazis clamoring to get into the chambers to film and die alongside the rest of the doomed people in the chambers.</p>

<p>See here for more on this: <a href="http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-myth-of-homicidal-gas-chambers-only.html">http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-myth-of-homicidal-gas-chambers-only.html</a></p>

<p>Red Cross records show that about 280k people (jews and non-jews total) died in the German-run camps.  But overwhelmingly from disease. There was no mass murder.  They were work and internment camps.  Similar, by the way, to how the US Government interned many Americans of Japanese and German ancestry in concentration camps on U.S. soil during WW2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the cyanide testing proves that the alleged &quot;homicidal gas chambers&quot; were not used to kill people.  </p>

<p>Proof in this article, citing findings by Fred Leuchter and Germar Rudolf: <a href="http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-myth-of-homicidal-gas-chambers-only.html">http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-myth-of-homicidal-gas-chambers-only.html</a></p>

<p>In 1988 he traveled to Poland and conducted a physical and forensic examination of the alleged gas chambers at the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps.  He determined that the alleged gas chamber facilities, based upon their design and construction, &quot;were incapable of supporting the use of hydrogen cyanide gas for purposes of execution&quot;.  For instance, the facilities were not hermetically sealed and did not have proper ventilation systems. </p>

<p>He also took samples from the walls of the alleged gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau and chemically tested the material. If the facilities were used to execute people using gas, then residue from the gas would be present in the walls.  The tests determined that hydrogen cyanide was never used inside the facilities, confirming that the facilities were never used as gas chambers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao.  Nuremberg was a Kangaroo court.   It was a military tribunal. 
 Not a normal Western court of law, where defendants can actually defend themselves.  The defendants at Nuremberg could not refute the prosecution&#39;s allegations.  The allegations of the prosecution were taken as &quot;facts of common knowledge&quot;.</p>

<p>Proven here with quotes from the documents of the &quot; International Military Tribunal&quot; : <a href="http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-nuremberg-trials-admittedly-did-not.html">http://exposing-the-holocaust-hoax-archive.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-nuremberg-trials-admittedly-did-not.html</a></p>

<p>The beginning of Article 19 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal (IMT) states: “The Tribunal shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence …”  </p>

<p>The beginning of Article 21 says : “The Tribunal shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but shall take judicial notice thereof …”</p>

<p>At the IMT it was forbidden to dispute the content of documents such as USSR-008; one had to take judicial notice thereof.”</p>

<p>I never said you believed every blog. Just the ones that confirm your preconceived world views. Really? Millions of different opinions yet you keep falling back to the same poorly written, poorly sourced, blog that is obviously motivated by a desire to further a particular world view?

<p>I don&#39;t know because I wasn&#39;t there, but if I had to bet I would say it&#39;s more likely than not that Jews were killed. Now the numbers may or may not be correct but to think it&#39;s straight up didn&#39;t happen is unlikely in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you about that. The thing to remember when it comes to war is it&#39;s easier to kill a monster than a person. So I have no doubt number could have been exaggerated (possibly to millions) just to make it easier for the world to rally against the &quot;dirty Germans&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real conspiracy with what happened to the Jews during the holocaust was the amount of deaths that went into building and running space technology experiments, electro-magnetic testing, radiation, and nuclear science research.</p>

<p>Just think about what happened the first time humans discovered ballooning, didn’t realize certain aspects of travel in balloons would be very dangerous until people came back down passed out/dead from exposure to elements at high altitudes.</p>

<p>Science is a dirty business, and the pace of innovation was so steep in Germany before and during WW2 that many, many people ended up losing their lives (and eventually resulted in the loss of too much smart labor).</p>

<p>We want the space tech and weapons but don’t want to acknowledge that the US was behind giving shelter to the worst of the bunch.</p>

<p>So no, there weren’t 4 million gassed, but 4 million did die in terrible ways no human should ever have to be exposed to.</p>

<p>This is the real tragedy.</p>

<p>But yay for SpaceX!</p>
