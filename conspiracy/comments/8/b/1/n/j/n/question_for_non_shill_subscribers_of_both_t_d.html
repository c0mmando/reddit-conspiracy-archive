<p>Please scrub my post history so you can see this isn&#39;t a shareblue shill post.  I still consider myself a Trump supporter and If we held another election today I would still cast my vote for Trump over HRC.  This post isn&#39;t about Trump being better or worse than HRC.  </p>

<p>This post is about how longtime T_D members feel about or rationalize T_D suppressing information I&#39;m positive many original Trump supporters would have considered legit concerns back in November 2016.  </p>

For a group that claims to be about freedom of beliefs and &quot;anti-communist&quot; sure runs like Communist China in T_D. Like honestly during the election and stuff it was more a place to joke around and shitpost memes. Now it&#39;s just a bloody cult imo. Not to mention all the low-key racism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You think I believe a god damn thing my media presents? I do my own research and have my entire adult life. Trust no one.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok. I hope that there isn&#39;t a misunderstanding here due to language barrier. I was just sort of saying take what you learned with a grain of salt. Judging by your last comment it appears you agree, but are maybe taking what I said a bit personal. I didn&#39;t presume to know whether you watched main stream media in your country or not. That&#39;s why I said &quot;...your OWN media apparatus.&quot; That can be msm or any article you research on your own or anything you see and read on social media.  Almost all of it was contaminated to one degree or another given the amount of shilling going on during the election. Misinformation was everywhere. So I have to wonder how the sources you got your opinion from got their opinion. Remember, the media and the whole world thought that Hillary was a lock to win. Whoever you saw on TV rooting for either side were simply the loud minority. Trump won because of bad polling and because of hatred of Hillary, not because he has a particularly huge and rabid fan base. A lot of people that would have voted for Hillary were either being loyal to their party or voting they didn&#39;t like Trump. Bernie would have destroyed Trump. He didn&#39;t get a fair chance.</p>

<p>So when you wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;The whole last election made the majority of Americans appear like fucking morons to EVERYONE from outside.&quot;</p>

<p>If we are talking about how your opinion was formed by your own independent research than how could that comment possibly be true? </p>

<p>If your own independent sources gave you you the impression that the &quot;majority of Americans are fucking morons,&quot; then am I to assume that your own independent sources were simply saying the same shit that the msm for the entire rest of the world outside of America was saying and that everyone regardless of their country or political bent or msm bias or penchant for independent research all came away with the same negative opinion of us? Ok, fair enough, but what was the point of you doing all that independent research then?</p>

<p>The media coverage of our last election was atrocious, but I think you get what I&#39;m saying here. You seem a little defensive in your response to me while being quite insulting to our country based on some sort of media, msm or otherwise, while at the same time not really taking the time to register what I said. Yet you still want to jump down my throat when my words are much more precise and not insulting at all while your words are vague, sloppy and insulting to this entire country. The only saving grace you have left imo is that you said it &quot;appeared&quot; as though the majority of us were &quot;fucking morons.&quot; Again, fair enough. But  that &quot;appearance&quot; was given to you by some sort of &quot;media apparatus.&quot; I was just making sure you understood, maybe due to a language barrier or something, that that was indeed only an appearance and hoped you didn&#39;t actually believe it.
Just because people voted for one of the two big candidates doesn&#39;t necessarily make them a moron. Largly it means they are busy working long hours and struggling to make ends meet and just too damn preoccupied to do the kind of research you obviously had the freedom to do. We are stuck with our government and our two party system and most do the best they can while juggling the rest of their lives. At the end of the day either Trump or Hillary was gonna win. Most people might as well flip a fucking coin as to who they thought was lesser of two evils, that doesn&#39;t make them morons and it doesn&#39;t make them the same as the idiots that were all over the msm or social media acting like such fervent worshipers of either candidate. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear about your sources and how it is exactly that you came up with the same opinion that apparently the entire rest of the world came up with without trusting a bit of what msm had to say about the whole circus.</p>

I&#39;ve just watched my whole life each year the Elites whip the public up in the USA into more and more of a fury. Like do you think watching videos of people getting their head bashed open for wearing a red hat or &quot;voting for the wrong&quot; side makes America look like anything less than pure madness at this point from the outside ? I swear another 4 years and America will be in a full authoritarian police state where they&#39;re going to disappear people in the night USSR style. The America government is almost at 4th Reich levels. I cannot imagine what being sane in America is like in 2018.</p>

There are only 800 plus anti-trump subs on Reddit you can go slander the guy freely in, you have no &quot;human right&quot; to take over Trump&#39;s fan sub with anti-trump obsessed people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how there are like 30 anti-Trump subs that were created after Hillary lost?  All those people would be brigading T_D non stop, so T_D just bans the shit out of people.  It&#39;s self preservation. This is a pseudo anonymous website. You can&#39;t tell who&#39;s a concern troll and who isn&#39;t, and it&#39;s easy to create alts.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve seen what has happened to this sub since the election, right?  The voting behavior here is now identical to that of r/politics.  Anything that goes against the left wing narrative gets downvoted below the threshold.  The mods of T_D don&#39;t want that to happen there, and I don&#39;t blame them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Trump, and I post on T_D often.</p>

<p>However, just like any other sub, I don&#39;t agree with/endorse all of the content posted there. The idea that <strong>any</strong> sub is a single, homogenous entity with universally shared opinions and values is a gross oversimplification. </p>

<p>Eg: I&#39;m Canadian, believe the Qur&#39;an is the Word of God, and Muhammad is a Messenger of God. I don&#39;t own a gun, nor do I want to. My family is from the Middle East, my spouse is Latina. In short, I probably don&#39;t fit the profile of what some would assume constitutes the typical TD user.</p>

<p>Despite voicing most of those things in various discussions over time, I&#39;ve never been attacked or banned on TD, even when defending Islam or Muhammad from all sorts of accusations.</p>

<p>TD has lots of shitposting, lots of good conversation, and lots of utter shit worth downvoting. But the truth is: it&#39;s the only place on Reddit where I can chat about Trump without being harassed. </p>

<p>And TD was actually what piqued my interest in conspiracies in general, which brought me here. So there&#39;s that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Please scrub my post history so you can see this isn&#39;t a shareblue shill post.&quot;</p>

<p>Only you can scrub your post history.</p>

<p>Otherwise I only subscribe to T_D cause he&#39;s the damn president. I just like getting the headlines on my front page and rarely go there or post comments. Otherwise, I fully expect it to be a pep rally. Same thing went on in Hillary&#39;s sub, same thing with fucking BidenBros, I&#39;d imagine same thing with all the big name politicians. I find lots of differing viewpoints on the president right here in this sub. Otherwise, it seems to me that r/politics, r/worldnews and r/news are all almost the opposite in that any positive views of Trump or even non-negative views are down voted and blasted into the ether. I also find it crazy that people try and slam somebody just for being a subscriber or contribute to T_D. Again, he&#39;s the damn president. </p>

<p>Despite all the shilling and criticism, this sub right here is much less of an echo chamber than any of the other main subs where political discussion takes place. I routinely disagree with regulars one day and get along just fine the next. If T_D is the right then news, worldnews and politics is the left and this sub is as non-partisan as I can imagine a sub that discusses these issues while being inundated with shills from literally all over the globe can be.</p>
