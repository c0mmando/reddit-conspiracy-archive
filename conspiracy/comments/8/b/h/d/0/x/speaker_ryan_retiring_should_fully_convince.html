       It is now clear that anything and everything will be sacrificed to prevent Donald Trump from reforming our government. We must indeed have Democratic power. The Republicans are a front. Who's actually behind it we will never find out. They are too deeply entrenched. It has gone too far. Bush then Clinton then Bush then Obama has completely erased any residual resistance to the Takeover. America is done.

       Paul never really wanted the job in the first place, he was very reluctant to take over boehners position. I am not surprised at all that rats are fleeing the sinking ship that is career politics.

       Yep, exactly. The republicans were forcing Boehner out, and there was about to be an outright civil war within the party about who to replace him. Paul Ryan was the only one they could semi agree on, so they begged him to come on. And Paul Ryan saw that $500,000 check from the Koch's coming his way, so he finally agreed. Now, that he got the money, he cashed out, and has no more reason to stay.

       We'll see him in about a decade or so running for president.

       The entire lynchpin of your argument is that Trump is a good guy and our savior.

       That's what you want to focus on. It's not people I don't like - it's people that have ethical problems in very important roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to continue a dialog with you if you continue to twist my words. There's no point in discussing.

      <p>
       A big portion of the role of the POTUS is Chief Executive, which is to select his staff and cabinet. The people that Trump picked are unqualified, or have moral, ethical or financial conflicts that preclude them from working in the best interest of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a personal preference.
      </p>
      <p>
       But feel free to defend Kushner and Priutt. Tell me how they are not morally or ethically corrupt in their roles.

       You are aware cross-border immigration has been trending down and was at its lowest point in 40 years. People are immigrating way more through airports than the border. And can you point to the policies he's made to stop the dismantling? There's none - he's fearmongering his base. And what's the connection to corruption in the border security debate anyways?

       Even though immigration has trended down since Trump took office the political talk of opening the boards has been at an all time high. This talk is also coming from the UN and Israel towards the US. The plan has always been to dismantle boarders, then dismantle nation states, then world government.

       I said that Trump is fearmongering his base that the Mexican border is a free-for-all, which your biased articles from the Daily Caller and National Review help to confirm.

       The immigration problem is significantly more serious from airports than it is from the Mexican border, yet Trump's wall fantasies have nothing to do with the real problems.

       Hmm I am most certainly not. Just because I don’t agree with you and your Dear Leader - don’t make this a personal character attack.

       Stay on topic: you refuse to acknowledge what ways Trumps White House and canine team appointments are not corrupt and the one thing you can point to is his rhetoric on the Scary Mexican border.

       Ryan's leaving because Trump personally disgusts him, but Paul kept quiet and tolerated the man long enough to give a trillion-dollar tax cut to his ultra-wealthy patrons.  With that done, he's bailing on DC insanity to take some cushy job at a lobbyist or think tank that his backers are keeping warm for him.

       I’m trying to understand your argument here.  You’re saying that Ryan is getting pushed out so Trump won’t succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does Ryan being around have to do with Trumps success or lack thereof?   You consider Ryan a champion of Trump, and by him retiring the Republican are going to pick a leader that opposes Trump?

       I think that it will be Paul Nehlsen, or possibly someone else, over Randy Bryce. I doubt a Dem wins there regardless.
