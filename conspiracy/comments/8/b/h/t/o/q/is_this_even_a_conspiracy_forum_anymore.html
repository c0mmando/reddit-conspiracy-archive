<p>Now, I have been into this stuff since about 1990 - back when people wouldn&#39;t even admit that Zionists even <em>existed</em>, let alone listened to GHWB&#39;s national proclamation of the NWO.</p>

<p>Has conspiracy talk really regressed this much to the point where it is limited to mere speculation of MSM talking points?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I avoid postingand even commenting anymore.i think imissed the hayday but I have always read up on commented back and forth with ppl. Ihave yet to be engaged in a meaningful informative discussion. It doesmt happent online. To me it points to the complete destruction of humanity by removing &quot;humanity&quot; from oppos8ng positions it frees us to disregard even blatant facts as the ravings of a mad man. I have been spinning a theory in my head since this whole Russia-gate thing came about and then I saw the video fromtthe 80s of the former Russian spy, then I read about CIA and drugs, NSA and Googlebook.... I would give the rest of my thoughts on how it all ties together but its not worth it.... And it probably goes back far beyond what I mentioned but... Musings of a madman I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shills got completely hammered over the last few months as conscious efforts were made to speak very directly against the use of those tactics. You and I know it&#39;s nonsense, but the newer people think it&#39;s real, and that&#39;s why shills have to be confronted with direct questioning when they use <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">disinformation tactics</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you attacking this post without explaining any factual reason why it is wrong? Are you just trying to bully people who post here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you shift to making personal attacks after you confronted over factual errors? You need to explain or correct the inaccurate claims you were making and stop deflecting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do all of your comments in this thread have exactly 25 upvotes?&quot; (they <em>hate</em> this one).</p>

If people are aware of their shilling, I think what they are doing is actually counter-productive and would lead them to stop doing it maybe.
