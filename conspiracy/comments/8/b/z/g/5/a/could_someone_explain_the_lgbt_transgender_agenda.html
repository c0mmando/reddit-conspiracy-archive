       As a diagnosed dysphoric that wants as few LGBT* folks as possible, - it's a horrible way to live and is definitely not a choice - I find it difficult to understand the theories about us being evil, satanic, etc.. Looking at how media portrays it as a choice does raise suspicion, but I really doubt much harm can be done to anyone that isn't LGBT* when that is happening is the delegitimization of our mental disorders. I'm always interested in opposing viewpoints, and I'm open to any questions, so please don't hesitate to answer or ask anything that comes to mind. Thank you

       The homosexual agenda started as a film put out by Springs of life Ministries (Oregon), a Christian conservative group. Basically  it's a theory that gays/trans are trying to normalize a abnormal  act, as well try to recruit other to do the same. In their eyes homosexuality is a mental health issue and should be addressed  as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a straight female who has a lesbian best friend. I do not agree that her preference in sexual partners equals mental disorder. I am however curious by your post; when you say you are diagnosed  dysphoric (I'm guessing body dysphoric), is it then a act of nature or a mental disorder  for you? It seems almost as though you are also uncertain.

       Well my opinion probably differs from most people on this sub but I personally I think gay people are good for society. As far as trans people go, personally I feel like as long as people aren't hurting other people they should do whatever makes them happy and if transitioning makes them happy then go for it. BUT big pharma is really where conspiracy comes into the equation. I think they pump trans people with as much medication and hormones as they can to make money. Most medications come with side effects and sometimes the good the medication brings outweighs the negative side effects but a lot of times they don't. Trans people have it hard enough that factoring in medication just really fucks with their brain chemistry. I'm sure the high suicide rate is so high in trans communities because of the way they're treated in society but also I think the medication they're put on contributes to it. If you've been diagnosed gender dysmorphic then I genuinely wish you the best. It's not an easy hand to be dealt. Do what you need to do to do to makes things easier but just be cautious of big pharma.

       From the US in the north east. I think they're good for society because they aren't the ones having unplanned pregnancies and having kids they don't plan on taking care of. In fact they can adopt those kids and give them a good home. I means really who are they possibly harming in being gay?

       Agreed. I find it to be a net benefit in a modern society like ours. Reproduction isn't as high a priority and they can save abandoned children from suffering.

       Unfortunately I can't remember where or when I read it (and there is every possibility that I heard it said by lecturer at university), so I can't provide a link or resource to prove, but I once came across an interesting theory about the evolutionary advantage of homosexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist of it is that in a society where people are living communally or in large family groups that homosexuality provides an additional child rearing and child raising resource to improve the survival of their family's offspring. It follows on from the  scientifically studied correlations that the more older siblings one has, especially brothers, the more likely one is to be gay. 
In such a situation with many older brothers or sisters, a single gay person who did not have children of their own would be more likely to help with the rearing of their nieces and nephews and contribute to the family, that's improving reproductive success by insuring that more children make it healthily to adulthood without starving or being eaten. This confers an indirect and mild evolutionary advantage to fecund families who create one or two homosexual children occasionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said I can't remember exactly where it's from, and it's kind of out there, I admit so I'm not saying it's definitive or even necessarily true. However, as a gay man who often wonders about his purpose or meaning being locked out of the normal relationships required to fulfill the biological meaning of life (that is to reproduce) it brings me some comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition what I read said something along the lines of gay people historically who did not have children of their own might be freer in their time to pursue philosophy and other intellectual Pursuits which would further human culture. But that's way out there too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just food for thought mostly.

       Putting aside artificial insemination, homosexuality is gonna reduce birth rates. Might change the idea of a gentleman's club too.

       That aside, letting people harmlessly be who they feel they are is worth way more than any archaic religion trying to stop it.

       Honestly, pharma is a savoir as well as a killer. I completely agree with you on the overmedicating bit - I'm basically dependent on my antidepressants, and even those barely do anything. We really need to reform our mental healthcare system, and it's scary that America has the best one there is when ours is still so flawed. I appreciate the sympathy, and will definitely keep healthy skepticism when it comes to big pharma

       If you can place masses of individuals in a group it's vastly easier to control them.
Personally, I'm not transphobic, I'm trans-skeptical.
Kinda like furries, I'm not afraid of what they are capable of, I'm just not sure 0.03% of the population needs the police power of the government to make sure their feeling don't get hurt.

       It's not about their feelings, its about their rights as citizens.  When laws are passed that target and discriminate against them, they should have every right under the Consittution to legally challenge the constitutionality of those laws.  Every citizen is guaranteed the equal protection of the laws.

       I totally understand the skepticism. The overly-sensative ones are usually the same ones that feign it to be "cute" or "quirky" while not suffering any of the actual disorders that correlate with the alternative genders / sexualities. They give the whole community a bad name because they're the only ones that actually flaunt it. If you notice, the legitimate folks try to cover it up or keep it casual.

       I don't like how it's being forced onto kids either, trust me. A kid doesn't have a concept of sexuality or gender - it just knows that the opposite gender has cooties. Seeing mental illness be sensationalized is honestly pretty insulting to the people that really have it, and kids definitely don't need to be forced into such a shitty lifestyle.

       I really hate how people do this. Most legitimate members of the community aren't this way, I promise. It's all the people that feign it just so they have a cause to "support," but don't have the actual disorders that correlate with it. Give them a few years and they'll die down.

       I completely agree - kids don't need to be brought into this. Parents are socially conditioning their kids to be these alternative things, and the kids don't know any better until later on. Just teaching them about it could be beneficial in the sense that they know it's a thing, (I'm only saying this because my life would have been much easier if I had known it wasn't just me losing my shit) but pushing it onto them is definitely doing more damage than good.

       If Atrazine can make the frogs gay...then what are similar chemicals doing to humans?
      </p>
      <p>
       Roundup sprayed on the food, pesticides sprayed in the air, seeds coated with neonicotinoids, fluoride and lead in the water, aviation emissions leaving contrails everywhere, adjuvants in vaccines, asbestos in the walls, Fukishima radiation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...it's pretty apparent what might be happening here. We are altering our environment in such unnatural ways our genetics are not adapted for it and strange things happen. Look at all the diseases now, more than ever, new ones every day it seems like.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like growing some dank cheeba. You could have a nice budding plant, pure sensimilla, but if you fuck up the lighting for just one day of the flowering cycle you can cause that sensi to hermaphrodite from "stress" and grow male organs half way through flowering of female organs in an attempt to counter the stress. An unnatural/altered environment causes that. We'd be very stupid to believe we are immune to this sort of thing ourselves, while witnessing it happen all around us and pretending like LGBT is just a social movement. It is more plausible that people are being genetically castrated/altered by their polluted environment.

       I see what you're saying, and that could be the reason for the spike in it, but the alternative sexualities and genders have been around since ancient times. Certain Native American tribes often had gay males become their shamans because they were thought to be more androgynous, thus making them more in-tune with the spirits. Records show dysphorics committing suicides back in the 1800's and earlier. People have documented animals showing homosexual behaviors for years. Obviously, we can't tell if animals even have a concept of gender, so there are no statistics on that one, but you probably get the point

       The industrial revolution happened in the 1800's, so chemicals like leaded gas &amp; paint were around. And they used asbestos in ancient pottery.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you do have a good point and there are probably many different factors, like children growing up without strong families / father figures, or even parental issues. And of course, some people just do what they want to because they can, or they heard someone cool was doing it.

       I never mention "my family" like it is some kind of attack on my family.  I said  "the family structure" implying the normal fabric of society.  Yes divorced women, single mothers, and orphaned children do take a toll on society.

       How is it destroying the family structure, though? The alternative sexualities and genders are all linked to mental disorders, whether the community likes it or not, and we can't control what we feel, even if we try. It would only destroy the family structure if the family wasn't accepting of the disorders, which is becoming significantly less common now

       But see, legitimate Gender Dysphoria is a diagnosable and testable mental disorder. It can be pressured onto kids, but that's more of a social conditioning, and they won't have the actual disorder. A dysphoric brain will never not be dysphoric; it's a chemical imbalance that as of now, we can't fix.

       gay =/= transgender which is what he is talking about. No one is attacking you for sucking dick, really no one cares what anyones sexual preference is. OP is probably referring to the growing amount of people feeding their kids hormones or the general push of transgender issues being a national hot button issue.

       Ive learned not to feed trolls. The OP is calling people in the LGBT community as those who "choose" it and that they have mental disorders. That disqualifies legitimate conversation because it starts with a premise is flat out wrong, biased and ignorant. It is akin to racists using the book The Bell Curve to start a discussion with a premise that blacks are inferior and that they are just genetic malformations and abnormalities. And then you attack a black person for responding: "Don't shut down conversation."

       Go troll elsewhere, again. Done feeding you.

       I think you might have misread OP's statement. OP is trans, and doesn't wish their experienced social stigma on other people. I think you got hung up on their wording? I'm gay myself (and proud, yada yada), so I understand where OP's coming from.

       Their main point, anyway, was to ask why some folks view LGBT people as part of/involved in certain conspiracies.

       Mind jumping the fuck down and reading what I'm saying before you lose your shit? I'm a trannie and I want to know what the other side thinks. If you're going to call someone a piece of shit for trying to understand an opposing viewpoint, this sub isn't for you. Last I checked, we have the freedom to speak our minds. You need to learn about someone before throwing these bullshit accusations around, and people like you are the reason we have a bad rap in the first place. You can't just let people have their opinions, can you?

       First is homosexuality then it's bestiality and pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this resurgence of LGBT we have this wide acceptance of anything sexual having to be fully accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       •wanting to be a man when your biology says female or vise versa
      </p>
      <p>
       •Want to be a brony, furry, whatever the hell, other kin
      </p>
      <p>
       •polygamy
      </p>
      <p>
       •pedophilia (as long as you don't act on it...) just wait till it is allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People say that's as slippery slope argument. But look where we are now. And see all these articles being pushed like "I'm a pedophile but I'm not a monster" stupid Netflix age gap documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       People seeing John podestas at collection as just weird and nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is if pedophiles use the same argument "I was born like this" what can we say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since we're on this whole "I identify as..." people are coming out as animals, different race, different time periods. If a 5 year old boy can say they identify as female and legally consent to hormone shots, and genital mutilation. You think they'd stop a 12 year old girl from identifying as a 18 year old woman and consenting to her relationship with a 40 year old dude because she's "feels mature" and she was born that way?

       Some really conservative people believe that the Old Testament isn't actually Satanism, but the word of God, and thus they think homosexuality, trans-genderism, and anything that makes them feel funny, is the work of "the enemy" (Satan). Any attempts by society to make transgenderism and homosexuality accepted is considered the work of Satan, their whole worldview is centered around the idea that all evil carried out by civilization is the work of Satan and must be stopped (unless it's just normal evil, like the sins that everyone commits every day, especially the ones they commit, those are okay and don't require intervention).
      </p>

       Then there are people that are skeptical about transitioning children before they can read, and putting them on puberty blocking drugs because a doctor working in the least concrete science we have, psychology, has determined that their child has gender dysphoria.

       My problem with the “agenda” is that the goal has nothing to do with helping homosexual and transgender ppl, but it is a way to cause division and subvert social stability, particularly the family structure, which is uniquely protective of individuals. This is no longer about the morality of such conditions, but encouraging it beyond what makes sense. As someone here said, how is it 0.03% of the population have federal and local mandates to protect them?  Do you see that for other disenfranchised groups that are larger?  This is obviously not an organic progression of the issues. It has been seen in other areas as well, such as extramarital sex, normalization of divorce, pitting women against men through disingenuous ‘women’s lib.’  It’s not that the idea is wrong,
       <em>
        it is good to have justice and grace in each circumstance.
       </em>
       It is the malevolent intent to undermine protective relationships that result in isolated, weaker individuals —which makes it easier to manipulate society as a whole.  As much as we are in a broken world, where accidents of sexual orientation and gender identity can occur for physiological reasons, it does not negate the wisdom of God’s design and the need to preserve it for our own good, even the good of homosexual and transsexual ppl.  It’s frightening to see kids being pressured to question their gender and take medical procedures when they are so young to really understand all the issues. There have been a number of ppl who have regretted it. Apparently this detail is being suppressed in research.  This is a complex and difficult area to discuss bec it brings in so many issues of morality and acceptance. How can a person accept their condition and surrender it to God?  How can Christians have compassion and grace instead of judgement and accusations?  Those are a separate issue from what is happening now.

       This is why I'm asking; I'm not sure what the conspiracy would be. Apparently Satanists are making us gay or something? I don't know about anyone else, but it's definitely not some horned asshole telling
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       that my body's wrong.

       How is it destroying the family structure, though? The alternative sexualities and genders are all linked to mental disorders, whether the community likes it or not, and we can't control what we feel, even if we try. It would only destroy the family structure if the family wasn't accepting of the disorders, which is becoming significantly less common now

       Actually there are numerous times where the family structure gets "destroyed." Last time I checked society is still functional, it just adapts.
