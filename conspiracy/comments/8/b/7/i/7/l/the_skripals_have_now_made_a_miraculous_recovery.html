       Okay so i'm usually a lurker and to be honest a lot of the stuff i read on here i disagree with but there are some good points that get raised and i like to look at all avenue's. This now just seems like absolute bollocks though..
      </p>
      <p>
       So as most of us know on March 4th, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal were poisoned. Coincidentally only a 20 minute drive from Porton Down known for the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). Possibly one of the UK's most controversial military sites used for the development of chemical warfare for decades. This place is said to be the birth of the VX nerve agent although inevitably sold to and then massed produced by the US in exchange for thermonuclear technology(
       <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/nerve-gas-simon-cotton.aspx">
        https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/perspective/nerve-gas-simon-cotton.aspx
       </a>
       ). VX is one of the most widely known nerve agents and with it being more potent than sarin gas and far more dangerous than many other nerve agents was classed as a WMD in 1993. (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VX_(nerve_agent)
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       So with that in mind, we have two people, one which was a known double agent for Russia who became a UK citizen after an arranged spy swap between Russia and the UK and his daughter, a Russian citizen who was over visiting her father from Russia. They get found on a bench slumped over and unconscious. They get admitted to hospital, along with the first police officer on the scene who has also been "contaminated" with an, at this time unknown poison. I had a bit of trouble trying to find the exact date it was released to the public that the nerve agent Novichok was actually used, so if anyone can let me know that would be great. So while these people are in hospital and over what i remember being the course of the next 24-48 hours they discover the nerve agent Novichok was used on both Sergei and Yulia, as well as cross contamination with the police officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this to me is where things start to get really ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Novichok was developed some time between 1971 and 1993 by the Soviet Union and Russia. in 1992 though two brave whistle blowers Vil Mirzayanov &amp; Lev Fyodorov blew the lid on the chemical weapons experimentation that was going on (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil_Mirzayanov">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil_Mirzayanov
       </a>
       ). Now bear in mind that Vil Mirzayanov was one of the scientists that actually helped invent this chemical, so it's safe to say he will have an exceptionally good understanding of how it works and it's effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       So during the process of Yulia, Sergei and the police officer Nick Bailey being in hospital. The UK government comes out and says it has evidence that Novichok has been used, it was clearly done by Russia as this is a Russian made chemical and the target was an ex Russian spy. They begin the condemn the country and ask for the world wide support from other countries and announce they are expelling 23 Russian diplomats due to them being "intelligence officers" for Russia (although they will have already knew this and were happy having them in the country before). Before we know it more than 20 different countries have backed the UK and are expelling Russian diplomats left, right and center, in less than a week since the announcement from the UK without any prior proof or letting Russia or the UN security council have a single sample of the Novichok nerve agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to Vil Mirzayanov, one of the inventors of Novichok then, during the process of the worldwide condemnation and the press trying to figure out more about the nerve agent they obviously go to the one man who would be in the know. Interviews are done and we get some quite harrowing information about this nerve agent. So Novichok is supposed to be more than 10X more powerful than VX which as mentioned above is classed already as a WMD. The one thing that stuck with me though was the fact he said the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's torture," he said. "It's absolutely incurable." (
       <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/only-russia-could-be-behind-uk-poison-attack-toxin-inventor-says/9546298">
        http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/only-russia-could-be-behind-uk-poison-attack-toxin-inventor-says/9546298
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       He said: “There is no antidote to these agents."
      </p>
      <p>
       “I can say with nearly 100 per cent certainty that if Skripal and his daughter are taken off life support, they will die, although they are now only technically alive.” (
       <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hero-cop-hit-nerve-agent-12227778">
        https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/hero-cop-hit-nerve-agent-12227778
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       "The damage it inflicts is practically incurable,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Asked this week about the March 4 poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, he was quoted as saying: "These people are gone -- the man and his daughter. Even if they survive they will not recover." (
       <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20180313-scientist-who-leaked-russias-novichok-conspiracy">
        http://www.france24.com/en/20180313-scientist-who-leaked-russias-novichok-conspiracy
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       A scientist who was developing the agent came into residual contact which left him critically injured and took ten days to recover consciousness after the incident. He lost the ability to walk and was treated at a secret clinic in Leningrad for three months afterwards. The agent caused permanent harm, with effects that included "chronic weakness in his arms, a toxic hepatitis that gave rise to cirrhosis of the liver, epilepsy, spells of severe depression, and an inability to read or concentrate that left him totally disabled and unable to work." He never recovered and died in July 1992 after five years of deteriorating health. (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then on the 22nd of March Nick Bailey is released in perfect health and is free to go home. Now as of today the 10th of April Yulia has been released from hospital and taken to a safe house where we will probably never hear from her again and Sergei is set to make a recovery and be released shortly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to finally recap and apologise for the length of this! One of the most deadly nerve agents in the world has supposedly been used in a potentially public place to assassinate an ex Russian spy by Russia. The location of the attempted assassination was 20 minutes away from the UK's most widely known chemical weapons lab. Yet the NHS have managed to not only find out what has happened to them, got the non existent antidotes to work on them and manage to save three people. Two of which were at an almost 100% chance of death or life long impairment by the estimation of one of the inventors of said chemical. No one else has been infected and Russia and the UN still don't have samples of the nerve agent and now the UK can't confirm it came from there oh and also the UK wont let Russia speak to a Russian citizen (Yulia) regarding the alleged attack.

       Exposure time and concentration are vital here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was enough to make them sick but not kill them. Like there was a story of a guy who gave himself cyanide poisoning by eating cherry seeds. He didn't die but he nearly did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the novichok seems to have been delivered on the door handle, we don't know how long it was there and its concentration would be falling all the time.

       So do you think there was originally enough to kill them on the door handle and the concentration has fallen by the time he's touched it?

       So what do you think about the fact that all the evidence shows that exposure to nerve agents such as this causes severe symptoms within seconds or minutes, rather than hours?
      </p>
      <p>
       How were the Skripals able to spend hours enjoying their day
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       being exposed to this agent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another question... we hear talk about these people being in a coma for weeks... but:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Both Mr and Ms Skripal remain in hospital
        <strong>
         under heavy sedation
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>

        http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2018/6.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would doctors be sedating people who are in a coma? These people woke up not because the effects of a nerve agent wore off, but because the doctors stopped sedating them.

       My opinions about this case from the start have been based on evidence or lack thereof and logical thinking, your has been to parrot the "official narrative" which is falling apart at the seams day by day.

       Where are you getting your information? Also, did the Skripals  go back to their home between the time of leaving the pub and going to park bench? I can't clarify that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exposure time: I spoke to one scientist, Andrei Zheleznyakov, who had been exposed to a minute amount of Novichok in a lab accident five years prior. He staggered out after the mishap, his vision, as I wrote, “seared by brilliant colors and hallucinations.” Zheleznyakov never fully recovered, and he died shortly after I interviewed him. (From the WaPo writer that interviewed him in Russia)
      </p>
      <p>
       Concentration: Novichok agents have a higher density than air and will therefore tend to collect in low-lying areas. No other information is available regarding their persistency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, numerous articles I've read describe the nerve agent as "persistent" for a short time, but not much is known. So I'm curious as to where you are getting your information.

       The father has been in critical condition for over a month. The daughter, who presumably was less exposed, just was released.

       Critical condition means vital signs are compromised and unstable.

       I can appreciate that then, maybe the amount of nerve agent he was exposed to wasn't enough to actually kill him.

      <p>
       I'm not overly saying the chemicals are 100% lethal but from the evidence of how brutal Novichok is and the amount of strange shit going on regarding the way it's been handled by the UK government you have to admit it seems quite odd?

       Chemical weapons are used not because they're lethal, but to send a message. A painful one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Litivenko and the agony he died in. I'm gonna link his statement, in part, because it's so poignant. A message to counter what was sent.

        I think, therefore, that this may be the time to say one or two things to the person responsible for my present condition.

        You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price. You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilised value.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have shown yourself to be unworthy of your office, to be unworthy of the trust of civilised men and women.

       <p>
        You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.

        May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.

       It doesn't automatically disprove your theory, it just makes it more suspicious, which is what I said. Of course there is a chance that the Russian assassin screwed up, it just makes the whole conspiracy theory against the Russians even less likely than it already was.

       You're absolutely right, it doesn't add up. Just like this gas attack in Syria supposedly done by Assad, this is just another staged attack. The Deep State clearly wants war and conflict with Russia/Syria/Iran, and they are pushing very hard right now.

       I have thought this was dodgy since it came into the news... I don't see why the samples Russia requested were refused.... Teresa May is quick to accuse and then fan the flames of blame without offering any proof. I think its been a red flag since day one and that it's an excuse to stir up tensions and take a step back to cold War mistrust and suspicion... The war in the middle east is cooling somewhat, war is money and the fact that Putin won't tolerate the bullshit lays a good foundation to start WW3.

       The only confirmed kill via this nerve agent took 5 years to die after exposure from a constelation of neurodegenerative conditions. The purpose of this weapon is not to immediately kill, it is to produce invalids.

       The nerve agent used on kimmy's brother at the Malaysian airport worked pretty well. He died quickly. So the rumour is the Russians have some of the most lethal and best nerve agents in the world and now their stuff cant even kill two civilians.. Mmm

       Not sure about this secondary contact on the door handle and then they went out for lunch? All the stuff ive seen is the effects are immediate. No protection and contact with the stuff ends up with you doing the funky rabbit in less than a minute.. You know the old 60's (or earlier) video of the rabbit being exposed to nerve agent. If you haven't seen it, you should watch it, the nerve blockers send the poor rabbit into a frenzy.

       Maybe if you spent more time analysing the story instead of people's post history you'd come to the same conclusion as me.

       Regarding your final paragraph - just come out and say it I hate beating around the bush.

       Chemical weapons are used not because they're lethal, but to send a message. A painful one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Litivenko and the agony he died in. I'm gonna link his statement, in part, because it's so poignant. A message to counter what was sent.

        I think, therefore, that this may be the time to say one or two things to the person responsible for my present condition.

       <p>
        You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price. You have shown yourself to be as barbaric and ruthless as your most hostile critics have claimed.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have shown yourself to have no respect for life, liberty or any civilised value.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have shown yourself to be unworthy of your office, to be unworthy of the trust of civilised men and women.
       </p>
       <p>
        You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.

        May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.

       It doesn't automatically disprove your theory, it just makes it more suspicious, which is what I said. Of course there is a chance that the Russian assassin screwed up, it just makes the whole conspiracy theory against the Russians even less likely than it already was.
