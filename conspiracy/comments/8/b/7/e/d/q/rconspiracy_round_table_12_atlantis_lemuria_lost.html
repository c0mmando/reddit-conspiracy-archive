<p>This is not to claim that the tech was better than our current standards, but &quot; is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, this was clearly not unique or the first of its kind. &quot;The quality and complexity of the mechanism&#39;s manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period.&quot;</p>

<p>That was sort of the point. The mechanical complexity predates what is traditionally thought of on par with devices from the 1300&#39;s, but stands as an example that it predates that period by about 13-15 hundreds years.</p>

<p>Wait a moment. I agree that there&#39;s nothing suspicious here. But what is usually reported is that *before* the Antikythera mechanism was found there was nothing remotely similar to the complexity of this tool, and nothing remotely similar to the degree of precision and craftemenship required. If it hadn&#39;t been dated precisely it surely would have been considered on hoax. But now we know we had the skills to build something like this long ago, case closed. I don&#39;t see any mystery myself but to deny the sheer magnitude of this finding is useless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just looked the wikipedia page which I though was what you wanted. And it says &quot;<em>the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer Ma Jun (c. 200–265 CE) of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms</em>&quot;. </p>

<p>And in any case is just a chariot, I&#39;m sure there are other inventions that are far superior to this chariot and still have not surprised researchers as much as the Antikythera mechanism. And if you think they have found only bits of two gears maybe it&#39;s the reason why you don&#39;t see how extraordinary was thi tool. </p>

<p>Then again I repeat, I&#39;m not the guy you were talking before, I agree with you that it has nothing to do with ancient civilizations, never mind Atlantis. But still it changes our view about what we were able to craft at that time. By a long shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has nothing to do with aquifers or concrete, those are completely different technologies that have nothing to do with the discusson at hand, so what&#39;s your point? That&#39;s like saying self driving cars aren&#39;t 21st century technology because people had boats thousands of years ago; it makes zero sense because the two aren&#39;t related.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t understand what you could possibly find vague about 1300s technology; we&#39;re discussing one, single piece of technology,  not 1300s technology in general. The specific technology in question is the ability to manufacture a device capable of predicting astronomical events decades in advance without the need to do the math by hand, which other than the device is not seen until the 1300s.</p>

<p>I also think you&#39;re confused about what the term computer means in a non-modern context since you keep insisting that a bunch of gears isn&#39;t necessarily a computer, even though we know exactly what function it was built for (COMPUTING predictive astronomical problems). The device was used to solve (compute) predictive astronomical problems without needing to do the math by hand. What about the device doesn&#39;t seem like a computer to you? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>analogue computer is a form of computer that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, <strong>mechanical</strong> <em>(gears in this case)</em>, or hydraulic quantities to model the <strong>problem being solved</strong> <em>(predictions of astronomical events decades in advance)</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Electronic Computers =/= Only kind of Computer</p>

<p>The gears are designed in such a way that they can follow celestial bodies and predict astronomical events like eclipses. Basically the design of the gears and how they interacted was the software and the hardware. It has 1 set of built in inputs to start the computation. The movement of the gears is the actually computing part and the resulting visuals from the gear movement signaled different outputs. Input, computation, output = Basic Computer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. The very act of trying to follow the movements of celestial bodies, which would include positioning that would cause eclipses, is a prediction. Prediction is another word for attempting to guess the future. When the weatherman says on Tuesday that it&#39;ll rain Thursday he is making a prediction. When you say the planets will be in this alignment tomorrow night that is a prediction. If you still disagree, you can forget the semantics of prediction and just realize it is computing the movements. The astronomical knowledge inputted wasn&#39;t new. The calculations weren&#39;t new. But this tool designed to do the calculations using those inputs was new and is an early, simple example of an analog computing device aka a computer. </p>

Maybe there is also some confusion around the device in their minds capabilities vs the device actual known capabilities... which for the last fucking time is theorized to be an astrological/celestial timepiece... which means it isnt computing anything. If you think it predicts astrological events... then to you its a computer.

Actual peer reviewed pub lishings cant even confirm it was a time piece with all the missing hypothetical pieces.

    <div class="md"><p>No, just disappointed, very disappointed in modern skeptics on reddit (/conspiracy) self destruct logic. I.e. a lot of people here, say i argue 1/8 based on representation of responses actually looked up this object with an emphasis on peer reviewed data, it is important not only what but where scientific/historical claims are made. If i say something, and have even the ability to censor discourse, i should be taken less seriously than if i say something encouraging others to disagree, tear down a statement and together build a better one... so ALL peer reviewed data on this object says a few things, and everyone (7/8) is apparently disagreeing with their findings. And that is disappointing, and not really worth the time after a point (which ive passed idk why im here... day off maybe to blamd, i should go buy a wii u and mario maker 1.5 yrs late, lol). Anyways... this then gets into the territory of not understanding how gears work. Otherwise youd have acknowledged by this logic a wheel with a marker on it is a computer. The source of power isnt the point, the point is because it is a time device the start time affects ability for a set of gears (just think bicycle with mark om wheel). If you can find all the missing pieces, and then run a few trials where you predict an astrological event despite start time, ill concede. Until then, this is silly. Take care friend. :)</p>

<li><p>Idk where your getting this YouTube vs peer review thing. I haven&#39;t watched 1 YT video on this thing and in my googling, all the peer reviewed articles I came across concluded it&#39;s a complex and fairly accurate astronomical model of the celestial bodies known at that time. </p></li>
<li><p>You dont ever present any case other that &quot;peer review says&quot; and &quot;people dont understand gears.&quot; Neither of which are an actual argument. </p></li>
<li><p>A wheel with markings wouldn&#39;t be an analog computer by itself. It needs to interact with other computational elements. A slide rule is an analog computer though.

<li>As ive said many times this is the only place you see the claim predicting astrological events occur. I think maybe this post has branched more than 2 response trees. Claim is in both.</li>
<li>Mobile, cant link well. Sorry cant do any better excuse is honesty. I have mentioned adding peer review or .edu to any google queries on topic. And i have implored people to seek peer reviewed comparisons. But im refuting claims anyways, burden of proof is on claimant citing hearsay.</li>
<li>Youre right, it isnt a computer, it contains none of the parts that would differentiate computing. Gears and housing alone powered by man dont compute astrological events. Ty thats very helpful here :) </li>

If were calling time pieces computers, sun dials were the first computers? This still isnt close within a thousand years of first gear driven time piece... The fact is this is pieces of 2 gears people profoundly hypothesize upon, when all peer reviewed data dates the item over a thousand years after gear driven time pieces, hydraulics and even steam powered devices and note that &#39;predicting astralogical events&#39; is horseshit hearsay. This community is beyond toxic when you disagree with kool aid. Fact is this was likely used to measure time via/astralogical clock, seems more complex to modern humans because we dont know or use the stars to tell us time and location like more mariner-centric people did... and yes, its still amazing.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Yes, they do detract when they are solely about being a pointless silly meme joke and that&#39;s all they add. And don&#39;t you worry bud, I <em>do</em> seek out information. Thanks for assuming. And I already have researched the topic at hand. However, for people who haven&#39;t, these shit memes just stop the conversation, instead of promote it. That&#39;s why this is frustrating. I know I will research this topic, but shitty memes will probably discourage some others from looking into the topic. Kind of the opposite view of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, no? </p>

<p>Fuck me for wanting people to actually discuss things at hand instead of switching the conversation to flavor of the hour level bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s like your opinion man.</p>

<p>See I can make meme jokes too.</p>

<p>But really, a lot of people care. That&#39;s why my comment got upvoted. This is one of the only places I would expect reddit to care. This place is supposed to be about free, open discussion...and when a control mechanism is used to limit conversation right in front of us, I would expect some people to be irratated. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if it was on accident, it stopped the conversation pretty effectively. If you look at those jokes on reddit you will find the same trend in every thread...it stops the original topic in place. So even if its just in fun, it&#39;s kind of messing with the wholr point of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>You know memes and memetics have value and are real right? For a long time I might add. The Navy has done research on them, as well as many respected people over time. It&#39;s not coincedence that memes have become popular in the last decade or so.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what <a href="/r/prequelmemes">/r/prequelmemes</a> has been doing, even if its just a joke and on accident. That&#39;s why it&#39;s gaining in popularity and it stops conversations everywhere it happens. That&#39;s the meme magic of <a href="/r/prequelmemes">/r/prequelmemes</a></p>

<p>But yeah.....not a big deal</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is pretty cool. I saw this thing on the discovery channel when I was a kid about some desert shrubs in Africa that can go a long time without water and then there was a dust storm that buried one of these shrubs under like 120foot sand dune in a day or two. if that much sand can dune up on a friggin shrub then the terrain can change dramatically in a few generations. if I remember correctly didn&#39;t they have to excavate some of the pyramids because they were literally buried in sand? who knows what else in under all that sand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something similar happened in Bulgaria, East Europe.</p>

<p>They have a town called Nessebar, that was sacked by the Turks and was a focal point of many wars between Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>

<p>This town is split into old and new Nessebar but they inhabit the same &#39;island&#39;. I can&#39;t remember what the proper term is, but it&#39;s one of those towns that is (well, was, they built a higher road a few years ago) only accessible when the tide is out.</p>

<p>A few years ago they were doing some renovation in the town centre when they uncovered ancient roman ruins(or ruins of the same time period) When you walk through the town, the tops of the ruins are only a few feet below street level and they have uncovered some amazing architecture.</p>

<p>So, I suppose it goes to show that ruins could be lost through various wars or just buried totally for whatever random reason shit ends up below the ground. More importantly, it shows that even in a busy town with a long history, secrets remain hidden just under the surface.</p>

I think it was Nik Research who made the observation that probably a thunderbolt.. from the sun? or from some passing planet scarred our planet from around Nepal to Africa. It sounds pretty mad to begin with, until you watch the testable hypotheses from the Thunderbolts of the Gods (Symbols from an Alien Sky) youtube vid. and take in google maps from a zoomed out point. One can see the proposed arch through the Middle East too, between these points. 
It&#39;s as good as an explanation as any I&#39;ve heard so far. NASA images of Mars show the same sort of scarring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg1">Alterwelt&#39;s &quot;Remote Viewing&quot; of the past</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some backstory. So this guy started a thread on Godlike Productions&#39; forum saying he can remote view ancient civilizations. His username was Alterwelt and he allowed users to post questions.</p>

<p>The threads that followed are fucking crazy. Even if what he said wasn&#39;t true, it is incredibly fascinating. I wish everything he said could be made into a crazy book series.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to get it off my mind ever since. Let me know what you guys think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ridiculously interesting, thank you for this.</p>

<p>I do believe that humans have FAR more history than what we&#39;re being told (the ~10k years of human settlements we&#39;re fed is a joke). That said, statements like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the second high period of civilization solar power, magnetic propulsion, artificially grown crystalline hardware were commonplace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also mentions that we had bases on the moon and explored the inner solar system. I do find this all hard to believe. We have a large amount of proof of the dinosaurs but not a single shred of evidence that any of these societies existed? </p>

<p>I want to believe. Hahaha :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the relatively recent discovery of the 300,000 year old <em>Homo sapiens</em> will have implications in the ancient civilizations hypotheses. Previously, the oldest <em>Homo sapiens</em> bones dated to 195,000 years ago. </p>

<p>I could be wrong (not an anthropologist by any means), but I believe this has affected the existing evolutionary model of humans. That is, we now know that we evolved and migrated sometime before 250,000-300,000 years ago. </p>

<p>I wonder what implications this will have (if any) to the accepted timeline for the appearance of anatomically modern and behaviorally modern humans, especially given the presence of heat treated stone tools among the 300,000 year old bones. I know stone tools have been in use for a very long time, but I don&#39;t know anything regarding the evolution of tools; maybe heat treated flint isn&#39;t that surprising for 300,000 year old hominids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You take anything made of carbon, bone, wood, ect, you take it into a clean room, you place it into an airtight box, you drill a hole and take a peice that was not exposed to air, messure it&#39;s weight.</p>

<p>You burn it while collecting the smoke that is then fed into an instrument that counts the particles, the ratio of C14 compared to C12 tells you it&#39;s age, as the C14 degrades into C12 at a specific rate</p>

<p>I did a search, you can pay the grad students of a university in Florida to do this for you for under $500. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t complex, it&#39;s done all over universities every week. Sure if you are getting a BA in geology then it&#39;s msot likely text book work, but there are 100s in geology doctorial programs every semester across the states and I&#39;m sure 1000s when you look at the whole globe.</p>

<p>If it didn&#39;t work, someone would write a paper about it and it would be tested 100 fold because that happens all the time with scientific methods and research every day.</p>

Almost all dinosaur fossils come from teams led by 2 men trying to one up each other. While most of their findings arnt contested, there are numerous confirmed forgeries on both sides. What is to say the whole thing isnt fake? It is kind of weird that dinosaurs wernt known at all until the 1800s but the knowledge of fossils goes back to ancient rome and probably further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I stumbled across that post it was like the first time I ever saw the website. I even got a couple questions in to the OP (Alterwelt) before he disappeared.</p>

<p>The whole thing is freaking crazy, and I love it. He&#39;s very convincing, and the answers he gives seem plausible most of the time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my personal opinion that if high technology existed during these &quot;high periods of civilization&quot; I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that evidence has been eradicated from the face of the earth due to time. </p>

<p>If so much of the earths population lives so close to the coastlines now, imagine what would happen if we were hit with a cataclysmic flood. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-earth-would-look-like-if-ice-melted-world-map-animation-2015-2">Here is a cool video showing the earth if all the ice melted.</a> That would raise the sea levels by 216 feet. Many of our most populated areas would be underwater. Florida would essentially be completely underwater.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder what kind of historical record we would leave behind if we went through a cataclysm similar to the one Alterwelt or Graham Hancock talk about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a joe rogan podcast with graham taking about the water levels before the last ice age and how the sea level is much lower then it is today. So it got me thinking wouldn’t they be able to map out the old coastlines of these ancient cities?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought about that. I looked it up last night and found that the ocean has risen 120 meters since the last ice age. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t link from my phone right now, but I found a map after googling something like &quot;ocean 120 meters lower&quot; and it brought up an old Reddit post with a map of the earth minus 120 meters of ocean. </p>

<p>I focused on the area around northern Australia/Indonesia/New Guinea. If you take a look at that map, Australia is connected to New Guinea 12,800 years ago. The sea of Arafura was above sea level. </p>

<p>There was a huge land mass from southeast Asia which almost connected to the mainland of Australia. Today it is a string of islands and countries from Malaysia to Indonesia.</p>

<p>I theorize that there was an advanced civilization which built the massive pyramid currently being excavated at Gunung Padang in Indonesia. What are now island countries were the mountainous highlands of that time, while all the coastal habitations are now under 120 meters of water west of Sumatra and north of Indonesia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah so basically Oceania would be one big continent. I was reading something about the coral reefs and how there finding massive reefs at depths of up to 1500ft but coral reefs are only formed around 150ft so it proves the ocean floors go up and down which could be an explanation for Atlantis and Lemuria disappearing in stages. So in other words they think these lost cities are under the coral reefs and that explains why we havnt found anything because the reefs are a protected ecosystem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very interesting. I never knew that about coral reefs. I also believe that 13,000 years of soil is probably making it hard to find as well. </p>

<p>Check out Gunung Padang. There is a megalithic site on top of the &quot;hill&quot; in west java, but that hill is apparently man-made. The excavation is still underway, but there appears to be a massive pyramid under the hill. Core samples are saying that the pyramid is 20,000 years old. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over the course of the past few days, little by little, I&#39;ve gone through all 286 pages (skipping through to Alerwelt&#39;s replies).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buddhism got many things wrong. Jesus got all of them right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They go on and on about Jesus. Saying that he was genetically just a man, but he came to understand all of creation. OP elsewhere mentions that modern man isn&#39;t capable of understanding all of creation because our modern brains can&#39;t handle it.</p>

<p>They also mention that:</p>

<p>--Bigfoot creatures can teleport a few miles at a time. </p>

<p>--We used to be able to go to the moon in four hours, Mars in two months, and had colonies in orbit.</p>

<p>--Black people are an evolution of another, extremely similar homo species.</p>

<p>--People during the first period of civilization didn&#39;t dream as they had access to the dreamscape at any time and basically walked around in a half dream state.</p>

<p>--During the time of man, North America had a bird with a nearly 100&#39; wing span (keeping in mind the largest we know of was closer to 25&#39;, with the largest pterodactyl at about 35&#39;).</p>

<p>It got more and more ridiculous as it went on but <em>boy</em> was it all entertaining, I have to give them that. Also, whoever is behind it seems to be very well educated. They speak enough proven &#39;truth&#39; that it&#39;s easy to go along with them for the ride.</p>

<p>What questions did you ask? I truly wish I&#39;d been there, I have a few of my own I&#39;d love to ask! </p>

<p>If even ten percent of what OP said was true, then it&#39;s still completely earth shattering info. Again, it&#39;s more fun to believe than to just flat out refuse to even entertain any of it. </p>

 Quoting: Matjaz</p>

<p>Religious people would be forced to forfeit their beliefs. Archeologists, philosophers and others would be forced to admit their knowledge is insufficient and concerning the history they know as little as a common person.</p>

<p>Reverse engineering the renewable energy sources would deprive vast companies of their income, cheap and effective medical technologies would undermine the medical complex and so on.</p>

<p>The change of this magnitude is too much for a great many people.&quot;</p>

<p>These billion dollar companies could pivot if this technology was available to be reversed engineered in no fucking time. The medical companies don’t want it known because it would reduce their income? Fuck no. They would be selling these crystals or whatever at vast amounts of money in a second. </p>

<p>Unlimited energy? The oil companies would pivot and get cheap, renewable energy to be resold in another second.</p>

<p>For real. There’s tons of money to made if it’s true and reversible. </p>

<p>The new found tech would make it easier to make a “slave society”, not harder. Think of the weapons, the control, the power and shit they could build with this new tech.</p>

<p>Corruption, Treason, Black operation involving machinery that is far advanced than we currently perceive, data collection, mechanisms of control like media, sports, and music, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am inclined to disagree on this one. There are a lotta cubicle farms in Langely. I&#39;m absolutely certain that the CIA does not deem such an initiative below its purview. It seems to me that the CIA has and continues to dabble in its fair share of either bankrolling or outright creating propaganda, social engineering initiatives, and limited hangouts not only on its own citizens, but throughout the planet.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, were I in charge of the most disgusting organized crime syndicate on the planet, I&#39;d be more than happy to scrap together a purposefully low-gloss &quot;authentic&quot; hang-out and/or forum targeting curious awakening souls in order to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Monitor what awakening people say or are curious about.</p></li>
<li><p>Control the dribble of juicy details about real elements of the consciousness hologram we&#39;re all logged into, or at the very least contextualize them in a way that maintains the CIA&#39;s control or perch.</p></li>

<p>The OP talks about other spiritual figures like Buddha who knew the same things, just not to the same degree as Jesus.</p>

<p>He says consciousness is real and never really ends. As opposed to the previous humans, we made life and death finite and our subconscious is our dream state. He said we can&#39;t comprehend what the higher humans thought or operated like because their brains were always subconsciously awake and similar to a lucid dream state. </p>

<p>&quot;Re: Remote Viewing Ancient Civilizations - a compilation of data.
What is the voynich manuscript and what language was used in it? What was its purpose and who created it?
 Quoting: Anonymous Coward 56184035 </p>

<p>It&#39;s not written in a language, its written in a cypher using a dead language. It was a message from one representative of a secret society to his colleagues. It&#39;s not meant for the casual reader.&quot;</p>

<p>According to this article it has been decoded- <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/the-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-has-finally-been-decoded/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/the-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-has-finally-been-decoded/</a> </p>

<p>So maybe it&#39;s all just really well-worded bullshit? I don&#39;t know. I read a bunch of these pages and their answers seem plausible, but this one is just bugging me. I mean, maybe his answer isn&#39;t wrong, just conveniently worded?</p>

<p>tl;dr: The spiral orbit of our Sun with Sirius A, both around the brown dwarf Sirius B, is a sort of &quot;engine&quot; that drives the development and, ultimately, ascension/descension of species on Earth.</p>

<p>Atlantis is said to be the fourth root race; we&#39;re the fifth, just starting out -- very exciting to think about:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The races are literally different.  Physiologically, psychologically, culturally, etc.</p>

<p>Pointing out that those differences come with advantages and disadvantages is going to be absolutely necessary if we as humans ever want to create an equal society.</p>

<p>Every time someone uses the word &quot;racist&quot; as an insult, they do damage to our future by creating a social stigma around incredibly important topics.</p>

<p>We <em>need</em> to look at things with logic if we are to grow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I strongly wish more people understood this. Society seems to be stuck in an older framework of understanding the races, where too much is considered taboo and real discussion can&#39;t occur when most people are either overly sensitive or worried about offending someone. There is no way truly forward from this point, only more of the same, just like the powers that be want it. They love to see us divided and hating each other.. it keeps us from focusing our discontent where it really belongs. If we could all come together, unite our visions and find true strength in numbers and new purpose, we would be unstoppable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m still not sure I buy the whole root races thing, various groups seem to think something important will be happening in 2025.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is that 2025 will briefly at the beginning of the year be 1776 in the Julian (Roman) calendar by the reckoning of Phantom Time Hypothesis. 1776 is printed on the US $1 bill, supposedly as a representation of the founding year of the US, but it is peculiarly written in Roman numerals without the month or day, next to two Latin phrases, potentially signaling that it instead refers to J.1776. Further, one of these phrases is generally translated as &quot;a new order for the ages&quot;, or sometimes as &quot;a new world order&quot;, but it can also be translated as &quot;a new class of races&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heres my personal theory. There was once was great civilisation 12000 years ago. There was geological evidence was meteor hitting the ice caps . The caused huge catastrophe . By hitting the ice caps the water leval went up dramatically . that could explain why alot of ancient structures are under water. Then the surviors of the metor spilt apart and made their own sub culture. This could explain why Egyptians and all other empires that related during that time were similar. Same set of gods . A god king a jelous brother that wants the throne etc. Also adds explain why alot pyrmids mad during that time. Dont really have a clue about what caused the collaspe of the bronze age. </p>

<p>to be honest . I wrote this half assed and im sorry. i dont enjoy typing on phone i actually edit later on my computer when get a chance.</p>

<p>also if like history and suppressed archeogly and debunking of archeological theories then. watch Bright insight god i love his channel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone want to read a serious intellectual book which will convince you of the merits of Atlantis existing in the past I suggest <em>Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C</em> by D S Allan and J B Delair. It goes through geological and mythological evidence, is sourced and cited in an academic manner and contains a wealth of information on the subject. After reading this I was amazed it wasn&#39;t common knowledge given all the evidence in favour of it. If you are a hardcore skeptic and want scientific evidence that Atlantis once existed in this world read this book. I have an old thread broadstroking it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6r0ldi/book_review_cataclysm_compelling_evidence_of_a/">here</a> as well as a link to an ebook version of the book :). </p>

<p>Maybe there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s not common knowledge. Denying the Ice Age theory is a pretty huge claim. How have other scientists responded to it? Links would be ideal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am fascinated by this subject. Recently, I read &quot;Lemuria: Lost Continent of the Pacific&quot; by Wishar Cerve (actually a nom de plume for H. Spencer Lewis). It is a fascinating book, which lead me to Mt. Shasta and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=petroglyphs+klamath+falls&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwj4i7g7HaAhXrjVQKHTRtA4gQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1380&amp;amp;bih=799">Klamath Falls petroglyphs.</a></p>

<p>I did some more research and found a striking similarity to petroglyphs located at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=petroglyphs+klamath+falls&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwj4i7g7HaAhXrjVQKHTRtA4gQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1380&amp;amp;bih=799">Lake Winnemucca, Nevada</a> and [Painted Rock, California.](<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=san+luis+obispo+petroglyphs+painted+rock&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2ityihLHaAhXrzlQKHUrRC5UQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1380&amp;amp;bih=799">https://www.google.com/search?q=san+luis+obispo+petroglyphs+painted+rock&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2ityihLHaAhXrzlQKHUrRC5UQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1380&amp;amp;bih=799</a></p>

<p>Then, after doing a little more digging, I found a resemblance to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=caroline+islands+script&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwijgrK6hPrZAhVE_mMKHVcNBwYQ_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1380&amp;amp;bih=799#imgrc=4XV__UXiAFraMM:">Caroline Islands Script</a> from the South Pacific, near Papua New Guinea. </p>

<p>Could this point to a common root language dating back to lost Lemuria? Curious to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just finished reading <em>The History of Atlantis</em> and <em>Occult Science in Atlantis</em> by Lewis Spence. Almost finished with <em>Atlantis: Mother of Empires</em> by Robert Stacy-Judd. These are must reads for anyone interested in the subject, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Both researchers theorize that there were three major waves of immigration from Atlantis to Europe and the Americas corresponding to three great cataclysms suffered by Atlantis, along with periodic colonization of both areas in between. These cataclysms and subsequent waves occurred in approximately 23,000 BC, 14,000 BC, and 9,600 BC, with the latter being the final cataclysm described by Plato in the Timaeus and Critias. </p>

<p>These three waves correspond to the Aurignacian, Magdalenian, and Azilian-Tardenoisian cultures in Europe, respectively. They also correspond to the pre-Mound Builders, Mound Builders, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Mayans in America.</p>

<p>Curious to hear if anyone else has read these books, and what there take on them is!</p>

<p>Lemuria was actually where Indonesia is that connected to Australia before water levels rose. It was called, Sundaland.</p>

<p>According to the most widely accepted theory, the ancestors of the modern-day Austronesian populations of the Malay archipelago and adjacent regions are believed to have migrated southward, from the East Asia mainland to Taiwan, and then to the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia. An alternative theory points to the now-submerged Sundaland as the possible cradle of Asian population: thus the &quot;Out of Sundaland&quot; theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the Biblical flood, and many other floods in our collective history have been caused by a 2nd star in our solar system, a dead black star passing through our inner solar system every few thousand years.  I also think that it&#39;s due to come back around soon, and that David Bowie hid its location on the vinyl version of his Blackstar album.  There is an image of a star field on it that was found some time after the album came out that can only be seen in UV light.  I also think that this is the biggest secret of all of the secret societies like the Freemasons, that they have kept from us &quot;profane&quot; for millenia.  Tubal-Cain is the password of the Master Mason and IMO alludes to this concept in an allegorical way.  Here&#39;s a link to an article that mentions the album Blackstar having more secrets to be revealed

<a href="http://hubblesite.org/image/1338/news_release/2003-15">http://hubblesite.org/image/1338/news_release/2003-15</a>
that we might be able to detect it in time to prepare for its inevitable return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this rabbit hole. The only thing keeping me from it is that such star would have been detected by its gravitational influence in the solar system. Objects as small as Pluto were derived/predicted from such gravitational irregularities using Newton&#39;s mechanics. Einstein&#39;s general relativity is even more precise.   The only way for such a black star to exist is if it is not a normal black star but an intelligent custom built one made by advanced extraterrestrial beings who possess mastery over gravity and matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not saying I believe it but it&#39;s theoretically possible to have a large planet (possible a burnt out star, idk for sure) that would orbit the sun in a crazy elliptical 10-100k+ year orbit. It&#39;s extremely hard for us to detect things by any means if they are not close to an active star. If it passed by earth close enough it would not need to be that big(or it could be big and pass further away) in order to completely fuck with our oceans and flood everything, eradicating most life... The moon is tiny and still has a crazy effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that due to its large orbit and far distance from our inner solar system, it would be very hard to detect until it gets much closer....I dont know how far away it might currently be but I do have reasons to think that sometime in the next few years it will be back.  I have tied a number of conspiracy theories together with this being a huge factor.  Think about how the Mayan calendar ended just a few years ago....it would make sense that their calculations would be off a bit....a small error would account for a few years on that kind of scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory on Atlantis:</p>

<p>According to what I&#39;ve read, it was supposed to be due West of the straight of Gibraltar and be around 230miles by 345 miles large (measured in stades). I forget where I read it, but it was also a few day boat ride to get there, which based on Roman boats, that would place it around the Portuguese Azores area. If you look in Google earth, there is a land mass of roughly 345 miles wide and 230miles tall.  The problem is that even if you account for a 400 ft rise in sea level, it still would be under water. </p>

<p>This is where a recent discovery helps us out. If you look into the pyramids found off the coast of Cuba, you will see a city that is 2000ft below sea level. You might ask why this matters. If you look at tectonic plates, this is on the edge between the north American plate and the plate right below. Guess what! The location of Atlantis in the azores is also on the edge of the tectonic plate between north america and the plate to the east. How could the whole ridge be raised you ask? Well it is like a boat on an ocean of magma with a huge iceberg on the northern side. When this was destroyed at the end of the ice age 10800 years ago (Thanks Graham Hancock), this caused the whole plate to level itself.  </p>

<p>Another item that coincides is the report of the circle nature of a portion of Atlantis. If you look on the eastern edge, you will see an old crater. If this was above water, it would have given Atlantis its shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite reads is Adam and Eve from The Urantia Papers. This I believe was the story of Atlantis or the First Garden of Eden that sunk beneath the waters.</p>

<p>Here is a snippet.</p>

<p>ADAM AND EVE arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago. It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the Jerusem personnel intrusted with the transportation of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the temple of the Universal Father. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of Adam and Eve was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world’s new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously. The Material Sons and Daughters always serve together. It is the essence of their service at all times and in all places never to be separated. They are designed to work in pairs; seldom do they function alone.<a href="https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-74-adam-and-eve">https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-74-adam-and-eve</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the theory that &#39;atlantis&#39; was either in the Mediterranean Sea or the Persian gulf. The Persian gulf is particularly interesting, because the book of Genesis describes Eden as the place where the euphrates and Tigris converge. If you consider that 10-20k years ago the oceans were low enough that the gulf would have been dry, then it would make sense for the first civilization to have started there. Then perhaps there was some rapid melting of ice which quickly raised ocean levels, perhaps even the release of massive lakes held back by ice dams, such as the one that stretched across North America in the Pacific Northwest. </p>

<p>The Mediterranean also could have had an ice dams in the strait of Gibraltar that released a tidal wave into the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone know about in depth research on Aboriginal Australian  memory sticks?  There is some mainstream work i heard about on the Mysterious Universe.  They had the author of the Memory Code, Lynne Kelly, as a guest and she mentioned some interesting things about the Aboriginal timeline.  She also mentioned that while there is no true written history there are sticks passed generation to generation that go back 10s of thousands of years.  </p>

<p>The book was a good start but it tries to take on too much in too little space.  I would like to find a good place to start to see if there is a connection between memory sticks, the French cave paintings, and imagery in the southwest United States.  </p>

<p>From what little in the way of decent sources I found I think there may be far better tangible evidence for a great civilization at least 50,000 years ago.  </p>

<p>I think that due to their isolation the Aboriginal history may be an outstanding resource.  Over time this has eroded, but not as much as say ancient African or Middle Eastern history.  The problem I have is a majority of easy to find material is written with the modern bias of written civilization being 6,000 years old.  </p>

<p>If anyone knows of anything specific to Australia that would help me get started I would appreciate it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One recommendation I have for people is to really dive into the second volume of H.P. Blavatsky&#39;s book <a href="http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm">&quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;</a>. That&#39;s where the foundation of the modern ideas of Lemuria etc. and much on Atlantis come from. There&#39;s been a lot of outgrowth of those ideas, some more fantastic than others, since Blavatsky, and not all is compatible with what she wrote.</p>

<p>The Secret Doctrine is one hell of a dense read, but worth it if you can stick with it. Volume 2 lays out the theosophical version of the history of humanity and is beyond interesting. Volume 1 lays out the theosophical view of cosmogony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you think the relation might be between the various species in the family Hominidae and the genus Homo, and what theosophy calls Root-Races and sub-races. Clearly there have been several major stages in the development of &quot;Man&quot; as we know it, and all a &quot;race&quot; means in theosophy is a &quot;stage of development&quot;. </p>

<p>But anyway, as Graham Hancock says, we&#39;re a species with amnesia. We seem to know next to nothing about our actual history and what was going on during the millions of years of big brained homo species. Perhaps major cataclysms are why we have so little knowledge or evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea. Though the idea that life began at the poles does make a certain amount of sense to me.</p>

<p>Tbh I&#39;d say anyone claiming they can <em>prove</em> or <em>know</em> much of anything about humanity prior to about 12,000 years ago is likely far over reaching. It&#39;s a sad state of affairs that we know so little, but we can speculate and try to put puzzle pieces together. May be that we&#39;ll never know for sure. </p>

<p>Interesting link. I need more time to watch. BTW the Omani at the end of the Arabian peninsula along the Indian ocean. Also had an empire that ranged from Southern Africa along uo the east coast to Ethiopia all the way to India and on to China as well for the spice trade. This started 1000 years BCE. They then stored the spices like Frankincense and Myrrh and other spices and traveled along the Frankincense trail to Egypt and Palestine to trade</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the perfect thing for this topic actually... a Canadian Atlantis (along with some other curious geo formations).</p>

<p>When I was browsing the global map, I saw a circular ring shaped land mass that reminded me a bit of the classic descriptions of Atlantis. The neat, circular design of the ring shape makes me think it was deliberately designed and could possibly be Atlantis or some other similar advanced city. I haven&#39;t seen this area discussed much by other people either... its a very odd, unnatural looking crater in Canada called Manicougan crater:</p>

<p>Wiki: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicouagan_Reservoir">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manicouagan_Reservoir</a>
Map: <a href="https://binged.it/2queJXi">https://binged.it/2queJXi</a></p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t seem like a natural formation to me cause comets/asteroids usually make craters at an angle (so oval/irregular shape) and usually cause a crater depression that would cause a pit that gets deeper toward the center, which would form a lake or something but this crater is a ring shape, where the land in the center is raised/normal instead of more caved in and a ring of water around it like a moat. </p>

<p>As I was doing more research I found out that it also has a dam to contain the water in the reservoir and was surprised to find out that I recognized it from something..... the Weapon X program in the Wolverine Origins movie! Its the same dam that wolverine was locked up in for mutant experiments, and I have seen that dam used in other movies/shows as well (usually in an ominous setting). </p>

<p>I actually think there is a real secret government base in there, along with some mysterious history to the location itself, which is what inspired those movie producers to include the dam in their films. It could be ancient atlantis that has been covered up to hide their technology and keep it secret, or an underground government base/bunker, or even something alien related where they used it as a stargate or visual marker and use the site for secret genetic testing. Could be a variety of things, but I just can&#39;t see it being a simple meteorite crater from what I see. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually considered making a road trip up there to check it out myself in person, esp that inner circle of the &quot;Eye of Quebec&quot;. I&#39;m sure exploring the area would be worth it regardless, prob find some ancient artifacts or meteorite rocks.... maybe get abducted and given mutant powers, or just plain abducted which would kinda suck lol. </p>

<p>I have always thought Canada has some secrets that haven&#39;t been discovered yet, or are intentionally being kept hidden. I find it interesting that they have such strict rules for crossing the border into Canada, so like people with a DUI or certain &quot;flags&quot; won&#39;t be allowed in... they&#39;re very selective. There is also tons of wild territory that has not been fully explored with only a few small settlements around. Most of the population of Canadians lives in the bottom 1/3 of the country, while the top 2/3 is wild Yukon territory that only the native inuit &quot;First Nations&quot; Indians live in.</p>

<p>First Nations and the &quot;Canadian Shield&quot; geographic area is another point too cause I think the First Nations tribes have a very ancient historical past in the north that isn&#39;t publicized much but shows up in their beliefs. With climate/pole shifts that whole northern arctic area could have been more habitable in the past like they say about antarctica. The whole Canadian shield area in general seems kinda odd to me too with its unique shield shape... you can tell that it used to be one land mass that was shattered into smaller pieces by meteorites. There is that theory about a huge meteorite that could have crashed and created the Hudson bay and then broke off into smaller pieces multiple times as it arced downward, making the great lakes and other smaller lakes in Midwest/east coast of US. Aside from that tho, there are other known meteorite sites up there that are mined for ore and even give off magnetic anomalies. Its just a strange area. </p>

<p>But yea... Canada has some interesting and mysterious features that I hope we will learn more about eventually. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These fucking jokes aren&#39;t even funny. Especially when real questions are asked. It just distracts from the conversation and people don&#39;t want to share and talk about what they were about to. Because instead of thought and discussion, it will be met with pointless memes.</p>

<p>Downvote me though, go ahead. Prove <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is filled with 14 year olds posting shit jokes for karma coming from <a href="/r/prequelmemes">/r/prequelmemes</a>. Pathetic really</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s theosophy (atleast the &quot;root race&quot; racist bullshit is, I exposed all that crap <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nho9k/if_you_want_to_know_what_the_elite_believe/">here</a>) and <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/LXwuPmJvamFy/">this movie</a> also does a very good job of explaining Theosophy</p>

<p>I do not dismiss or discount the possibility that what they are saying is true, but at the heart of the teachings lie some morally unacceptable things for me.</p>

<p>The most interesting of the theosophical teaching is how the &quot;6th&quot; root race will be born from the Brazilians (remember how &quot;we will all look Brazillian&quot;?), through a triumverate of the USA, Britain and Brazil (insane, I know, but watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWMw249xY8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1h22m5s">this time stamp</a> of the film from the thread I linked)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is pretty cool. I saw this thing on the discovery channel when I was a kid about some desert shrubs in Africa that can go a long time without water and then there was a dust storm that buried one of these shrubs under like 120foot sand dune in a day or two. if that much sand can dune up on a friggin shrub then the terrain can change dramatically in a few generations. if I remember correctly didn&#39;t they have to excavate some of the pyramids because they were literally buried in sand? who knows what else in under all that sand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something similar happened in Bulgaria, East Europe.</p>

<p>They have a town called Nessebar, that was sacked by the Turks and was a focal point of many wars between Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>

<p>This town is split into old and new Nessebar but they inhabit the same &#39;island&#39;. I can&#39;t remember what the proper term is, but it&#39;s one of those towns that is (well, was, they built a higher road a few years ago) only accessible when the tide is out.</p>

<p>A few years ago they were doing some renovation in the town centre when they uncovered ancient roman ruins(or ruins of the same time period) When you walk through the town, the tops of the ruins are only a few feet below street level and they have uncovered some amazing architecture.</p>

<p>So, I suppose it goes to show that ruins could be lost through various wars or just buried totally for whatever random reason shit ends up below the ground. More importantly, it shows that even in a busy town with a long history, secrets remain hidden just under the surface.</p>

<p>Who knows what we would find in mid Africa or Greece or Italy or...</p>
