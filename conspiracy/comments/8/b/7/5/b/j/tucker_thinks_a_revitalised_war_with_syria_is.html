<p>Submission statement: Tucker says there is really no proof that these suspiciously timed chemical weapon attacks that recently happened in syria. And even if they did happen, he describes the costs of a revitalized War in Syria. It&#39;s a good watch and he&#39;s asking the right questions. I originally found the video on 4chan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partisans have little to sense of comparing situations.</p>

<p>LBJ escalated Vietnam big time and he did it with a false incident. That&#39;s fair to say. But to blame &quot;the Democrats&quot; for Vietnam would be to miss how it started under Eisenhower (and Richard Nixon).</p>

<p>In fact, LBJ was working on peace in 1968. Richard Nixon went out of his way to sabotage the peace all the while telling people he would end Vietnam. A whole series of major assassinations occurred around this time, making it easier for Richard Nixon to get into the White House than his miserable 1960 try.</p>

<p>Once in the White House, Richard Nixon broke his promise in a complete about face (much like a certain White House occupant today), and &quot;widened&quot; the war. About half of the American deaths from Vietnam and its new expanded geography occurred under Richard Nixon. And here&#39;s something else: the Vietnam War never ended the whole time Richard Nixon was in -- the whole time!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Involvement in Vietnam started under Ike, the Vietnam War did not. The War started in 1964 with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave LBJ power to escalate the war without a formal declaration of war. </p>

<p>LBJ may have sought a way out of Vietnam in 1968 but South Vietnam did not agree with this and some speculate (including Nixon) that LBJ only floated peace to boost a fading HHH in the election. </p>

<p>Richard Nixon had to expand the war because the enemy was attacking from Cambodian sanctuaries. The US was throwing away lives in Vietnam because it was fighting with a hand tied behind its back. This is disingenuous to say the war never ended under Nixon. He deescalated the war, withdrew American boots on the ground, and ended the draft. </p>

<p>How carefully partisans parse their political correctness when it suits their purposes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which gave LBJ power to escalate the war </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How quickly partisans contradict themselves by saying first LBJ started the war then a few words later, LBJ escalated the war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LBJ may have sought a way out of Vietnam in 1968</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How easily partisans change a situation that happened into one that &quot;may&quot; have. There were extensive peace talks. That&#39;s not &quot;may.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>South Vietnam did not agree with this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/politics/nixon-tried-to-spoil-johnsons-vietnam-peace-talks-in-68-notes-show.html">some truth</a> in this, but here&#39;s why:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a telephone conversation with H. R. Haldeman, who would go on to become White House chief of staff, Nixon gave instructions that a friendly intermediary should keep “working on” South Vietnamese leaders to persuade them not to agree to a deal before the election, according to the notes, taken by Mr. Haldeman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a good idea for you to use that point to support your Dear Richard Nixon. It cuts against you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some speculate (including Nixon) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ROFL. &quot;Some&quot; including Nixon. Sounds like something Donald Trump would say: &quot;Some say [blah blah blah].&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because it was fighting with a hand tied behind its back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very famous propaganda, but as it turned out, Richar Nixon&#39;s expansion did not help achieve victory -- it merely prolonged the war and got tens of thousands more AMericans killed. It is amazing how deadly some base propaganda is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is disingenuous to say the war never ended under Nixon. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you go again with the political correctness, and worse yet, a sly accusation that the person you disagree with is a liar. Dirty tactic. Fact: the war did not end under Richard Nixon. It is true that he de-escalated it, but that was after he escalated it. Is that some major accomplishment or is it just the one-sided partisan view that you only notice the second part? And I&#39;m &quot;disingenuous&quot;? LOL</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and ended the draft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you ended it with a statement that is entire false. Talk to Mike Gravel about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>-There was no war until the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. LBJ started the war and escalated it into what it became. Placing military advisors is not a war. Placing combat troops on the battlefield is a war. </p>

<p>-LBJ halted bombing days before the election. It was a ploy to win the election, not end the war. South Vietnam did not agree with this therefore there would not be a meaningful peace regardless of what Nixon did. </p>

<p>-It didn&#39;t end the war because Nixon never went all the way. &quot;Duck Hook&quot;, which was abandoned by Nixon may have been but it was too drastic. Regardless, you can&#39;t allow enemies to attack you from sanctuaries and do nothing about it. Bombing Cambodia expanded the war but it was the best option at the time. </p>

<p>-Our involvement in the war was scaled down under Nixon. The American ground war was pretty much over in 1973. Combat troops were gone and we played a supporting role providing air cover and supplies. Which was successful until we abandoned it. </p>

<p>What did I say was false? Nixon ended the draft. Isn&#39;t that a historical fact?</p>

<p>Fox in general is infotainment of blondes talking conservative politics.</p>

<p>But Tucker is quite reasonable. Here is him calling John Bolton out on his bullshit.</p>

Then he spent a long while doing other stuff and not needing to grind out within a tight narrative and I think that he grew as a person.  Lately however I was really liking around the time he was upgraded into a better hour but then a bit later I noticed that he didn&#39;t seem very fresh anymore and was getting a tiny bit irate.  I can&#39;t say how he has been over the last 3 months or so since I&#39;m out of the country and there is no way I&#39;m watching that stuff if it doesn&#39;t come on with the push of a button (I stay with family when back in California).</p>

<p>The same way Republicans hid behind the &#39;opposition&#39; of the Tea Party in 2010 to retake the Congress. You do realize that the Congress has been controlled by Republicans all but four years since 1995, right? Congress is in Article I of the Constitution.

    <div class="md"><p>But isn&#39;t it crazy that the majority blindly jumped into a desire for action against <em>Iraq</em>? When Iraq was never proven to have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>I mean even if we ignore the very obvious shitshow that 9/11 was and how the official story stinks beyond belief to the point where probably at least half of the US doesn&#39;t believe it (I mean to me it almost seemed like they didn&#39;t even try to mask it was a false flag in any thorough, because the moment you start digging it&#39;s obvious pretty fast imho,almost like they wanted people to now), even if we ignore that, it seems people were OK with pretty much bombing any Middle Eatern country, as long as there was some supposed &quot;suspicion&quot; that there were some terrorists there.</p>

<p>People were totally led by their emotions and they were led and herded into those wars like sheep. Yeah, some protested and resisted, but many still supported the military campaigns in Iraq and elsewhere. </p>

<p>People were so easily duped that it frightens me what another attack of that scale could do. They could literally just create a false flag anywhere, pin it on the country they wish to attack and the people would support it. With new technology, the falsification of any evidence could be done even more easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common sense question.</p>

<p>Wtf is the US interested in Syria in the first place?</p>

<p>Yes, we see stories on the news about chemical attacks on civilians. But if you take a step back and ask yourself a few questions, things don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Lots of bad stuff happens to civilians in other countries all the time and nobody gives a fuck. So why is Syria different?</p>

<p>I saw another video on the BBC and it was the same thing. People washing off victims of a possible chemical attack... yet not one mask or pair of gloves in sights. Most of the &quot;victims&quot; were either children or very young. Weren&#39;t there any adult victims too?</p>

<p>It gave me the impression that whoever filmed this was aiming to make the maximum emotional impact on the viewer. Same old shit... problem, reaction, solution.</p>

<p>Problem is chemical attacks. Reaction is outrage. Solution is to start bombing Syrian forces and effect regime change.</p>

<p>Now if you&#39;ve followed along up to this point, ask yourself &quot;Why would the Assad government do the one thing that would justify (continued) outside intervention by a group of nations that have openly announced their preference for regime change? </p>

<p>This makes no sense and it make one conclude that the attacks are either fake... or they&#39;re real but it&#39;s a frame job.</p>

<p>Why get rid of Assad? One reason is so they can run a gas pipeline from the ME (Qatar?) to Europe. If you try and run north of Syria, you have to go through Turkey and I don&#39;t think Turkey is going to be &quot;on our side&quot; for much longer. Run south and the pipleine gets longer and more expensive to build, plus it would have to go through Israel. Maybe those gas-producing Arab nations don&#39;t like the idea of their natural gas making it&#39;s way to Europe through Israeli territory (and Israeli control)?</p>

<p>So there you go. Run the pipeline through Syria. Except you have to get rid of the current government because Assad is a Russian ally. That&#39;s a problem for the pipeline planners because they know that their natural gas will replace the Russian natural gas that Europe is using right now.</p>

<p>If Europe no longer needs Russian natural gas, they won&#39;t need Russia and Russia will lose out on one of it&#39;s biggest customers (and a lot of $$$).</p>

<p>So now you can see why everybody is so interested in Syria. The Syrians, Russians and even the Iranians want to keep things the way they are. The Israelis, Americans, maybe Turkey... and a number of  Middle Eastern nations would like to see Syria (and Iran) go down in ruins.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s about energy and geopolitics. Chemical attacks (real or otherwise) have absolutely zero to do with anything... except to engineer an attitude in the minds of the general public that a war in Syria would be justified.</p>

<p>This gets asked a lot and the answer is obvious to me. He&#39;s a ruthless dictator.  He and his family have a history of doing this kind of stuff. The civil war was kicked off when he tortured some kids to death that were at a peaceful protest. He drops barrel bombs on civilian areas with regularity. His father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Hama_massacre">leveled an entire city</a> that rebelled against him. This is what these guys do. To me the question is why anyone is surprised that he would do this.</p>

The same time a new american century was published afgan,Iraq,sudan and liyba have all had wars with the west this century. Iran and Korea I don&#39;t need to spell out! Trump went back on the arrangements with Cuba. This is all bigger then you could imagine the west is being out birthed it holds no place in the future this is the west death shit the east contains majority of the people on this earth. If the west doesn&#39;t take all that land now they will our future oppressors it sucks but I get it. At present were military stronger. But the fact all the people and raw materials are in the east means if our western nations want a secure future now is the time to take it. Rather then wait for it to take you. I only side with the west cos of how humanity is treated in the east they have the most oppressive governments in our world even after all the technological advances our global civilisation has seen. The west is by no means perfect. But they gave freedom of though and human riggts. Going doe them. This is jus my theory after wondering down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I think it would actually track through Syria and then undersea across the Mediterranean. This is just me guessing, but a likely place for the receiving terminal would be Italy. Why?</p>

<p>They&#39;re a stable EU member and they&#39;re not too far away from Syria.</p>

<p>could this possibly be in connection to one of the last biblical prophecies that have yet to come true? this video i stumbled upon wasn’t necessarily focused on syria but mentioned that the old testament had a bunch of prophecies that became true over hundreds of years with spot on time frame predictions originally quoted from the bible, and a particular one involving the complete obliteration of syria by israel which was supposedly the next prophecy due. </p>

<p>sorry i don’t have any links or bible verses to source and again, i’m probably the last guy to relate any biblical shit to anything going on but it was that damn video that immediately came to mind when i started reading all this syrian war shit today. idk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>English 101; When you make a remark on someone&#39;s argument you accept it as a factual statement. &quot;What a sad person to be President&quot; is a remark on someone&#39;s misinformation that suggests you incorrectly recognised it as a fact even if all you were doing was walking them through it.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re coming to a conspiracy sub and you&#39;re not looking to uncover facts previously not told to us then you either don&#39;t care enough or just treat conspiracy theories as some fun subject to ponder on like the meaning of life.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of a proper conspiracy theorist is to uncover hidden truths. Just talking about them because they are fun to talk about is a huge part of the problem in this sub, especially when people put across their beliefs as facts. It muddies the water and spreads misinformation which is why I told you not to accept it as facts. </p>

<p>A dictators son takes over and uses any means (gas attack) necessary to maintain power. It even has Isis in it too. </p>

<p>Watch that show and take in how deep the propaganda runs. We&#39;re talking news media, Hollywood, oscars, tv shows, twitter, Facebook and many others all working directly together to give us a completely false reality regarding Syria. </p>

<p>What we can agree on is that Syria is very important to their plan. Unfortunately Obama admin botched the initial run at Assad. It says a lot that even the blind Obama lovers hesitated to go back to war. </p>

<p>What we are seeing is the end of the system working overtime to hold power. Stay vigilant and stay positive. We can&#39;t let hate and propaganda force us into an irrational and emotional decision. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re coming to a conspiracy sub and you&#39;re not looking to uncover facts previously not told to us then you either don&#39;t care enough or just treat conspiracy theories as some fun subject to ponder on like the meaning of life.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of a proper conspiracy theorist is to uncover hidden truths. Just talking about them because they are fun to talk about is a huge part of the problem in this sub, especially when people put across their beliefs as facts. It muddies the water and spreads misinformation which is why I told you not to accept it as facts. </p>
