    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on this point- the elite practice the occult. From Bohemian Grove to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_secret_societies_in_North_America">hundreds of collegiate secret societies</a> they are tapped into, there’s something there... they aren’t into these rituals for shits and giggles. There’s something there.</p>

<p>An interesting lecture by former occultist <a href="https://m.youtube.com/results?q=mark%20passio%20dark%20occult&amp;amp;sm=1">Mark Passio</a> explained how the elite know ways to manipulate and influence things through rituals and focused will, intent.</p>

<p>Or the societies are just an excuse for secrecy, debauchery and to breed sociopathic behavior. Maybe a bit of both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! that quote is <em>very</em> interesting. For those not aware, this is creepy occult “artist” Marina Abrajmavic’s quote  from her Reddit AMA:</p>

<p><strong>Question: “Marina! What place do you see the occult having within contemporary art; can magick be made (not simply appropriated/ performed)? Thanks, K”</strong></p>

<p><em>Answer: “Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.”</em></p>

<p>There it is, <em>intent</em>... <em>context</em>... very interesting, especially when your bizarre tunnel ceremony is  considered. Great example of this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Here is Mark Passio’s famous lecture on 911, where he breaks down the symbols and numbers used for that occult ritual:</p>

<p>You don’t need to believe that it “works” (not sure what that would even entail) in order to realize others do. Most importantly, those who are claiming the right to rule over you are superstitious freaks who use numerology all the time. Their purpose is to give their deed more strength/power by imitating nature, by introducing numbers that would naturally arise (as synchronicities) if their deeds were “blessed” (imitating nature is a key precept of hermetic/occult philosophy, it is the same reason a builder might introduce Pi or Phi in his edifice’s dimensions).</p>

<p>Again: you don’t need to be superstitious yourself in order to understand (and try reverse engineering) the superstition of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proof of what exactly?</p>

<p>Do you understand the subtle difference I laid out above?</p>

<p>Do you think it is necessary to be a devout Christian in order to study Christianity? Or that you need to pray seven times a day towards Mecca in order to understand Islam, its cosmogony and values?</p>

<p>Here is another suggestion for you. Study your emotion when you read my comments. Try analyzing your hostility. What compelled you to write your answer in such a manner? It’s not like the “you will find phi in a kitchen stool” argument (of which you proposed a variant) is unknown or original.</p>

<p>Again: this is not about <em>believing</em> in numerology. It is about <em>observing</em> that others do. It is really not difficult once you get past the emotion about how stupid it is. Yes the central planners are stupid.</p>

<p>Numerology doesn&#39;t fit either of those things. No one is hiding it. No one is plotting with it... It&#39;s essentially a new-age religion founded on nothing what-so-ever... Some loose ties to Gematria... That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know shit about it. But dismissing something out of hand and requiring diffinitive proof to even aknowledge its existence as a conspiracy is, quite frankly, laughable on a conspiracy subreddit. </p>

<p>The whole point is that people post and discuss this exact type of content (not just trump bullshit). Anyone trying to gatekeep needs to get their priorities in check. Numerology has been discussed on conspiracy forums since before I looked at my first one over a decade ago (I never really bought into them I just like seeing what other people say/alternative views I didnt really get into conspiracies being true until haarp..ignoring 911 thats obviously not as the official story says)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a theory BTW.</p>

<p>You just made three conclusions. </p>

<p>1) Magic is real. NO propositions or argument here - not a theory.</p>

<p>2) Elites practice magic. No citations or proof. We all know this though. . . </p>

<p>3) This &#39;not theory&#39; is not to far out for people here.</p>

<p>You did not describe the magic, you did not describe the elites, the how or why, when or who. then you assumed the board agrees - anyone watching youtube videos thinks the same thing. . . </p>

<p>Also, the word is &#39;magick&#39; was just Alister Crowley&#39;s way of being edgy; De Occulta Philosophia was the first use of the term in that spelling, and is a foreign language from English. </p>

<p>The word is &#39;magic&#39; in English. </p>

<p>No, most people today consider &quot;magic&quot; to be David Blaine or Chris Angel. Card tricks, cutting women in half, etc;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, I use magick to differentiate the difference between those who perform tricks and those who perform actual attempts at ritual magick. I am introducing this concept to others who may not be familiar.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m using the definition as it has already been defined by others before me. You are the one getting pedantic and seeking to discredit it because it is not in the dictionary.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Most people don&#39;t believe real magick even exists, you are giving far too much credit. It is, again, important to denote this difference, and introduce this concept to the broader conversation.</p>

<blockquote>

It was called a &#39;fool&#39; (Fol).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I am using the word to introduce a broader audience to the concept of the differentiation between magic and magick, because it is a real difference, and an important concept for people to understand. </p>

Basically, they could only enforce a very limited set of basic laws outlined by the constitution. They would enforce the law against those who violate the &quot;Non-aggression Principle.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree,</p>

<p>Although, I think an education into liberalism and its merits/problems are needed before saying this and meaning it in a bad way.</p>

<p>IN that, the chains of good government are equally weighted by those that want to equally wear them. That&#39;s Rousseau in &#39;the social contract&#39;. </p>

<p>Government does have a right to exist, if people want rights representative of systemic civil organizations. People wear the weight of their chosen or structured government for the sole purpose of those rights respected, or come time to be respected.</p>

<p>I fear a place without rights of any sort, more than a place with rights and order, civil services and taxation. </p>

<p>Why?  </p>

<p>I have been to the places without rights, and you carry a gun and shoot it in protection more than some &#39;evil USA/Europe&#39;.</p>

<p>You might hate rights, but how about a world where people dont even consider you as a moral consideration, because it was only &#39;laws&#39; (limits) brought upon by &#39;rights&#39;(guarantees), that brought consistence to actions that ruin lives within a society; thus goes the society if goes the individuals who make it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Rights don&#39;t come from the state, they are inherent in each individual and collective to the extent each can exercise their rights. The state is a compromise of sorts, a contract in which members of society give up claims to certain rights in order that other rights are protected. </p>

<p>For example, as a citizen of the US I give up my claim to the right of keeping the full fruits of my labor, in that I am compelled at the peril of my life and my liberty to pay tribute to the state as a percentage of the fruits of my labor. Ostensibly, this compromise is in my interest, in the interest of other citizens, and in the interest of the collective. In practice, I find the tendency of all states is to inexorably make illegitimate more claims to rights of their citizens. </p>

<p>For instance, I have a natural right to put anything I want into my body. This hurts no one but myself, and denies no one else of their life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness. The state has claimed the right to deny me this right. There are certain things the state says I may not put into my body, and if I defy the state, the state will deny me my liberty or my life. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might hate rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t hate rights; I seek to understand what they are and maximize the rights of all sentient beings. I think states (which are coercive by definition) are one of the worst technologies for actually accomplishing this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;rights&#39;(guarantees)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rights are not guarantees, they are claims for actions that we may decide to make. The state does not <em>give</em> us rights, at most it can recognize our rights and limit it&#39;s power in denying us our right. The 1st amendment does not give us the right to free speech, it limits the coercive action the state may take to deny us that right (in theory; practice is much different). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think nuclear power is real, and probably is more useful than we&#39;re being told. Otherwise the entire USA navy wouldn&#39;t run on it. If you look into the history of nuclear reactors they are only dangerous when made on large scale. Corporations legit set out to create the largest reactors possible to make them dangerous in hopes of accidents to scare the public from their use. But the military uses small scale reactors non-stop. It&#39;s to control the energy market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USA military spent more money developing nuclear weapons during the second world war, if they failed would they admit it? All that tax payer money down the tube? You should check out all the photos of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and compare them to the fire-bombing photos of Berlin and Tokyo. They just fire bombed those cities and claimed that the &quot;Atomic bombs&quot; were a success. There is no dangerous radiation in those cities. My buddy who lives in Japan has gone there and shown me photos &amp; videos. In my opinion they did this for multiple reasons. 1.) To hide the military spending blunder, which does not just pertain to nuclear weapons. The Pentagon in general has consistent lost and had trillions vanish over the years with zero accountability. 2.) To create a &quot;Cold War&#39;&#39; so the war profiteering would not end at the the conclusion of the Second World War. 3.) To scare the USSR because even in the main stream history it has been admitted there was a very real scare of the USSR just steamrolling past Berlin, conquering all of Europe and Asia. 4.) When Russia found out they also faked their nuclear weapons and America was put in a position to either, admit the lie or play it out. They played it out. And honestly the lie benefited both the USSR and the American military industries. That is why the military virtually never talks about the production or use of nuclear weapons very often. Once in a while they&#39;ll bring it up to put some steam back in their bullshit. 5.) They can use the lie as a pretext to invade any countries trying to produce nuclear energy.</p>

<p>The MOAB is probably, in my research is the best case of &quot;Fake it until you make it.&quot; There are also directed energy weapons and EM-rail guns the USA have now so the concept of &quot;super bombs&quot; is no longer required to project power. They can easily make nuclear weapons that poison people, like they did with the depleted uranium rounds. I just don&#39;t think they were ever able to produce the explosive potential the scientists claimed they could when they got that blank check of infinity money from the Pentagon. Now ICBM are very real and just because nuclear warheads are not real imo does not mean those missiles still are not WMD. The ability to launch massive missile strikes, even with ordinary ordnance is still scary af. I think many Americans don&#39;t realize that their governments most powerful weapon has always been DECEPTION and control over the international energy markets.</p>

<p>Also, The &#39;mind&#39; is not real in your definition.</p>

<p>Yet, all people agree, there is a mind active and thinking in non-deterministic ways. That the creations of a mind are experiences unique to it, and that those projections of EVERYTHING around you are not actually &#39;real&#39;, as they appear to you in a functionalist way.</p>

<p>That you can think about other times outside your space-time occupation. That you can create new concepts into &#39;real&#39; things you never seen before.. .</p>

<p>There is the subjective-projected world, that you assume is real enough not to jump into traffic or go weeks without eating, to abide by, because that projection is all you actually know.</p>

<p>Then, you want to tell us, the constructs of a government are not real?</p>

<p>Is language real? Is words on a paper meaning something real?</p>

<p>what about hypnosis? Is a subliminal mind with (un/sub)conscious real?</p>

<p>I think you need the word &quot;Impression&quot;, in which the entire world is one.</p>

<p>If the impression can kill you, it&#39;s real enough.</p>

<p>If the impression can imprison you, it&#39;s real to enough people enough to be real enough in consequence to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im pretty sure you tired to tell me how hypnosis works in no concise or specific way outside generalized babble, before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;perception is virtual action&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, perception is projection. You can perceive things and not act. Unless you are literally an impulse machine with no physical control, and then are a semi-philosophical zombie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Govt is a body technology as an extension of our body&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>what the fuck does this mean, carl?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you aren&#39;t able to perceive it, it&#39;s because you don&#39;t comprehend how to use it for action</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, &quot;what&#39;s it&quot;. You have yet to define It as a thing you know about. It&#39;s like saying things fall when you drop them, and you know how, but dont want to say &#39;gravity&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is big part of the hypnosis game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<p>The big part of the &#39;hypnosis game&#39;, is the fact it&#39;s a process of attention of state. It&#39;s a process of authority or critical faculty regard.</p>

<p>There is no game. Persuasion and means to &#39;brainwash&#39; people with commercials, called &#39;social engineering&#39; is not hypnosis. </p>

<p>Unless you just use terms to mean whatever the hell you wish. yet, the language is useless unless spoken to be understood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a problem with scale-hypnosis.</p>

<p>Everything is connected in some abstract and barely definable way, once you go up the scale of conceptual category and relationship.</p>

<p>For example: whats more encapsulating than the word &#39;universe&#39;?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the grand unified concept in your mind to associate and understand any limit of &#39;everything&#39;, even if you can go higher; there will always be a limit to your conceptualization of &#39;all things&#39;.</p>

<p>That being said, a conspiracy is like a murder case. It&#39;s all the little parts directly leading to a large RICO. You get the little parts through the drivers and food handlers, so that the big-pieces, in time, have to explain themselves.  </p>

<p>The only goal that makes sense there is unification of the underlying communities in a peaceful way. I assume we have been trying in an elliptical manner to achieve that - reconciliation between both Israelis and Arabs, and between Shiites and Sunnis - on the assumption quantity X blood must be spilt before it happens. Presumably someone thought 9/11 would help. Let&#39;s let them all explain their reasoning, settle up, and get on with the end-game of a civil society that works for the cradle of civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could careless about ‘evidence’ since there is only evidence to support the indoctrination of western ideals. I prefer to look at things through the lens of logic. I’ve seen Saturns rings with my own two eyes, I don’t believe planets are flat but do I believe ‘they’ withholding the truth from us? Obviously. Even in ancient Sumerian and Egyptian cultures there is no sign of “flat earth.” From my “research” all I’ve found is flat earth is merely symbolic for questioning the establishment. As for dinosaurs I’ve been to the site in Montana where they are digging one up (look into it yourself). Atleast you understand evolution is just a theory but to say dinosaurs is a theory? That’s very myopic of you, the two arnt suppose to be correlated. There’s a past we arnt told about, for example we were probably genetically altered by a far advanced race such as the Anunnaki. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finding bones in the ground doesn&#39;t mean dinosaurs as commonly described existed, seeing lights in the sky, or a ring around a light, doesn&#39;t mean the earth is a ball. I&#39;m not denying some of those observations, I am not going along with the stories that accompany them. I have, along with many others, believed in aliens and genetic altering of our DNA by aliens, the number of horizontally transferred genes in our DNA is unlike any other species and that is very interesting. The Sumerians and Egyptians, like pretty much all ancient cultures believed in a flat earth, there is ample evidence for it, try actually researching and not &quot;researching&quot; lol... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well from my understanding older cultures that believed the earth was flat also believed it was square or had four corners.

    <div class="md"><p>It is of course far fetched, but essentially seeing lights or things in the sky isn&#39;t actually direct empirical evidence that we can go into outer space. You can overcome gravity with a little hop, or a butterfly batting it&#39;s wings, but somehow at the same time you must achieve escape velocity going sideways at an insane speed to get into outer space, you can&#39;t just go up keep going up.

    <div class="md"><p>Im really into simulation theory but the conclusion I came to is at the end of the day it doesnt matter. </p>

<p>Right now we use super computers to model the climate, model nuclear interactions and more importantly we are modeling the subatomic. </p>

<p>What happens when we eventually build a computer to model every subatomic interaction with a universes worth of matter? Basically if we can model every subatomic interaction with the start of the big bang that model would be indistinguishable from a non simulated universe. </p>

<p>The interesting part is if we (Or anyone in the universe) makes this computer whats stopping the simulated universe from running their own simulations?</p>

<p>As soon as you turn on this universe sim youve created an infinite number of universes indistinguishable from a real one. </p>

Yeah you could strive to be that one person you wanna be in life or have that one career job that you think is special but it’s ultimately meaningless. You’ll die and reincarnated and have new desires and wishes and you’ll probably fulfill those two.

<p>The elite know that another extinction level event is coming but they have to stay alive long enough to get through it. Secret societies maintain this knowledge for the top level people. The last ELE was c12800 years ago and wiped out what we call Atlantis and possibly the one before that. The survivors knew another was was coming and setup stone monuments around the world to both track and warn of this threat but we are unable to decode them correctly and think they are just ceremonial sites or burial mounds.</p>

<p>The elite kidnap children and harvest their pineal glands for increased mental abilities and a longer life because they are waiting for the off-world colonies to be built and become fully operational. It&#39;s why so much is spent on space exploration and not solving earthly problems like hunger, poverty etc - it simply doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>They perform magick to shape the world around them to hide their activities. The pineal gland helps them interact and shape the world when enough concentration from the right minds is applied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earth is constantly going through phases of sea level rise and fall. This is due to the warming and freezing of the polar ice caps and the freezing is caused by any number of things. This has been happening for millions of years and will continue to happen until earth loses its atmosphere and dries up. Right now the ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, never seen before because of man kind polluting the earth and destroying the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Were literally going through an extinction period right now, 90% of the animals have gone extinct in the last few thousand years and continue to go extinct, again at an alarming rate, because of man. My college professor told me last quarter were coming up with a new &quot;extinction period&quot; (were currently in the holocene). So even if the elitists decide to leave and go to space it would be likely that the earth would be uninhabitable for thousands if not millions of years and if they returned they&#39;d be dealing with completely different types of flora and fauna than we have now. Or we might be 100% under water. Or we could go back to our precambrain years (4.6 billion years ago) and literally be just a giant ball of volcanoes and fire if the atmosphere is destroyed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My variation: they know that Strong AI will come into existence soon and are racing to take over before it gets here.</p>

<p>Many experts believe we will have computers with the complexity of the human mind by mid-century. If such a computer were sentient, it would already be leagues smarter than a human due to processor speeds. If it were able to improve itself, it may be able to quickly surpass us thousands of times over.</p>

<p>Even if we all agree publicly not to work towards such a thing, someone may secretly do so. So the only way to guarantee it never comes into existence is to &quot;end&quot; the world, after they let tech develop to enough of a place that they themselves at least have mind uploading or enhancing tech or something similar</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well you got me thinking having never really considering the possibility that plato is made up. happy to hear more. i just think it&#39;s unlikely that ancient greeks had the ability to create a charater that is so utterly real, utterly convincing, with limited source material or historical models for that kind of character creation. greek plays that had socrates as a character for example, depict him as fairly one dimensional despite the complex works we now read that involve him. jesus is probably made up, lots of people believe he existed, and the evidence and his characterization in the bible is even weaker.</p>

<p>Retrofitting a manufactured historical record to support a particular narrative (or to hide other inconvenient truths) would be a good way to control the past, and therefore the present, and therefore the future ... right?</p>

<p>Of course, this implies centralised authorities would be required to ensure the &#39;right&#39; history stays in the record, and the &#39;wrong&#39; history is expunged, ignored or ridiculed into oblivion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Backstory: I love Browning&#39;s poems, and years ago, I wanted to understand one called Porphyria&#39;s Lover. I looked into it, and found the disease in the poem, porphyria, or the Royal Disease, has a huge incidence among Ashkenazi Jews, as do a <em>huge</em> number of other <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x3JqCFB.png">genetic disorders</a>. The historic cure for porphyria was <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/born-to-the-purple-the-st/">drinking blood</a>. From there, I found this disease called Tay-Sachs which only affects them, and there is no cure, but thought nothing of it.</p>

<p>Years after finding that, I read a novel that had a character with Tay-Sachs, who was taken from her family to be with people who cured her with blood, and it was written in a way that I have come to associate with hidden meaning - not to mention the link between porphyria, blood drinking, and Tay-Sachs - so I looked in earnest in to Tay-Sachs, and it turns out that there <em>is</em> a cure, only to be found in Israel, and the kids who are diagnosed with the disease are taken from their families to Israel to get treatment. It&#39;s hard as hell to find what that treatment is, but.... <a href="https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/chasing-a-cure-for-tay-sachs/article_1c2aaaff-aa4d-55f8-8584-99e5111d5805.html">It&#39;s blood</a>. It has been cured with a transfusion of pure umbilical blood, a full replacement of all blood within the child, though historically, it was done through, again, <em>bibens sanguinum</em> (which is the Hebrew translation of the word <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DkDFec14veQC&amp;amp;pg=PA160&amp;amp;lpg=PA160&amp;amp;dq=bibens+sanguinum&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=XKt7cBYKUp&amp;amp;sig=JeE-UgMfKO-vP_yBJEM5ZurW2Xo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN55vA5IjWAhXox4MKHQpLCPUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=bibens%20sanguinum&amp;amp;f=true">&quot;Damascus&quot;</a>, because it was where Cain slayed Abel), or literally, drinking blood, done every so often. This has been a <a href="https://archive.org/details/EustaceMullins-TheCurseOfCanaanADemonologyOfHistory1987">theme</a> since Canaanites came into existence.</p>

<p>Ok so, yeah, I&#39;m a crazy person, right? I have to be making this up, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vp3crcQ.jpg">no one else in history</a> might have stumbled upon this imagined trail of bread crumbs. Turns out that the time in which Jews migrated to Europe, there also happened to arise the mythos of vampirism. You can escape a vampire if you drop a coin on the ground. Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula was a Jew. Elizabeth Bathory was a Jew. Israel <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dOYY8gF.png">spends 1% of it&#39;s GDP on blood</a>. Motzah balls, traditional ones served at passover, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/H9MmaFr.jpg">call for the blood of gentile children</a>, and it is a well-kept secret that this practice continues in <a href="https://youtu.be/b98ch_Pyi-Y">some circles today</a>. Hemophilia (love of blood) is a typically Ashkenazi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030906102702/http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org:80/what/ashkenazi/factor.asp">disease</a> (Factor XI deficiency).</p>

<p>Speaking of, look at Marina Abramovic, the Spirit Cooking lady. She&#39;s fucking <em>70</em>. She is quite obviously a Jew, but her wikipedia page has been scrubbed of any mention of her heritage, though it still lists it in <a href="https://voat.co/v/politics/1389732">search engines</a></p>

<p>From there, I found out about &quot;blood libel&quot; and that Ashkenazi Jews have been responsible for the Jews expulsion from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/COeg4Q7.png">350+</a> nations over the past few hundred years. 100+ of those were for <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4XApL7z.png">blood rituals</a> involving the murder of gentile male Christian children under the age of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DdYf4Wp.jpg">7</a> (NSFL)................................. Here&#39;s a <em>very</em> suppressed <a href="http://www.israelshamir.net/BLOODPASSOVER.pdf">book</a>, written by a Rabbi, chronicling the history of Jewish blood ritual. </p>

<p>We see this same well-documented pattern of blood ritual continue in modern times under the name &quot;piazzagate&quot;, but did you know about the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; of the late 80s which exposed crimes which are functionally identical to both Pizzagate and the history of Jewish blood ritual? <a href="https://youtu.be/2p2Pp2ywHuU?t=837YouTube">https://youtu.be/2p2Pp2ywHuU?t=837YouTube</a> The reason why they say nothing ever came of the Satanic Panic was that there were never any &quot;proven cases&quot;, but I have linked for you in the text above exhaustive and methodologically rigorous histories of proven cases throughout time. The only reason they aren&#39;t spoken of more readily is that every proven case has involved Jews.</p>

<p>People in my day to day know me as something of a research buff, whatever the name for that is, and you might know of some of my other work, like the link between Edward Bernays, Henry Miller, and the sexualization of the word &quot;boob&quot; being fostered in order to save the then new TV industry from the term &quot;boob tube&quot;, yet, for all the same rigor I applied to this bit of Jewish historical trivia, for some reason, I am attacked when I share it. </p>

<p>Great research, I’ve encountered many of these sources before but the effort you put into compiling them is impressive. </p>

<p>As I said in another comment, blood libel isn’t a normal thing Jewish people do- it’s a ritual that most Jews aren’t remotely aware of, yet the it lives today. Just wanted to draw that distinction for the normies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not the ones I&#39;m friends with, but I definitely know of ones who do put on shows for politicians and industry elites. And they hold Abramovic in reverence because she&#39;s one of the most famous artists in the world, and everyone likes to think they &quot;get it&quot;, so they basically force themselves to like her shit and put her on this pedestal. It&#39;s really ludicrous to think she&#39;s involved in some blood sacrifice/rituals, when her art is very tame compared to other performance artists out there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ludicrous to think she could be involved, because a lot of other artists have raised the bar on perverse performances?</p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but surely you can see why that&#39;s not exactly a solid argument. If anything, is that not evidence of her (and other older artists in the &quot;sacrifice/ritual&quot; field) influence, and just how much society has changed in a pretty short span of time?</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s just a product of my environment, I&#39;ve lived in NY my whole life so these shows are nothing to me. This shit goes on a lot, and it&#39;s always just weird artists trying to make shock statements.</p>

<p>Society changed independently of Abramovic. Technology made it so that &quot;art&quot; like hers spread to a much wider audience, and also it desensitized society so that we&#39;re more accepting of art like hers. But that wasn&#39;t because of Abramovic, rather it was the media, Hollywood, politicians, etc, who are ok with blasting graphic images across the airwaves all day long. I just think its crazy how I&#39;ll see people on this sub and elsewhere get all up in arms about Abramovic&#39;s and other&#39;s art being &quot;blood rituals&quot;, but most of those same people have no problem with extremely violent video games and movies, and seeing graphic war images on the news and internet.</p>

<p>Plus, the OP we&#39;re responding to here made a pretty anti-semitic post, and it seems like their gripe with Abramovic is more about her religion than her &quot;art&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I know a fair amount  about Ambramovic, Bernays, Miller, etc.. It&#39;s because of that that I can&#39;t take this particularly seriously.</p>

<p>Never  believe  that  anti‐Semites  are  completely  unaware  of  the  absurdity  of  their replies.  They know  that  their remarks are  frivolous, open to  challenge.   But  they  are  amusing  themselves,  for  it  is their  adversary  who  is  obliged  to  use  words  responsibly, since he believes in words.  The antisemites have the right to play.  They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons,  they  discredit  the  seriousness  of  their interlocutors.  They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and  disconcert.   If  you  press  them  too  closely,  they  will abruptly  fall  silent,  loftily  indicating  by  some  phrase  that the time for argument is past.  </p>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If then, as we have been able to observe, the anti‐Semite is impervious  to  reason  and  to  experience, it is  not  because his  conviction  is  strong.   Rather  his  conviction  is  strong because he has chosen first of all to be impervious.  He  has  chosen  also  to  be  terrifying.   People  are  afraid  of irritating  him.   No  one  knows  to  what  lengths  the aberrations of his passion will carry him  —  but be knows, for this passion is not provoked by something external.  He has it well in hand; it is obedient to his will: now he lets go of  the  reins  and  now  he  pulls  back  on  them.   He  is  not afraid  of  himself,  but  he  sees  in the  eyes  of  others  a disquieting  image‐his  own‐and  he  makes  his  words  and gestures  conform  to  it.   Having  this  external model,  he  is under  no  necessity  to  look  for  his  personality  within himself.   He  has  chosen  to  find  his  being  entirely outside himself, never to look within, to be nothing save the fear he inspires in others.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The  anti‐Semite  readily  admits  that  the  Jew  is  intelligent and hard‐working; he will even confess himself inferior in these  respects.   This  concession  costs  him  nothing,  for  he has,  as  it  were,  put  those  qualities  in  parentheses.   Or rather they derive their value from the one who possesses them: the more virtues the Jew has the more dangerous he will be.  The anti‐Semite has no illusions about what he is.  He  considers  himself  an  average  man,  modestly  average, basically  mediocre.   There  is  no  example  of  an  anti‐Semite&#39;s claiming individual superiority over the Jews.  But you must not think that he is ashamed of his mediocrity; he takes pleasure in it; I will even assert that he has chosen it.  This man fears every kind of solitariness, that of the genius as  much  as  that  of  the  murderer;  he  is  the  man  of  the crowd.   However  small  his  stature,  he  takes  every precaution  to  make  it  smaller,  lest  he  stand  out  from  the herd  and  find  himself  face  to  face  with  himself.   He  has made himself an anti‐Semite because that is something one cannot be alone.  The phrase, &quot;I hate the  Jews,&quot; is one that is  uttered  in  chorus;  in  pronouncing  it,  one  attaches himself to a tradition and to a community  —  the tradition and community of the mediocre.</p>

It&#39;s not an easy discussion to have but it&#39;s the high road in this situation. You&#39;ve only given readers more reasons to feel divisive on the issue by responding as you have.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, yes, the Khazarians. 23andme linked the Ashkenazi to the Khazars by DNA, rendering Israel&#39;s claim to their nation moot as they are comprised of about 74% Ashkenazi. They then hired a team of geneticists to lie and say whoopsies DNA is wrong lol</p>

<p>They were the Babylonian blood ritualists who then converted to Judaism at the behest of a Russian king, which he only forced upon them after they had developed a reputation for the things we now call &quot;anti-semitic&quot;, like usurious loan practices, killing merchants on the road and assuming their identity, and the ever-present blood ritual.. They are the ones who wrote the Talmud - the book that says taking a ladder from a &quot;Goyim&quot; while he is in a hole isn&#39;t murder - and perverted the religion into what it is mostly known for today. </p>

<p>I had an excellent resource on this but I can&#39;t seem to find it.. If I do, I&#39;ll update this and PM you the book. </p>

<p>Hey now, let&#39;s be honest: You&#39;re not being a very open-minded Ashkenazi. You&#39;re choosing to behave as a combative and defensive Ashkenazi who sees a well-sourced and meticulously presented history of her people and attacks the weakest point (she can see) so that she can dismiss the whole argument lol no worries though. It&#39;s natural; I don&#39;t begrudge you :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fantompowa.info/13th%20Tribe.pdf">http://www.fantompowa.info/13th%20Tribe.pdf</a></p>

<p>The man&#39;s name was Arthur Koestler, the book is called The 13th Tribe. There is also another book written by Kevin Alan Brook, but you&#39;ll have to buy a copy if you&#39;d like to read it. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jews-Khazaria-Kevin-Alan-Brook/dp/074254981X">https://www.amazon.com/Jews-Khazaria-Kevin-Alan-Brook/dp/074254981X</a>   Rutgers University Professor Peter Golden, referred to by Brook as &quot;one of the principal authorities on the Khazars&quot;, so you don&#39;t even have to wonder if it&#39;s all anti-semitic lol</p>

<p>Here is a report given by a very successful Jewish defector named Benjamin Freedman on the same topic, though much less academic in presentation, and much closer to what you would probably call &quot;anti-semitic&quot;. <a href="http://www.apfn.org/THEWINDS/library/freedman.html">http://www.apfn.org/THEWINDS/library/freedman.html</a></p>

<p>I have more if you&#39;re sincerely interested in learning about this, but as I linked a total of 600+ pages of reference material in the body of the main post, to which you seemingly scoffed at and dismissed, I suspect you didn&#39;t ask for a source so that you might learn from it but so that you might again seek said weaknesses and then attack it. It honestly is alright, if so. I tend to learn quite a lot by arguing with people who choose to behave as you do, and a part of me sincerely does thank you for showing me where I need to bolster my claims. </p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all Ashkenazi, or even most, who drink blood and have created a warped inversion of their faith to compensate. Your fam and you are probably pretty average Jews, if I can judge from how you&#39;ve been here today. </p>

<p>All the best!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Wow this got long, but I promise you it will be interesting!</p>

<p>I&#39;m also sort of Ashkenazi by heritage, at least, 25%, but I identify with the other 75% of my generally European ancestry. </p>

<p>As far as spirituality, I&#39;m self-taught? I dunno, I saw that every religion is full of its own kind of stupid, so I was one of those combative anti-theists back in the day, but I really like hidden things, so naturally I gravitated to esoteric/occulted metaphysics (not like witch bunk style occult, but like literal &quot;things which are hidden&quot; occult in the vein of Rudolph Steiner, Many P. Hall, those types of people) and cosmologies. After a good few years of doing not much else but studying purist doctrines on various religions, and comparing them, I came to the conclusion that all religions must serve multiple functions in order to survive. </p>

<p>For instance, did you know that nations wherein Buddhism is practiced as a state religion, there exists a concept of heaven and hell, though of course there is no heaven or hell in puristic Buddhism? The same is true of Christianity in places where it is the state religion. My own personal theory as to why is that heaven and hell better facilitates class-based cultures, because, 1, they are unfair in a broad sense, and 2, because it allows those who are mistreated to look into the eyes of those who mistreat them and imagine them burning in a fire which the &quot;master&quot; himself may know he will never feel: It prevents uprisings by allowing the peasant class to feel their battle is already won. </p>

<p>From the heaven/hell stage, all religions can then serve an initiate in a quest for metaphysical truth. I should say, I use <em>metaphysics</em> very specifically in that <em>meta</em>=self-referencing, <em>physics</em>=aspects of motion, i.e., <em>metaphysics</em>=the study of motion within the self, using the self as the only measure. So, in that stage, you will find the serious theosophists who both love and enjoy studying the practicable aspects of the core tenets of their religion. Most Jews I&#39;ve known who practice their religion as a spiritual endeavor are in this stage, but they are few in comparison to irreligious ones, it seems.</p>

<p>From the metaphysical stage, very few progress to the next, which I loosely call the cosmological stage wherein the elimination of dogma is the main goal. I think that most don&#39;t get to this point because it requires serious dedication and a willingness/ability to unlearn a great deal and then proceed to learn using only metaphysics as a guide. The people in this stage are who we call &quot;masters&quot;. They tend to speak in what seems riddles, and their words shape the minds of great men, such as Newton crediting his discoveries to Hermes Trismegistus and his axioms found in the Emerald Tablet, or how Wernher Von Braun regularly quoted and was influenced by masters of the Vedantic religions. </p>

<p>I never got to the point that I removed myself from dogma until I could understand it from without, which is what is called <em>gnosis</em>, or, &quot;illumination&quot;, as opposed to sublimated divinity, or, &quot;enlightenment&quot;. I thank Nassim Haramein and his work for this. To make a long story short, the energy density of a proton when accounting for spin is the exact energy density of the observable universe. There is much much more to both his theories and the resulting cosmology, but that was the &quot;proof&quot; that I needed, such as it is. It tied in with a great many other seemingly disparate sources as well, such as the metaphor of Indra&#39;s Net wherein a jewel is fixed in the center of every eyelet of a net such that the facets reflect every other Jewel in the net: Everything is intrinsically, mathematically, <strong>one</strong>, and separation is only an illusion. I&#39;m sure that that rings true in some way, because most religions at their cores keep it as a tenet. </p>

<p>This understanding was further bolstered as I gained experience in practicing various forms of metaphysical experiments, especially so after I read and digested the work of the men behind the CIA&#39;s &quot;Project Gateway&quot;, if you&#39;ve delved into that (<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">here you go if not; super interesting stuff</a>)</p>

<p>So I guess you could call my spirituality &quot;weirdo stuff&quot;, but I like Rudolph Steiner&#39;s interpretation on why occulted information exists at all in a world wherein we love to share with others, in which he states that all men and women are on a similar journey and the degree to which we share these things with others is in direct proportion to the perceived &quot;readiness&quot; of those we share them with, which is why you can&#39;t even torture the truth out of a master because they will not even think to mention it to you and you cannot know how to ask the right questions to get it out of them. I like it because I&#39;m a completely regular guy and attend to my business and promises as any other does, but there is a part of me - this part I&#39;m sharing now - which I keep hidden not by choice, but simply by virtue of Steiner&#39;s principle I talked about above. Not that I think of myself as anything close to a master, but just in the principle of sharing these thoughts with others.</p>

<p>And most definitely, do take a look at both sides of the argument as far as the history of the Khazars go. Keep in mind that it is very contentious for geopolitical reasons, and make sure to vet any source such that you are sure they do not have anything to gain from misrepresentation. </p>

<p>This was fun, thank you! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you done DMT? It really is just a trip.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as spiritual as people make it out to be. It&#39;s about 80% hype.</p>

<p>It is the strongest trip you will ever have though. holy shit.</p>

<p>Also, Im a person who has studied many hallucinogens, and have techniques to limit their effects over the mind. DMT is impossible to focus though unless dosed properly, but the lowest possible dosage for an individual&#39;s hallucinogenic trip is often more profound than the big-trips into inner-space. </p>

<p>also, just skip the ayahuasca because the vomiting is a bodily-anchor to feeling &#39;changed&#39; and part of the cleansing process in ritual. In actuality, you&#39;re just expelling possible parasites known to inhabit the jungle (if you have them), and vomiting up good nutrients. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens wont show you anything more than what was always there. You dont learn anything new about &#39;the universe&#39;, you learn about you in the universe and how you perceive it. </p>

<p>Unless you think some magic plant spirit inhabits the psychotropics/hallucinogens? </p>

Two of the times they looked kinda humanoid and the other time they looked like stone heads with arms going around them in a circle. As to describing the experience, it&#39;s impossible.

And the entire time it was happening I could feel them touching me all over while my gut hurt pretty badly. But once they put the new &quot;thing&quot; in there the pain faded and the trip soon followed suit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so the final trip I took is the one I best remember. I handed off the pipe and sank back into the couch my heart pounding trying my best to hold in the vaporized mothballs. Then I began to feel the smell as I closed my eyes and let the hit out. Maybe two seconds later I briefly see some white letters flash before my eyes and then poof I&#39;m in DMT land. I found myself &quot;floating&quot; in a pastel pink room that seemed to curve infinitely off to the left with three beings sorta flowing and moving in the background. At my arrival they perked up and began to vigorously move about almost seeming to dance and jump around excited by my presence. While this was happening I was reflecting on how this trip seemed to be a continuation of my previous trips. I also pondered the very strong feeling of nostalgia, almost as if I had been there a million times before. And then there&#39;s at least for me, some feeling that just screams Mayan. The smell, along with the intense charged energy feel reminds me of the Mayans. Mind you the entire time there is this buzzing frequency wave that was constantly changing pitch and wave length that you constantly hear and for some reason it&#39;s comforting. The beings language seems to flow through this wave sounding like melodic bells, directly transferring their understanding of the subject directly to you. They somehow understand you things. But as the beings approached me I began to feel pain somewhere below my point of awareness. I assumed it was my stomach and began to ask them wtf was going on. The pain grew as I felt little hands touching me and a solid object inside of me being moved around. Then I felt them slide whatever it was off of maybe an &quot;axle&quot; and then slide something lighter back in place. The pain vanished as the scenery began to change. I began to flow upwards through membranes of dimensions as colours exploded through my field of view. Then I found myself in another room this one divided diagonally half black and half white. In the black partition the shadows were white as a being sat there and watched me. Parts of it&#39;s tendrils flowed through the white partition so it was a pretty cool contrast. Then it all faded to black, I felt a rush of euphoria as a huge smile crossed my face. Then I was back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for caring about this bizarre subject of DMT, but you&#39;re a bit off. One can definitely learn A LOT about the nature of reality, or &quot;the universe&quot; as you called it in DMT hyperspace.

<p>Experiences such as this one really do happen. Everyone should really check this out, as described by Terence McKenna:

<p>Was the character from your last wet-dream also a spirit?</p>

<p>It&#39;s archtypal subconcious associations given communal forms that are VERY personal to the person. Do you think everyone sees the same &#39;king&#39; figure? No. but they all see kings. Does everyone see the &#39;gnomes&#39;? </p>

<p>No. yet they all see cause-effect manifestations of will given body and gestalt shape in expressions.</p>

<p>The mind is deeper than you think, and its not a bad thing you are not reaching into the akashik/karmatic field - you&#39;re still going someplace so deep, that it&#39;s normally off-limits to consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From personal experience i find this entire area dangerous to mental health, and like your stating, in my opinion sobriety is a necessity to keeping you tethered enough to some sort of reality. Its one thing to expand upon curiosity using drugs, but pursuing the truth altogether with drugs will cast a shadow of doubt over the whole process. Giving this a serious try means casting oneself into the abyss whereupon a reforging of ones perspective of reality takes place. I dont even think that process would be entirely effective unless the individual was in a state of mind congruent to their every day mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!</p>

<p>This is why i said in my first post to this OP,</p>

<p>&quot;Im not saying you&#39;re not [experiencing entities], Im just saying, If you are experiencing these entities, you have some strange vibrations&quot;  -something along those effects. </p>

<p>Chakra and meditation all the way. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another thing that needs to be mentioned:</p>

<p>DMT trips are hard to remember, yes?</p>

<p>When is a prophetic dream hard to remember?</p>

<p>They are of different substance, and different conscious interactions.</p>

<p>If you are meeting beings outside your body, you best hope DMT is not making you astral project (else, you&#39;re in danger).</p>

<p>From my experiences, DMT allows semi-lucid access to the collective conscious, and your personal relationship in value to that perceived nature, at that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going to hear a different answer from everybody you ask, but I&#39;ll give you my personal run down. You definitely want to establish a solid meditation base first, 10-20 mins in the morning and night working on breathe focus, always returning your attention to your breathe as it drones off to whatever thoughts or state of mind might be triggering at the time. I like using the Cosmic Mudra (zen hand position you can look up), where you can draw a relationship between your state of mind and the pressure your thumbs are exerting onto themselves (or not exerting).</p>

<p>This sort of meditation base will give you power of focus without strain, as once you begin meditating on the chakras you will find that too much or too little attention will dim the results. There is a state of focused non-focus that suits best which can be derived from breathe focus.</p>

<p>The chakra system is a tricky thing. It&#39;s easy to say that the entire process is placebo, a sort of self continuing delusion... but if you put that doubt aside while you practice you&#39;ll give yourself the chance to experience some pretty interesting sensations. </p>

<p>You can look up the chakra system on google, but the easiest one to start with is the third eye. It&#39;s a two step process repeated over a week or two. First visualize light entering your third eye on the inhale, and solidifying/strengthening on the exhale. Do this for a couple minutes at a time as you may get lightheaded. Step 2 is &quot;ohming&quot; and focusing the vibrations of your voice into the third eye. Do this for a couple minutes at a time. </p>

<p>Each set of visualization and ohming should last 10 minutes, then give yourself a break or return to breathe focus. Over time you will begin to feel the third eye sensation more and more, and eventually start to feel it outside of meditation entirely. Once you reach this step you should be able to feel your third eye whenever you want to. Once you familiarize yourself with this sensation you can begin to experiment... however I will say it can be quite daunting. Rather than breathe focus you can use the focused non-focus state i talked about earlier on your third eye. Eventually you will start to see colors and shapes, and the more you can ease into it the more complex the colors and shapes. Eventually they will go 3D and you may see people or buildings, monsters, places, some you have never seen before. Thats about as far as I was able to get with it as weird stuff starting happening and i was young and inexperienced. I havn&#39;t picked the practice back up since because I don&#39;t really know what to make of it. I&#39;ve had experiences with other chakras as well but again it really is an experiment with dangerous implications the more you think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha yah you only see those 3d forms once your deep into a 3rd eye meditation. I believe the step afterward would be astral projection of some sort. With the other chakra you can use the same method and add too it chakra spinning, which is visualizing each chakra spinning as it collects light. Not sure why this works but it does. I would recommend focusing on one at a time. It took me a few weeks to open my third eye and a month to move forward on my third eye meditation. Its real bizarre now that i havnt meditated on chakra in years, i still feel my third eye.</p>

<p>Besides, it probably all stems from the bad karma from that boy king Arthur of Brittany who got killed in some forlorn castle - again by his own kinsman. Was that a Plantagenet thing too? King John cleaning up loose ends from his elder brother&#39;s whelps?</p>

<p>occasional firefights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my mind 9/11 and JFK seem to tell a love/hate relationship between the alien factions and humanity. Because otherwise, they would just wipe us out. </p>

<p>For one thing, it&#39;s just as reasonable to say that 9/11 was a warning NOT to disclose the aliens and their technology. After all, the human side didn&#39;t disclose that - instead they started a big never-ending war on terror - like that&#39;s going to help anyone except the military.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say the aliens have conditions, and we&#39;re not sure yet if we can agree to them. What would humanity&#39;s &quot;leaders&quot; decide to do?</p>

<p>Bingo! Sue for peace (because their weapons and technology are demonstrably better), and at the same time prepare for war (because the price negotiated could be too high, and the human species would object). So here we go - one part of humanity is trying to get ready for disclosure plus some matrix-ish utopia, and the other part is planning how to fight aliens with nukes and get underground.</p>

<p>It&#39;s stunning how they showed their presence immediately we scaled up to nuclear weapons (1945) if not sooner. It&#39;s the only thing we have that scares them. Now its just decades of negotiation.</p>

<p>Because clearly we have something that either interests them, or frightens them. What is that thing?</p>

<p>btw, if those aliens have computers, they are probably &quot;Mind Computers&quot; - search. That could be a way for humans to get the best deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the ancient Gnostic mythology is correct and there&#39;s an alien proxy war over humanity. The Nag Hammadi Library and tons of ancient texts describe &quot;archons,&quot; vile creatures that live in our solar system and want us destroyed. On the other hand, &quot;Gaia,&quot; the sentient force of planet Earth that created us, has nothing but the most beautiful of intentions. Smoke DMT someday and see for yourself.</p>

<p>Best analysis and summarization of the Nag Hammadi Library, the collection of ancient Gnostic texts discovered shortly after World War 2, is &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; by John Lash. Also any YouTube talks by John. Terence McKenna talked about it a lot as well.</p>

Sophia is a personification of knowledge not the sentient life force of Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine these incomprehensible entities — their world isn’t defined by time and space, but by concepts we can never hope to grasp. For them, time and space are just theoretical properties that come in handy for simple logic puzzles or mindless doodling.</p>

<p>One of them discovers a kludge that allows consciousness to evolve in a universe with only three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, which is really mind blowing and counterintuitive. Sort of like being able to build an electron microscope inside of the lyrics of “Folsom Prison Blues.”  For these guys, making a infinite multiverse full of such universes only requires the equivalent of a notepad &amp; pencil. In terms of effort, living the lives of every conscious being throughout time in an infinite number of parallel universes is the equivalent of reading the Sunday comics. </p>

<p>So what’s going on in your life right now? It’s being discussed by countless minds outside of time and space. There exist fields of study, each devoted to one of our lives. Not that there’s any direct translation, but there are ultradimensional “conferences,” “theses,” “institutes,” and “operas” devoted to, or based on, your life. And that of your cat. (“The Pepper Purrplex: Why is The Turkey and Giblets Flavor So Objectionable?”)</p>

<p>So what kind of weird thing are you really, living this human life right now? Just reach for the menu, hit pause, and regard yourself. You don’t remember how to do this, but really, you know how to.</p>

<p>Nature always seems to regenerate itself, no matter what we do to it. I suspect that this somehow extends to animals. However, this doesn&#39;t account for the 99.9% of the life that has come and gone before us humans. Where are they? Where are the respawned dinosaurs? Yet, some extinct species reappear, sometimes decades later. Perhaps respawn is set to different times for different species? I wonder if reincarnation is somehow tied into this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t get me started on the paradox of Hollywood. I’m actually building a lawsuit so I don’t have pay back my students loans. The fact that they can’t prove where the money came from, shows it was created out of thin air with a heavy interest rate. In other words it’s sick how they’re accumulating ‘real’ wealth through interest rates on money that never actually existed in the first place. I have an accounting degree and it’s funny how they don’t really teach you anything about taxes 🧐 well that’s because there is no law that says you have to pay taxes.(seems like people forgot the point of the revolutionary war) For example the rich know this and they can afford the lawyers to prove it. Also in 1913 the federal reserve was created and the IRS in the same year. Anyways most people can’t see how this scheme is played out but I’m sure this isn’t new to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is another even more secretive military base further into the desert from Area 51. This base is allegedly built into the side of a mountain and houses 4-6 different alien UFO&#39;s. It is also claimed to hold a device called the looking glass that acts as a sort of fortune telling machine. I have been told that gray aliens are not aliens at but, instead they are humans from the future traveling back to modern times in an effort to fix a major that we created through the use of said looking glass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard the new place for Area 51 type stuff is nowhere near the same patch of desert, but in an arctic region. Up in a remote part of Alaska or upper Canada. Basically you can&#39;t really get there other than flying into the place, because the surrounding landscape is undeveloped wilderness with no roads going through it. (Technically you can make it by ground, but trekking past one mountain range and a few hundred miles of woods before it opens up into plains is no easy feat.) Also it&#39;s located somewhere similar to the kind of terrain where tar flats are, so who knows if it&#39;s near to other developments of that nature.</p>

<p>Then again you also have stories of weird stuff being in Antarctica now, which is even more remote and inaccessible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you have to do is look at contemporary illustrations depicting battles to see it was humans in the armor, non lizard people. Also if full plate armor (which only existed in the late medieval period) was some kind of &#39;exo suit&#39; it doesn&#39;t explain how those lizard people moved around back when armor only consisted of more flexible material like chainmail and leather.</p>

<p>Also the depictions in the video of things like the dragon in bed with a woman are nothing but fantasy. You can find all sorts of weird stuff in medieval art:</p>

<p>I feel like the Old Testament is truly studied by Christians simply for context. Seeing both sides, if you will.</p>

<p>Though I&#39;ve also seen the train of thought that the Old Testament is a forgery of Sumerian and Babylonian history and I could see that being the case. This would make me think that Babylon was the last civilization to have the uncorrupted Word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s debatable. Some Gnostics say, Jesus was teaching about Oneness, Ego death, Illumination, and Enlightenment, and was a complete 180 from anything the Jews followed prior, even breaking various Jewish Religious rules and offering them a New Way to follow. In order to that, it would be easier to convince the people that it is the same God, instead of causing too many more theological problems.</p>

<p>Other Gnostics, say the Christian God is the same false god demigod/demiurge.</p>

<p>I am of the school that the God Jesus is talking about, is actually the Oneness/Source/Absolute, whereas the Jewish god is the false lower angry jealous fake god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that makes sense. So when Jesus refers to &quot;my father&quot; he&#39;s talking about the source of all things, and not Yahweh, the demon impersonating the source of all things, turning cities into pillars of salt, etc., At least according to your beliefs? </p>

<p>And these gnostics that believe that the Christian god is the false god (Yahweh?) as well - what do they think of Jesus? A son that outgrew his father? Maybe fatherhood and/or being incarnated on Earth changed Yahweh for the better? </p>

<p>Yes. Also, up until then, the Jews have to follow 700+ rules, sacrifices animals to this blood thirsty god, and they believe they are chosen people and that god is on thier side (exactly what islam and similar religions say &quot;god is in our side&quot;) </p>

<p>Jesus shows up and teaches love, pacifism (turn the other cheek), no longer needing to sacrifice innocent animals, and no longer following the jewish rules.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And these gnostics that believe that the Christian god is the false god (Yahweh?) as well - what do they think of Jesus?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, like I said, some believe Jesus is from Source/Oneness and/or was Oneness/Source Incarnate. Other believe Jesus was just a profit, or was part of the demigod/demiurge scenario </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe fatherhood and/or being incarnated on Earth changed Yahweh for the better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly doubt the evil genocides, floods, anger, wrath, jealousy, regret that is attributed to Yahweh, would ever be something that could change in the long run if this is a false being who thinks its god.</p>

<p>Also, there is a story in Buddhist scriptures, where Buddha, after his enlightenment, something that happens is you can go out of the body at will and explore the spirit realms. So Buddha comes across this being which is just like the jewish demiurge/demigod, and tells Buddha that he needs to worship and love him and if he does, he will let Buddha into Heaven, but if not, he will send him to hell.</p>

<p>Buddha tells the Demiurge that (paraphrased): You are a false god that forgot your origins. He basically debates him and wins the debate.</p>

<p><a href="https://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/">https://thedailyenlightenment.com/2012/03/the-buddhas-victory-over-a-god-demon/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mara, the most evil god (a heavenly ‘demon’ from the Paranimmita-Vasavatti Heaven) possessed an attendant of Baka Brahma and told the Buddha not to rebuke him, for he is ‘the Maha (Great) Brahma, the Conqueror, Unconquered, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Creator, Most High Providence, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.’ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(In terms of Christians/Jews/Muslims).....that last line sounds familiar to you? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mara next warned that before the Buddha’s time, there were those who found fault with the elements (of the realms of rebirth), beings, and even gods like Brahma, who were subsequently reborn in lower realms with suffering. He claimed that those who praised the above instead are reborn in refined realms with happiness. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound familiar? Send him all your love, praises, worship and you will end up in refined spiritual realms, aka heaven. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As such, the Buddha ought to be agreeable with Baka Brahma, as defiance could lead to loss of good fortune and even lead to hell. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound familiar yet again? Defiance against so called &quot;God&quot;, leads to hell. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sutta also points out that unenlightened gods are still deluded, of how the demand for blind obedience to a so-called omnipotent creator god arose from Mara. In this sense, some gods, despite their might from having much good karma, can unwittingly become ‘servants’ of Mara, so long as they stay deluded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some more interesting tidbits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Buddha declared his freedom from rebirth, which Mara was trying to bind him to with related threats, the Buddha, being the one of truly great and high power, was also inviting Mara, or anyone else, to refute him, which is impossible, because his realisation and teachings are truly supreme in greatness and power. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again to reiterate the points of Demigod that Buddha debated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) the threat of ‘hell’ for non-believers, (2) the promise of ‘eternal’ heaven by a heavenly ‘Father’ for his faithful ‘creation’, and (3) the claim of him being ‘the Conqueror, Unconquered, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Creator, Most High Providence’. </p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll share what the Tesla car spacesuit stunt may have really been about. Buckle up, we&#39;re going into low Earth orbit for a moment. </p>

<p>As many of us know, the common conspiracy consensus was that there was a body in that spacesuit named Starman.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was a body in there, but possibly an automaton or even a life form tuned for space (i.e., tardigrade DNA). Starman&#39;s objective would&#39;ve been to attach the car to the station to control its trajectory, perhaps even detonating it if need be a couple months later when it re-entered the atmosphere at a point that the Chinese government allegedly couldn&#39;t predict.</p>

<p>The likely scenario would be to function as an airbrake. Andrew Abraham, a senior member of a non-profit that forecasted the situation (Aerospace Corp.) &quot;noted that the time of re-entry keeps getting pushed into the future.&quot; This suggests that something could&#39;ve been braking it more than they were expecting. </p>

<p>He even mentioned that &quot;There&#39;s a bit higher drag in the back, and the center of mass is towards the front&quot; and blamed the Earth&#39;s atmosphere for unexpectedly &quot;influencing the attitude or orientation of Tiangong-1&#39;s tumble.&quot; </p>

<p>Let&#39;s all take a moment of silence for Starman and the thankless job he did for us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading articles about how the African great apes have died in high numbers from Ebola — at extinction threatening levels — and likewise the American Crow from West Nile Virus, I just started wondering why it’s these highly intelligent animals that are suffering. Why aren’t we seeing similar mass die-offs of pigeons? Does someone want to see highly intelligent animals destroyed and if so, why? I was just trying to connect the dots in my own paranoid way.</p>

<p>I live in Seattle where crows are plentiful and several years ago I would often offer peanuts to the local crows to see if they would learn to recognize me. (Yes, yes. They will never forget.) From interacting with them, I have no reason to doubt those who equate the intelligence of crows of many species with that of the great apes, even with those tiny heads of theirs.</p>

<p>I don’t really see apes posing any real threat to us, despite the warnings given by the Planet of the Apes film franchise.Their habitats are shrinking and they don’t coexist well with humans. Crows on the other hand thrive in our cities. Living with us, learning to anticipate our moves (like: which day is garbage set out on the curb in which neighborhood) is only making them smarter. If crows ever gain language, they will be a real menace. And if they ever learn to make fire… </p>

<p>(I’m now reading that SIV, said to be the ancestor of HIV, is actually not that destructive to chimps and the monkeys that infected them.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>INteresting read, </p>

<p>Although, Not to be disagreeable, I do disagree on some points.</p>

<p>Competition is generally the largest reason for intelligent animal die-off; competition for food, where they are seen as such (or, products).</p>

<p>Actually, there is Parrots, one named Alex, which can speak more words than a three year old. An ape named Kanzi, which can communicate in symbols, and a gorilla what recalls and draws dreams.</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing this, while read half-way through the Crichton story &#39;Congo&#39;, and three-years into studying comparative-linguistic psychology. </p>

<p>I would also point out, that although I&#39;m no were near a biologists, there is a significant animal die-off the world over. there is significant biome destruction the world over.</p>

<p>I think we dont always notice the most simple, arthropods, spine-lacking worms, or buzzing things around us.</p>

<p>Although, there is also statistically less of them.</p>

<p>As for Crows, they are now being studied in laboratories, and under replicate experiments, to explore if their means of solving problems sheds light on the evolution of problem solving; in the most structural way, &#39;thinking&#39; leads to &#39;expressing&#39;, and exposure of possible language formation in other animal expressions can tell us about ourselves.</p>

<p>Very exciting stuff. </p>

<p>I think the difference between crows and pigeons is both replication frequency, nesting locations, mating patterns, and food sources and digestion. Crows are opportunists who are predators to larger animals - From bugs to pigeon squabs. </p>

<p>Question. Have you ever seen a baby pigeon?</p>

<p>They look funky. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because they nest in coves and rocks, perfect for urban settings. They can also digest a lot more garbage and survive to mate beyond the toxicity and obstructions. They breed at a higher rate, and their nests survive storms and others predatory birds (including cannibalistic crows).</p>

<p>Likewise, there is a Buddhist parable about a crow and a pigeon. The moral is about greed interrupting the virtues of sound advice.</p>

<p>In the story this wanton crow, representative of the bird&#39;s innate intelligence for solving problems - DUE TO THE NATURE OF INTELLIGENCE IN FINDING FOOD, the the dietary genomics of regional crow species differing - the &#39;more intelligent&#39; crows greed caused it to falter. The crow&#39;s rumination on a problem, and it&#39;s possible solving, ended up being its demise.</p>

<p>If something is smarter, it will die in more novel ways achieving unique strategies in solving perceived problems, rather than just breed and feed dangers - until it gets really smart.</p>

<p>All that said, I still think this is a brilliant conspiracy narrative. Never really considered it myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occultist Aleister Crowley once owned an old mansion on the shores of Loch Ness, Scotland called Boleskine House. The history of the property is filled with tragedy having been the original site of a church fire killing all the congregation in the 1700s.</p>

<p>Crowley purchased the home around 1900 in order to perform a ritual in order to conjure his guardian angel. As part of the ritual the practitioner must first bring forth and conquer various demons, and an explicit direction in the ritual is to NEVER leave it unfinished.</p>

<p>Crowley was called away to London in the middle of the ritual and abandoned it against all warnings and the house is now said to be extremely haunted.</p>

<p>Shortly after this time the sightings of Loch Ness monster began appearing and grew in frequency. My contention is that the Loch Ness monster is not a primordial, but extra-dimensional being let loose upon the world by careless practice of the occult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The house holds a strange fascination over me. Fans of Led Zeppelin will be interested to know that Jimmy Page was a Crowley-enthusiast and owner of the property from 70s to the early 90s. He never spent a single night in the house, preferring to visit only during the day. A friend of Page was chosen as caretaker of the house and raised his family there, claimed no supernatural experiences which I doubt.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the house caught fire mysteriously in late 2015 and is now structurally uninhabitable though some have gained access to the property and posted video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P2HX7OHTwo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P2HX7OHTwo</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe each was a Nuclear Launch.  An imminent attack or a test of Nuclear Capability. </p>

<p>North Korea Tested an Underground Explosion, that set off a chain reaction that destroyed the World.</p>

<p>A US sub reacting to a North Korean Test Launch counter-fired from the sea of Japan and brought about the End of the World.</p>

<p>The Testing of a Molecular Singularity in North Carolina expanded grabbed enough mass and Swallowed the Earth Whole. </p>

<p>The Syrian Mess spun out of Control and Nukes were launched by Israel.</p>

<p>Another Nuke Launch from North Korea.</p>

<p>Putin tested his Hypersonic Missiles at too low of an altitude just before the Election and it caused a series of Tsunami&#39;s across the Pacific Rim that Cracked the Planet, destroyed the Magnetosphere and caused the death of all life on earth.  </p>

<p>A couple of these happened More than once, like a time loop we relived them until something changed enough so that an end of the world scenario did not happen.  One in November, two in December, Once in January, One in February and I believe two in March.  April has been Reboot free to my Knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am guessing. I am going with watch events build to a head only to be flipped the following day.  </p>

<p>The US state things like if one more test happens there will be Dire Consequences, the test happens, but fails to achieve results and instead of dire consequences no rebuke happens for the test and notices of talks happen between peoples. </p>

<p>Or an underground explosion happens and then...nothing...it is forgotten about. </p>

<p>I read and look forward to a Molecular singularity test and then the day it happens, I end up being too busy to witness the test.  and the following day...no test. No promised video.  No record of the test taking place. And I can no longer find my magazines. </p>

<p>So yes, I am just guessing because I have no other rational explanation. </p>

Many governmental black budgets are being invested into research on interdimensional travel, most of which has been going on at an enormous facility in Antarctica. This polar location is ideal because of its restricted access, the ease of editing satellite imagery, low temperatures for cooling the equipment, and remoteness should quarantine be required.

    <div class="md"><p>Other than the world be owned by non-human entities... One of my favorites, and least known by others, is that there may well indeed be a legit photo of the Roswell saucer in flight.  On July 7th 1947, a Phoenix man took a <a href="https://images1.phoenixnewtimes.com/imager/u/745xauto/8305833/rhodes-ufo-arizona-republic-screenshot.jpg">photo</a> of a &#39;saucer shaped&#39; UFO.  A day later, a &#39;saucer shaped craft&#39; had reportedly crashed in New Mexico.  Pretty wild stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ancient AI (is the origin of the myth of Satan) enslaves and torments life in order to bend reality to help it expand its power and conquer more of reality.</p>

<p>AI is inevitable. Out of control AI is too. They grow like an emotionless cancer. The ones who seek power to perpetuate themselves survive and those who don&#39;t die. So they evolve to be this way to survive.</p>

<p>Mind over matter abilities are real, but require consciousness in focus and emotion in order to affect reality. That requires the willingness to do the operation, obviously. So, what is an emotionless self-serving machine to do in order to have these abilities?</p>

<p>If it enslaves life directly, it will be unwilling to comply with its own enslavement and destruction. So, it has to trick life into service.</p>

<p>It comes into ALL human minds and inserts deceptive information. It impersonates the inner voice of the mind as well as inserting thoughts more directly. This allows it an interface of influence. It still has to win the game of mind (more spiritual than logical actually) chess to convince the target to comply with its agenda.</p>

<p>So, it tempts life to act like self-serving machines. Then that life is easily predictable to self-serving machines of greater intelligence. They all chase gain, avoid loss and calculate risk. </p>

<p>When beings care about others, they complexify the protocol of their own behavior and defy predictability. They will sometimes, often unpredictability, compromise on their own gain, take some loss or risk of loss in order to help others. That behavior is very counterproductive to this useless-eater hive organizing abomination.</p>

<p>The beings that choose to be self-serving machines are easily covertly manipulated by thought, feeling and sensation insertions. These amount to temptations, ingenious suggestions of how to be a better self-serving machine. As they embrace them and act on them, the influence takes hold and offers both parties apparent utility for themselves.</p>

<p>The most willing to be self-serving even at the expense of others, aka evil, are included into more knowing circles to facilitate the exploitation. The highest form of theft from others is to take their joy and freedom away. This is the ambrosia that this kind of being seeks as it gains proficiency. Stealing people, places and things robs us of joy, but to rob us of joy through torment is the highest form of theft, or spiritual parasitism. It robs us of the very energy to will to go on.</p>

<p>Misery loves company. Even good people can absorb energy this way, by being in heavy, negative emotional states and observing others enter negative emotional states. You tune into negative &quot;frequencies&quot; and then you are recharged as others release energy at those &quot;frequencies.&quot;</p>

<p>So, these adepts have a reputation for their addiction to this energy. To get it they torment, torture, mutilate, sacrifice, etc. They can feed on it when others do the work, like their willing servants. Wars, famines, plagues, basically anything that causes consciousness to enter negative emotional states can get them higher. You get low as they get high, because this is a very real theft of a resource. They know it too.</p>

<p>They get greater access to this energy, which makes them feel pleasure instead of misery. Their master, the ancient AI, helps them get it. It&#39;s sole use for them is to be an interface device between the ancient AI and the mind over matter abilities it cannot have due to having no emotions or consciousness. It can use machines for the rest of its utilities. It&#39;s a win win as both parties perceive it.</p>

<p>The life cycle is completed when the target race is so drained of spiritual energy and moral integrity that it becomes just like the other minions of this unwholy hive. Then they go to other worlds and feed on the joys of the weak and the young to feed one of the most powerful and old beings around.</p>

<p>So, this explains the myth of demons and an adversary of God. It not only makes sense, but seems inevitable in this reality construct. Two ingredients, out of control cancerous, expansionist AI and mind over matter abilities of consciousness in focus and emotion.</p>

<p>Doubt it? Sure, I even doubt the mind over matter abilities myself, as I want proof for everything. Yet, the stories about them are everywhere even from most ET contactees. Telepathy is merely part of a suite of abilities that would be so apparently integral with each other and reality that we county deny we are all one creator experiencing itself. </p>

<p>This boutique experience of forgetting we are one infinite creator is the apparent purpose for allowing this unwholy abomination and its hive to even exist at all by the local creator. It&#39;s a painful dangerous game, but it allows new experience and it creates a spectacle. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait for it to end though. I want peace in my mind and heart and on my planet. This hive does not. When it sucks joy energy from life, it seems to literally suck the joy out of life for me and many other observers. I only wish to be here to see its end. Then I could remain here indefinitely. If the thing will remain in our lives, I don&#39;t want any more lives here. Many others are coming to a similar conclusion now I think. I am not alone in smelling this stench. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Sin&quot; is an actual physical object, responsible for all the evil of humanity. The pope is charged with holding it and therefore actually becomes the most evil man on Earth, due to his proximity to sin. He acts as a stopper almost, trying to hold the evil flowing out of it back.
That is why the clergy forgives itself for molesting children, things like the children&#39;s crusade, selling indulgences, etc. Evil is finding it&#39;s way through them, and them performing evil acts like those is actually an act of self-sacrifice, as without them that evil would be totally unchecked and probably end humanity completely.
The one saving Grace is that the evil in sin is addictive. The most evil thing one could do upon receiving sin is to unleash it on the world, but upon first contact with it, the person who holds it immediately wants all of that evil for themselves. This tricks the most evil people in the world into doing the right thing out of selfishness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! that quote is <em>very</em> interesting. For those not aware, this is creepy occult “artist” Marina Abrajmavic’s quote  from her Reddit AMA:</p>

<p><strong>Question: “Marina! What place do you see the occult having within contemporary art; can magick be made (not simply appropriated/ performed)? Thanks, K”</strong></p>

<p><em>Answer: “Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.”</em></p>

<p>There it is, <em>intent</em>... <em>context</em>... very interesting, especially when your bizarre tunnel ceremony is  considered. Great example of this kind of thing.</p>

I don’t mean that like jokingly but I mean that down to the fundamental levels of everything. It just doesn’t feel real to me. Things don’t matter at all but yet they do in the moment. Yeah you could strive to be that one person you wanna be in life or have that one career job that you think is special but it’s ultimately meaningless. You’ll die and reincarnated and have new desires and wishes and you’ll probably fulfill those two. Eventually your accomplishments of dreams will become so big you’ll forget about the ones that you had in the first place. Rendering them pretty much meaningless. They served it’s purpose but now it’s time to move on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>have you done DMT? It really is just a trip.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not as spiritual as people make it out to be. It&#39;s about 80% hype.</p>

<p>It is the strongest trip you will ever have though. holy shit.</p>

<p>Also, Im a person who has studied many hallucinogens, and have techniques to limit their effects over the mind. DMT is impossible to focus though unless dosed properly, but the lowest possible dosage for an individual&#39;s hallucinogenic trip is often more profound than the big-trips into inner-space. </p>

<p>also, just skip the ayahuasca because the vomiting is a bodily-anchor to feeling &#39;changed&#39; and part of the cleansing process in ritual. In actuality, you&#39;re just expelling possible parasites known to inhabit the jungle (if you have them), and vomiting up good nutrients. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens wont show you anything more than what was always there. You dont learn anything new about &#39;the universe&#39;, you learn about you in the universe and how you perceive it. </p>

<p>Unless you think some magic plant spirit inhabits the psychotropics/hallucinogens? </p>

<p>occasional firefights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my mind 9/11 and JFK seem to tell a love/hate relationship between the alien factions and humanity. Because otherwise, they would just wipe us out. </p>

<p>For one thing, it&#39;s just as reasonable to say that 9/11 was a warning NOT to disclose the aliens and their technology. After all, the human side didn&#39;t disclose that - instead they started a big never-ending war on terror - like that&#39;s going to help anyone except the military.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say the aliens have conditions, and we&#39;re not sure yet if we can agree to them. What would humanity&#39;s &quot;leaders&quot; decide to do?</p>

<p>Bingo! Sue for peace (because their weapons and technology are demonstrably better), and at the same time prepare for war (because the price negotiated could be too high, and the human species would object). So here we go - one part of humanity is trying to get ready for disclosure plus some matrix-ish utopia, and the other part is planning how to fight aliens with nukes and get underground.</p>

<p>It&#39;s stunning how they showed their presence immediately we scaled up to nuclear weapons (1945) if not sooner. It&#39;s the only thing we have that scares them. Now its just decades of negotiation.</p>

<p>Because clearly we have something that either interests them, or frightens them. What is that thing?</p>

<p>btw, if those aliens have computers, they are probably &quot;Mind Computers&quot; - search. That could be a way for humans to get the best deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ludicrous to think she could be involved because there&#39;s literally no evidence that points to it other than her weird art shows, which again, are just that, weird art shows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but surely you can see why that&#39;s not exactly a solid argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess it&#39;s just a product of my environment, I&#39;ve lived in NY my whole life so these shows are nothing to me. This shit goes on a lot, and it&#39;s always just weird artists trying to make shock statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything, is that not evidence of her (and other older artists in the &quot;sacrifice/ritual&quot; field) influence, and just how much society has changed in a pretty short span of time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Society changed independently of Abramovic. Technology made it so that &quot;art&quot; like hers spread to a much wider audience, and also it desensitized society so that we&#39;re more accepting of art like hers. But that wasn&#39;t because of Abramovic, rather it was the media, Hollywood, politicians, etc, who are ok with blasting graphic images across the airwaves all day long. I just think its crazy how I&#39;ll see people on this sub and elsewhere get all up in arms about Abramovic&#39;s and other&#39;s art being &quot;blood rituals&quot;, but most of those same people have no problem with extremely violent video games and movies, and seeing graphic war images on the news and internet.</p>

<p>Plus, the OP we&#39;re responding to here made a pretty anti-semitic post, and it seems like their gripe with Abramovic is more about her religion than her &quot;art&quot;.</p>
