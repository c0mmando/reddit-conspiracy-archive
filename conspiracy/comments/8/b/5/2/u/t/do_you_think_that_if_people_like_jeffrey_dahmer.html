       I think the BTK guy might have been caught earlier if we had the internet. I'm thinking that internet sleuths might have pieced together all the evidence faster and found a connection.

       Well, to be honest, I haven't heard of a serial killer in the past ten or so years.

       But I do honestly think that the BTK killer might have been caught sooner if we had the internet. Internet detectives are pretty damn good, especially when they all congregate on a website together to share theories, information, etc.

       Wasn't there some kind of serial killer hog farmer guy up in British Colombia? And the strange cases of feet washing ashore in the Vancouver area?

       I hear your point, but what makes me scratch my head is how sensationalized some of the serial killers were. There have been hundreds of movies, books, magazines etc based on American serial killers. The media wouldn't stop pushing the grisly details, day in and day out when it was making them alot of money. I don't don't think it's because people can't handle the details....just my opinion though, I could be wrong, it maybe Canada has way more ethics in media than the US.

       I'm not disagreeing that there are alot of talented people on the internet, but I'm just wondering if serial killers suddenly disappeared from existence, or if there is maybe a more logical reason why it's basically non existent in the news.

       I like the theory that a few of the more prominent ones like Bundy and Kaczynski are by products of MK ultra experiments. I'm pretty sure it's confirmed Kaczynski was in the program in college. It's not going to be true for most of them like Kemper or Dahmer who would have talked about it at some point in all their interviews after. Maybe all that forced LSD and emotional abuse to intelligent people just creates a monster

       Interesting thought. You don't see or hear of serial killers like that. Aside from the Phoenix sniper, I can't think of any others.

       Maybe they don't report them as much.

       This could be true. I actually was surprised to read these statistics, which would make your theory of concealment plausible. Don't take this the wrong way Reddit, but most msm is anti-white right now, and it would not help their case to broadcast this on the news.

       I brought up statistics that most certainly matter, whether or not it may offend you or anyone else.  I didn't say anything derogatory about any races or specific people.  MSM drives the narrative, and tells you what they want you to know.  There was incredible coverage of almost all serial killers from the ones I mentioned above, and many more for many years.  My question is, what's with the sudden disappearance from the media, despite the overwhelming evidence in the statistics?  Go ahead and think whatever you want about my intentions, or maybe bring up an argument to the statistics we can discuss.

       His point is since races other than white statistically have more serial killers why do we never hear about them and the main well known serial killers are all white.

       The statistics provided by the Beatle juice guy shows there's more whites than blacks... But either way most serial killers in general aren't sensationalized much these days. It turns them into celebrities and causes an uptick in serial killing. I'd bet the same thing is going on with how the media covers mass shootings, they've only gotten slightly better since Sandy Hook but still can't help but making it all about the killer

       Some people are fucked up and see that "fame" and it becomes a numbers game, if they can get more they will be more famous. There was a similar phenomenon with some serial killers who would want to know where they ranked in body count

       That was what I was referring to, you can talk about statistics all you want, I wasn't saying they were wrong (it actually shows on your link 52% of serial killers are white) I was questioning why you would bring up race in regards to this based off that part of the comment and it seemed insidious. On top of it that is a sure fire way to bring politics into what could be a non political discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you can think what ever you want, I have nothing to be offended over. If I was completely misreading you and implied bad intentions, my bad. I just don't see how this is political and this is a fun topic which would get ruined by that kinda thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To address the post finally I don't think the news ignores them, there possibly is a decline in the amount of serial killers. The news also used to drive more people to commit these acts by essentially making the serial killers celebrities with non stop coverage and blasting the dudes face all over.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was recently an active serial killer going around in Toronto, he's on trial now to determine guilt.

       This is only 1 example  but it's really recent. I think most people can't stomache this topic (most people I try to yap about serial killers with don't like it lol). There's probably a connection between MK ultra and some serial killers like Unabomber.

       I don't think the media stopped covering serial killers because it bred more serial killers. Just look at the current news with all these mass shooters. The news loves it, and makes big bucks off it.

       I think they just kind of stopped because it wasn't getting the views for it anymore because most people started to agree that the coverage was doing more harm than good. It will probably take some time for the same to happen with mass shooters, who knows. You're probably more right than wrong on that one
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd guess there is quite an overlap with the type of mind set serial and mass killers have and maybe with the rise of instant gratification through technology the way it manifested has changed in how these types act out. Before it was all stalk your prey, enjoy the ride and take your time. Now it's go out guns blazing and instant gratification of a giant chaos you caused all at once.

       It is true that harming/killing animals is a big red flag but it doesn't make him a serial killer by definition. No one knows for certain whether or not he would have continued.

       Not sure they were 4-chan but they persevered when the damned cops didn't act! They ended up using
