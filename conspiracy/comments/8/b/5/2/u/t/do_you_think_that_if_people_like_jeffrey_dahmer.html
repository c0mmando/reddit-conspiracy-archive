    <div class="md"><p>I hear your point, but what makes me scratch my head is how sensationalized some of the serial killers were. There have been hundreds of movies, books, magazines etc based on American serial killers. The media wouldn&#39;t stop pushing the grisly details, day in and day out when it was making them alot of money. I don&#39;t don&#39;t think it&#39;s because people can&#39;t handle the details....just my opinion though, I could be wrong, it maybe Canada has way more ethics in media than the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the theory that a few of the more prominent ones like Bundy and Kaczynski are by products of MK ultra experiments. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s confirmed Kaczynski was in the program in college. It&#39;s not going to be true for most of them like Kemper or Dahmer who would have talked about it at some point in all their interviews after. Maybe all that forced LSD and emotional abuse to intelligent people just creates a monster </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The statistics provided by the Beatle juice guy shows there&#39;s more whites than blacks... But either way most serial killers in general aren&#39;t sensationalized much these days. It turns them into celebrities and causes an uptick in serial killing. I&#39;d bet the same thing is going on with how the media covers mass shootings, they&#39;ve only gotten slightly better since Sandy Hook but still can&#39;t help but making it all about the killer </p>

<p>That was what I was referring to, you can talk about statistics all you want, I wasn&#39;t saying they were wrong (it actually shows on your link 52% of serial killers are white) I was questioning why you would bring up race in regards to this based off that part of the comment and it seemed insidious. On top of it that is a sure fire way to bring politics into what could be a non political discussion.</p>

<p>Also you can think what ever you want, I have nothing to be offended over. If I was completely misreading you and implied bad intentions, my bad. I just don&#39;t see how this is political and this is a fun topic which would get ruined by that kinda thing. </p>

<p>To address the post finally I don&#39;t think the news ignores them, there possibly is a decline in the amount of serial killers. The news also used to drive more people to commit these acts by essentially making the serial killers celebrities with non stop coverage and blasting the dudes face all over.</p>

<p>There was recently an active serial killer going around in Toronto, he&#39;s on trial now to determine guilt.</p>

<p>This is only 1 example  but it&#39;s really recent. I think most people can&#39;t stomache this topic (most people I try to yap about serial killers with don&#39;t like it lol). There&#39;s probably a connection between MK ultra and some serial killers like Unabomber. </p>

<p>Some people just were kind of born predisposed to fascination with blood and guts or dead things, one or two violent or traumatic experiences as a kid and then just become psycho as they downward spiral mentally </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the media stopped covering serial killers because it bred more serial killers. Just look at the current news with all these mass shooters. The news loves it, and makes big bucks off it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they just kind of stopped because it wasn&#39;t getting the views for it anymore because most people started to agree that the coverage was doing more harm than good. It will probably take some time for the same to happen with mass shooters, who knows. You&#39;re probably more right than wrong on that one</p>

<p>I&#39;d guess there is quite an overlap with the type of mind set serial and mass killers have and maybe with the rise of instant gratification through technology the way it manifested has changed in how these types act out. Before it was all stalk your prey, enjoy the ride and take your time. Now it&#39;s go out guns blazing and instant gratification of a giant chaos you caused all at once. </p>
