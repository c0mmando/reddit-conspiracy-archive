<p>Hillary took a hands-off approach - see Libya: Don&#39;t directly intervene, but supply rebels with arms.</p>

<p>And she continued the drone war that Trump removed judicial checks on which is causing more civilian casualties.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how Trump is continuing the same stuff, but even worse - you realize we have American troops in Syria right now yes?</p>

<p>But let&#39;s discuss the person that&#39;s not president and not Trump who is hiring former-Bush administration war criminals - see John Bolton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like every president since Kennedy (and I&#39;m not too sure about him) Trump doesn&#39;t care if there&#39;s a war or not. If he&#39;s instructed that it&#39;s in his best interest to drop a few bombs on Syria, that&#39;s what he&#39;ll do. </p>

<p>Bolton? Haley? These are amongst the most horrible people in the world. Were these monsters Donnie&#39;s idea? Unlikely. I suspect these appointments are under instruction from those who can tap Donnie on the shoulder and with a waggle of their finger, get his complete attention.</p>

<p>The media is unable to understand Trump because they think he&#39;s a politician, lucky and an idiot.  He&#39;s none of those things. He is a egocentric smart business man who spews crap, knowing precisely what he&#39;s doing. If he lies or says something idiotic and gets called on it, he doubles done by saying the same nonsense again (and likely again). It&#39;s a part of setting his negotiating position. Now, if he says something half way reasonable, people are relieved and go along with his &quot;new&quot; position. Genius? No.  Savvy? Yes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where any of this theatre will take us. It&#39;s sad and nasty.  It would be beautiful if the corrupt meddlers running things took a century or two off. Peace.</p>

<p>How. Do. You. People. Still. Believe. This. He&#39;s a complete moron and a stooge, he doesn&#39;t &quot;know exactly what he&#39;s doing&quot; he THINKS he does, which is the most dangerous type of person, and the most easy to manipulate and control. He THINKS he&#39;s the big shot in control, and he&#39;s so egocentric that he will do and parrot whatever anyone says to try and sound smart, since he does not in fact have any ideas of his own (those that he does have are insane, as per his twitter ramblings.)</p>

<p>Trump is an easily manipulated war monger (do I need to quote his rhetoric of him salivating over the military???) and the way people are trying to absolve Trump of any guilt whenever he does something he disagrees with is pathetic. </p>

<p>No one forced Trump&#39;s hand to hire these people either, he HIRED these people because they said things and do things he agrees with, are they manipulating him? Sure, but only bc he is too idiotic to do these things on his own, he still agrees wholeheartedly with these people. </p>

<p>Thats why she got a juicy foreign policy position to beef up her cress after a stint as governor. </p>

<p>She probably got it for boning trump honestly. Haley is the republocans answer to democrats running women. Now they will be able to say look we are both women.</p>

<p>My dad told me hed vote for her next election &quot;because shes hot&quot; same reason he voted for McCain /palin

    <div class="md"><p>No idea. I just have always felt trump was selected to run against Clinton to guarantee her spot. I think thats why he got more and more absurd as time went on. I think he wanted to lose so he can continue making bank but this was the debt he owed his owners that bailed him out in the 80s. I think he was pissed when he won...especially after all the scrutiny into his personal life with stormy and puss grabbing and his financials. Tptb do have to cave to publoc pressure to keep their stranglehold. Which is the russia investigation.  </p>

<p>Trump wont be named in anything. Lower folks will. Kushner is going to get a pardon and trump is going to finish out his term and let pence / hailey take over and they will win while democrats will win the Congress (probably only senate). All of this has been in the works since obamas first term. Clinton was supposed time in and now they need plan b. Which is why the candidates are both put there by the same owners. </p>

<p>Trump literally admits this when he says things like I donate to both sides to make sure I have sway with whoever wins. </p>
