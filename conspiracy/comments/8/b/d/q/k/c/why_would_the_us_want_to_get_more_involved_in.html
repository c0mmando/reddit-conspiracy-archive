       It is written by the same people who wrote the old one, Thomas Donnelly and Gary Schmitt.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time, it is being pushed by the American Enterprise Institute, a Koch brothers think tank. How libertarian could they possibly be?

       Donald Trump has been speaking language directly out of the new PNAC. Think he knows or is that just a coincidence?

       How come people in a conspiracy forum are not aware of the new PNAC?

       Thank you for the link, I honestly didn't know they were any recent publications by these crazy war mongers. The Koch Brothers huh, well it must obviously be about pushing "peace". I research all kinds of topics and sometimes get caught up on particular topics. I will admit that Donald Trump's campaign was probably the best propaganda job they've done so far.

       Long before the current conflict, way back in the olden days of 2001, there was a plan in place. General Wesley Clark testified to this.

       I heard and interesting theory today, it's to counter the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Belt_One_Road_Initiative">
        one belt one road initative by China
       </a>
       .  I have always thought it was to counter the Turkey/Syria/Qatar pipeline, but I'm beginning to suspect it has more to do with China and why the US is expanding the Afghanistan war as well.

       The shit flinging with China always amuses me. The only way we will ever compete with a nation 4x our size is to invest in education and infrastructure  here
       <em>
        at home
       </em>
       . Not wasting what precious strategic reserves of geopolitical capital and economic power we have left in colonial wars.

       Totally agree, but I see us going after China, especially in light of the new Petro Yuan.  I honestly think TPTB want a war with China and not because they are a threat, but the type of society they want.

       Yep, seems our Elites have decided that a confrontation with China is inevitable. Problem is, America can only come out the loser in such a conflict. We need to invest in transitioning to a Green economy and becoming fully energy independent. We need to make sure all our people are healthy and educated, and keep investing in higher ed to combat the rise of China.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not gonna beat China by wasting resources in the ME. We need to turn America into a powerhouse of green energy and infrastructure. We need to make sure our Higher Ed stays the best in the world. We need to make sure our People aren't dying in the streets. We need to be the "shining city on a hill" that the fool H.W. Bush claimed we were.

       The elite have made us dependent on china and turned us into a consumer market.  I'm curious to see how these Tariffs will pan out, I personally think we're so far gone since the passage of the WTO, that it's probably going to do more damage than we think.  Even now I'm having issues with normal products in construction which prices are inflating considerable.  The issues I'm seeing IRL, is the US manufacturing options are horrible (or don't exist) and don't fit the bill for construction, so now we're in a slight limbo while waiting for the Chinese products to come in.  I think Tariffs would have been great, 10+ years ago, but they have killed so many manufacturing in this country, we might be a real bad situation.

       Back in 2007 the Pentagon conducted war games that assumed a Trade War with China. They said that according to their numbers we could win, but just barely. I believe that in the last 10 years this has shifted decisively against us.

       China and the US are each others' best business partners. They couldnt go to war even though they want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       China's strategy in military, politics, and business is to play the passive aggressive role. They will only strike when they are in a position of power, but if you attack them they will defend til the last man.

       yes, but illegal expansion via island building in the South China Sea cannot be tolerated either. US needs to protects its allies over there and ensure there are no im0ediments to global trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trade war is a good course of action. there may be no winners in a trade war, but some lose more than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       China is overextended on the debt, US is their biggest customer. If they dont get the money from US customers they cant pay off their debt and the whole house of crads that is China collapses. China knows this. They are scared. Chinas military is mostly geared towards controlling their own population, not fighting a war overseas. they would fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       China's only hope is a low blow cheap shot. Fortunately for them, thats what they are best at.

       one belt one road = China needs to keep building infrastructure to avoid financial collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       One belt one road allows them to keep building pretty much forever in places like Bangladesh, Turrmenistan, Afghanistan, etc. Its also a way to launder money.

       You are asking the wrong question. Why would the people controlling the US Government want a war with Syria?
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi Arabia wants the oil
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has hated Syria since 1947
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany, and France, and the US are Puppets of Israel.

       Syria would be a trap. the Assad regime is a puppet state the deep state setup to suck in US resources to weaken them elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       it all started with Fascist Angela Merkel opening borders in the EU to let immigrants claw their way through Europe to Germany. I think her line was ' if you can get here, we will provide a home'. she did this without consulting the countries they would be going through and where they would ultimately end up. Classic NWO move. Use a fake humanitarian agenda to hide your nefarious plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest loss of things in Syria is all the history and culture. its pretty much where civilization started. there is a lot to learn there. seems that most is destryoyed though and Merkel's move ensured that all of the good people who could have preserved the culture left, and probably got raped on the way during their exodus to europe.

         Energy is power. The oil is going to run out eventually. All nations want their armies sitting atop as much of that oil as possible.

         The United States military is currently far, far superior to every other fighting force in the solar system. It may not be that way forever. From a strategic standpoint, it makes sense to accomplish medium- and long-term objectives now, rather than later.

         For this item, I think it's better to think about why Russia is involved in Syria. There are several reasons, but one of the big ones is that Syria borders Turkey, and Turkey controls access to the Black Sea. On the Black Sea sits Crimea, Russia's only port to the Middle East &amp; Med Sea. It's also the only port in all of Russia that doesn't freeze over in the winter. The entire history of Russia is basically that of an Asian kid pretending to be European. Russia needs that port to be a power-player.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may have noticed that NATO and Turkey are going through a nasty public breakup. Putin wants to be Turkey's new bestie, so he's trying to impress Turkey by keeping their backyard free of Americans. The US is there to keep Russia out.
        </p>

         It goes further than the ME. Here's the thing: Russia has a shitload of natural gas. And it's cheap as hell. NATO is doing everything they can to keep Russia from selling that gas in Europe. If nations are dependent on Russia for fuel, Russia has a lot of power. This is hitting the former Warsaw Pact countries hard, and it's why you see NATO building up their forces in those countries. It's also why the United States overthrew the democratically-elected Ukranian Government. That government was too Russia-friendly, in NATO's view. I know this sounds a little off-topic w/r/t Syria, but it's really not. It's all related. This is about power. Haven't you wondered why Germany is siding with Russia &amp; against Europe/NATO more &amp; more as time goes on?  Hint:

         The United States has a hard-on for Iran, and has for a long, long time.  I actually have no idea why this is. I've never been able to understand it. Iran supports the Houthis in Yemen, and may or may not be arming "insurgents" in Iraq and Syria. Iran probably has something to do with it. I dunno.

       The US don't really. It's zionist juice and freemasons pursuing the Oded Yinon plan. Everything else is sycophantic economic interests:

       <li>

        mass muslim deplacement to EU for the sake of destabilising social cohesion [What's bad for the goy, is good for Israel]

       <li>
        Replacement migration to provide new debt slavery fodder
       </li>
       <li>
        Increase birth rates through migrants as they want their 7 kids regardless of how shit their standard of living is
       </li>
       <li>
        Corporate overlords benefit from high supply of unskilled labour, wages are kept low and wageslavery can continue (Or rather, welfare-slavery, as in EU migrants are required to attend 'educational and training' lessons to get their welfare. The companies providing this training (subsidiaries of companies already owned by wealthy elites) bill the government (the taxpayer, aka the native European white) and make use of tax-avoidance under the guise of 'inclusivity, diversity, UN-approved good guy bonus, etc'. This is the new 'wageslavery' as it renders welfare dependant migrants helpless in a conflict of interest that will see to them NOT EVER acquiring any real or valuable education.

       Profit. The US military budget is 700 billion. That is completely insane. It was 500 billion at the height of the Iraq war, while Afghanistan was still very much ongoing. Needless to say, there are a lot of people, and giant corporations, relying on military contracts as well as arms sales. The pipeline issue is in the background, as well as the Petrodollar connection with Saudi Arabia, and Israels desire to quash Assad yet overall I would pin this 51% on the merchants of war making their bonuses. Syria, Iran, N. Korea, Venezuela, Russia, China, and other paper tigers provide the Military Industrial Complex an excuse to keep devouring that sweet tax money and this is just the next payday. Unfortunately this time it might prove difficult for US troops as Russia is not a force that will fold easily (if it escalates that far).
