<p>Why is it so hard for the average person to realize this is no longer their country? This isn’t the America their grandparents grew up in.</p>

<p>We simply live in a land that is occupied and ruled by hostile foreigners who use America’s corpse to do all of their dirty work and when it’s no longer of any use, they will finally finish the job and destroy the country — probably through war or major economic collapse.</p>

<p>America as we know it will be gone within 10 years. Book it.</p>

<p>Congratulations, your country is dying a slow, painful death all because no one wants to do what’s necessary out of fear of being labeled that one bad word.</p>

<p>My grandfather worked in the Steel Mills for 27 years after the war before retiring with a pension. I have his hard hat on my bookshelf. It serves a reminder of this fact every day and every time I look at it.</p>

<p>People fail to realize what has happened because they fail to realize that those who claim to be the arbiters of Truth and information, the MSM, are liars. They have faith in institutions be it CNN, MSNBC, Fox, ABC, WaPo, NYT, LAT, etc; they don&#39;t realize just how far things have fallen.</p>

<p>That&#39;s partly generational.   Old folks grew up on Cronkite,  who ended up showing us he was scum,  but most people missed that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Paley&#39;s own friendship with Allen Dulles is now known to have been one of the most influential and significant in the communications industry. He provided cover for CIA agents, supplied out-takes of news film, permitted the debriefing of reporters, and in many ways set the standard for the cooperation between the CIA and the major broadcast companies which lasted until the mid-1970s (sic). But in 1948, despite the mutual intelligence connections, when Hayes and Graham asked to buy WTOP-CBS radio, Paley had refused to sell. Within a year, though, an arrangement was worked out, Dulles having spoken of Graham and Hayes to Paley, and fifty-five percent of the WTOP stock was transferred to the Post Company. Wayne Coy at the FCC approved the license reassignment, and CBS and the Post began sharing their Washington news staffs (reporters then worked interchangeably for print and broadcast). In 1950 Phil then bought a small Washington television station, license approved by Wayne Coy, and changed its call letters to WTOP-TV; it became a CBS affiliate. That year he and Hayes also hired a news analyst who for two years after the war had been chief correspondent for United Press International in Moscow, a man who had experience with American intelligence and was also endowed with a good television presence; the man&#39;s name was Walter Cronkite. He soon worked his way onto the network staff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Paley sold the remaining WTOP stock to Phil in 1953, a year before Wayne Coy died, giving the Washington Post company complete control over the CBS radio and television outlets in Washington, which it retained until required by law to sell the television station in 1977. The Post men continued to see Paley and Cronkite every Christmas at a dinner given by Allen Dulles at a private club called the Alibi. The club is in an old, dark, red brick townhouse in the middle of downtown Washington, the only house on a block of office buildings. It bears a simple brass plaque and brass doorknob; membership is limited to men in or close to intelligence and is by invitation only.&quot; (pp. 175-176)</p>

<h2>*Davis on MOCKINGBIRD: &quot;Wisner began wide-scale recruitment of foreign students and infiltration of labor unions. But he wanted something more, a way not only to subvert and disrupt, but to give foreign peoples a sense of America, to ‘alter their perceptions&#39; against Communism without violence; and the publisher Philip Graham helped him conceive of a way to use journalists for that objective. Intelligence agencies had used journalists before, but the practice had remained haphazard. This, however, was to be a formal program, structured and run according to high-level policy. The program had the code name Operation MOCKINGBIRD.&quot;(p. 129)</h2>

<p>&quot;By the early 1950s, Wisner had implemented his plan and ‘owned&#39; respected members of the New York Times, Newsweek, CBS, and other communications vehicles, plus stringers, four to six hundred in all, according to a former CIA analyst who worked with MOCKINGBIRD. Each journalist was a separate ‘operation,&#39; requiring a code name, a field supervisor, and a field office, at an annual cost of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars--there has never been an accurate accounting. Some of these journalists thought of themselves as helpers of the Agency, some simply as patriots who wanted to run stories that would benefit their country.</p>

<p>Cronkite was not willing to debate the outcome of the Warren Commission even when it had been largely discredited.</p>

<p>Cronkite followed his own advice,   he joined the wealthy elite with the hope that he brought a positive influence.    Unfortunately he was mostly used,  and also had a repugnant part in the McCarthy purges.</p>

<p>1) Cronkite didn&#39;t debate the outcome of the Warren Commission</p>

<p>2)Cronkite joined the wealthy elite</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying he&#39;s scum because he didn&#39;t challenge a government report that you (and I for that matter) didn&#39;t like, and because he got rich. I guess my bar for what makes someone scum is a little higher than yours.</p>

Sure,  they had their arguments over Vietnam and left vs right,   but its a club,  and you and I are not in it.    The &quot;merit&quot; it takes to join that club is to sell out.</p>

<p>I just want to throw out there that it kinda actually was the same America back then. They were lied to then, too. The fake moon landing, JFK, Titanic, Vietnam, the Japan nuclear bomb attacks that were fucking avoidable, the Banana wars, the govt pounding sovereign countries to the benefit of U-Fruit-Co. This country has been at war 98% of it&#39;s entire existence, for one main reason - multinational corporate dominance of resources globally. The political system is just a puppet show.</p>

Your obsession with the jews is really too much and should be taken back a notch. And before you claim modern politics  I do know the present danger Israel is at the moment and how the geopolitical game is being played out at the Bilderberg Group.</p>

<p>But they didn&#39;t do a thing to influence the civil war which again for the third time please show me a link to prove me otherwise and ill happily read about it. Which is all I want I&#39;ve looked i found it no where on the web no where on conspiracy forums just you claiming it to be true </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice straw man. </p>

<p>&quot;Higher education&quot; has become a complete scam. Modern universities are Marxist indoctrination camps that leave you saddled with debt and no better able to get a job or make a living. If you want affordable education that will actually make a difference in your life then go to a vocational school and learn a trade. You&#39;ll be out making money in half the time with a fraction of the debt of a conventional university.</p>

<p>I see you seem to be calling for further restriction of the second amendment. That means you&#39;re part of the problem. I mean, how else are globalists going to force us to accept waves of third world migrants that hate our culture and want to replace us if we have guns? They can&#39;t, and they won&#39;t despite what some shaven headed cuban commie says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criticisms of crony capitialism is the one thing that leftists do get right. Except then they go right back to eating their own boogers by insinuating that Marxism or any of its bottom feeding, authoritarian variants would be any better. In fact the problem is much deeper than economic systems. It&#39;s modern civilization as a whole. </p>

<p>We&#39;re living in artificially crafted cities, consuming poisoned food and water, isolating ourselves with social media, being bombarded with radio frequencies from cell phones and wifi that are slowly giving us cancer, and destroying the planet with our greed. Fortunately this can not and will not last. </p>

<p>There is no fixing the current system. We&#39;re too far gone. Modern civilization will collapse one way or another. We will return to a more natural state of self sufficiency. Then those who are left will be able to remake the world in their own image.</p>

Let me go dig up the comment I made months ago even though I really don&#39;t want to waste the time. One ex-spy turncoat who was willing to say/do anything to save his own skin isn&#39;t proof of some massive scheme or plot by cultural &quot;marxists&quot; and communists and no old tape from the 1970s is proof of anything. America isn&#39;t beseiged by communists but by rightwing and center-right pro-capitalists telling you that the enemy is <em>insert Boogeyman</em> so you won&#39;t pay attention to the real enemy: Themselves. It is akin to neocons and neoliberals and the current Russiaphobia and red scare where if you actually question the narrative and think critically then you are somehow a &quot;Putin puppet&quot; or &quot;Russian spy/bot&quot;.
