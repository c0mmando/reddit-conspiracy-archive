Nowadays, all people to is &quot;chatter&quot;. We know that the media lies, we know that Israel influences the United States actions in Syria and uses us for their gain without regards to OUR personal well being and safety, we know that our government is corrupt as shit, and yet we do nothing about it. Few are up in arms trying to do something. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, what&#39;s going on here is great. This is good information and a great resource, but the problem is is that nothing is being done!!!</p>

<p>My biggest fear is that we, the United States, get into some huge war because Israel makes us fuck around in the Middle East too much. We stand NOTHING to gain from there, and yet we are there for them, our &quot;greatest allies&quot;. </p>

<p>What happened to getting up and doing something instead of just being mad about it online???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, complacency has permeated the soul of 90%(random, but high number) of people. Those that want to create change on a large scale probably don&#39;t have the numbers to do it. </p>

<p>Also, I think with the sharp rise in  technology users, there are enough distractions for everyone to turn a blind eye to the evil being done in the world. TV, social media, YouTube, video games. Without the prevalence of these items-plus others that I failed to name-, I think the world would be a lot different. Or maybe there would be replacements for these, and nothing would have changed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The AIPAC Policy Conference is the pro-Israel community&#39;s preeminent annual gathering. The event attracts more than 18,000 community and student activists from all 50 states, and more than half of the Senate, a third of the House of Representatives and countless Israeli and American policymakers and thought leaders.Over three jam-packed days, Policy Conference participants choose from hundreds of informative sessions and participate in the pro-Israel community&#39;s largest and most important advocacy day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a jewish &quot;problem&quot; but a matter of zionists in both Isreal and the US, pandering to one another or colluding because of mutual interests. </p>

<p>When Israel lobbies in other countries, like the UK, (some of their represantatives seemingly using underhanded tactics sometimes to accomplish what they want), it shows they have influence that starts to work against the native people of said countries in order to support Israel interests and side with them on conflicts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your litmus test for &quot;how things used to be&quot;? Civil rights protests (a race of people openly discriminated against for their skin colour)? Vietnam (young people being drafted to go fight in a pointless war)?</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t as such a clear cut discrimination, and no one is being drafted to go to war. Society at large is much nicer than it was, although you may disagree.</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably a fancy word for this, but you&#39;re suffering from a historic bias: you&#39;re viewing history as a chain of huge, society changing events. Believe it or not, there were dull days (and weeks and months and years) in between those big events you&#39;ve read about where dick-all happened. There weren&#39;t huge protests. People just lived their lives. People went to work, went home, watched tv, and talked about inane shit. But that doesn&#39;t reach the history books.</p>

<p>You&#39;re living a lot of dick-all days, just like they did. You don&#39;t know what&#39;s historically significant until it&#39;s in a history book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah when i realized how the world worked intuitively as a child i was ostracized and isolated. That was in the 90s before the internet was what it became in the early 2000s.

<p>&quot;A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah I know what you mean about the lighthouse. It&#39;s interesting how we never find out what Helmholtz&#39;s life was like when he was in isolation. I guess we will never know. I kind of prefer it that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The technology shifted.  It used to be that countries relied on drafting large armies from the population, and more importantly relied on the general population for labor.  That changed into a society that relies on specialized technical labor and highly trained soldiers and developed weapons tech.  It would be quite impossible to have modern technology without some sort of totalitarian ideology dominating.  (Even the so-called &quot;libertarian&quot; ideology is totalitarian - never mind that American lolberts are a transparent joke.)</p>

<p>There are cracks here and there; the university and education system try hard to enforce intellectual totalitarianism and scientism, even though knowledge ought to be widely accessible with our present technology, but that totalitarianism is ultimately in place because of the military calculus where a scientific dictatorship would casually democide parts of the population with little difficulty.</p>

<p>All of that aside; what do you think a strike is, if not a revolt?  There is literally no way you can retain capitalism and not have a totalitarian regime; too much wealth is concentrated in the hands of the very rich and corporations, and even if you somehow overthrew the US regime, if you retain property rights the rich capitalists will just collude and, out of necessity, enforce totalitarian policies to defend the property of the rich against the masses.</p>

<p>However, even if you did abolish capitalism somehow, it is very likely that socialism would take a totalitarian shape because of what technology demands, and until that balance of power shifts in the technology the educated specialists will demand - and be able to demand with power - special privileges and status, thus recreating class society along different lines.</p>
