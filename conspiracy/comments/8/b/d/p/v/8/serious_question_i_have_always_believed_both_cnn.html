<p>Like I said, it is to gain the Trust of their viewers. They will tell just enough Truth to get you to believe that they always tell the Truth, so that they can shove the lies down your throat when it comes time to do so. The Free Press is mostly dead in this country, it&#39;s all Corporate Media. These so called &quot;journalists&quot; are nothing but talking heads, patronized with a job from their Corporate bosses. </p>

<p>This is it really, they are the back up plan for the people that are to &quot;redpilled&quot; for the rest of the MSM.</p>

<p>Trump was good friends with Epstein a known occultic pedophile billionaire and is an old friend of the Clintons.</p>

They remember it as a &quot;fact&quot; they learned, but not necessarily that it was from a questionable source, which is worrisome if your only reason for thinking a piece of information was unreliable was the source you heard it from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FOX was more legit. It became more legit when Murdoch spun it off from his parent company. Murdoch is basically Soros.</p>

<p>That said, FOX news is now infiltrated again sarting about last week, maybe 2 weeks ago. Cant trust any source these days except:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Q</p></li>
<li><p>Trump</p></li>
<li><p>Wikileaks (Julian Assange)</p></li>
<li><p>certain people on twitter and youtube</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Zerohedge, politico, and truepundit are all infested with disinformation rat whores starting from a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>However, there are a few ways you can mine the truths from all the disinformation bile spewing out of virtually every media source these days. Not gonna get into the details but it involves, triangulation across sources, looking at how stories change, paying attention to what is not being said, and most importantly good ole&#39; common sense with a healthy serving of grounded intuition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe WikiLeaks releases real information, but I wouldn’t say I trust them. They could easily be sitting on a bunch of other information which they choose not to release because of whatever bias they have.</p>

<p>Or maybe Trump told Assange he would pardon him if Assange vouched for Trump.</p>

<p>We don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes, and if anything WikiLeaks should stand as a testament to that fact.</p>

<p>When you say WikiLeaks backs trump, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Also I’ll say again, your top two picks for most trusted are <strong>the president</strong> and <strong>an anon from 4chan</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t like Hillary either but cmon there have to be more trustworthy sources for a conspiracy theorist than these two. At least put WL as #1, ya know?</p>

<p>But hey, you said Trump’s strategy and Q’s drops, which strategy which drops? Because I asked you that just now and I’d think it would be an easy one to answer, but apparently not. This makes me wonder if there really is a good reason to trust these two, or if it’s just because what they say conforms to your bias.</p>

<p>Which Trump strategies? Which Q drops?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if assange is not publishing something he has it is for one or several of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>will get him in too much trouble</p></li>
<li><p>it will be counterproductive to the big picture</p></li>
<li><p>the public isnt ready for it</p></li>
<li><p>he doesnt have enough evidence to be 100% sure</p></li>
<li><p>other legit reason that im too lazy to expound on</p></li>
</ol>

<p>re your other queries, the opportunity cost of explaining all the big picture shit and strategies is too high to get into here. If what I said resonated, just look at q posts cross referencing timestamps with trump tweets and MSM articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because FOX tells you the truth with bias while others literally make up shit and twist and turn and omit as much truth as possible.   Here&#39;s a handful of examples of leftwing news propaganda.  Find me something remotely close to it from FOX or other rightwing news sites.  You can argue they over exaggerate effects of mass immigration or too many posts on muslim assaults or sex gangs or some other bias, but those are still true things happening.    That cant be said for CNN and their ilk.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/KEV9Ark">Zimmerman Dispatch Transcript</a> - Media had access to this in written and audio form.  They edited the audio to cut out dispatch and half of Zimmerman&#39;s dialogue to make it sound like he was racist and knew he was black and was out to kill him for racial reasons.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/CaPbbi1">Computer scientists found evidence of hacking</a> - title and focus of piece is explicitly debunked later in article, a common tactic.  Basically, fear monger and push a narrative.  People hear general discussion or see title and subheadings stating one thing, but don&#39;t read entire article and see their statement that covers their ass for being sued.   Literally fake news.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/XNt7YZt">LITERALLY fake news</a> - if you don&#39;t have news, make it.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/YAQrSvO">Sinatra&#39;s daughter on her father&#39;s song being used by trump</a> - she actually doesn&#39;t support trump, so cnn thought they could just run a made up story and quote and she&#39;d go along with it as she was anti-trump.   Fake news they made up with no source.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/SGsKayS">Russia dossier corroborated!</a> - except it wasn&#39;t.  Another &#39;put it in headlines, discuss like it is true, but cover our ass at bottom of the article or edit in the correction later&#39;.    Fake news.  Fake narrative.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gitqlAC">Japanese PM&#39;s wife forced to go solo because Trump and his wife ignored them</a> - oh wait, they were actually seen together and the story is completely made up.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/nIB2AeN">Town hall protesters across America upset with Trump</a> - completely dishonest story.  There are numerous like this for various areas.  This image shows the voter turn outs for the area they wrote about.  They claim the people are revolting and upset with Trump and completely ignore the real story that they know - it was a landslide victory for a republican and the area is fully supporting republicans.   The people that were protesting were paid protesters that came in with out of state plates on their vehicles, had signs and all shouted and wouldn tlet anyone speak or discuss the issues.  This was happening in many areas at the time and they played it as complete lies and refused to report the real issues - paid disrupters.    </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/WmzSKxx">Iran protesting Trump</a> - another lie by omission - they know they have this anti-America protest rally every year and in the same place.  They&#39;ve reported on it before.   yet it was an anti-trump rally by foreigners now.   Not death to americans and other hate but now a peaceful rally against oppression and all things trump.   Fake news.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/WVfKQQd">Kellyanne Conway taking picture on couch</a> - this was a huge deal somehow and played as if she was being some sloppy, disrespectful and uncouth woman when she took her shoes off so she wouldn&#39;t dirty the couch and could take a photo of everyone.   A literal non-story that dominated the news cycle for a day or two, yet was completely fabricated and another lie by omission of what was really happening.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/qkiRqjR">Blacks riot and burn down neighbourhood, cousin condemns violence</a> - feel good story of blacks coming together after evil whites killed them, except completely fabricated and another omit context and words and edit audio to lie to the public and hide the evil of these people that care only about themselves - just go burn white neighbourhoods down.    </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/IRQy9id">Even simple things are lied about, yet proven true in the next breathe</a> - In what world is 37.4% not &#39;almost 40%&#39;?  Where could he possibly have gotten that stat?  How can they even say this with a straight face?  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/mC8IeOu">Trump on veterans - aren&#39;t strong, cant handle it</a> - this was the one that really made me angry even reading and when I first really took notice of trump as a candidate.   They fucking have the transcripts, they have the audio, many press were fucking there.  They know he was at a military event and directly addressing the military and how they all loved the speech and candidness of trump in addressing mental health and ptsd and how they were failing the veterans and needed to do better.  Yet the fucking liars all smeared him in the papers and turned it into a complete farce.   Trump has many faults, but this was just too fucking much for me.   </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/mt8gvL4">Associated Press - no bias at all</a> - They have guidelines that are required to have news accepted and posted and control much of news in world on wirelines and so on.   How does this even happen?  It&#39;s near identical amounts, yet one is a listed with praise and other is associated with soaring deficits.   It&#39;s news, it should be &#39;this is the amount for spending budget&#39; from both of them, yet the fucking AP has vested interests and their own slant.   </p>

<p>This could go on forever.   I&#39;ve honestly tried to find anything remotely similar from even shit like Breitbart or fringe sites.  You can go to full nutjob sites and find retarded right leaning bullshit, but actual news sites?  Some bias, some careful wording, but outright fucking lies?  Completely made up?  Like even going back to Obama birth certificate stuff - that was real.  There were issues with his birth certificate and he lists as an exchange student in year books for college and so on.  They didn&#39;t make it up.  You could argue its over played or bullshit not worth the effort, but it was still real.   Most of this stuff above?  The left literally lies and makes up news or edits it to be completely different context.  They turned two black criminals killed by police into martyrs and good bois that dindunuffin and painted innocent men as racists and out for blood and broadcast it to the public in good faith.  It&#39;s sedition and they should be held accountable.  </p>

They remember it as a &quot;fact&quot; they learned, but not necessarily that it was from a questionable source, which is worrisome if your only reason for thinking a piece of information was unreliable was the source you heard it from. </p>
