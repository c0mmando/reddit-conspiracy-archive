        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>HP Blavatsky ISIS Unveiled Vol 2 Page 381-392(1877):&quot;As to the modern Knights Templar and those Masonic Lodges which now claim a direct descent from the ancient Templars, their persecution by the Church was a farce from the beginning. They have not, nor have they ever had any secrets, dangerous to the Church. Quite the contrary; for we find J. G. Findel saying that the Scottish degrees, or the Templar system, only dates from 1735-1740, and &quot;following its Catholic tendency, took up its chief residence in the Jesuit College of Clermont, in Paris, and hence was called the Clermont system.&quot; The present Swedish system has also something of the Templar element in it, but free from Jesuits and interference with politics; however, it asserts that it has Molay&#39;s Testament in the original, for a Count Beaujeu, a nephew of Molay, never heard of elsewhere — says Findel — transplanted Templarism into Freemasonry, and thus procured for his uncle&#39;s ashes a mysterious sepulchre. It is sufficient to prove this a Masonic fable that on this pretended monument the day of Molay&#39;s funeral is represented as March 11, 1313, while the day of his death was March 19, 1313. This spurious production, which is neither genuine Templarism, nor genuine Freemasonry, has never taken firm root in Germany. But the case is otherwise in France.</p>

<p>Writing upon this subject, we must hear what Wilcke has to say of these pretensions:</p>

<p>&quot;The present Knight Templars of Paris will have it, that they are direct descendants from the ancient Knights, and endeavor to prove this by documents, interior regulations, and secret doctrines. Foraisse says the Fraternity of Freemasons was founded in Egypt, Moses communicating the secret teaching to the Israelites, Jesus to the Apostles, and thence it found its way to the Knight Templars. Such inventions are necessary . . . to the assertion that the Parisian Templars are the offspring of the ancient order. All these asseverations, unsupported by history, were fabricated in the High Chapter of Clermont (Jesuits), and preserved by the Parisian Templars as a legacy left them by those political revolutionists, the Stuarts and the Jesuits.&quot; Hence we find the Bishops Gregoire* and Munter** supporting them.</p>

<p>Connecting the modern with the ancient Templars, we can at best, therefore, allow them an adoption of certain rites and ceremonies of purely ecclesiastical character after they had been cunningly inoculated into that grand and antique Order by the clergy. Since this desecration, it gradually lost its primitive and simple character, and went fast to its final ruin. Founded in 1118 by the Knights Hugh de Payens and Geoffrey de St. Omer, nominally for the protection of the pilgrims, its true aim was the restoration of the primitive secret worship. The true version of the history of Jesus, and the early Christianity was imparted to Hugh de Payens, by the Grand-Pontiff of the Order of the Temple (of the Nazarene or Johanite sect), one named Theocletes, after which it was learned by some Knights in Palestine, from the higher and more intellectual members of the St. John sect, who were initiated into its mysteries.* Freedom of intellectual thought and the restoration of one and universal religion was their secret object. Sworn to the vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, they were at first the true Knights of John the Baptist, crying in the wilderness and living on wild honey and locusts. Such is the tradition and the true kabalistic version.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to state that the Order became only later anti-Catholic. It was so from the beginning, and the red cross on the white mantle, the vestment of the Order, had the same significance as with the initiates in every other country. It pointed to the four quarters of the compass, and was the emblem of the universe.** When, later, the Brotherhood was transformed into a Lodge, the Templars had, in order to avoid persecution, to perform their own ceremonies in the greatest secresy, generally in the hall of the chapter, more frequently in isolated caves or country houses built amidst woods, while the ecclesiastical form of worship was carried on publicly in the chapels belonging to the Order.</p>

<p>Though of the accusations brought against them by order of Philip IV., many were infamously false, the main charges were certainly correct, from the stand-point of what is considered by the Church, heresy. The present-day Templars, adhering strictly as they do to the Bible, can hardly claim descent from those who did not believe in Christ, as God-man, or as the Saviour of the world; who rejected the miracle of his birth, and those performed by himself; who did not believe in transubstantiation, the saints, holy relics, purgatory, etc. The Christ Jesus was, in their opinion, a false prophet, but the man Jesus a Brother. They regarded John the Baptist as their patron, but never viewed him in the light in which he is presented in the Bible. They reverenced the doc-trines of alchemy, astrology, magic, kabalistic talismans, and adhered to the secret teachings of their chiefs in the East. &quot;In the last century,&quot; says Findel, &quot;when Freemasonry erroneously supposed herself the daughter of Templarism, great pains were taken to regard the Order of Knights-Templars as innocent. . . . For this purpose not only legends and unrecorded events were fabricated, but pains were taken to repress the truth. The Masonic admirers of the Knights-Templars bought up the whole of the documents of the lawsuit published by Moldenwaher, because they proved the culpability of the Order.&quot;*</p>

<p>This culpability consisted in their &quot;heresy&quot; against the Roman Catholic Church. While the real &quot;Brothers&quot; died an ignominious death, the spurious Order which tried to step into their shoes became exclusively a branch of the Jesuits under the immediate tutelage of the latter. True-hearted, honest Masons, ought to reject with horror any connection, let alone descent from these.</p>

<p>&quot;The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,&quot; writes Commander Gourdin,** &quot;sometimes called the Knights Hospitallers, and the Knights of Malta, were not Freemasons. On the contrary, they seem to have been inimical to Freemasonry, for in 1740, the Grand Master of the Order of Malta caused the Bull of Pope Clement XII. to be published in that island, and forbade the meetings of the Freemasons. On this occasion several Knights and many citizens left the island; and in 1741, the Inquisition persecuted the Freemasons at Malta. The Grand Master proscribed their assemblies under severe penalties, and six Knights were banished from the island in perpetuity for having assisted at a meeting. In fact, unlike the Templars, they had not even a secret form of reception. Reghellini says that he was unable to procure a copy of the secret Ritual of the Knights of Malta. The reason is obvious — there was none!&quot;</p>

<p>And yet American Templarism comprises three degrees. 1, Knight of the Red Cross; 2, Knight Templar; and 3, Knight of Malta. It was introduced from France into the United States, in 1808, and the first Grand Encampment General was organized on June 20, 1816, with Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York, as Grand Master.</p>

<p>This inheritance of the Jesuits should hardly be boasted of. If the Knights Templar desire to make good their claims, they must choose between a descent from the &quot;heretical,&quot; anti-Christian, kabalistic, primitive Templars, or connect themselves with the Jesuits, and nail their tesselated carpets directly on the platform of ultra-Catholicism! Otherwise, their claims become a mere pretense.</p>

<p>So impossible does it become for the originators of the ecclesiastical pseudo-order of Templars, invented, according to Dupuy, in France, by the adherents of the Stuarts, to avoid being considered a branch of the Order of the Jesuits, that we are not surprised to see an anonymous author, rightly suspected of belonging to the Jesuit Chapter at Clermont, publishing a work in 1751, in Brussels, on the lawsuit of the Knights Templar. In this volume, in sundry mutilated notes, additions, and commentaries, he represents the innocence of the Templars of the accusation of &quot;heresy,&quot; thus robbing them of the greatest title to respect and admiration that these early free-thinkers and martyrs have won!</p>

<p>This last pseudo-order was constituted at Paris, on the 4th of November, 1804, by virtue of a forged Constitution, and ever since it has &quot;contaminated genuine Freemasonry,&quot; as the highest Masons themselves tell us. La Charte de transmission (tabula aurea Larmenii) presents the outward appearance of such extreme antiquity &quot;that Gregoire confesses that if all the other relics of the Parisian treasury of the Order had not silenced his doubts as to their ancient descent, the sight of this charter would at the very first glance have persuaded him.&quot;* The first Grand Master of this spurious Order was a physician of Paris, Dr. Fahre-Palaprat, who assumed the name of Bernard Raymond.</p>

<p>Count Ramsay, a Jesuit, was the first to start the idea of the Templars being joined to the Knights of Malta. Therefore, we read from his pen the following:</p>

<p>&quot;Our forefathers (! ! !), the Crusaders, assembled in the Holy Land from all Christendom, wished to unite in a fraternity embracing all nations, that when bound together, heart and soul, for mutual improvement, they might, in the course of time, represent one single intellectual people.&quot;</p>

<p>This is why the Templars are made to join the St. John&#39;s Knights, and the latter got into the craft of Masonry known as St. John&#39;s Masons.</p>

<p>In the Sceau Rompu, in 1745, we find, therefore, the following most impudent falsehood, worthy of the Sons of Loyola: &quot;The lodges were dedicated to St. John, because the Knights-Masons had in the holy wars in Palestine joined the Knights of St. John.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1743, the Kadosh degree was invented at Lyons (so writes Thory, at least), and &quot;it represents the revenge of the Templars.&quot; And here we find Findel saying that &quot;the Order of Knights Templars had been abolished in 1311, and to that epoch they were obliged to have recourse when, after the banishment of several Knights from Malta, in 1740, because they were Freemasons, it was no longer possible to keep up a connection with the Order of St. John, or Knights of Malta, then in the plenitude of their power under the sovereignty of the Pope.&quot;</p>

<p>Turning to Clavel, one of the best Masonic authorities, we read: &quot;It is clear that the erection of the French Order of the Knight Templars is not more ancient than the year 1804, and that it cannot lay any legitimate claim to being the continuation of the so-called society of &#39;la petite Resurrection des Templiers,&#39; nor this latter, either, extend back to the ancient Order of the Knights Templars.&quot; Therefore, we see these pseudo-Templars, under the guidance of the worthy Father Jesuits, forging in Paris, 1806, the famous charter of Larmenius. Twenty years later, this nefast and subterranean body, guiding the hand of assassins, directed it toward one of the best and greatest princes in Europe, whose mysterious death, unfortunately for the interests of truth and justice, has never been — for political reasons — investigated and proclaimed to the world as it ought to have been. It is this prince, a Freemason himself, who was the last depository of the secrets of the true Knights Templar. For long centuries these had remained unknown and unsuspected. Holding their meetings once every thirteen years, at Malta, and their Grand Master advising the European brothers of the place of rendezvous but a few hours in advance, these representatives of the once mightiest and most glorious body of Knights assembled on the fixed day, from various points of the earth. Thirteen in number, in commemoration of the year of the death of Jacques Molay (1313), the now Eastern brothers, among whom were crowned heads, planned together the future religious and political fate of the nations; while the Popish Knights, their murderous and bastard successors, slept soundly in their beds, without a dream disturbing their guilty consciences.</p>

<p>&quot;And yet,&quot; says Rebold, &quot;notwithstanding the confusion they had created (1736-72), the Jesuits had accomplished but one of their designs, viz.: denaturalyzing and bringing into disrepute the Masonic Institution. Having succeeded, as they believed, in destroying it in one form, they were determined to use it in another. With this determination, they arranged the systems styled &#39;Clerkship of the Templars,&#39; an amalgamation of the different histories, events, and characteristics of the crusades mixed with the reveries of the alchemists. In this combination Catholicism governed all, and the whole fabrication moved upon wheels, representing the great object for which the Society of Jesus was organized.&quot;*</p>

<p>Hence, the rites and symbols of Masonry which though &quot;Pagan&quot; in origin, are all applied to and all flavor of Christianity. A Mason has to declare his belief in a personal God, Jehovah, and in the Encampment degrees also in Christ, before he can be accepted in the Lodge, while the Johanite Templars believed in the unknown and invisible Principle, whence proceeded the Creative Powers misnamed gods, and held to the Nazarene version of Ben-Panther being the sinful father of Jesus, who thus proclaimed himself &quot;the son of god and of humanity.&quot;* This also accounts for the fearful oaths of the Masons taken on the Bible, and for their lectures servilely agreeing with the Patriarcho-Biblical Chronology. In the American Order of Rose Croix, for instance, when the neophyte approaches the altar, the &quot;Sir Knights are called to order, and the captain of the guard makes his proclamation.&quot; &quot;To the glory of the sublime architect of the universe (Jehovah-Binah?), under the auspices of the Sovereign Sanctuary of Ancient and Primitive Freemasonry,&quot; etc., etc. Then the Knight Orator strikes 1 and tells the neophyte that the antique legends of Masonry date back FORTY centuries; claiming no greater antiquity for the oldest of them than 622 A.M., at which time he says Noah was born. Under the circumstances this will be regarded as a liberal concession to chronological preferences. After that Masons** are apprised that it was about the year 2188 B.C., that Mizraim led colonies into Egypt, and laid the foundation of the Kingdom of Egypt, which kingdom lasted 1,663 years (! ! !). Strange chronology, which, if it piously conforms with that of the Bible, disagrees entirely with that of history. The mythical nine names of the Deity, imported into Egypt, according to the Masons, only in the twenty-second century B.C., are found on monuments reckoned twice as old by the best Egyptologists. Nevertheless we must take at the same time into consideration, that the Masons are themselves ignorant of these names.</p>

<p>The simple truth is that modern Masonry is a sadly different thing from what the once universal secret fraternity was in the days when the Brahma-worshippers of the AUM, exchanged grips and passwords with the devotees of TUM, and the adepts of every country under the sun were &quot;Brothers.&quot;</p>

<p>What was then that mysterious name, that mighty &quot;word&quot; through whose potency the Hindu as well as the Chaldean and Egyptian initiate performed his wonders? In chapter cxv. of the Egyptian Funeral Ritual, entitled &quot;The chapter of coming out to the Heaven . . . and of knowing the Spirits of An&quot; (Heliopolis), Horus says: &quot;I knew the Spirits of An. The greatly glorious does not pass over it . . . unless the gods give me the WORD.&quot; In another hymn the soul, transformed, exclaims: &quot;Make road for me to Rusta. I am the Great One, dressed as the Great One. I have come! I have come! Delicious to me are the kings of Osiris. I am creating the water (through the power of the Word). . . . Have I not seen the hidden secrets . . . I have given truth to the Sun. I am clear. I am adored for my purity&quot; (cxvii. — cxix. The chapters of the going into and coming out from the Rusta). In another place the mummy&#39;s roll expresses the following: &quot;I am the Great God (spirit) existing of myself, the creator of His Name. . . . I know the name of this Great God that is there.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus is accused by his enemies of having wrought miracles, and shown by his own apostles to have expelled demons by the power of the INEFFABLE NAME. The former firmly believed that he had stolen it in the Sanctuary. &quot;And he cast the spirits with his word . . . and healed all that were sick&quot; (Matthew xviii. 16). When the Jewish rulers ask Peter (Acts iv. 7): &quot;By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?&quot; Peter replies, &quot;By the NAME of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.&quot; But does this mean the name of Christ, as the interpreters would make us believe; or does it signify, &quot;&#39;by the NAME which was in the possession of Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; the initiate, who was accused by the Jews to have learned it but who had it really through initiation? Besides, he states repeatedly that all that he does he does in &quot;His Father&#39;s Name,&quot; not in his own.</p>

<p>But who of the modern Masons has ever heard it pronounced? In their own Ritual, they confess that they never have. The &quot;Sir Orator&quot; tells the &quot;Sir Knight,&quot; that the passwords which he received in the preceding degrees are all &quot;so many corruptions&quot; of the true name of God engraved on the triangle; and that therefore they have adopted a &quot;substitute&quot; for it. Such also is the case in the Blue Lodge, where the Master, representing King Solomon, agrees with King Hiram that the Word * * * &quot;shall be used as a substitute for the Master&#39;s word, until wiser ages shall discover the true one.&quot; What Senior Deacon, of all the thousands who have assisted in bringing candidates from darkness to light; or what Master who has whispered this mystic &quot;word&quot; into the ears of supposititious Hiram Abiffs, while holding them on the five points of fellowship, has suspected the real meaning of even this substitute, which they impart &quot;at low breath&quot;? How few new-made Master Masons but go away imagining that it has some occult connection with the &quot;marrow in the bone.&quot; What do they know of that mystical personage known to some adepts as the &quot;venerable MAH,&quot; or of the mysterious Eastern Brothers who obey him, whose name is abbreviated in the first syllable of the three which compose the Masonic substitute — The MAH, who lives at this very day in a spot unknown to all but initiates, and the approaches to which are through trackless wildernesses, untrodden by Jesuit or missionary foot, for it is beset by dangers fit to appall the most courageous explorers? And yet, for generations this meaningless jingle of vowels and consonants has been repeated in noviciate ears, as though it possessed even so much potency as would deflect from its course a thistledown floating in the air! Like Christianity, Freemasonry is a corpse from which the spirit long ago fled.</p>

<p>In this connection, place may well be given to a letter from Mr. Charles Sotheran, Corresponding Secretary of the New York Liberal Club, which was received by us on the day after the date it bears. Mr. Sotheran is known as a writer and lecturer on antiquarian, mystical, and other subjects. In Masonry, he has taken so many of the degrees as to be a competent authority as regards the Craft. He is 32 three dotsA. and P. R., and P. R., 94 three dotsMemphis, K. R cross, K. Kadosh, M. M. 104, Eng., etc. He is also an initiate of the modern English Brotherhood of the Rosie Cross and other secret societies, and Masonic editor of the New York Advocate. Following is the letter, which we place before the Masons as we desire that they should see what one of their own number has to say:&quot;NEW YORK PRESS CLUB, January 11th, 1877.
&quot;In response to your letter, I willingly furnish the information desired with respect to the antiquity and present condition of Freemasonry. This I do the more cheerfully since we belong to the same secret societies, and you can thus better appreciate the necessity for the reserve which at times I shall be obliged to exhibit. You rightly refer to the fact that Freemasonry, no less than the effete theologies of the day, has its fabulous history to narrate. Clogged up as the Order has been by the rubbish and drift of absurd biblical legends, it is no wonder that its usefulness has been impaired and its work as a civilizer hampered. Fortunately the great anti-Masonic excitement that raged in the United States during a portion of this century, forced a considerable band of workers to delve into the true origin of the Craft, and bring about a healthier state of things. The agitation in America also spread to Europe and the literary efforts of Masonic authors on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Rebold, Findel, Hyneman, Mitchell, Mackenzie, Hughan, Yarker and others well-known to the fraternity, is now a matter of history. One effect of their labors has been, in a great measure, to bring the history of Masonry into an open daylight, where even its teachings, jurisprudence, and ritual are no longer secret from those of the &#39;profane,&#39; who have the wit to read as they run.
&quot;You are correct in saying that the Bible is the &#39;great light&#39; of European and American Masonry. In consequence of this the theistic conception of God and the biblical cosmogony have been ever considered two of its great corner-stones. Its chronology seems also to have been based upon the same pseudo-revelation. Thus Dr. Dalcho, in one of his treatises asserts that the principles of the Masonic Order were presented at and coeval with the creation. It is therefore not astonishing that such a pundit should go on to state that God was the first Grand Master, Adam the second, and the last named initiated Eve into the Great Mystery, as I suppose many a Priestess of Cybele and &#39;Lady&#39; Kadosh were afterward. The Rev. Dr. Oliver, another Masonic authority, gravely records what may be termed the minutes of a Lodge where Moses presided as Grand Master, Joshua as Deputy Grand Master, and Aholiab and Bezaleel as Grand Wardens! The temple at Jerusalem, which recent archaeologists have shown to be a structure with nothing like the pretended antiquity of its erection, and incorrectly called after a monarch whose name proves his mystical character, Sol-Om-On (the name of the sun in three languages), plays, as you correctly observe, a considerable share in Masonic mystery. Such fables as these, and the traditional Masonic colonization of ancient Egypt, have given the Craft the credit of an illustrious origin to which it has no right, and before whose forty centuries of legendary history, the mythologies of Greece and Rome fade into insignificance. The Egyptian, Chaldean, and other theories necessary to each fabricator of &#39;high degrees&#39; have also each had their short period of prominence. The last &#39;axe to grind&#39; has consecutively been the fruitful mother of unproductiveness.
&quot;We both agree that all the ancient priesthoods had their esoteric doctrines and secret ceremonies. From the Essenic brotherhood, an evolution of the Hindu Gymnosophists, doubtless proceeded the Solidarities of Greece and Rome as described by so-called &#39;Pagan&#39; writers. Founded on these and copying them in the matter of ritual, signs, grips, passwords, etc., were developed the mediaeval guilds. Like the present livery companies of London, the relics of the English trade-guilds, the operative Masons were but a guild of workmen with higher pretensions. From the French name &#39;Macon,&#39; derived from &#39;Mas,&#39; an old Norman noun meaning &#39;a house,&#39; comes our English &#39;Mason,&#39; a house builder. As the London companies alluded to present now and again the Freedom of the &#39;Liveries&#39; to outsiders, so we find the trade-guilds of Masons doing the same. Thus the founder of the Ashmolean Museum was made free of the Masons at Warrington, in Lancashire, England, on the 16th October, 1646. The entrance of such men as Elias Ashmole into the Operative Fraternity paved the way for the great &#39;Masonic Revolution of 1717,&#39; when SPECULATIVE Masonry came into existence. The Constitutions of 1723 and 1738, by the Masonic impostor Anderson, were written up for the newly-fledged and first Grand Lodge of &#39;Free and Accepted Masons&#39; of England, from which body all others over the world hail to-day.
&quot;These bogus constitutions, written by Anderson, were compiled about then, and in order to palm off his miserable rubbish yclept history, on the Craft, he had the audacity to state that nearly all the documents relating to Masonry in England had been destroyed by the 1717 reformers. Happily, in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, and other public institutions, Rebold, Hughan and others have discovered sufficient evidence in the shape of old Operative Masonic charges to disprove this statement.
&quot;The same writers, I think, have conclusively upset the tenability of two other documents palmed upon Masonry, namely, the spurious charter of Cologne of 1535, and the forged questions, supposed to have been written by Leylande, the antiquary,
[[Vol. 2, Page]] 390 ISIS UNVEILED.
from a MS. of King Henry VI. of England. In the last named, Pythagoras is referred to as having — &#39;formed a great lodge, at Crotona, and made many Masons, some of whom travelled into France, and there made many, from whence, in process of time, the art passed into England.&#39; Sir Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral, London, often called the &#39;Grand Master of Freemasons,&#39; was simply the Master or President of the London Operative Masons Company. If such a tissue of fable could interweave itself into the history of the Grand Lodges which now have charge of the first three symbolical degrees, it is hardly astonishing that the same fate should befall nearly all of the High Masonic Degrees which have been aptly termed &#39;an incoherent medley of opposite principles.&#39;
&quot;It is curious to note too that most of the bodies which work these, such as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Rite of Avignon, the Order of the Temple, Fessler&#39;s Rite, the &#39;Grand Council of the Emperors of the East and West — Sovereign Prince Masons,&#39; etc., etc., are nearly all the offspring of the sons of Ignatius Loyola. The Baron Hundt, Chevalier Ramsay, Tschoudy, Zinnendorf, and numerous others who founded the grades in these rites, worked under instructions from the General of the Jesuits. The nest where these high degrees were hatched, and no Masonic rite is free from their baleful influence more or less, was the Jesuit College of Clermont at Paris.
&quot;That bastard foundling of Freemasonry, the &#39;Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite,&#39; which is unrecognized by the Blue Lodges was the enunciation, primarily, of the brain of the Jesuit Chevalier Ramsay. It was brought by him to England in 1736-38, to aid the cause of the Catholic Stuarts. The rite in its present form of thirty-three degrees was reorganized at the end of the eighteenth century by some half dozen Masonic adventurers at Charleston, South Carolina. Two of these, Pirlet a tailor, and a dancing master named Lacorne, were fitting predecessors for a later resuscitation by a gentleman of the name of Gourgas, employed in the aristocratic occupation of a ship&#39;s clerk, on a boat trading between New York and Liverpool. Dr. Crucefix, alias Goss, the inventor of certain patent medicines of an objectionable character, ran the institution in England. The powers under which these worthies acted was a document claimed to have been signed by Frederick the Great at Berlin, on May 1st, 1786, and by which were revised the Masonic Constitution and Status of the High Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Rite. This paper was an impudent forgery and necessitated the issuing of a protocol by the Grand Lodges of the Three Globes of Berlin, which conclusively proved the whole arrangement to be false in every particular. On claims supported by this supposititious document, the Ancient and Accepted Rite have swindled their confiding brothers in the Americas and Europe out of thousands of dollars, to the shame and discredit of humanity.
&quot;The modern Templars, whom you refer to in your letter, are but mere magpies in peacock&#39;s plumes. The aim of the Masonic Templars is the sectarianization, or rather the Christianizing of Masonry, a fraternity which is supposed to admit the Jew, Parsee, Mahometan, Buddhist, in fact every religionist within its portals who accepts the doctrine of a personal god, and spirit-immortality. According to the belief of a section, if not all the Israelites, belonging to the Craft in America — Templarism is Jesuitism.
&quot;It seems strange, now that the belief in a personal God is becoming extinct, and that even the theologian has transformed his deity into an indescribable nondescript, that there are those who stand in the way of the general acceptation of the sublime pantheism of the primeval Orientals, of Jacob Boehme, of Spinoza. Often in the Grand Lodge and subordinate lodges of this and other jurisdictions, the old doxology is sung, with its &#39;Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,&#39; to the disgust of Israelites and free-thinking brethren, who are thus unnecessarily insulted. This could never occur in India, where the great light in a lodge may be the Koran, the Zend-Avesta, or one of the Vedas. The sectarian Christian spirit in Masonry must be put down. To-day there are German Grand Lodges which will not allow Jews to be initiated, or Israelites from foreign countries to be accepted as brethren within their jurisdiction. The French Masons have, however, revolted against this tyranny, and the Grand Orient of France does now permit the atheist and materialist to fellowship in the Craft. A standing rebuke upon the claimed universality of Masonry is the fact that the French brethren are now repudiated.
&quot;Notwithstanding its many faults — and speculative Masonry is but human, and therefore fallible — there is no institution that has done so much, and is yet capable of such great undertakings in the future, for human, religious, and political improvement. In the last century the Illuminati taught, &#39;peace with the cottage, war with the palace,&#39; throughout the length and breadth of Europe. In the last century the United States was freed from the tyranny of the mother country by the action of the Secret Societies more than is commonly imagined. Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, were Masons. And in the nineteenth century it was Grand Master Garibaldi, 33, who unified Italy, working in accordance with the spirit of the faithful brotherhood, as the Masonic, or rather carbonari, principles of &#39;liberty, equality, humanity, independence, unity,&#39; taught for years by brother Joseph Mazzini.
&quot;Speculative Masonry has much, too, within its ranks to do. One is to accept woman as a co-worker of man in the struggle of life, as the Hungarian Masons have done lately by initiating the Countess Haideck. Another important thing is also to recognize practically the brotherhood of all humanity by refusing none on account of color, race, position, or creed. The dark-skinned should not be only theoretically the brother of the light. The colored Masons who have been duly and regularly raised stand at every lodge-door in America craving admission, and they are refused. And there is South America to be conquered to a participation in the duties of humanity.
&quot;If Masonry be, as claimed, a progressive science and a school of pure religion, it should ever be found in the advance guard of civilization, not in the rear. If it be but an empirical effort, a crude attempt of humanity to solve some of the deepest problems of the race, and no more, then it must give place to fitter successors, perchance one of those that you and I know of, one that may have acted the prompter at the side of the chiefs of the Order, during its greatest triumphs, whispering to them as the daemon did in the ear of Socrates.
&quot;Yours most Sincerely,
&quot;CHARLES SOTHERAN.&quot;
Thus falls to ruins the grand epic poem of Masons, sung by so many mysterious Knights as another revealed gospel. As we see, the Temple of Solomon is being undermined and brought to the ground by its own chief &quot;Master Masons,&quot; of this century. But if, following the ingenious exoteric description of the Bible, there are yet Masons who persist in regarding it as once an actual structure, who, of the students of the esoteric doctrine will ever consider this mythic temple otherwise than an allegory, embodying the secret science? Whether or not there ever was a real temple of that name, we may well leave to archaeologists to decide; but that the detailed description thereof in 1 Kings is purely allegorical, no serious scholar, proficient in the ancient as well as mediaeval jargon of the kabalists and alchemists, can doubt. The building of the Temple of Solomon is the symbolical representation of the gradual acquirement of the secret wisdom, or magic; the erection and development of the spiritual from the earthly; the manifestation of the power and splendor of the spirit in the physical world, through the wisdom and genius of the builder. The latter, when he has become an adept, is a mightier king than Solomon himself, the emblem of the sun or Light himself — the light of the real subjective world, shining in the darkness of the objective universe. This is the &quot;Temple&quot; which can be reared without the sound of the hammer, or any tool of iron being heard in the house while it is &quot;in building.&quot;In the East, this science is called, in some places, the &quot;seven-storied,&quot; in others, the &quot;nine-storied&quot; Temple; every story answers allegorically to a degree of knowledge acquired. Throughout the countries of the Orient, wherever magic and the wisdom-religion are studied, its practitioners and students are known among their craft as Builders — for they build the temple of knowledge, of secret science. Those of the adepts who are active, are styled practical or operative Builders, while the students, or neophytes are classed as speculative or theoretical. The former exemplify in works their control over the forces of inanimate as well as animate nature; the latter are but perfecting themselves in the rudiments of the sacred science. These terms were evidently borrowed at the beginning by the unknown founders of the first Masonic guilds.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HP Blavatsky Theosophy or Jesuitism pages 1-5: &quot;Theosophy and Jesuitism are the two opposite poles: one far above, the other far below
even that stagnant marsh. One is the power of Light, the other that of Darkness.
Theosophists are slandered and reviled by the Jesuits and their adherents everywhere.
Roman Catholicism is but a name. As a Church it is a phantom of the past and a
mask. The Jesuits have practised Black Magic in its worst form, far more than any
other body of men; and to it they owe in large measure their power and influence.
The day may come when their wealth will be violently taken from them, and they
themselves mercilessly destroyed amidst the general execrations and applause of all
nations and peoples. There is a Nemesis-Karma, though often it allows Evil and Sin
to go on successfully for ages.A question will surely be asked: “Why should anyone choose between the two? Cannot
one remain in the world, a good Christian of whatever church, without gravitating
to either of these poles?” Most undeniably, one can do so, for a few more years to
come. But the cycle is rapidly approaching the last limit of its turning point. One out
of the three great churches of Christendom is split into atomic sects, whose number
increases yearly; and a house divided against itself, as is the Protestant Church —
MUST FALL.
8
The third, the Roman Catholic, the only one that has hitherto succeeded
in appearing to retain all its integrity, is rapidly decaying from within. It is honeycombed
throughout, and is being devoured by the ravenous microbes begotten by
Loyola.
It is no better now than a Dead Sea fruit, fair for some to look at, but full of the rottenness
of decay and death within. Roman Catholicism is but a name. As a Church it
is a phantom of the Past and a mask. It is absolutely and indissolubly bound up
with, and fettered by the Society of Ignatius Loyola; for, as rightly expressed by Lord
Robert Montagu, the Roman Catholic Church is now “the largest secret society in the
world, beside which Freemasonry is but a pigmy.”
9
Protestantism is slowly, insidiously,
but as surely, infected with Latinism — the new ritualistic sects of the High
Church, and such men among its clergy as Father Rivington, being undeniable evidence
of it. In fifty years more at the present rate of success of Latinism among the “upper ten,”
10 the English aristocracy will have returned to the faith of King Charles
II, and its servile copyist — mixed Society — will have followed suit. And then the
Jesuits will begin to reign alone and supreme over the Christian portions of the
globe, for they have crept even into the Greek Church.
It is vain to argue and claim a difference between Jesuitism and Roman Catholicism
proper, for the latter is now sucked into and inseparably amalgamated with the former.
We have public assurance for it in the Pastoral of 1876 by the Bishop of Cambrai.
“Clericalism, Ultramontanism and Jesuitism are one and the same thing — that
is to say, Roman Catholicism — and the distinctions between them have been created
by the enemies of religion,” says the “Pastoral.” “There was a time,” adds Monseigneur
the Cardinal, “when a certain theological opinion was commonly professed in
France concerning the authority of the Pope. . . . It was restricted to our nation, and
was of recent origin. The civil power during a century and a half imposed official instruction.
Those who professed these opinions were called Gallicans, and those who
protested were called Ultramontanes, because they had their doctrinal centre beyond
the Alps, at Rome. Today the distinction between the two schools is no longer admissible.
Theological Gallicanism can no longer exist, since this opinion has ceased to be
tolerated by the Church. It has been solemnly condemned, past all return, by the Oecumenical
Council of the Vatican. ONE CANNOT NOW BE CATHOLIC WITHOUT BEING ULTRAMONTANE
— AND JESUIT.”
11
A plain statement; and as cool as it is plain.
The Pastoral made a certain noise in France and in the Catholic world, but was soon
forgotten. And as two centuries have rolled away since an exposé of the infamous
principles of the Jesuits was made (of which we will speak presently), the “Black Militia”
of Loyola has had ample time to lie so successfully in denying the just charges that even now, when the present Pope has brilliantly sanctioned the utterance of the
Bishop of Cambrai, the Roman Catholics will hardly confess to such a thing. Strange
exhibition of infallibility in the Popes! The “infallible” Pope, Clement XIV (Ganganelli),
suppressed the Jesuits on the 21st of July, 1773, and yet they came to life again; the
“infallible” Pope, Pius VII, re-established them on the 7th of August, 1814.12 The infallible
Pope Pius IX,13 travelled, during the whole of his long Pontificate, between the
Scylla and Charybdis of the Jesuit question; his infallibility helping him very little. And now the “infallible” Leo XIII (fatal figures!)
14 raises the Jesuits again to the highest
pinnacle of their sinister and graceless glory.
The recent Brevet of the Pope (hardly two years old) dated July 13th (the same fatal
figures), 1886, is an event, the importance of which can never be overvalued. It begins
with the words Dolemus inter alia,
15 and reinstalls the Jesuits in all the rights of
the Order that had ever been cancelled. It was a manifesto and a loud defiant insult
to all the Christian nations of the New and the Old worlds. From an article by Louis
Lambert in the Gaulois (August 18th, 1886) we learn that “In 1750 there were 40,000
Jesuits all over the world. In 1800, officially they were reckoned at about 1,000 men,
only. In 1886, they numbered between 7 and 8,000.”
16 This last modest number can
well be doubted. For, verily now —
Where you meet a man believing in the salutary nature of falsehoods, or the divine
authority of things doubtful, and fancying that to serve the Good Cause he
must call the devil to his aid, there is a follower of Unsaint17 Ignatius,
says Carlyle, and adds of that black militia of Ignatius that:
They have given a new substantive to modern languages. The word Jesuitism
now, in all countries, expresses an idea for which there was in nature no prototype
before. Not till these last centuries had the human soul generated that
abomination, or needed to name it. Truly they have achieved great things in the
world, and a general result that we may call stupendous.18
And now since their reinstalment in Germany and elsewhere, they will achieve still
grander and more stupendous results. For the future can be best read by the past.
Unfortunately in this year of the Pope’s jubilee the civilized portions of humanity —
even the Protestant ones — seem to have entirely forgotten that past. Let then those
who profess to despise Theosophy, the fair child of early Āryan thought and Alexandrian Neo-Platonism, bow before the monstrous Fiend of the Age, but let them not
forget at the same time its history.
It is curious to observe, how persistently the Order has assailed everything like Occultism
from the earliest times, and Theosophy since the foundation of its last Society,
which is ours. The Moors and the Jews of Spain felt the weight of the oppressive
hand of Obscurantism no less than did the Kabbalists and Alchemists of the Middle
Ages. One would think Esoteric philosophy and especially the Occult Arts, or Magic, were an abomination to those good holy fathers? And so indeed they would have the
world believe. But when one studies history and the works of their own authors published
with the imprimatur of the Order, what does one find? That the Jesuits have
practised not only Occultism, but BLACK MAGIC in its worst form,
19
more than any other
body of men; and that to it they owe in large measure their power and influence!
To refresh the memory of our readers and all those whom it may concern, a short
summary of the doings and actings of our good friends, may be once more attempted.
For those who are inclined to laugh, and deny the subterranean and truly infernal
means used by “Ignatius’ black militia,” we may state facts!
In Isis Unveiled it was said of the holy Fraternity that:
. . . though established only in 1535 to 1540, in 1555 there was already general
outcry raised against them.20
And now once more:
. . . that crafty, learned, conscienceless, terrible soul of Jesuitism, within the
body of Romanism, is slowly but surely possessing itself of the whole prestige
and spiritual power that clings to it. . . . Throughout the whole of antiquity,
where, in what land, can we find anything like this Order or anything even approaching
it? . . . The cry of an outraged public morality was raised against this
Order from its very birth. Barely fifteen years had elapsed after the bull approving
its constitution was promulgated, when its members began to be driven
away from one place to the other. Portugal and the Low Countries got rid of
them, in 1578, France in 1594; Venice in 1606; Naples in 1622. From St. Petersburg
they were expelled in 1815, and from all Russia in 1820.21&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill look into the Society of Cincinnati more, here are some qoutes from 
Tupper Staussy, Rulers of Evil page 151-153 : &quot;A decade after the American bishop scare had broken out,
thousands of American Protestant and Catholic churchgoer s
began killing and being killed to win The War That Would Keep
Anglican Bishops Out of America. And they won this war. But the
utterly stupefying outcome of their victory was that no bishops
were kept out of America : two bishops were brought into America ,
an Anglican and a Roman Catholic !
The Roman Catholic , of course, was John Carroll. This Jesuit
son of Maryland was consecrated Bishop of Baltimore on August
15, 1790, in the chapel of Lulworth, a castle set high on the Dorset
coast of England owned by the Welds , a prominent Roman
Catholic family. Lulworth’ s upper “Red Room ” looks to the east
upon a commanding view of the estate’s long entrance meadow
and to the south upon a famous smugglers’ cove in the distance. A
frequent visitor to Lulworth Castle , and honored guest in its Red
Room, I am told, was King George III.
Bishop Carroll became the Holy See’s direct representative not
just in Baltimore but throughout the U.S . This fact was validated
in 1798 by Judge Addison, President of the Court of Common Pleas of the Fifth Circuit of Pennsylvania in the case of Fromm vs.
Carroll. Fromm was a recalcitrant German Franciscan who wanted
to establish his ow n German-speaking , laity-owned parish.
Addison ruled that “the Bishop of Baltimore has sole episcopal
authority over the Catholic Church of the Unite d States , and
without authority from him no Catholic priest can exercise any
pastoral function over any congregation within the Unite d
States. ” Fromm was excommunicated and held up as an example
of what happens to rebels against wholesome Church authority.
Addison’s use of the term “Catholic Church of the United States”
is an interesting judicial notice that Carroll’s ordination instituted,
for all practical purposes, a secular church ruled by the black
papacy. Eminent Catholic historian Thomas O’Gorman concurred
in 1895, observing that American Catholicism was, “in its inception,
wholly a Jesuit affair and [has] largely remained so.” 7
America’ s first Anglican bishop, ordained in 1784, was Rev.
Samuel Seabury of Connecticut. Rev. Seabury was both a High
Churchman and a Freemason. 8
 To avoid the political repercussions
of swearing allegiance to the Church of England so soon after
1776, Seabury was consecrated in Novembe r 1784 at Aberdeen,
Scotland. Of critical importance to Rome was that the three bishops
consecrating Seabury were all “nonjuring” bishops. “Nonjuring” described the class of Catholic bishops that stood in the
succession of “Jacobite” clergy who, remaining loyal to King James
II after his abdication in 1689, had refused to take a loyalty oath
to James’ successors – his daughter, Mary Stuart, and son-in-law,
William of Orange , both Protestants. 9
 America’ s first Protestant
bishop, like his Roman Catholic counterpart, owed allegiance to
Rome. This obscure fact is commemorated in one of London’ s most
heavily-trafficked and world-famous locations. Th e spacious grassy
lawns on either side of the great stairway leading up to the National
Portrait Gallery facing Trafalgar Square are identical except for
their bronze statuary, one piece alone placed at the center of each
lawn. On the north lawn stands James II, crowned with imperial
laurel, wearing the armor of Julius Caesar. (An elderly British Jesuit with a passion for offbeat historical detail confided to me that
James loved to go in Caesarean drag.) On the south lawn stands
the celebrated Houdon figure of... George Washington, garbed in
period attire, leaning for support upon a huge bundle of rods from
which projects the head of an axe – the fasces, ancient emblem of
Roman legal authority! When Bishop Seabury united his episcopate
with the other two Anglican communions in America in
1789, the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Unite d States was
born. George Washington was a member of this Church. The Lond
on statuary are explaining the little-known historical fact that
James II’s Roman Catholic rulership of the English-speaking people
was resumed in the First President of the Constitutional United
States of America . It is a tribute to the phenomenal generalate
of Lorenzo Ricci.
John Carroll spent his final years in Europe helping to develop
Lorenzo Ricci’s vision of rebellion in America . He moved cautiously,
and often incognito. What few traces he left behind are
quite revealing. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rome Maryland becomes Washington D.C. with the 1871 Organic Act</p>

<p>Founding of “Rome, Maryland”.  Rome, Maryland was the name of the city before the land was donated by Jesuit John Carroll, the wealthiest man in the US at the time, who also founded Georgetown University one year BEFORE, Washington D.C. was created</p>

<p>“Catholicism came to Maryland on March 25, 1634, an auspicious day: the Feast of the Annunciation and the first day of the English new year. A small group, Protestants and Catholics mixed, landed on a small island in the lower Potomac near the Maryland shore, and Father Andrew White celebrated Mass to bless the beginning of their colony. The Calverts came to Maryland as the Puritans had come to Massachusetts, for piety and for profit. Seeking a refuge from the Penal Laws, they hoped also to reap the benefits of a bountiful new land.” Father Andrew White is who the US “White” House is named after!!
The Jesuits came to minister to the Catholic colonists, but also with an eye to the conversion of the native population. “Who then can have a doubt,” White wrote before leaving England, “but that by this one work so glorious, many thousand souls may be led to Christ?” White and his companions overcame the hostility of some of the tribes, the prejudice of Proprietor and English settlers, and the great barrier of language to convert several tribal chiefs. At St. Mary’s City White made of an Indian hut the colony’s first chapel.</p>

<p>The name “White House,” however, was not used officially until President Theodore Roosevelt had it engraved on his stationery in 1901. Prior to that, the building was known variously as the “President’s Palace,” the “President’s House,” and the “Executive Mansion.”</p>

<p>The Capital of Amerigo, the District of Columbia is named after Pesephone, the Godess of War not the other Catholic Explorer Christopher Columbus, as the wealthy elite history books have sold us.
And the White House is named after a Jesuit Andrew White. Then Daniel Carroll (Catholic) gives the land for our National Capital. Then after 26 years of Jesuit education John Carroll (Catholic) founded Georgetown University in 1789 the same year we became a country.
 Andrew White (1579 – December 27, 1656) was an English Jesuit missionary who was involved in the founding of the Maryland colony.[1] He was a chronicler of the early colony, and his writings are a primary source on the land, the Native Americans of the area, and the Jesuit mission in North America. For his efforts in converting and educating the native population, he is frequently referred to as the “Apostle of Maryland.” He is considered a forefather of Georgetown University, and is memorialized in the name of its White-Gravenor building, a central location of offices and classrooms on the university’s campus.[2]
George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore, whom White is credited in helping to turn to Catholicism in 1625, wrote to White from his colony on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland after 1628. White’s further interest in America is shown a letter from Superior General Mutio Vitelleschi in a letter dated March 3, 1629, approving a mission to America. Though George Calvert died in 1632, his son, Leonard Calvert, second Baron Baltimore, continued the colonization program. Baltimore had wanted White to help found a new colony in the Chesapeake Bay which had been chartered June 20, 1632. White himself wrote of the benefits of converting the native population, and in a document dated February 10, 1633, he specifically advocates Catholic settlement in “lord Baltimore’s Plantation in Mary-land.” He describes to potential financiers a paradisaical land with majestic forests and fruitful soil, advertising 2,000 acres (8 km2) of land for each potential settler.</p>

<p>Apostle of Maryland</p>

<p>On November 22, 1633, he took Baltimore’s offer and set sail from Cowes on the Isle of Wight with lord Leonard Calvert and fellow Jesuits John Altham Gravenor and Thomas Gervase on The Ark, one of George Calvert’s ships.[4] Their landing on March 25, 1634, on St. Clement’s Island marks the birth of the Maryland colony. The anniversary of this date is now celebrated as Maryland Day. In saying Catholic Mass that day, he became the first priest to do so in the original thirteen English colonies.[5] By July of that year, White had written his first discussion on the new colony, titled A Relation of the Successful Beginnings of the Lord Baltimore’s Plantation in Maryland. Sections of this were used to further advertise the colony.White spent most of the next decade in St. Mary’s City, working on English-Native American relations, particularly with the Yaocomico tribe, which consistently saw favorable trade treaties from Calvert because of White, and the Anacostans. In 1637 they were joined by Jesuits Thomas Copley and Ferdinand Poulton, and between 1634 and 1650 there averaged four permanent Jesuits in the Maryland Colony.[6] To further his missionary work, he wrote dictionaries and translated the catechism into the native languages. On July 5, 1640, he famously converted Chitomachon, the chief of the Piscataway Indians, to Christianity. The chief was baptized as Charles. He later baptized a princess of the Patuxent Indians, and much of her tribe.
In 1933, the architect and writer Christopher La Farge designed a monument to White that is located just outside St. Mary’s City.[7]
Return to England. The English Civil War was to cut short his missionary work. In 1644, Richard Ingle and Puritan colonists from the neighboring Virginian colony of Jamestown, which had previously rebuffed George Calvert’s visit, first raided St. Mary’s City. Ingle succeeded in burning the town and, with the aid of William Claiborne, in controlling the Maryland Colony. White was again arrested for his Catholic preaching, and in 1645 he was sent with Thomas Copley in chains to London. Once there, he was tried for the crime of returning to England after being banished in 1606, which carried the punishment of death. He escaped this fate by arguing that his return was not of his own will. His petitions to return to Maryland denied, he spent the last decade of his life quietly in England until his death on December 27, 1656.</p>

<p>The Jesuits’ Slaves
“Can a man serve God faithfully and posess slaves?” Brother Joseph Mobberly, S.J. asked in his diary in 1818. “Yes,” he answered. “Is it then lawful to keep men in servitude? Yes.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jesuits of the Maryland province had always relied on plantations to support their ministries. The estates were extensive, totaling 12,000 acres on four large properties in Southern Prince Georges, Charles and St. Mary’s counties, and two smaller estates on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. In 1634, when the Jesuits arrived in Maryland, Lord Baltimore awarded them quasi-estates in which they were permitted to live off the rent of tenant farmers. However, as University Dean Hubert Cloke explains, “The system was totally antiquated and romantic, not related to reality, and they realized they were not going to make any money.” So, the Jesuits turned to indentured servants, English men and women who worked the land for set terms in return for the passage from England to Maryland. But as working conditions improved in England, the supply of indentured servants dropped and the Jesuits once again found a new way to work the land. By the 1680s they relied upon a fully developed slave system.</p>

<p>Compared to other plantation owners in the area, when it came to slavery, “The Jesuits were no better or worse,” according to Cloke. Many of the slaves had been gifts from wealthy Catholic families to sustain the Church. The abolition of slavery was not an issue in the area until the early nineteenth century, when Georgetown’s Jesuits became deeply divided over the issue of slavery.</p>

<p>“But they were not conflicted in the way you would want,” Cloke said. “They were conflicted over what to do about the threat of abolitionists.”</p>

<p>In a generational divide, an older group of Jesuits, mostly European born, felt a patriarchal connection to their slaves and were unwilling to sell them. A younger, American-born group, a minority, felt that the money invested in plantations should be spent on institutions in cities like Philadelphia and New York with their rapidly growing Catholic populations. It seems neither faction had any particular moral quandaries with the six plantations and the nearly 300 slaves owned by Georgetown’s and Maryland’s Jesuits.</p>

<p>This rift is just one of the things American Studies students learned when history professors like Cloke and Emmett Curran introduced the Jesuit Plantation Project into the American Studies curriculum in the spring of 1996. The project involved students transcribing and digitizing hundreds of documents from the Jesuit’s Maryland Province Index recording the Georgetown’s Jesuits’ complicated relationship with slavery.</p>

<p>With only two exceptions, all the higher-ranking Jesuits in the province during the time were foreign-born and of the older faction. Since only U.S. citizens had temporal jurisdiction, foreign Jesuits had no authority over the Mission’s estates.</p>

<p>This meant that a younger group of American Jesuits, a minority, controlled the destiny of the estates, and this group wanted to end slave operations.</p>

<p>“They considered the plantations and slaves as a losing business enterprise and thought the Society should rid itself of both plantations and slaves,” Curran said.</p>

<p>Abolitionists presented an economic rather than moral problem for these Jesuits. With a growing abolitionist presence in Maryland, some of them feared a devaluation of their property, their slaves. Maryland was a state in which slavery had a tenuous hold, the economy was no longer driven by slave labor. According to reports, the general debt of the mission was close to $32,000 by the 1830s, a large sum for the time.</p>

<p>“It was not a market for growing crops, but for growing slaves,” said Cloke. The real money was to be made not from the work a slave could do in Maryland, but from the hugely profitable business of selling the slaves downriver.</p>

<p>In 1815, Brother Joseph Mobberly, S.J. wrote a letter to John Grassi, S.J., the president of Georgetown College, listing three major reasons to sell the slaves. He wrote, “It is better to sell for a time or get your people free … Because we have their souls to answer for.” He then went on to explain that the slaves had become more difficult to govern, and he believed this to be the result of a growing abolitionist movement. Finally, in an extensive table of expenses, he concluded that the slaves should be sold because, “We shall make more and more to your satisfaction.”</p>

<p>Brother Mobberly, who served as an overseer on one of the estates, kept an extensive diary giving a bird’s eye view of the tension the Jesuits felt surrounding the issue of slavery. His diary explores the tension between Catholics, an already persecuted group, and the Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers and Methodists who were outspokenly opposed to slavery. Mobberly, like other Jesuits, came to feel threatened and saw the issue as a Catholic-Protestant conflict. Involving everything from the Bible to Thomas Jefferson, Mobberly’s diary defended slavery. He explained that Abraham owned slaves, and wrote, “Abraham had God for his particular friend; and we do not read that God ever reproached him for keeping men in servitude. Therefore, it was lawful for him to possess them.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is fascinating, the trippiest part is that the larst land owner of Rome Maryland at the time was a guy named Francis Pope.... now we got Jesuit Pope Francis on the seat of the tiara...</p>

<p>In HPB’s(Blavatsky) “The Trial of the Sun Initiate,” we come across the following insight…</p>

<p>“The Jesuits … To give one instance of their success in throwing dust into the eyes of ordinary individuals to prevent their seeing the truths of Occultism, we will point out what they did in what is now called Freemasonry. This Brotherhood does possess a considerable portion of the symbolism, formulae, and ritual of Occultism, handed down from time immemorial from the primeval Initiations. To render this Brotherhood a mere harmless negation, the Jesuits sent some of their most able emissaries into the Order, who first made the simple brethren believe that the true secret was lost with Hiram Abiff; and then induced them to put this belief into their formularies. They then invented specious but spurious higher degrees, pretending to give further light upon this lost secret, to lead the candidate on and amuse him with forms borrowed from the real thing but containing no substance, and all artfully contrived to lead the aspiring Neophyte to nowhere. And yet men of good sense and abilities, in other respects, will meet at intervals, and with solemn face, zeal and earnestness, go through the mockery of revealing “substituted secrets” instead of the real thing.”</p>

<p>Manly P Hall The Secret Teachings of all Ages page 91: &quot; If any one doubts the presence of Masonic and occult influences at the time the Great Seal was designed, he should give due consideration to the comments of Professor Charles Eliot Norton of Harvard, who wrote concerning the unfinished pyramid and the All-Seeing Eye which adorned the reverse of the seal, as follows: &quot;The device adopted by Congress is practically incapable of effective treatment; it can hardly (however artistically treated by the designer) look otherwise than as a dull emblem of a Masonic fraternity.&quot; (The History of the Seal of the United States.)</p>

<p>The eagles of Napoleon and Cæsar and the zodiacal eagle of Scorpio are really phœnixes, for the latter bird--not the eagle--is the symbol of spiritual victory and achievement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manly Hall the Secret Destiny of America pages 223/224 : &quot;The details of Franklin&#39;s Masonic connections have been drawn largely from contemporary correspondence. He was duly elected Master of the Masons of Philadelphia, and was regarded as the Grand Master of Pennsylvanian, possibly by authority derived from the Grand Lodge at London. The esteemed doctor was given to secret assemblies. He contemplated the formation of a club to be called the The Society and Free and Easy, which was to be devoted to moral and ethical instructions for those who intended later to associate themselves with Freemasonry. With several young men, he was active in Organizing a group called the Junto. The rules governing this society were incorporated into the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. Those aware of Franklin&#39;s connections with Secret Fraternities will find the following quotation of interest: &quot;There seems to me at present to be a great occasion for raising a United Party of Virtue, forming the virtuous and good men of all nations to a regular body, to be governed by suitable, good, and wise rules, which good and wise men probably be more unanimous in their obedience to, than common people are common laws.(Sounds like the Jesuits...)I at present think, that whoever attempts this aright, and is well qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success&quot;Mutual Interests in curious and antiquities are said to have inspired the friendship between Franklin and Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society. Franklin also knew Sir William Herschel, and was popular in England in spite of the Revolutionary War.George III consoled himself over the loss of the American colonies because Herschel had recently named a planet in his honor. Franklin was acquainted with Mesmer and Cagliostro, but there is evidence that he ever met Rousseau. This celebrated French philosopher was living in strict retirement, but he received a copy of Franklin&#39;s liturgy for a new religion, with pleasure. Franklin, equally , commended the influence of Rousseau&#39;s philosophy not only on the European mind, but among the American colonies. Franklin was in contact with certain obscure gentlemen in the colonies, who took no obvious action in the formation the American government, but were secretly advancing the cause.(sounds like the Jesuits again)The Philadelphia printer acted as a confidential agent for this group on numerous occasions. He traveled about , visiting here and there, and delivered messages and reports to interested parties. He (Franklin)was close to the ear of Thomas Jefferson, whose attainments were also highly diversified. It is regrettable that most of Jefferson&#39;s library and papers were destroyed when the British army sacked Washington in the War of 1812. Franklin was a link between European Secret Societies and the American democratic experiment.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manly P Hall Secret Teachings of All Ages page 200-201 : &quot;Many times the question has been asked, Was Francis Bacon&#39;s vision of the &quot;New Atlantis&quot; a prophetic dream of the great civilization which was so soon to rise upon the soil of the New World? It cannot be doubted that the secret societies of Europe conspired to establish upon the American continent &quot;a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; Two incidents in the early history of the United States evidence the influence of that silent body which has so long guided the destinies of peoples and religions. By them nations are created as vehicles for the promulgation of ideals, and while nations are true to these ideals they survive; when they vary from them they vanish like the Atlantis of old which had ceased to &quot;know the gods.&quot;</p>

<p>In his admirable little treatise, Our Flag, Robert Allen Campbell revives the details of an obscure, but most important, episode of American history--the designing of the Colonial flag of 1775. The account involves a mysterious man concerning whom no information is available other than that he was on familiar terms with both General George Washington and Dr. Benjamin Franklin. The following description of him is taken from Campbell&#39;s treatise:</p>

<p>&quot;Little seems to have been known concerning this old gentleman; and in the materials from which this account is compiled his name is not even once mentioned, for he is uniformly spoken of or referred to as &#39;the Professor.&#39; He was evidently far beyond his threescore and ten years; and he often referred to historical events of more than a century previous just as if he had been a living witness of their occurrence; still he was erect, vigorous and active--hale, hearty, and clear-minded--as strong and energetic every way as in the prime of his life He was tall, of fine figure, perfectly easy, and very dignified in his manners; being at once courteous, gracious and commanding. He was, for those times and considering the customs of the Colonists, very peculiar in his method of living; for he ate no flesh, fowl or fish; he never used for food any &#39;green thing,&#39; any roots or anything unripe; he drank no liquor, wine or ale; but confined his diet to cereals and their products, fruits that were ripened on the stem in the sun, nuts, mild tea and the sweets of honey, sugar or molasses.</p>

<p>&quot;He was well educated, highly cultivated, of extensive as well as varied information, and very studious. He spent considerable of his time in the patient and persistent conning of a number of very rare old books and ancient manuscripts which he seemed to be deciphering, translating or rewriting. These books and manuscripts, together with his own writings, he never showed to anyone; and he did not even mention them in his conversations with the family, except in the most casual way; and he always locked them up carefully in a large, old-fashioned, cubically shaped, iron-bound, heavy, oaken chest, whenever he left his room, even for his meals. He took long and frequent walks alone, sat on the brows of the neighboring hills, or mused in the midst of the green and flower-gemmed meadows. He was fairly liberal--but in no way lavish--in spending his money, with which he was well supplied. He was a quiet, though a very genial and very interesting, member of the family; and be was seemingly at home upon any and every topic coming up in conversation. He was, in short, one whom everyone would notice and respect, whom few would feel well acquainted with, and whom no one would presume to question concerning himself--as to whence he came, why he tarried, or whither he journeyed. &quot;</p>

<p>By something more than a mere coincidence the committee appointed by the Colonial Congress to design a flag accepted an invitation to be guests, while in Cambridge, of the same family with which the Professor was staying. It was here that General Washington joined them for the purpose of deciding upon a fitting emblem. By the signs which passed between them it was evident that both General Washington and Doctor Franklin recognized the Professor, and by unanimous approval he was invited to become an active member of the committee. During the proceedings which followed, the Professor was treated with the most profound respect and all of his suggestions immediately acted upon. He submitted a pattern which he considered symbolically appropriate for the new flag, and this was unhesitatingly accepted by the other six members of the committee, who voted that the arrangement suggested by the Professor be forthwith adopted. After the episode of the flag the Professor quietly vanished, and nothing further is known concerning him.</p>

<p>Did General Washington and Doctor Franklin recognize the Professor as an emissary of the Mystery school which has so long controlled the political destinies of this planet? Benjamin Franklin was a philosopher and a Freemason--possibly a Rosicrucian initiate. He and the Marquis de Lafayette--also a man of mystery--constitute two of the most important links in the chain of circumstance that culminated in the establishment of the original thirteen American Colonies as a free and independent nation. Doctor Franklin&#39;s philosophic attainments are well attested in Poor Richard&#39;s Almanac, published by him for many years under the name of Richard Saunders. His interest in the cause of Freemasonry is also shown by his republication of Anderson&#39;s Constitutions of Freemasonry, a rare and much disputed work on the subject.</p>

<p>It was during the evening of July 4, 1776, that the second of these mysterious episodes occurred. In the old State House in Philadelphia a group of men were gathered for the momentous task of severing the last tie between the old country and the new. It was a grave moment and not a few of those present feared that their lives would be the forfeit for their audacity. In the midst of the debate a fierce voice rang out. The debaters stopped and turned to look upon the stranger. Who was this man who had suddenly appeared in their midst and transfixed them with his oratory? They had never seen him before, none knew when he had entered, but his tall form and pale face filled them with awe. His voice ringing with a holy zeal, the stranger stirred them to their very souls. His closing words rang through the building: &quot;God has given America to be free!&quot; As the stranger sank into a chair exhausted, a wild enthusiasm burst forth. Name after name was placed upon the parchment: the Declaration of Independence was signed. But where was the man who had precipitated the accomplishment of this immortal task--who had lifted for a moment the veil from the eyes of the assemblage and revealed to them a part at least of the great purpose for which the new nation was conceived? He had disappeared, nor was he ever seen again or his identity established. This episode parallels others of a similar kind recorded by ancient historians attendant upon the founding of every new nation. Are they coincidences, or do they demonstrate that the divine wisdom of the ancient Mysteries still is present in the world, serving mankind as it did of old?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly recomend Manly Hall, he is a great scholar! Blavatsky wrote a little bit about the mounds in her book the Secret Doctrine (1888) Here is a quote from Volume 2 page 752-754 : &quot;The modern archeologist, though speculating ad infinitum upon the dolmens and their builders, knows, in fact, nothing of them or their origin. Yet, these weird, and often colossal monuments of unhewn stones -- which consist generally of four or seven gigantic blocks placed together -- are strewn over Asia, Europe, America, and Africa, in groups or rows. Stones of enormous size are found placed horizontally and variously upon two, three, four, and as in Poitou, upon six and seven blocks. People name them &quot;devil&#39;s altars,&quot; druidic stones, and giant tombs. The stones of Carnac in the Morbihan, Brittany -- nearly a mile in length and numbering 11,000 ranged in eleven rows -- are twin sisters of those at Stonehenge. The Conical menhir of Loch-Maria-ker in Morbihan, measures twenty yards in length and nearly two yards across. The Menhir of Champ Dolent (near St. Malo) rises thirty feet above the ground, and is fifteen feet in depth below. Such dolmens and prehistoric monuments are met with in almost every latitude. They are found in the Mediterranean basin; in Denmark (among the local tumuli from twenty-seven to thirty-five feet in height); in Shetland, and in Sweden, where they are called ganggriften (or tombs with corridors); in Germany, where they are known as the giant tombs (Hunengraben); in Spain (see the dolmen of Antiguera near Malaga), and Africa; in Palestine and Algeria; in Sardinia (see the Nuraghi and Sepolture dei giganti, or tombs of giants); in Malabar, in India, where they are called the tombs of the Daityas (giants) and of the Rakshasas, the men-demons of Lanka; in Russia and Siberia, where they are known as the Koorgan; in Peru and Bolivia, where they are termed the chulpas or burial places, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>There is no country from which they are absent. Who built them? Why are they all connected with Serpents and Dragons, with Alligators and Crocodiles? Because remains of &quot;palaeolithic man&quot; were, it is thought, found in some of them, and because in the funeral mounds of America bodies of later races were discovered with the usual paraphernalia of bone necklaces, weapons, stone and copper urns, etc., hence they are declared ancient tombs. But surely the two famous mounds -- one in the Mississippi valley and the other in Ohio -- known respectively as &quot;the Alligator Mound&quot; and &quot;the Great Serpent Mound,&quot; were never meant for tombs* (Vide infra). Yet one is told authoritatively that the Mounds, and the Mound or Dolmen Builders, are all &quot;Pelasgic&quot; in Europe, antecedent to the Incas, in America, yet of &quot;not extremely distant times.&quot; They are built by &quot;no race of Dolmen Builders,&quot; which never existed (opinion of De Mortillet, Bastian, and Westropp) save in the earlier archeological fancy. Finally Virchow&#39;s opinion of the giant tombs of Germany is now accepted as an axiom: -- &quot;The tombs alone are gigantic, and not the bones they contain&quot; -- says that German biologist; and archaeology has but to bow and submit to the decision.**</p>

<p>That no gigantic skeletons have been hitherto found in the &quot;tombs&quot; is yet no reason to say there never were the remains of giants in them. Cremation was universal till a comparatively recent period -- some 80, or 100,000 years ago. The real giants, moreover, were nearly all drowned with Atlantis. Nevertheless, the classics, as shown elsewhere, often speak of giant skeletons still excavated in their day. Besides this, human fossils may be counted on the fingers, as yet. No skeleton ever yet found is older than between 50, or 60,000 years,*** and man&#39;s size was reduced from 15 to 10 or 12 feet, ever since the third sub-race of the Aryan stock, which sub-race -- born and developed in Europe and Asia Minor under new climates and conditions -- had become European. Since then, as said, it has steadily been decreasing. It is truer therefore to say, that the tombs alone are archaic, and not necessarily the bodies of men occasionally found in them; and that those tombs, since they are gigantic, must have contained giants,**** or rather the ashes of generations of giants.Nor were all such cyclopean structures intended for sepulchres. It is with the so-called Druidical remains, such as Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge in Great Britain, that the travelling Initiates above alluded to had to do. And these gigantic monuments are all symbolic records of the World&#39;s history. They are not Druidical, but universal. Nor did the Druids build them, for they were only the heirs to the cyclopean lore left to them by generations of mighty builders and -- &quot;magicians,&quot; both good and bad.</p>

<p>It will always be a subject of regret that history, rejecting a priori the actual existence of giants, has preserved us so little of the records of antiquity concerning them. Yet in nearly every mythology -- which after all is ancient history -- the giants play an important part. In the old Norse mythology, the giants, Skrymir and his brethren, against whom the sons of the gods fought, were potent factors in the histories of deities and men. The modern exegesis, that makes these giants to be the brethren of the dwarfs, and reduces the combats of the gods to the history of the development of the Aryan race, will only receive credence amongst the believers in the Aryan theory, as expounded by Max Muller. Granting that the Turanian races were typified by the dwarfs (Dwergar), and that a dark, round-headed, and dwarfish race was driven northward by the fair-faced Scandinavians, or AEsir, the gods being like unto men, there still exists neither in history nor any other scientific work any anthropological proof whatever of the existence in time or space of a race of giants. Yet that such exist, relatively and de facto side by side with dwarfs, Schweinfurth can testify. The Nyam-Nyam of Africa are regular dwarfs, while their next neighbours (several tribes of comparatively fair-complexioned Africans) are giants when confronted with the Nyam-Nyams, and very tall even among Europeans, for their women are all above 6 1/2 feet high. (Vide Schweinfurth&#39;s latest works.)</p>

<p>In Cornwall and in ancient Britain the traditions of these giants are, on the other hand, excessively common; they are said to live even down to the time of King Arthur. All this shows that giants lived to a later date amongst the Celtic than among the Teutonic peoples.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;DURING the fall of 1775 , Congress authorized a committee made up of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Lynch, Benjamin Harrison and George Washington to consider and recommend a design for the first united colonial flag. Th e so-called “Flag Committee” traveled to Cambridge , Massachusetts. There , according to the only know n account of its proceedings , given in Robert Allen Campbell’ s book, Our Flag (Chicago , 1890), the Committee mysteriously shared its authority with a total stranger. This stranger was an elderly European transient known only as “the Professor.&quot; He had arrived from parts unknown at summer’s end. (Th e prisoner of Castel Sant’Angel o had not been publicly seen in two years – ample time to manage Braschi’s election to the papacy, relax, pack important things, die the philosopher’s death, and take a three-month voyage to Boston Harbor). Since his arrival, the Professor had occupied a guestroom in a private Cambridge home whose hostess, “one of his earnest and intelligent disciples,” would remember him in her diary (cited in Campbell’ s book) as “a quiet and very interesting member of the family.” What the hostess records about the Professor matches remarkably what is know n about the character of Lorenzo Ricci. For example , the Professor is perceived to be “more than three-score and ten” years of age; Lorenzo Ricci was seventy-two. Th e Professor spoke many languages fluently, displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of history, and was “seemingly at home upon any and every topic coming up in conversation.” We might expect the very same of Lorenzo Ricci, a distinguished professor of literature, philosophy and theology at the Roman College and a well-established confidant of Europe’s leading intellectuals , philosophes, and mystics. The Professor kept “locked away in a large, old fashioned, cubically shaped, iron bound, heavy, oaken chest, a number of very rare old books and ancient manuscripts,” which he spent much of his time “deciphering, translating, or rewriting.” We might expect as much of Lorenzo Ricci, the voracious scholar and publisher of oriental masterworks. On the morning of December 13, 1775 , the committeemen arrived in Cambridge for a midday feast. Th e Professor greeted them as we might expect Lorenzo Ricci would, “with an ease, grace and dignity [evidencing] his superior ability, experience and attainments , and ... with a courtly bow that left no room to doubt that he had habitually associated with those in acknowledged authority. ” When Benjamin Franklin was presented to him, the hostess watched the patriarchal Doctor lock hands with the patriarchal Professor, “and as fingers closed upon fingers, their eyes also met, and there was an instantaneous, a very apparent and a mutually gratified recognition. ” What had the woman witnessed? The Ultimate Summit? Unknown Superior revealing himself to America’s Grandest Freemason? T h e table talk soon focused on subjects that had occupied Lorenzo Ricci’s attention since the beginning of his generalate. T h e hostess witnessed them discussing “the relation of the Colonies to each other and to the Mother Country. ” She saw them discuss “the related question of one’s duty to the Colony , as related to his allegiance to Great Britain. ” She saw the Professor take “a noticeable, though not at all an obtrusive, part in the conversation, himself possessed of a wonderful fund of varied and accurate information concerning the Colonies , an understanding of their progress, condition and needs , and a familiarity with the principles and operations of British and European statesmanship. ” Wouldn’t we expect as much from the Superior General of the world’s best intelligence agency? After lunch, General Washington and the committeemen held a “brief, undertone conversation.” The n Dr. Franklin rose and stated: “As the chairman of this committee , speaking for my associates, with their consent, and with the approval of General Washington, I respectfully invite the Professor to meet with the Committee as one of its members; and we, each one , personally and urgently, request him to accept the responsibility, and to give us, and the American Colonies , the benefit of his counsel.” Taking the floor, the Professor accepted the responsibility. Then , startlingly, he proposed that his disciple, the hostess, be placed on the committee “because she is our hostess, because she is a woman, and above all, because she is a superior woman. ” (The committee considered this an innovation; yet the Jesuits had been employing female coadjutors for centuries.) Th e proposal was “immediately and unanimously adopted. ” Luncheon was adjourned. T h e committee would reconvene at seven in the evening, “in the guest chamber usually occupied by the Professor.” Franklin and the Professor spent the afternoon together walking about Cambridge. When they returned, the hostess noted that “both of them wore the relieved and confident look of earnest and determined men who had, in a satisfactory way, solved a perplex-ing problem, and of victors who had successfully mastered a difficult and dangerous situation.” At the evening session, Franklin turned the meeting over to “his new-found and abundantly honored friend.” Th e subject was a flag. Addressing the committee as “Comrade Americans, ” the Professor explained that, since the colonies were still dependent upon Great Britain, “we are not expected to design or recommend a flag which will represent a new government or an independent nation, ” but instead one “that will testify our present loyalty as English Subjects, ” a flag that was “already in use,” a flag that had been recognized by the British government for “half a century,” a flag having a field of alternate horizontal red and white stripes with the Grand Union Flag of Great Britain in the upper left corner. “I refer,” he said, “to the flag of the East India Company.” To hide the fact that Americans would be fighting under the private flag of an international mercantile corporation controlled by Jesuits, the Professor provided a plausible cover whereby the flag could be “explained to the masses:” “The Union Flag of the Mother Country is retained as the union [upper left corner] of our new flag to announce that the Colonies are loyal to the just and legitimate sovereignty of the British Government. The thirteen stripes will at once be understood to represent the thirteen Colonies; their equal width will type the equal rank, rights and responsibilities of the Colonies. The union of the stripes in the field of our flag will announce the unity of interests and the cooperative union of efforts, which the Colonies recognize and put forth in their common cause. The white stripes will signify that we consider our demands just and reasonable; and that we will seek to secure our rights through peaceable, intelligent and statesmanlike means – if they prove at all possible; and the red stripes at the top and bottom of our flag will declare that first and last – and always – we have the determination, the enthusiasm, and the power to use force – whenever we deem force necessary. The alternation of the red and white stripes will suggest that our reasons for all demands will be intelligent and forcible, and that our force in securing our rights will be just and reasonable.” The Professor reminded the committee that “the masses of the people, and a large majority of the leaders of public opinion, desire a removal of grievances , and a rectification of wrongs , through a fuller recognition of their rights as British Subjects ; and few of them desire and very few of them expect – at this time – any complete severance of their present political and dependent relations with the English Government. ” That severance would occur “before the sun in its next summer’s strength” – indicating that the Professor foreknew, as Lorenzo Ricci would have foreknown, a July declaration of independence. At that time, the East India Company flag could be “easily modified” by replacing the Union Jack with stars against a blue background, “to make it announce and represent the new and independent nation.” Washington and Franklin lavished the Professor’s idea with “especial approval and unstinted praise.” Th e committee formally and unanimously adopted the East India Company’ s banner , known as “Th e Thirteen Stripes,” as the “general flag and recognized standard of the Colonial Army and Navy. ” Just before midnight, they adjourned. On January 2, 1776, at a formal ceremony attended by the Flag Committee , George Washington personally hoisted the East India Company flag “upon a towering and specially raised pine tree liberty pole, ” unfurling it to the breeze and displaying it for the first time “to his army, the citizens of the vicinity, and the British forces in Boston. ” The British officers at Charlestown Heights perceived the event to mean that General Washington had thus announced his surrender to them. At once, they saluted “The Thirteen Stripes”with thirteen hearty cheers. They immediately followed this spontaneous outburst of British Enthusiasm with the grander and more dignified official salute of thirteen guns, the thirteengun salute being the highest compliment in gunpowder, the military “God speed you.” By so colorfully equivocating both his enemies , the Professor had made himself God of Confusion. The redcoats were toasting the good health of the rebels, who in turn were fighting for the East India Company . On e of the few places in the world where such ludicrous phenomena are considered standard and routine is in the pages of Lorenzo Ricci’s Thirteen Articles: “Th e Genera l decides everything; he knows how to shape, at will, not only the army he is commanding but also that of his enemies.” -Rulers of Evil Pages 215-217</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HP Blavatsky Theosophy of Jesuitism page 4-7 : &quot; Roman Catholicism is but a name. As a Church it
is a phantom of the Past and a mask. It is absolutely and indissolubly bound up
with, and fettered by the Society of Ignatius Loyola; for, as rightly expressed by Lord
Robert Montagu, the Roman Catholic Church is now “the largest secret society in the
world, beside which Freemasonry is but a pigmy.”
9
Protestantism is slowly, insidiously,
but as surely, infected with Latinism — the new ritualistic sects of the High
Church, and such men among its clergy as Father Rivington, being undeniable evidence
of it. In fifty years more at the present rate of success of Latinism among the “upper ten,”
10 the English aristocracy will have returned to the faith of King Charles
II, and its servile copyist — mixed Society — will have followed suit. And then the
Jesuits will begin to reign alone and supreme over the Christian portions of the
globe, for they have crept even into the Greek Church.
It is vain to argue and claim a difference between Jesuitism and Roman Catholicism
proper, for the latter is now sucked into and inseparably amalgamated with the former.
We have public assurance for it in the Pastoral of 1876 by the Bishop of Cambrai.
“Clericalism, Ultramontanism and Jesuitism are one and the same thing — that
is to say, Roman Catholicism — and the distinctions between them have been created
by the enemies of religion,” says the “Pastoral.” “There was a time,” adds Monseigneur
the Cardinal, “when a certain theological opinion was commonly professed in
France concerning the authority of the Pope. . . . It was restricted to our nation, and
was of recent origin. The civil power during a century and a half imposed official instruction.
Those who professed these opinions were called Gallicans, and those who
protested were called Ultramontanes, because they had their doctrinal centre beyond
the Alps, at Rome. Today the distinction between the two schools is no longer admissible.
Theological Gallicanism can no longer exist, since this opinion has ceased to be
tolerated by the Church. It has been solemnly condemned, past all return, by the Oecumenical
Council of the Vatican. ONE CANNOT NOW BE CATHOLIC WITHOUT BEING ULTRAMONTANE
— AND JESUIT.”
11A plain statement; and as cool as it is plain.
The Pastoral made a certain noise in France and in the Catholic world, but was soon
forgotten. And as two centuries have rolled away since an exposé of the infamous
principles of the Jesuits was made (of which we will speak presently), the “Black Militia”
of Loyola has had ample time to lie so successfully in denying the just charges,
that even now, when the present Pope has brilliantly sanctioned the utterance of the
Bishop of Cambrai, the Roman Catholics will hardly confess to such a thing. Strange
exhibition of infallibility in the Popes! The “infallible” Pope, Clement XIV (Ganganelli),
suppressed the Jesuits on the 21st of July, 1773, and yet they came to life again; the
“infallible” Pope, Pius VII, re-established them on the 7th of August, 1814.12 The infallible
Pope Pius IX,13 travelled, during the whole of his long Pontificate, between the
Scylla and Charybdis of the Jesuit question; his infallibility helping him very little.And now the “infallible” Leo XIII (fatal figures!)
14 raises the Jesuits again to the highest
pinnacle of their sinister and graceless glory.
The recent Brevet of the Pope (hardly two years old) dated July 13th (the same fatal
figures), 1886, is an event, the importance of which can never be overvalued. It begins
with the words Dolemus inter alia,
15 and reinstalls the Jesuits in all the rights of
the Order that had ever been cancelled. It was a manifesto and a loud defiant insult
to all the Christian nations of the New and the Old worlds. From an article by Louis
Lambert in the Gaulois (August 18th, 1886) we learn that “In 1750 there were 40,000
Jesuits all over the world. In 1800, officially they were reckoned at about 1,000 men,
only. In 1886, they numbered between 7 and 8,000.”
16 This last modest number can
well be doubted. For, verily now —
Where you meet a man believing in the salutary nature of falsehoods, or the divine
authority of things doubtful, and fancying that to serve the Good Cause he
must call the devil to his aid, there is a follower of Unsaint17 Ignatius,
says Carlyle, and adds of that black militia of Ignatius that:
&quot;They have given a new substantive to modern languages. The word Jesuitism
now, in all countries, expresses an idea for which there was in nature no prototype
before. Not till these last centuries had the human soul generated that
abomination, or needed to name it. Truly they have achieved great things in the
world, and a general result that we may call stupendous&quot;.18
And now since their reinstalment in Germany and elsewhere, they will achieve still
grander and more stupendous results. For the future can be best read by the past.
Unfortunately in this year of the Pope’s jubilee the civilized portions of humanity —even the Protestant ones — seem to have entirely forgotten that past. Let then those
who profess to despise Theosophy, the fair child of early Āryan thought and Alexandrian
Neo-Platonism, bow before the monstrous Fiend of the Age, but let them not
forget at the same time its history.
It is curious to observe, how persistently the Order has assailed everything like Occultism
from the earliest times, and Theosophy since the foundation of its last Society,
which is ours. The Moors and the Jews of Spain felt the weight of the oppressive
hand of Obscurantism no less than did the Kabbalists and Alchemists of the Middle
Ages. One would think Esoteric philosophy and especially the Occult Arts, or Magic, 
were an abomination to those good holy fathers? And so indeed they would have the
world believe. But when one studies history and the works of their own authors published
with the imprimatur of the Order, what does one find? That the Jesuits have
practised not only Occultism, but BLACK MAGIC in its worst form,
19
more than any other
body of men; and that to it they owe in large measure their power and influence!To refresh the memory of our readers and all those whom it may concern, a short
summary of the doings and actings of our good friends, may be once more attempted.
For those who are inclined to laugh, and deny the subterranean and truly infernal
means used by “Ignatius’ black militia,” we may state facts!
In Isis Unveiled it was said of the holy Fraternity that:
. . . though established only in 1535 to 1540, in 1555 there was already general
outcry raised against them.20
And now once more:
. . . that crafty, learned, conscienceless, terrible soul of Jesuitism, within the
body of Romanism, is slowly but surely possessing itself of the whole prestige
and spiritual power that clings to it. . . . Throughout the whole of antiquity,
where, in what land, can we find anything like this Order or anything even approaching
it? . . . The cry of an outraged public morality was raised against this
Order from its very birth. Barely fifteen years had elapsed after the bull approving
its constitution was promulgated, when its members began to be driven away from one place to the other. Portugal and the Low Countries got rid of
them, in 1578, France in 1594; Venice in 1606; Naples in 1622. From St. Petersburg
they were expelled in 1815, and from all Russia in 1820.21
The writer begs to remark to the readers, that this, which was written in 1875, applies
admirably and with still more force in 1888. Also that the statements that follow
in quotation marks may be all verified. And thirdly, that the principles (principii )
of the Jesuits that are now brought forward, are extracted from authenticated MSS.
or folios printed by various members themselves of this very distinguished body.
Therefore, they can be checked and verified in the British Museum and Bodleian Library
with still more ease than in our works.
. . . Many are copied from the large Quarto22 published by the authority of, and
verified and collated by the Commissioners of the French Parliament. The statements therein were collected and presented to the King, in order that, as
the Arrest du Parlement du 5 Mars, 1762 expresses it, “the elder son of the
Church might be made aware of the perversity of this doctrine. . . . A doctrine
authorizing Theft, Lying, Perjury, Impurity, every Passion and Crime, teaching
Homicide, Parricide, and Regicide, overthrowing religion in order to substitute
for it superstition, by favouring Sorcery, Blasphemy, Irreligion, and Idolatry . . .
etc.”

    <div class="md"><p>Rome Maryland becomes Washington D.C. with the 1871 Organic Act</p>

<p>Founding of “Rome, Maryland”.  Rome, Maryland was the name of the city before the land was donated by Jesuit John Carroll, the wealthiest man in the US at the time, who also founded Georgetown University one year BEFORE, Washington D.C. was created</p>

<p>“Catholicism came to Maryland on March 25, 1634, an auspicious day: the Feast of the Annunciation and the first day of the English new year. A small group, Protestants and Catholics mixed, landed on a small island in the lower Potomac near the Maryland shore, and Father Andrew White celebrated Mass to bless the beginning of their colony. The Calverts came to Maryland as the Puritans had come to Massachusetts, for piety and for profit. Seeking a refuge from the Penal Laws, they hoped also to reap the benefits of a bountiful new land.” Father Andrew White is who the US “White” House is named after!!
The Jesuits came to minister to the Catholic colonists, but also with an eye to the conversion of the native population. “Who then can have a doubt,” White wrote before leaving England, “but that by this one work so glorious, many thousand souls may be led to Christ?” White and his companions overcame the hostility of some of the tribes, the prejudice of Proprietor and English settlers, and the great barrier of language to convert several tribal chiefs. At St. Mary’s City White made of an Indian hut the colony’s first chapel.</p>

<p>The name “White House,” however, was not used officially until President Theodore Roosevelt had it engraved on his stationery in 1901. Prior to that, the building was known variously as the “President’s Palace,” the “President’s House,” and the “Executive Mansion.”</p>

<p>The Capital of Amerigo, the District of Columbia is named after Pesephone, the Godess of War not the other Catholic Explorer Christopher Columbus, as the wealthy elite history books have sold us.
And the White House is named after a Jesuit Andrew White. Then Daniel Carroll (Catholic) gives the land for our National Capital. Then after 26 years of Jesuit education John Carroll (Catholic) founded Georgetown University in 1789 the same year we became a country.
 Andrew White (1579 – December 27, 1656) was an English Jesuit missionary who was involved in the founding of the Maryland colony.[1] He was a chronicler of the early colony, and his writings are a primary source on the land, the Native Americans of the area, and the Jesuit mission in North America. For his efforts in converting and educating the native population, he is frequently referred to as the “Apostle of Maryland.” He is considered a forefather of Georgetown University, and is memorialized in the name of its White-Gravenor building, a central location of offices and classrooms on the university’s campus.[2]
George Calvert, the first Baron Baltimore, whom White is credited in helping to turn to Catholicism in 1625, wrote to White from his colony on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland after 1628. White’s further interest in America is shown a letter from Superior General Mutio Vitelleschi in a letter dated March 3, 1629, approving a mission to America. Though George Calvert died in 1632, his son, Leonard Calvert, second Baron Baltimore, continued the colonization program. Baltimore had wanted White to help found a new colony in the Chesapeake Bay which had been chartered June 20, 1632. White himself wrote of the benefits of converting the native population, and in a document dated February 10, 1633, he specifically advocates Catholic settlement in “lord Baltimore’s Plantation in Mary-land.” He describes to potential financiers a paradisaical land with majestic forests and fruitful soil, advertising 2,000 acres (8 km2) of land for each potential settler.</p>

<p>Apostle of Maryland</p>

<p>On November 22, 1633, he took Baltimore’s offer and set sail from Cowes on the Isle of Wight with lord Leonard Calvert and fellow Jesuits John Altham Gravenor and Thomas Gervase on The Ark, one of George Calvert’s ships.[4] Their landing on March 25, 1634, on St. Clement’s Island marks the birth of the Maryland colony. The anniversary of this date is now celebrated as Maryland Day. In saying Catholic Mass that day, he became the first priest to do so in the original thirteen English colonies.[5] By July of that year, White had written his first discussion on the new colony, titled A Relation of the Successful Beginnings of the Lord Baltimore’s Plantation in Maryland. Sections of this were used to further advertise the colony.White spent most of the next decade in St. Mary’s City, working on English-Native American relations, particularly with the Yaocomico tribe, which consistently saw favorable trade treaties from Calvert because of White, and the Anacostans. In 1637 they were joined by Jesuits Thomas Copley and Ferdinand Poulton, and between 1634 and 1650 there averaged four permanent Jesuits in the Maryland Colony.[6] To further his missionary work, he wrote dictionaries and translated the catechism into the native languages. On July 5, 1640, he famously converted Chitomachon, the chief of the Piscataway Indians, to Christianity. The chief was baptized as Charles. He later baptized a princess of the Patuxent Indians, and much of her tribe.
In 1933, the architect and writer Christopher La Farge designed a monument to White that is located just outside St. Mary’s City.[7]
Return to England. The English Civil War was to cut short his missionary work. In 1644, Richard Ingle and Puritan colonists from the neighboring Virginian colony of Jamestown, which had previously rebuffed George Calvert’s visit, first raided St. Mary’s City. Ingle succeeded in burning the town and, with the aid of William Claiborne, in controlling the Maryland Colony. White was again arrested for his Catholic preaching, and in 1645 he was sent with Thomas Copley in chains to London. Once there, he was tried for the crime of returning to England after being banished in 1606, which carried the punishment of death. He escaped this fate by arguing that his return was not of his own will. His petitions to return to Maryland denied, he spent the last decade of his life quietly in England until his death on December 27, 1656.</p>

<p>The Jesuits’ Slaves
“Can a man serve God faithfully and posess slaves?” Brother Joseph Mobberly, S.J. asked in his diary in 1818. “Yes,” he answered. “Is it then lawful to keep men in servitude? Yes.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jesuits of the Maryland province had always relied on plantations to support their ministries. The estates were extensive, totaling 12,000 acres on four large properties in Southern Prince Georges, Charles and St. Mary’s counties, and two smaller estates on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. In 1634, when the Jesuits arrived in Maryland, Lord Baltimore awarded them quasi-estates in which they were permitted to live off the rent of tenant farmers. However, as University Dean Hubert Cloke explains, “The system was totally antiquated and romantic, not related to reality, and they realized they were not going to make any money.” So, the Jesuits turned to indentured servants, English men and women who worked the land for set terms in return for the passage from England to Maryland. But as working conditions improved in England, the supply of indentured servants dropped and the Jesuits once again found a new way to work the land. By the 1680s they relied upon a fully developed slave system.</p>

<p>Compared to other plantation owners in the area, when it came to slavery, “The Jesuits were no better or worse,” according to Cloke. Many of the slaves had been gifts from wealthy Catholic families to sustain the Church. The abolition of slavery was not an issue in the area until the early nineteenth century, when Georgetown’s Jesuits became deeply divided over the issue of slavery.</p>

<p>“But they were not conflicted in the way you would want,” Cloke said. “They were conflicted over what to do about the threat of abolitionists.”</p>

<p>In a generational divide, an older group of Jesuits, mostly European born, felt a patriarchal connection to their slaves and were unwilling to sell them. A younger, American-born group, a minority, felt that the money invested in plantations should be spent on institutions in cities like Philadelphia and New York with their rapidly growing Catholic populations. It seems neither faction had any particular moral quandaries with the six plantations and the nearly 300 slaves owned by Georgetown’s and Maryland’s Jesuits.</p>

<p>This rift is just one of the things American Studies students learned when history professors like Cloke and Emmett Curran introduced the Jesuit Plantation Project into the American Studies curriculum in the spring of 1996. The project involved students transcribing and digitizing hundreds of documents from the Jesuit’s Maryland Province Index recording the Georgetown’s Jesuits’ complicated relationship with slavery.</p>

<p>With only two exceptions, all the higher-ranking Jesuits in the province during the time were foreign-born and of the older faction. Since only U.S. citizens had temporal jurisdiction, foreign Jesuits had no authority over the Mission’s estates.</p>

<p>This meant that a younger group of American Jesuits, a minority, controlled the destiny of the estates, and this group wanted to end slave operations.</p>

<p>“They considered the plantations and slaves as a losing business enterprise and thought the Society should rid itself of both plantations and slaves,” Curran said.</p>

<p>Abolitionists presented an economic rather than moral problem for these Jesuits. With a growing abolitionist presence in Maryland, some of them feared a devaluation of their property, their slaves. Maryland was a state in which slavery had a tenuous hold, the economy was no longer driven by slave labor. According to reports, the general debt of the mission was close to $32,000 by the 1830s, a large sum for the time.</p>

<p>“It was not a market for growing crops, but for growing slaves,” said Cloke. The real money was to be made not from the work a slave could do in Maryland, but from the hugely profitable business of selling the slaves downriver.</p>

<p>In 1815, Brother Joseph Mobberly, S.J. wrote a letter to John Grassi, S.J., the president of Georgetown College, listing three major reasons to sell the slaves. He wrote, “It is better to sell for a time or get your people free … Because we have their souls to answer for.” He then went on to explain that the slaves had become more difficult to govern, and he believed this to be the result of a growing abolitionist movement. Finally, in an extensive table of expenses, he concluded that the slaves should be sold because, “We shall make more and more to your satisfaction.”</p>

<p>Brother Mobberly, who served as an overseer on one of the estates, kept an extensive diary giving a bird’s eye view of the tension the Jesuits felt surrounding the issue of slavery. His diary explores the tension between Catholics, an already persecuted group, and the Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers and Methodists who were outspokenly opposed to slavery. Mobberly, like other Jesuits, came to feel threatened and saw the issue as a Catholic-Protestant conflict. Involving everything from the Bible to Thomas Jefferson, Mobberly’s diary defended slavery. He explained that Abraham owned slaves, and wrote, “Abraham had God for his particular friend; and we do not read that God ever reproached him for keeping men in servitude. Therefore, it was lawful for him to possess them.”</p>
