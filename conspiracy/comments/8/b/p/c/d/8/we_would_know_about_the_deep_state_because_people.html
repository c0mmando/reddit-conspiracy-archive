<p>Have you ever heard someone say &quot;we would know if the Deep State exists because people can&#39;t keep secrets&quot;? They conclude that because they never heard of whistle blowers on this topic, the deep state must not exist. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem. People <em>have</em> talked.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for something a little shorter, see this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYS647HTgks">Mike Lofgren, a congressional staff member for 28 years, joins Bill Moyers to talk about what he calls Washington&#39;s &quot;Deep State,&quot; in which elected and unelected figures collude to protect and serve powerful vested interests. &quot;It is how we had deregulation, financialization of the economy, the Wall Street bust, the erosion or our civil liberties and perpetual war,&quot; Lofgren tells Moyers.</a> [26 min]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Here are anumber of 9/11 whistleblowers:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/meet-the-911-whistleblowers/">https://www.corbettreport.com/meet-the-911-whistleblowers/</a></p>

<p>The reason these subjects are often discussed is BECAUSE the government sucks at creating bullshit narratives. People sometimes believe them because the mainstream media (controlled by 6 companies at the moment) manufactures consensus by parroting the party line. People falsely perceive this flimsy trickery as the facts, the general worldview.</p>

<p>Large scale conspiracies exist- the mafia, the Manhattan project, yakuza, big pharma fuckery, MKULTRA, Operation Cointelpro, Gladio, and Mockingbird... even the MSM propaganda responses involve conspiracies involving Russians, starving polar bears, whatever... </p>

Chelsea Manning - thrown naked in to a concrete cell in isolation for months before being thrown in prison - and those were a purple actually able to pull it off - who had their lives completely ruined for it. Imagine the people with families or that don&#39;t want to be put through that. Very few people are going to expose the US government, very few of the people that try will be successful, the ones that are will be dragged through the mud by the media and called traitors, and will have their lives turned upside down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We would know about a deep state because people can&#39;t keep secrets!!!&quot;</p>

<p>OK here is why that statement is wrong.</p>

<p>You could have 100 different whistleblowers on different topics but supposedly we can only have &quot;CONFIRMATION&quot; of the facts from crooked grifting politicians or Corporate &quot;News&quot; media that lives off ad revenues of corporate sponsors.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the only way we can have confirmation of a unelected Deep State.....believe me in that case we will NEVER HAVE CONFIRMATION because they control both the mass press &amp; politicians do whatever money tells them to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen the concerted effort to conceal the Mandella effect by various news outlets, I’ve seen disinformation, fake whistle blowers, clever news articles fronting it out (the most recent was news about how everyone got the friends theme song lyrics wrong, now confined to the silly websites), surprised looking teens on you tube about the Mandella effect, effectively making it a joke thing. </p>

<p>The other one would be about the coming solar minimum and potential for the loss of millions of hectares in arable land. The facts are out there, they are just muddied by a ton of other disinformation so you don’t really know what to think. Take 9:11 we all know something smells wrong about the whole thing, so there are now a multitude of conspiracies to muddy the waters, the truth will be there just hard to ascertain what it actually is, and you still have to be careful which whistleblowers are real.

<p>Even here there will be misinformation and psy ops, if the new world order wants to rule they have to make it so we know about it, as people don’t take well to sudden change, so it’s gently leaked until it’s not a surprise anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One excellent counter to this argument is the Manhattan Project. Tens of thousands, if not over a hundred thousand people worked on this project and there was never a leak. Compartmentalization was largely responsible, but this is what I always mention when people drop the old-&quot;someone would have talked&quot;. Even if people do talk their is no guarantee that the wider world would know because the media act as a filter and have many ways of killing stories and discrediting whistle blowers, as does the govt.</p>

This is how it works folks, its not even that complicated. Its a hornets nest of special interests with money and greed running everything. Deep state/shadow gov is the source of all the conflicts the US gets involved in. Its why the Syria thing is happening right now in front of our eyes. </p>

<p>The only thing that amazes me is how the vast majority of people in the US refuse to face this reality. As if its so crazy of an idea that corruption in the most powerful country on earth would be a thing. I guess its safer to just root for your team in the two party system.  </p>

<p>The concept of the deep state becomes problematic when it’s used as evidence to simply make up stories you are already inclined to believe in place of actual evidence. You should always ask yourselves if this story is the kind of story you would naturally be inclined to believe and be skeptical of blaming the deep state without evidence. You should also suspect that the deep state is involved in policies that you favor, like Trump. If they want to divide, then he is the perfect candidate. He cleverly nods and winks at this sub and has online operatives to defend him online. He’s an oligarch supported by oligarchs. My two cents.</p>
