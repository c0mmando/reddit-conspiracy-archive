      <p>
       Naturally, Russia is defending itself after the latest accusations against them and Syria with respect to the latest alleged chemical weapon attack. While such denials should be taken with a grain of salt, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       important to remember that the White Helmets are nothing but a propaganda outlet that's been caught staging similar events in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the alleged chemical attack is still
       <em>
        alleged
       </em>
       , it stands to reason that the White Helmets (or a simliar group) could just as likely be the culprit as any other faction, if not
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is a statement from Russia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On April 6, the new head of Jaysh al-Islam, following instructions of sponsors, derailed the evacuation of a party of fighters from Douma and resumed the rocket and mortar fire against residential areas in Damascus.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to official information, eight people died. 37 civilians were wounded. Unfortunately, we failed to see statements from Western capitals condemning the shelling of a historical district of Damascus. The following day, April 7, fighters accused the Syrian authorities of dropping barrel bombs with toxic substances. At the same time, diversions were being mixed up. It was either called sarin, chlorine, or a mix of toxic gases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on a well-known scheme, these rumors were immediately taken out by those who are financed by western capitalists; I am referring to NGOs and the White Helmets who are mendaciously acting under the cloak of health professionals. And these reports were also taken up and transferred to media outlets.
       </p>
       <p>
        It behooves us once again to state that many of these dubious structures have a clear list of the email addresses of representatives of Security Council members, which shows that some of our colleagues, with a reckless approach towards their status, are leaking sensitive information to their protégés.
       </p>
       <p>
        Incidentally, all should recall the way that accidentally, the White Helmets put on the internet a video which showed preparations for staging a so-called victim of an alleged attack perpetrated by the Syrian army.
       </p>

       I'm agnostic towards the Helmet men. I've heard the US and Russian propaganda. It makes more sense for "rebels" (terrorists) to use chems than Assad.

       Look up the vids of them staging sympathy shoots. Remember that Syrian kid covered in ash on the cover of Time? Faked by them. That iconic washed up dead kid on a beach? Faked by them.
       <em>
        Both
       </em>
       the recent false flag gas attacks? Faked by them. All of this is on video for the world to see. It's despicable, what these zionists do. The very definition of crying while you strike.

       Possibly. Russia alleges that they are Al-Nusra. They blow some shit up and return with the helmets. Their response time would be amazing if that's true.

       At this point I don't have hours to spend on something that may itself be staged. That's a minor detail. The bigger point is that we should do absolutely nothing except cut and run in Syria. Siphoning through footage and narratives up until now has proven at least that. I don't like that MSM can try to tie foreign crisis actor (which is more believable and has a more direct policy aspect) to domestic crisis actor (more dubious) as a means to discredit it. Hell they don't really have to do that at this point with the Govt beating the war drums.

       That doesn't say they staged the attacks. It says that they used corpses to take emotive photos. That still means the attack happened.

       False flag(someone else committed the act) or hoax(video is faked with actors)?

       Either is more likely that the official narrative.

       I have actually spoken in person with Syrian refugees who had actually been the area when a chemical attack happened and who had friends and family affected. Of course, that doesn't confirm this one is real, but I personally think that it was. My logic is that they have clearly happened before, and why would it be easier to stage an attack when you could just actually do it for real? Operation Northwoods tells us that America is perfectly comfortable with committing false flag attacks. The country is also perfectly comfortable with performing horrific acts of violence against civilians in order to get its way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say I think America did it. I'm just saying it would hardly be unprecedented if they did. But I think staging the attack would be needlessly complex and risky.
