    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll make it clearer then my other post of ellipses. </p>

<p>OP is obviously feeling lost, frustrated, and venting about something that must be really hard to cope with. And you come in here and summarize them, dismiss them, and then offer no empathy, or useful insight. Then you make it all about how you&#39;ve got it all figured out and how great you are. At least that&#39;s how it comes off. To me, it shows total lack of awareness of others, but most prominently awareness of self. </p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-4" data-depth="4" data-id="dxb32as">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/DonnaGail.html">DonnaGail</a> 2018-04-13</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t dismissing OP at all. We all have these feelings at one time or another in our life. But some of us have these feelings more often than others.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t intend to come across as dismissive. I do apologize (and I will copy and paste this for OP, as well). I was tired last night and didn&#39;t feel like typing a huge comment. I wanted to find out if this person was a &quot;glass half empty&quot; or &quot;glass half full&quot; kind of person first. So this is my fault and I apologize. I shouldn&#39;t type/comment when I&#39;m tired.</p>

<p>If you know me from here online, I am considerate and kind 99.9% of the time. Yesterday happened to be a sad and tiring day. Had a death in the family on Monday. Yesterday was the visitation at the funeral home.</p>

<p>If OP really feels this way all the time, it is not good. Depression and hopeless thoughts are not good mentally or physically for a person.</p>

<p>Like I said, we&#39;ve all felt this way before. I certainly have! But as time went on, I realized that by changing my attitude (thinking more positively) it changed my circumstances. Not overnight, mind you. But gradually, things began to brighten.</p>

<p>When I start having hopeless feelings, I now stop and think about all the things that I am thankful for. Yes, it sounds corny, but it works for me. Example: I&#39;m not in a wheelchair. I have two good legs to walk around on, so I&#39;m thankful for that. It could be a lot worse!</p>

<p>Also, my life is not perfect. Far from it. I have a 19 year old son with autism. He will never live on his own. He will always be dependent upon me and live with me. But I love him and I&#39;m fine with this. Also, I realize it could be a lot worse. I&#39;m thankful that he is physically fine/well. Autism does not affect/effect his life expectancy.</p>

<p>So again, I apologize to OP and everyone else if I came across as dismissive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that stepping away from your connection is important.  You&#39;re not very likely to better your life on reddit. </p>

<p>A year ago I was in debt with a garbage on call-job that never called me.  Now I&#39;m working somewhere much better, I&#39;m out of debt and I have a crypto wallet stuffed with coins.  </p>

<p>Your circumstances CAN change.  But it&#39;s up to you to figure out how to make it happen.  Go for a walk, or visit the local library.  Learn the flute.  Do anything, it really doesn&#39;t matter.  Be creative.  If you&#39;re depressed lay in bed.  Just try, that&#39;s all that matters I think.</p>

<p>You will never get ahead in life by expecting something from no effort.</p>

<p>You must create your own business. Luckily this is the easiest time in history to do so. Get a hobby. Learn something. Be interested in something that involves creating things. Things people buy.

    <div class="md"><p>You do have a choice, you have infinite potential and can create your own reality my fiend. You can wake up tomorrow and decide everything is going to change for you and meet someone new and do something you have never done and embark on a new journey. Also it may be helpful to realize the elites, rich people, famous people, are not any happier than anyone else, everyone has problems and issues. As well as the most sure fire way to have a fulfilled life is to forget about your own problems and just help other people and be of service to others, that&#39;s one of the biggest secrets around. The most selfish thing you can do is help somebody else. I can give some links to some reading material that entertaining and could be empowering if you want, but really I think you already have all the answers you may just need to ask some new questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Breathe, friend. Shit is heavy, yes... but, it&#39;s not as heavy you may think (this is place/mentality TPTB truly want you to be at and stuck at - it perpetuates the rat race and solidifies their matrix). </p>

<p>My advice? Check out Alan Watts on YT. Once you&#39;ve done that, organize your mind, body, and Spirit Being (or should I say... actually listen to it - <strong>its you</strong>). </p>

<p>Go out in nature. Camp by a decent size body of water, if you can. Be in nature, light a campfire, hear the water flow, animals running around, birds chirping. Smell the air. Do it for yourself. That is a million times more fulfilling than a 90k salary, and living a life of materialism. Trust me. </p>

<p>Think about what you actually want in this life (it&#39;s not your only one - but your Soul Being chose  <strong>this one and to be here for a reason</strong>).</p>

<p>Maybe, look into Finding a piece of land (it&#39;s actually cheaper than most think - and  even 1 acre(s) would do - looking at under $5k in most places). You can fully live off that land, and if the community is small enough (like under 20k people, in my experience), you can barter. You don&#39;t even need money, for the most part.</p>

<p>...or do like some are doing with Van Dwelling, and traveling the Country. There are many options out there, you just have to decide and figure out what you want. It&#39;s hard (I know), and I&#39;ve been there, and am still there in many ways. Always look within, and trust your gut. Never let fear (or others) dissuade you from pursuing happiness, knowledge, growth, and enlightenment. We are all one (in a sense), but most importantly, we are all individuals. </p>

<p>Peace and love!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between having enough and having too much. The elites have too much. Apparently having too much might be good for their ego, but they also seem like a bunch of miserable people, generally speaking. Anyone who takes delight at the suffering of others can not be happy. They are compelled by aquiring more and more, as if they are prisoners to their own desires. The real kicker is they are amassing things that they will never take with them after they die. The only true thing that they really own then is a rotten, distorted soul. Wealth is a poor metric for judging oneself or others, no matter how many people think otherwise.</p>

<p>You can have a job that you enjoy doing, a loving family and have enough to be very comfortable, while still be considered a &quot;wage slave&quot;. What more would you really want than that? Sure, it is unfortunate that the bastards are still in control, but that is changing for the better in my opinion as more and more people become aware of the collective situation we are in. </p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend reading or listening to some Alan Watts, Terrence McKenna and Zen writings.</p>

<p>Just as <a href="/u/ShitHitsTheMan">/u/ShitHitsTheMan</a> said, desire is merely a prison and an illusion. What&#39;s the point in always acquiring more if it never satisfies you? Better to just have no desire at all, right? Then you are always satisfied with even the least possessions. I am not saying yo stay stagnant and never change, I am more talking about material possessions. What you amass physically in this life stays behind after you die, what you do to better yourself and others to leave a legacy behind is what will stick with you beyond death.</p>

<p>It may just sound like &quot;feel good bullshit&quot; to someone like you who doesn&#39;t fully understand it, but to others it can be and literally is a way of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could just start trainhopping and taking odd jobs when you can get them. It’s less crazy and uncommon  than you think.</p>

<p>Our work has been systematically devalued for decades. Wages are stagnant, rent rises every month, college/medical bills are astronomical... bettering yourself is hard work but hell, man, try to learn a trade or take a few classes. Pardon the cliche but you can’t hit a home run without swinging the bat. </p>

<p>Even if you don’t want to do all that, there are options. Don’t want to work in a warehouse? What do you like? Records, danger? Apply to a record store or a repo place. </p>

<p>Still, anything’s better than death. If nothing matters then why not go for broke? Ever watch Rick and Morty? <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=szzVlQ653as">Remember the Roy video game?</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will echo what was already written, but I will address two major points. The first is your acute state of mental health, and the second is philosophical background on the question you asked concerning work. </p>

<p>If you are having suicidal ideation than you need to get help to stabilize.  If its possible, talk to professionals, and develop a support network  if possible, that knows how you feel.   You need to disconnect from the &#39;conspiracy&#39; world a bit, and focus on something positive. Enjoy nature, and engage in some activity where you are physically moving with people you love.</p>

<p>Books that are topical and I found very helpful, center around what the meaning of &#39;work&#39;, as a category that structures our world actually is.   The first books is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shop-Class-Soulcraft-Inquiry-Value/dp/0143117467">Shop Class as Soulcraft</a>.  In this work, the author, who actually worked for a Global Warming denial propaganda farm engages in an exploration of the difference between skilled manual labor and unskilled labor, and what the differences are for being a human.   </p>

<p>The second book, I am somewhat apprehensive to post, but I think it is really insightful. That is the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/preface.htm">1844 Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of Marx</a>, especially the section called, &quot; Estranged Labour&quot;.   It is an exploration of what work really is, as an activity that connects human beings, where we satisfy each others needs, and in doing so reproduce a social organism, and it is an exploration how we become alienated, and how these activities start to appear as forces outside of our control, that control us, and are deeply exploitative.  They don&#39;t have to be that way.  </p>

<p>I hope this was somewhat helpful, and I hope you feel better soon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find many doctors to be dogmatic, shallow social climbers eager to exploit people. The best of them think they’re being helpful while the feed you poison.</p>

<p>Building and maintaining social networks is important. Therapists/psychologists are like hookers- they serve as a sort of paid version of  what should come from your social network. Your wife, your father, your friend... those are the people that truly love and seek to understand you. </p>

<p>Also, sometimes the sources of problems are located in these social networks themselves, and here, a professional is valuable because of detachment in evaluating the situation, and in allowing the freedom to the patient to explore these issues, that can&#39;t be done the same in the family setting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the hell do you think they are happy? The elites are the most physically repulsive, ugly worms on the planet and they are hateful and vengeful and extremely unhappy. Happy people don’t murder children usually. </p>

<p>They are so unhappy that they have gotten sick of the general rich person life. They have gotten sick of nice cars and private cruises and hot ladies. These people probably bathe in their own shit and they torture their children for fun and they buy the most disgusting, degenerate, and worthless pieces of art for over 10 million dollars sometimes. They are unhappy and they get thrills from doing things nastier than you can imagine. </p>

<p>Life is tough kid. We go through cycles. “Strong men bring good times. Good times bring weak men. Weak men bring bad times. And bad times bring strong men.” We are at the point of weak men bringing bad times. It’s unfortunate that it has to be like that but it is life. Life is a struggle. </p>

<p>I also wanted to commit suicide. I didn’t go through with it. There is someone in the world that would be devastated if you died and there will be a lot of people that would gladly take you in if you open up about your feelings. Also, find God. Being religious is the best thing you could do. And you need to take this seriously. </p>

<p>Wage slaves can be happy. I don’t know your situation but there is still opportunities to move up the economic ladder in America. You don’t necessarily have to be piss poor. Nothing wrong with working your ass off and being a wage slavery though. Find a wife and kick it with her after the 9 to 5 rat race in your small house or apartment or whatever you can afford hopefully without the mortgage rats making it too tough on you. </p>

<p>Life is ups and downs, you are probably in a down right now. Also you need to believe in God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re getting plenty of good advice here but let me suggest a few things that haven’t been said.</p>

<p>You are having lots of negative thoughts.  We can call it depression or a chemical imbalance or whatever we want, doesn’t matter.  Here’s a few great ways to have more positive thoughts...</p>

<p>Start every day with exercise.  I don’t care if its two minutes of jogging in place.  Exercise.  Everyday.  It releases chemicals that make you happy, you’ll feel a sense of pride from it, and it will boost your metabolism.</p>

<p>Stay away from drugs, drinking, and heavily overeating.  Everything in moderation, but if you do this stuff often then it’s gonna make you feel worn down and hopeless.</p>

<p>Stay away from negative people if you can.  Do you have a friend who always talks about how bad things are?  Maybe spend a couple hours less with them every week.</p>

<p>Hope this helps man, take care :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, I have came across your issue which you have laid out here and there, about life being pointless. Very much the same feeling I had, except that I have always felt that there is something more to life than meets the eye, like a whole different reality, truth but could never see or find out what or where that is. Now, today I know that what you have described is just one side of life to which we have been born into. The matrix of lies build for many thousands of years. No wonders at all why we feel so bad about this life, everything is or going towards absolute opposition of how things meant to be &quot;by nature&quot;. That&#39;s my short explanation of the reasons you are in a state that you are in.</p>

<p>Secondly, most of subs you have posted by their nature of ideas are not really suited well to answer your question or help you a lot. Especially useless being askphilosophy subreddit, while taoism actually could set you on the right path. I would suggest other subreddits. Meditation, Chakras, and even a Psychonaut subreddits in my experience have a lot of info and people that will probably give you very good answers to your questions. I would go to Meditation, read their FAQ and then ask away in their subreddit.</p>

<p>I am just indifferent human and trying to genuinely help. Take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t overthink it. Fight your battles and make your own path. Not everyone can be born into richness, but anyone can get there. And what is richness, anyway? Wealth should not be defined by your material posessions. You should strive to be the most mindful and thoughtful person you can ever be. Read books, study human nature, observe your surroundings, get in touch with nature and the world around you. Don&#39;t stay at home mindlessly consuming trash-tier media and dwelling on the sad news your TV keeps feeding you. </p>

<p>Working for your money is an essential part of your development as a human being. We are teaching our youth to be scared from work and taking responsabilities. We are feeding them memes that call for a revolution against capitalism and tell them to hate evil corporations. And we make them forget that they were born into society. That they have all the benefits or years of technology, medicine and human rights. And it still isn&#39;t enough for them, they want more. They forget that they have a responsability as members of society, that they are part of the cycle of the human race.</p>

<p>Denial should never be the answer. Should you still be mad that some priviliged dudes are still making more in day than what you&#39;ll ever make in your whole life? Of course you should. But don&#39;t use that as an excuse to dodge your responsabilities as a member of society. Don&#39;t use it as a coping mechanism. Use it as fuel to reach your goals and be a better person. What else is there to do with the time we were given?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with your first paragraph. I simply disagree with the rest of it. What development to being a human being is defined by working to make money? To see that what our society is now and how it is run IS a huge part of the madness that we all live in. I would argue that $$$ and greed is at the base of a majority of the issues. Why should people not be taught about evil corporations? That they are destructive and contributing to the misery? Technology, medicine and human rights aren&#39;t applied equally to everyone. Once again why that is comes back to $$$ imo. What exact responsibility do people have in this society...just to buy in and keep it going in its current state? Why should someone be mad at someone who makes more than them in teir entire lifetime? Isn&#39;t that contradicting what you said in your first paragraph? The way we can spend our time given is a deeply personal question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should clarify - I&#39;m not promoting ignorance. You should know about the good and the bad stuff happening in the world. You should know how the working class is exploited in the benefit of the 1%. But it is highly unlikely anything meaningful will happen in our lifetimes, so the best strategy is to stop dwelling on tragedies and adapt to the environment. </p>

<p>I believe that working is an integral part of your development as a human being. I believe that when we reach a point where universal basic incoming is a thing, we&#39;ll have to completely restructure society and create activities that substitute old jobs. Humans cannot fuction without an persistent activity that fills most of their days. You could say &quot;well, people will then turn to their hobbies and be more creative and live happier lives&quot;. Some will, but most will be lost and resort to apathy (in my opinion).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get sad. Get involved!</p>

<p>We need society to work in a very similar way as it does now for us all to survive.
The idea that all 7 billion of us can live close to nature and be &#39;free&#39; is not possible if we want everyone to live and be healthy.
Someone has to make the medication, keep food on the shelves.</p>

<p>And with a society it helps to have a leader, someone to steer the ship in the direction that is best for everyone. </p>

<p>So our world isn&#39;t as bleak as it is made out.
We aren&#39;t born into servitude. It is more about being a cog in a big machine. All doing our little bit to make life easier for ourselves and our neighbour. </p>

<p>Yes we need to fix the system.
Make it one that shares the wealth around properly, so we are all living a great life.</p>

<p>It is of course more complicated than that.
There are only so many resources, and given that currently a good lifestyle is resource heavy, it can&#39;t be rolled out to everyone.
It is a shame that it is so heavily pushed as a measure of success. The mansion, the garage full of cars, the expensive jewellery. 
But none of it actually means shit. 
Any car will get you to your destination. Any bed will give you a nights sleep. You don&#39;t need to wake up to gold and marble to be happy or successful.</p>

<p>But if we want society to be fairer, and fight for it, -in the same way people fought for human rights all throughout history- we can make it happen.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that nobody wants to be a small cog. 
Society doesn&#39;t appreciate the vital work of the smaller cog. We all want to be the driver of our own journey. 
But we built society as the system works. We are happier and healthier and have more freedom than ever before.
Try working all hours to grow your own food, or even stay warm. 
Good luck if you ever get sick. </p>

<p>The fact that you have the internet and hot water on tap means you are already doing better than most. 
Instead of having the outlook of being defeated that no-one asked you to be a cog, realise you have the option to do whatever you want with your life!
Are you ever going to steer the ship?
No, probably not.</p>

<p>But you can play your part and do it while living an incredible life.
You can literally go anywhere and do anything (within reason) you just need the focus to pick a path and follow it.</p>

<p>We need to worry less about TPTB. We will always have TPTB in some form if we want society to work.
But get involved. 
You could help change things for the better.
Or set a goal and head for it</p>

<p>You live in a time where the whole world&#39;s information is at your fingertips, don&#39;t focus too much on who&#39;s out trying to control others. Yes, we are a small cog. TPTB will use us as a part of the machine. But it is one that saved billions of lives and gives us a great life, even if others have more. 
Use your time online to look at the things that interest you.
Always wanted to live in Paris?...Google flight costs. Research jobs. Go on youtube and learn the language. Set that goal and work hard for it, and you can do it!

In the past you would take on your father&#39;s job, as that is all the information you had access to. You didn&#39;t have the option to learn anything else.
But we do today.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not slaves. Just part of a system built by people who came before us. But within that system we have a lot of options. More than they ever did. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t feel defeated. Don&#39;t feel like you are a slave. Not without appreciating everything it brings. 
We aren&#39;t scared. We aren&#39;t hungry. We have so many options it often leaves people aimless. But focus on what you want in life. Get that knowledge &amp; go for it! </p>

<p>So what if you aren&#39;t a billionaire? 
Isn&#39;t the big con that we are told money and power equals success? Let those people waste their lives on something so worthless, instead aim to be happy and comfortable. </p>

<p>Realise you do have money and power...and options! 
&amp; then try to help those in parts of the world who don&#39;t</p>

<p>We can&#39;t look at TPTB and blame them for not caring about us, when we don&#39;t care about those less fortunate.</p>

<p>We want a better society? Let&#39;s build it.
All these old fossils will be dead soon. A new world is coming, led by the geeks. They are already the new billionaires shaping the future. </p>

<p>We still won&#39;t be in the driving seat, still just a cog in a system that is designed to help everyone, but the future isn&#39;t bleak. We aren&#39;t slaves. Only possibly told to think we are by aiming for what keeps the power/money so divided. We literally can&#39;t all be millionaires. Can&#39;t all own that fleet of Ferraris. But we don&#39;t even need to buy into that. Be happy. Follow your own path and your own measure of success. 
You can do it and it is literally the opposite of being a slave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been in your position and although I&#39;m super busy with work I really want to put this down in writing in the hopes it will help you and others feeling this way...</p>

<p>Build your own business. It&#39;s hard work and you work longer hours than you would in a corporate job but if it&#39;s something you love then work doesn&#39;t need to feel like &quot;work&quot;. It becomes part of your life, it defines you and it&#39;s a great feeling when you start to make a living from it. You just need to be 100% committed and be prepared to work really fucking hard to hit your goals. </p>

<p>I did the whole corporate career working for cunt bosses and not getting paid enough for the shit I had to take. I worked my way up the ladder, then decided enough is enough. Started my business and had to live like a pauper for years but it does pay off eventually, as long as you&#39;re committed and good at what you do. Be good to your clients and customers, go above and beyond and build strong relationships with them.</p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t get a credit card, don&#39;t take out loans. Live within your means. </p>

<p>Use your spare time wisely take long walks in the outdoors. Get off your screen, get off your phone, don&#39;t use social media, don&#39;t read the news, disconnect from it and focus on your own bubble. There&#39;s nothing you can do to stop world events from transpiring so just get away from this shit from time to time. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t even consider suicide. It&#39;s the easy way out. I&#39;ve been in some dark places when it seemed like the only option, but it&#39;s not. You need to talk to your family / friends. People only know you need help if you tell them, there&#39;s no shame in it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a great quote in &quot;The Blacklist&quot; which I think sums up suicide perfectly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddington: &quot;Have you ever seen the aftermath of a suicide bombing?&quot;</p>

<p>Woman: &quot;We&#39;re wasting time.&quot;</p>

<p>Reddington: &quot;I have. June 29th, 2003. I was meeting two associates at the Marouche restaurant in Tel Aviv. As my car was pulling up, a 20-year-old Palestinian named Ghazi Safar entered the restaurant and detonated a vest wired with C-4&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The shock wave knocked me flat, blew out my eardrums. I couldn&#39;t hear. The smoke... It was like being under water. I went inside. A nightmare. Blood, parts of people. You could tell where Safar was standing when the vest blew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was like a perfect circle of death. There was almost nothing left of the people closest to him. Seventeen dead, 46 injured. Blown to pieces.&quot;</p>

<p>The closer they were to the bomber, the more horrific the effect.</p>

<p>Woman:&quot;Stop.&quot;</p>

<p>Reddington: <em>That&#39;s every suicide</em>. Every single one. An act of terror perpetrated against everyone who&#39;s ever known you. Everyone who&#39;s ever loved you. The people closest to you, the ones who cherish you are the ones who suffer the most pain, the most damage. Why would you do that? Why would you do that to people who love you?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, sit up, get off the computer go out for a walk in the countryside and think about how YOU are going to change YOUR life.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the pain my friend. I&#39;ve been alive almost 3 decades and have always detested money and credit, and learning about the global pyramid scheme run by the central bank controllers has only exacerbated my hatred. </p>

<p>However, using systems thinking has started to help me peel my attention away from the powers that be. The political-economic-ecological global system is not authoritatively controlled by any one or any single group. Yes, a group of 147 trans national corporations wield immense power, but they can only hope to nudge and react to the system. Yes, they have gotten very good at it over the centuries.</p>

<p>But we, the people, are many. Yes, we are sheep, but that is as much a strength as a weakness. Stick your head into the right communities and you&#39;ll find that millions, if not billions of people are raising their awareness beyond a profit driven system toward the real important things in life and this world. We are becoming aware at a faster pace than all of human history. Aware that we can live a life with joy and meaning by doing work that regenerates ecology and community. We will not stand for doing work that extracts natural and cultural capital for financial capital, while merely offsetting the negative with a few positive investments. We can produce food <em>while healing land</em>, and without having to own land.</p>

<p>Look to the regenerative agricultural, ecological farming, rewilding and permaculture communities. La Via Campesina, the peasant life, is a global movement with over <strong>300 million</strong> people fighting to be free of corporate control and abuse. </p>

<p>Read David Fleming for the most nuanced and forward thinking perspective of capitalism and human economies. He wrote something of an encyclopedia about Lean Communities, and another guy, Shaun Chamberlin distilled the massive tome into a great read that presents an extremely refreshing, often mind blowing look at culture and economy. We learned in school about the Dark Ages as a rough time for human society, but in reality it was the People&#39;s Age. It was a time full of joy and celebration and meaning in the community because authoritarian rule was weak. </p>

<p>Let yourself relax about the authoritarian control of the powers that be. That is your power and birthright, take hold of it and live your life the way you want. If you choose to avoid the main life tracks that lead to wealth and a retirement account, there is a vast amount of opportunity to lead a simpler and potentially much more meaningful and joyful life. Make friends that are doing the same and you will find yourself letting go of the fear and hate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elite are completely miserable while people making mere fractions of what they make lead happy fulfilling happy lives, why is that? </p>

<p>It’s because sheer wealth and power isn’t enough to spiritually fulfill you, they’re empty monsters desperately clinging to a feeling of control in a material space where nothing can be controlled forever, they know deep down inside that there everything they have done is for their own selfish gain and with that level of power nothing phases you, they lack the love we feel for each other and the joy we get from fighting through problems in life.</p>

<p>Nothing in life is permanently attainable, the only certainty we face is change, and that goes for them too, at the end of the day they know their power is limited and only surface level based on the dirty tricks they pulled on good people.</p>

<p>While you can’t change everything overnight you can try to enjoy your life and if you leave the world even a little better than it was before you came in you can personally know that you you are living on a higher spiritual path than they are and they can revel in their own misery. Isn’t that the best revenge?</p>

<p>I would just learn to stop being upset about things you can’t change and do your best to accept life as it is and live it to the greatest potential you possibly can. Life is unfair even without the elites, there will always be someone stronger better and more powerful there to wreck your shit, there wont be that perfect human utopia in our lifetime, so I think we gotta make our own happiness and find it within what we already have,  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Learn a trade like welding or auto repair, machining or metal fabricatiom, something you can go do basically anywhere. Its never too late in life to learn a trade. Hopefully something that allows you to work with your hands and have to think to overcome problems. Jobs like this allow you to see real results of your efforts. There is always an end goal, something to accomplish and produce. Bonus points if open your own business in an area where your service is in high demand. </p>

<p>Its better if you can form a passion or bond with the trade.  Then find hobbies to fill your time, possibly a love interest and long term goals.  In this way, youre not just a wage slave. You are working for something that you desire. If you dont desire anything, thats no ones fault. What else are you going to do with your time? We are only here waiting to die, and if you dont want to participate in the hustle and bustle of keeping the elite fat, there are always other options. There are entire villages of people living off the grid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think of it like this: there are two worlds (them vs us) that exist side by side and they&#39;re constantly colliding. But the collisions are minor enough that they generally don&#39;t affect our day to day. Because of that, we get to experience the things our planet still has to offer us. There&#39;s a chance that one of these days the two worlds will collide and everyone&#39;s worst fears will be here, but honestly, it&#39;s such a small chance. What&#39;s likely to happen is what has always happened in human history. Rinse and repeat.  </p>

<p>In 2014-15 my income was $97k. I dropped out in 10th grade. Worked in cabinetry for several years, age 14 to 23, moved up in wages. Made probably $38k max. Was happy with this but I was born with a bone disease and I fractured my arm assembling a cabinet one day at work so I had to make a life change. Got a GED at 23. Went to community college at 25 for architectural design, landed a job my first semester, dropped out by my third semester. After 7 years with the company, I partnered with the architect in a separate business in 2013. In august 2016, I was stopped dead in my tracks when I reached the peak of a 2 month psychotic episode. Everything was downhill from there. Last year I was diagnosed with schizzoaffective disorder and I haven&#39;t made a damn penny since. I&#39;m getting better daily.  My point is life sucks man. You can&#39;t spend your days looking at your pennies while starring at another dudes pile of cash, you&#39;ll just stay broke and bitter. You got to find something you like, and become good at it and people will throw money at you. You can&#39;t expect to work a year or two and make a fortune. And a note about fast food, my brother-in-law is regional manager for  BK, has been for 13 years, takes care of a family of 4, all have nice cars, health insurance, and my sister has terminal cancer and his insurance covers her meds. Everything takes time my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a society we just need to change the system so that the workers benefit more from gains in productivity. It would not take much more income overall for everyone to be free from wage slavery and it can be done without crippling the world economy. As we move towards a more automated future, we have to look towards solutions like universal basic income. The fact of the matter is if your job can be automated then someone will do it, even if you were willing to work for $1.00/hr the robot would be more profitable to the company in the long run. Those gains from productivity should be distributed to the soon to be unemployed instead of those who have been living off trust funds their entire lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had the exact same thoughts recently. Everything that&#39;s been happening lately has made me wonder what the point of it all is. But I&#39;ve decided that I have to at least try and help what I can. If we all give up, they win. Allow yourself time and space to feel like this. But then use it as fuel to motivate you. I&#39;ve never posted in this sub before, but I am now in the hopes I can help you a little. Be grateful that you&#39;re aware of this terrible bullshit, and feeling like you do means you care. You&#39;re better than them! Remember... Be the change you want to see in the world. All of us doing our little bit will make a difference. And if it doesn&#39;t, at least we tried.</p>

<p>A little bit more rambling... My Nana was home guard in London during World War 2 shooting down military aircraft, had her ear drums blown out and suffered, what I believe was, PTSD and later dementia. She suffered 7 years in a catatonic state until finally her body gave up. My Granddads brother was a fighter pilot and was killed somewhere over France, his body never found again, never got to have a family of his own. All for some bullshit war that benefited no one except the elites. We need to make sure nothing like happens again. No one should suffer for their selfish wants. We all have to do our bit and make sacrifices for future generations. I&#39;m grateful I know who the enemy really is.
... Not saying we have to go to war or anything... But even helping others understand what&#39;s happening in this world is a step in the right direction :) </p>

<p>There are plenty of things that can give life purpose and pleasure, even the smallest things. (just ask my girlfriend)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Build your own company.
Work hard, buy land, become as self-sufficient as you can. 
Sun rises, sun sets, bird song, naked women under your covers, climb mountains, cold rivers, warm seas, good wine, strong beer, sleeping under the stars, barbecued meat, roasted meat, chocolate eclairs, caramel brownies, live music, albums through headphones, cinematic masterpieces, trashy blockbusters, hang-gliding, surfing, going really fast downhill on a bike, standing alone by a lake, standing with someone by a lake, riding a packed bus in a hot country not quite sure where you&#39;re going but with money in your pocket and nowhere to be, french fries, Thai food, your favourite sports team winning, riding a fucking horse across fucking lava fields in the land of fucking giants, engrossed in an epic story sitting in the shade whilst the sea laps against the shore, coming on someone&#39;s tits, rainy days in bed watching Netflix.</p>

It&#39;s so depressing that I can&#39;t spend my life doing things I love because I have to spend most of the day at work and when I&#39;m back home I don&#39;t have the energy for literally anything. A month of paid vacation is not a satisfying trade-off for the amount of time I have to spend working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may not be much help, but I hope it is. I came to this very realization/feeling after college. What really eased me was the realization that I have an ability the elites don&#39;t. Yeah, my life may be similar to an ant when compared to the elites; however, in the grand scheme of things, there&#39;s no way I could ever fuck anything up enough that it would matter on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Now, if I was somehow related to (or part of) TPTB and was figured out, arrested, what have you, then my wife or kids or family as a whole are at risk. Sure I don&#39;t get to run the world like they do, but that&#39;s perfectly fine by me. It also means the worst thing that can happen to me on a day-by-day basis is maybe I&#39;m late to work or have car troubles or something.</p>

<p>As others have commented, conspiracies really have a draining effect on you. I went through a phase in my life where they were all I could think about, and &quot;breaking the electronic chains&quot; as danielsaid and ridestraight said seemed like I was &quot;giving up&quot;. But, I think one of the major steps of being an adult is coming to terms with (and hopefully learning to enjoy) your relative insignificance.</p>

<p>Hope this helps at least a bit.</p>

<p>What do you mean that you have no choice but to be a wage slave? Go be self employed, or go suckle at the teet of social services, or find a job you like.

    <div class="md"><p>It’s important to find a creative outlet and try realize a few things. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>While your thoughts and opinions can change the world, but most likely they won’t.</p></li>
<li><p>The constant barrage of news is not healthy for anyone, finding a sense of humor about your self and the world is required for sanity.</p></li>
<li><p>Class mobility upwards ( poverty to middle class) is very hard to accomplish, so creating things and finding enjoyment in hobbies is key.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing how the elites operate or if UFOs are real wont make you happy.  What can make you happy is producing something outside your normal work day. Writing a song, starting a podcast or learning Python Programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge: my current situation is not optimal, what can I do to make it a little better?  That could me taking Online classes or learning how to do home improvements.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can only control your self, so take control of what you do. Use your current situation as a launching pad.  You must discover a passion, a drive like you’ve never known. </p>

<p>For me, that’s podcasting and being accountable to my listeners, to produce content on a weekly basis. This forces my to learn new things,  produce something I’m mostly proud off.  </p>

<p>Things maybe bleak, but if you have access to the Internet, you can learning anything you want to aid you in being a little more content. All the news and conspiracies will be here to tomorrow, focus on yourself today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I often find myself getting too reved up by everything happening around me. I will usually resort to a social media news hiatus besides Reddit for a while and make sure to go outside and enjoy nature. Do something you love. I danced all my life so when i get to practice it helps me let go of the fuckery happening all around us. ❤ I too have often contemplated why. Why work for nothing. Why do i have to be a slave to the system. I found a very rewarding job where im pretty fulfilled in my heart and mind with so that helps when almost a third of your life is spent working, maybe even a full half. </p>

<p>This is YOUR time to do what you fucking love. Go out there and see the beauty in nature. Let all the surface level bull shit take a backseat in your life for a few days. And always know that together we are all working towards the awakening. </p>

<p>I always hold onto my dream of getting the hell out of the US eventually when I can afford it. Also, puppies make everything better. Hope you feel better soon </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s being a wage slave and then there&#39;s being a wage slave.  </p>

<p>The way I see it is what I took from Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and the ramblings of Jordan Peterson. </p>

<p>Do what is in your nature, nothing more nothing less and your life will be fulfilling.  See the connections you have with people and be the man who you need to be to a small subset of people. To your friends, family and whomever you love.</p>

<p>All of this shit has happened before and it will happen again. Nothing we can do about that. </p>

<p>The only thing you can do is work with the small network of people around you.  </p>

<p>A wage slave is a person who lives from paycheck to paycheck, has credit card bills and other forms of debt. A person who can&#39;t afford any hobbies. And doesn&#39;t find enjoyment in their life. You don&#39;t have to be that person. </p>

<p>Take me for example. I&#39;m not looking to be rich. I&#39;m only looking for a job that I enjoy and which allows me to chisel out a little corner of my own life. Where I can spend some money on the side on hobbies(Like saving up for a Nissan GTR R32). And enjoy reading books and do some meditation in a small house. </p>

<p>The way I &quot;Stick it to the man&quot; is to not follow the MSM&#39;s narrative and not buy into rampant consumerism(debt) and to become a slave, like so many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do not dwell on the past. Do not dream of the future. Concentrate the mind on the present. That is literally all there is. Everything and everyone is and always will be in the present. Take care of each day...you see, there is no real future because it becomes the present. If you manage the present, the future is becoming how you live now. Right now. Incrementally improve every day. This is how you manage your &quot;future&quot;. Always worrying or looking at tomorrow takes you out of the present and the present is the ONLY place that you can make changes. So...if you follow me...since tomorrow becomes today, if you spend today thinking about that tomorrow...you will never change anything because your mind is not present. It&#39;s neither here nor there and nothing is done. People spend their entire lives dreaming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to resign from two good jobs because of the exact same feeling. I just couldn&#39;t do work for them even though the work was child&#39;s play. For me, doing online work seems to have done the trick. I&#39;m one of the crowd on a crowdsourcing website, doing small work for individual requesters like surveys, email finding etc. I&#39;ve thought about why it didn&#39;t generate similar repulsive feelings like in other jobs. Maybe because I don&#39;t work among people but alone from my home. Or maybe because I&#39;m not being forced to do the work, I have my choice of when to work, whether to work or not. Or maybe because I&#39;m being paid immediately moment to moment instead of as lump sum at the end of month. I can&#39;t really figure out exactly.</p>

<p>Well this is my experience. Maybe you should try different things too before finally giving up. Feelings are strange things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the King James Bible.  It&#39;s so attacked by this world you should know there is something to it.  If you are aware of all the Luciferians running everything you should take the time to read the Scriptures.  Everything that is happening is unfolding exactly has the Scriptures say it will.  It&#39;s the true word of God.</p>

<p>The truth is Jesus Christ really is God who died for you.  The world does not want you to know this so everything is set up to take you away from it.  From the straw man versions of religions and &quot;Churches&quot; all over the place to public education and the media.  Even red herring conspiracy stuff.  You have been pushed away from true Biblical belief by everything the world shows you.</p>

<p>When you read the KJV Scriptures you will find that Lucifer actually has been given power to rule this fallen world for a time.  Evidence of that is all over the place.  He is a great deceiver.  All he cares about is that you die before knowing you are a guilty sinner in need of redemption through the shed blood of Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p>

<p>You (and everyone else) are in need of Jesus Christ&#39;s blood atonement.  You receive this atonement by repentance (change your mind about everything you have ever believed related to yourself, God, sin etc) and belief in his gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>This means you need to abandon all self righteousness and put your trust fully in what Jesus Christ did for you to save your eternal soul.  Tell him you understand this and ask him to save you and he will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have to be this way... Learn a skilled trade, start at the bottom, learn everything, practice, improve, move up, gain experience, start your own gig, make your own hours...</p>

<p>In the trades, it really is as simple as that... With hard work and dedication to improving your craft, you can become your own boss and feel much less like a wage slave... Sure the banks are still ultimately the money boss, but you will have more independence than working for someone else... Construction jobs, skilled trades are in high demand almost everywhere that isn&#39;t shrinking...</p>

<p>- Obi Wan Kenobi</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the world is run by an elitist, corrupt system ... and yes, both governments and corporations abuse and deceive in ways that should never be permitted ...</p>

<p>... but why let those entities control your capacity for happiness? Happiness is an emotion that is completely internal and does not need to be affected by external forces ... especially external forces that are not likely even thinking about you individually as they go about their global power games. When I am on vacation and hiking in the mountains of Switzerland ... my mind and my emotions are filled with fresh air, the exhilaration of an enjoyed activity, and the beauty of the majestic mountaintops/nature all around me. Faceless corporations and over-controlling governments don&#39;t ruin the experience because I don&#39;t let them.</p>

<p>Further ... are you working for NOTHING? You&#39;re working for life. You&#39;re working to have experiences in growth, learning, and joy. You&#39;re working for the people you love and for the future that you can give your children. Life is all about the small moments.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I was lucky enough to be on a vacation with my significant other. We visited Malaga, Spain ... and there was a moment, about 30 minutes long, where we sat on the beach and ate cheeseburgers from McDonald&#39;s. It was a moment of relaxation, of enjoying companionship together, and of simply celebrating that we are alive. Am I a corporate wage-slave? Yes. Am I now back at work for repeated, drone-like days at the office? Yes. But those simple moments in life are so good that all of this is worthwhile. Life is worthwhile. You just have to learn to see where the beauty lies. And corrupt corporations and governments are incapable of taking that beauty away from you ... no matter what.</p>

<p>Finally ... if you&#39;re going to be a wage-slave ... find something bearable, even enjoyable ... and then focus on your own personal quality of life. What do you do before and after work? Build strong friendships. Take on hobbies. Enjoy LIFE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best thing you could do is spread truth. All we see is blue-pilled people bickering with their fellow blue-pilled friends and it’s pretty disgusting. The access to information today is both a gift and a curse. It’s very much bitter and only a little bit sweet; as in it is <em>so</em> easy to obtain information, that in turn means that manufactured truths and agendas plague 90% of what we see.</p>

<p>People today are probably the most ignorant generation, and it will (hopefully not) only get worse. People have a sort of ‘tunnel vision’. We’re only focused on bills, our jobs, taxes, etc.
We take medications that the powers that be tell us are perfectly fine to take(war on drugs). We take medications most likely grown and farmed in the Middle East. We have shootings that spark 2 week periods of the left and the right yelling at each other over social media, at the NRA, at Trump, at <em>anyone!</em>
Patriotism is consisted of two things: People being proud in our military  “fighting for our country”. Every single time I hear someone say that it just rubs me the wrong way. Fighting for <em>what?</em> democracy? Why the hell does America have to be the big brother of the world? Why do we still go to these places on the other fucking hemisphere, when we can barely <em>if even</em> pay of the <strong>interest</strong> on the whopping 18 trillion dollar debt America is in? The second, is justice. NO MATTER WHAT, if there has been a wrongdoing, we MUST find the culprit. Somebody is responsible for X because they did Y. </p>

<p>Knowledge is your biggest weapon, OP. If you feel like an ant in the shit mound we call America, don’t worry, you’re not alone. Only united by similar ideas, and conflicts, will we wipe the bad and replace it with good. Also, it is our right to abolish the corruption in our government. </p>

<p>P.S. I don’t think America is a complete shithole. There’s actually quite a bit we’ve achieved that was good (abolishing slavery, the <strong>initial</strong> creation of the United States, etc.) Now everything is monetized, and if you don’t think money grows on trees, well guess what; we are the trees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t post here much but dude you don&#39;t have to live like this.</p>

<p>I used to work an office job, commute, everything. After 3 years of study and 2 years in an office I realised I&#39;d made a huge mistake and I was very unhappy.</p>

<p>I had a big career change and now I teach people how to ski. I get to be outside every day in beautiful landscapes with happy people who just want to enjoy themselves. I work 4-8 hours a day, 6-7 days a week with about 2-5 months off a year.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t make a tonne of money and right now I&#39;m training for the next level of qualification and money is a little tight and it causes huge stress but I know it will be worth it.</p>

<p>Everyone is a wage slave. Every. Single. Person. Everyone needs to earn a living whether it&#39;s going out hunting in a tribe in Africa or if it&#39;s clocking in at the factory so you can put a roof over your head and pay for groceries.</p>

<p>Now there&#39;s thoughts that over a certain threshold money doesn&#39;t actually increase happiness, so striving to earn hundreds of thousands a year is a fruitless endeavour if all you&#39;re trying to do is live a happy life.</p>

<p>First off you gotta find something you enjoy. Bear in mind that turning it into a job will change how you feel about it but in my opinion it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;re unhappy.</p>

<p>Find something you like and there is some way you can make it work for you. It may not be an easy ride... I&#39;ve been training for 5 years and I&#39;ve been broke for most of them...</p>

<p>But a bad day in the mountains is better than a good day at the office. As long as your days are more positive than negative you&#39;re doing okay. Hang in there buddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this will help you not kill yourself, but it doesn&#39;t really matter at all what these elites have or don&#39;t have, or what you have or don&#39;t have. If the root cause of your depression here is that you feel you will never be able to make a positive impact since they are so much more powerful, and are pushing humanity towards a negative goal, then don&#39;t worry. They&#39;ll all die anyway, and never see their Machiavellian dreams come true. And one day, the earth will be swallowed up by the sun, and even if mankind expands out to every star in the universe, they will all die, and go cold, and all the energy in the universe will dissipate evenly, ever particle separated from every atom. The universe itself will die, and with it, all life. All our dreams and goals, and aspirations will be for nothing in this world. The only meaning life can possibly have is in what comes after death. Just hope that&#39;s something nice and try to be your best. Maybe there&#39;s something greater than us that will recognize our authentic attempts to live life with these abstract, esoteric truths of love&#39;s triumph over fear etc. I don&#39;t claim to know, and I&#39;m not a man of faith, so I couldn&#39;t begin to point you in a dogmatic direction, but Jesus&#39; teachings at their core are pretty objective, ethical truths, and his metaphysics are sublime existentialism. Maybe trusting in that things will be okay is what faith in God is. All I can say is, hang in there, and if you want to have peace, you can, even if it is only peace you choose irrationally. I think that&#39;s the only true peace, when you are at peace simply because you want to be.</p>

<p>If you know me from here online, I am considerate and kind 99.9% of the time. Yesterday happened to be a sad and tiring day. Had a death in the family on Monday. Yesterday was the visitation at the funeral home.</p>

<p>If OP really feels this way all the time, it is not good. Depression and hopeless thoughts are not good mentally or physically for a person.</p>

<p>Like I said, we&#39;ve all felt this way before. I certainly have! But as time went on, I realized that by changing my attitude (thinking more positively) it changed my circumstances. Not overnight, mind you. But gradually, things began to brighten.</p>

<p>When I start having hopeless feelings, I now stop and think about all the things that I am thankful for. Yes, it sounds corny, but it works for me. Example: I&#39;m not in a wheelchair. I have two good legs to walk around on, so I&#39;m thankful for that. It could be a lot worse!</p>

<p>Also, my life is not perfect. Far from it. I have a 19 year old son with autism. He will never live on his own. He will always be dependent upon me and live with me. But I love him and I&#39;m fine with this. Also, I realize it could be a lot worse. I&#39;m thankful that he is physically fine/well. Autism does not affect/effect his life expectancy.</p>

<p>So again, I apologize to OP and everyone else if I came across as dismissive.</p>

<p>1) Why in gods name would you use your bank account as a reference of self worth? I get it that you americans are a bit funny that way but.. seriously?</p>

<p>2) You will always be a slave to your desires. But you can find the sweet spot where duo undesirable work just enough to finance the necessities and spend your time on something more fullfilling. </p>

<p>3) If possible: go visit Africa, Asia or South America. You are historially and globally in a sweet spot. It is it really that important that others are richer? Would you really wanna lose valuable life time on <em>this</em> question?</p>

<p>For books: There are many. If you wanna change something politically the old anarchists and left/social philosophers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best starting place is to know you aren&#39;t alone. I see what you said, I&#39;ve experienced what you said. I hate to see so much advice get carelessly flung your way. It all depends on what the end goal is here. If to be changed and awoke is the goal do not fall back into a life of status quo. Most of the advice here circles around returning one&#39;s self back to a capacity to absorb and behave in the world as normal. To get back to happiness lost. Yes you can do everything they say here and yes they are right, it will work. I am a wage slave that has fallen and picked my self back up more than my fair share of times. You can totally reset yourself and go back to being ok with things as they are and fooling yourself into believing that this time it&#39;s different. What I have personally discovered is that it doesn&#39;t matter for whom you play the game so long as you play the game. Whether you are self employed or employed by an employer it all works towards the goals of those in charge. Yes it has some benefits for you and I and others but that&#39;s part of its design. Like casinos, win just enough to keep playing and losing. My own conclusion is that yes being awoke to things makes everything  harder but I feel its life&#39;s way of keeping me conscious. Like a pinch to make sure I haven&#39;t fallen back into autopilot. I think we are stuck playing the game. We have to sleep and eat. To be honest I think it&#39;s meant that way so that nobody truly has the stamina after working, paying bills, obligations and finding time for one&#39;s self to really try to come up with some solutions. To care about anything or anyone past the self. But the power here is you don&#39;t have to enjoy it. You don&#39;t have to like it. You are not alone in thinking and feeling the way that you do. Even though it seems there are a greater number of those wishing negative people would stop bringing happy positive people down. People who fight against the systematic anaesthesia we are drowned in have a strength to persevere and be true beacons of hope as opposed to false beacons of hope. We may not be able to change the system but we are ready for those who wake up and need to know they aren&#39;t alone. We can be ready for when our life&#39;s experiences become what the rest of society needs. That&#39;s my secret hope and source of staying alive is that one day society will wake and see that they need the bitter and depressed ones. I knew someone so afraid of unhappiness that he would try every trick in the book to avoid it. Trying to cram any source, genuine or not, on his already full plate. It was toxic to me that he had so little capacity for coping with life&#39;s shit. But it made me realize just how much I&#39;m one of those people that will jump waste deep in the mud to help someone get their car unstuck. That I don&#39;t turn away and ignore the bad or the problems. That I too am willing to take other&#39;s problems onto my shoulders. I do that because I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s the only way to really figure things out. If people only focus on experiencing the good things in life and none of the bad then it becomes the blind leading the blind. Here&#39;s something that may actually help you, actually heal you. Talk to people with problems far less and far greater than your own. Investigate their sources of strength and draw from them life lessons you didn&#39;t even know that you needed to learn. </p>

<p>All of course is in my own humble opinion and not meant to be preached as though my own perspective is correct. Take it as you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your instincts of slavery are, from my perspective, correct: we are born into debt, not sin. And we must buy our freedom. Some people never climb out and die not knowing what real freedom is.</p>

<p>There are mountains of studies confirming our worst fears about the relationship between quality of life and poverty: i.e., the poorer you are, the more pain, suffering and indignity you will endure, and the shorter, more disease-prone will be your life. More addiction, cancer, psychopathy, diabetes, renal disease, heart disease, etc. </p>

<p>At the same time, this mountain of literature appears to support the idea that once you reach a fairly attainable amount of wealth (like $50-70k/yr or something like that depending on the study methods), your quality of life, duration, and incidence of disease is about the same as the very wealthy. </p>

<p>IOW, it&#39;s fairly uncontroversial to say that a person making $50-70k/yr has about the same ability (once other factors are controlled for) to lead as happy and healthy a life as someone with billions in the bank. </p>

<p>That said, the lowest 20% on the income ladder must overcome incredible odds to break themselves out of the cycle of poverty. The biggest factor in social mobility in America has been and continues to be access to education. If you can become educated, you have the best chance to achieve a quality of life that is indistinguishable from the ultra-wealthy (in terms of happiness potential and disease incidence).</p>

<p>So, hang in there, partner. You&#39;re not alone. Far from it. The best advice I can give to the next generation is GET EDUCATED. Take the loans if you need to. They&#39;re worth it. The best decision I ever made was to go back to vocational school. Took 2 years, but it has allowed me to live more or less like my parents did. Not super rich, but bills paid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know how you feel and it&#39;s because I too was once naive, lost and hopeless. I don&#39;t mean this out of disrespect. I don&#39;t mean naive in the fact there are certain players that were/are unfairly advantaged, because it exists, but naive in the belief you are working for &quot;nothing&quot; and naive in the belief that the current system is only sociopathic and corrupt. Recognize I said &quot;only&quot; as I am not denying the fact that the players in the system can be sociopathic and corrupt, and thus, characteristically reflected in our perception of the system.</p>

<p>The first step is for you to realize that you&#39;re not a fucking victim. This idea is plaguing this world, you will get nowhere thinking there are other&#39;s keeping you down, thinking whatever you do is inconsequential. You see, the fact of the matter is, the Rothschild&#39;s and generational wealth of the kind have no fucking care in the world about you. You know those pesky 1%ers and multi billionaires or 1/10th of 1%ers in the world? Ya, they don&#39;t give a shit about your either (side note: The negative connotation of the 1% is ignorant. People move in and out of the 1% within their lifetime ALL THE TIME). This is actually great! It means that there&#39;s no one trying to stop you from &quot;succeeding&quot;. The question is then not how can you ever be successful or live a meaningful life, instead the question becomes how do you define success or what would be meaningful enough for you to continue living your life or even better what would be meaningful enough that you wake up in the morning bolting out your bed because you can&#39;t wait to do what you NEED to do? This is the question you should ponder for hours, days, weeks, months, fuck, your entire life, keeping in mind your definition of success or meaningful will constantly change. What you do however, is set a goal, define what would be meaningful for you in the short term (6mo-1yr), mid term (2-3 yrs), long term (5+ yrs). Keep these written down, don&#39;t be afraid to change it, but try to stick to your goals so that you have a direction to aim for. You don&#39;t have to get to what you were aiming, you just have to move in a direction.</p>

<p>Second, don&#39;t compare yourself with people out of your league and don&#39;t give up simply because there are those that exist that will forever be out of your league. Have you played a sport, game, or instrument? When you start to learn, let&#39;s say, how to play the piano, you practice. What you don&#39;t do is compare yourself to Beethoven or Bach and say &quot;fuck this, what&#39;s the point?&quot; You compare yourself to the you of the past along with those that are just in reach and in time, with enough practice, you&#39;ll find yourself to be a pretty good pianist. With enough practice, you&#39;ll find yourself better than most, but more likely than not there will always be someone doing better or there will be some child prodigy that makes your practice hours seem like a waste of time. But fuck that, you&#39;re still one of the top pianists, don&#39;t let other people&#39;s success discourage you from a road you wish to travel. Who know&#39;s where you&#39;ll end up. You see the thing about life is that there&#39;s this rule called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto Distribution</a> and it can basically explain why inequality happens in any system of production, including the capitalist system or any creative endeavor. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcEWRykSgwE">Jordan Peterson</a> talking about the Pareto Distribution. So even though you&#39;re not going to become the best pianist, go for it, who knows where you&#39;ll end up.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m going to pretend that you think success means dolla dolla bills even though it&#39;s a superficial idea because I believe money is just a result of successful/meaningful/purposeful work. I think to truly be successful or wealthy you have to find something your passionate about and we can talk about that more later if you want. When you think of wealth or power, you must think of it as accumulated social and capital wealth across multiple generations. I think you&#39;d be surprised to find that most wealth accumulated will actually be lost within the first 2-3 generations. This article explains how <a href="http://time.com/money/3925308/rich-families-lose-wealth/">70% of rich families lose their wealth within the 2nd generation</a>. So families like the Rothschild are a rarity. Let&#39;s say you come from a poverty stricken family. Well you&#39;re in luck! <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/">The Brooking&#39;s Institute study</a> shows if you follow 3 simple rules, you&#39;ll be able to join the middle class within your lifetime: &quot;at least finish high school, get a full-time job, and wait until age 21 to get married and have children.&quot; Of those who follow these 3 rules &quot;only about 2 percent [remain] in poverty and nearly 75 percent have joined the middle class.&quot; Damn you&#39;re already on your way up!</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to still feel a little resentful if you slave away your entire life to just join the middle class, but try not to think of it this way. This is an an unbelievable accomplishment because many people can&#39;t fucking do it, even after multiple fucking generations. Wealth isn&#39;t created in a day, sometimes it&#39;s not even created in your lifetime. But assuming you&#39;re from poverty you goal, if any, should be providing your children with a head start. The better you do, the bigger the head start. This is where generations come into play. You&#39;re not just working for yourself, you&#39;re working for you children, your grandchildren, and your future generational lineage and if you&#39;re doing well enough, maybe even your relatives, friends etc. Most of the people that are young and rich or seemingly rich have had a head start and this was given to them by their parents or grandparents through money, catering education, or simply <strong>good parenting</strong>. With good parenting, teaching your kids the value of hard work. saving money, your lineage could be on their way in becoming part of the 1% or more. What this means is, depending on your financial standing, you might be the one who bears this sacred responsibility. Notice I emphasize good parenting, because that&#39;s more important that getting a shit ton of money. If your kids of spoiled shits well your wealth might just be the 70% that doesn&#39;t make it past the 2nd generation.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall into the trap of not trying before you even try. Fuck the news, fuck the conspiracies, fuck things that aren&#39;t immediately affecting you. Don&#39;t blame Hillary, don&#39;t blame Trump, left, right, don&#39;t blame anyone. Just write down some goals and start moving towards it. What I mean is, don&#39;t try to fix anything until you fix yourself. Your ability to change context, people, w.e. is minuscule compared to your ability to fix yourself. Tell the truth, don&#39;t cheat, strive to be the perfect ideal even though you&#39;ll never reach it. When things get tough and you feel like giving up, do it for the you in 5 years, start making changes for the you in 10 years. You&#39;re <strong>always</strong> more than what you think you can be. By becoming the best possible person you can be, by striving to meet/exceed your potential, you&#39;ll automatically better the people and the world around you. Fucking obnoxiously cliche, but there&#39;s a reason the saying&#39;s been around for so long, &quot;Be the change you wish to see the world.&quot; It&#39;s because it&#39;s true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch Kurzgesagt’s video titled “Optimistic Nihilism”. I believe this sort of philosophy can help you wrap your mind around the insurmountable odds we face. </p>

<p>Nihilism is the belief that we can never truly know what is “real” in our perception of reality. Therefore, there is no real meaning to life, and our existence is meaningless.</p>

<p>Optimistic Nihilism suggests that because we can never truly know what is “real”, it is up to us to determine what is real to us. Therefore, we are the true meaning of life, and we can create and live in our own realities.</p>

<p>I’m likely not describing it as well as Kurzgesagt does, so just check it out! He also has a lot of other great videos that I highly recommend. Stay strong friend, you’ll find your way!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Advice? Start your own business. Period. That&#39;s basically your <em>only</em> ticket to financial independence. </p>

<p>People think it&#39;s risky, but it isn&#39;t at all. What&#39;s risky is living paycheck to paycheck and at any time you can get fired for no good reason or because the company is aquired or going under etc.  When you&#39;re self employed YOU control all the vairables.</p>

<p>A decent idea and hard work (incl. studying up on how to raise money, busines plans etc.) will get you there. Think big, think original.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to have suicidal thoughts all the time.  I eventually started thinking &quot;I&#39;d like to do XYZ&quot; before I die.  There are a bunch of things when you get thinking about it.  People I know (who are admittedly probably more emotionally stable than I) tend to give advice about long term plans, slow and steady, etc.  I find the opposite helps me cope day to day.  Make small but exciting short term goals.  If you have a big long term goal, break it down into lots of small, exciting, short term ones with planned breaks to celebrate milestones.  Instead of a marathon with death at the end, life can be a series of sprints between celebrations.  One thing you should definitely NOT do is try to talk to your normie friends and acquaintances about your views on the elite control of society bringing you down.  They will try to convince you that you are wrong (you aren&#39;t), crazy (you aren&#39;t), and you will just end up frustrated that they don&#39;t see the obvious.  Depressive realism is real, so it&#39;s unfortunate that the people who see and understand the injustices in the world are more likely to be depressed regularly.  Be careful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you for is the question you should be asking yourself. Are you competing  financially with others seeking materialistic gains? Does your lifestyle include crippling debt driven by materialism? Life is cheap bro! </p>

<p>I have two jobs. </p>

<p>One is a live-in overnight caregiver. All I have to do is be “home” every night between 8pm and 5am Mon-Fri. I’m just there in case of an emergency and I give pm and am meds. That’s it. I get free room and board Mon-Sun and utilities plus $400 a month stipend. I have week ends off. </p>

<p>I also am employed as a Traffic Control Supervisor/Temporary Traffic Control Flagger for a flagging company. I make $25/hour on prevailing wage contracts and $18/hour base.</p>

<p>I have no debt, no loans, no credit cards.</p>

<p>I control my own schedule at work.  Work is considered on-call and I only call in my availability the day before to get an assignment. If I don’t want to work any day(s) I don’t call dispatch. I also have weekends off with this job. </p>

<p>I own my car. In fact, I own everything I have outright.</p>

<p>I am a minimalist. Most of my possessions are related to outdoor recreation - climbing gear, mountain bike, kayak, backpacking gear. </p>

<p>I’m saving and banking the majority of my paychecks. I intend on buying an a brand new Airstream RV Trailer paying cash to live in full time.</p>

<p>My flagging certificate is multi-state. The company I work for operates in two states. My future plans is to retain my job and travel working prevailing wage contracts while living in my Airstream. In my off time enjoy my outdoor sports and explore.</p>
