       SS: What do you think will come of any information found from the attorney, whether it relates to Russian collusion or even anything that could make trump ‘their guy’.  Could they use this information to hold trump over a barrel and reverse things like the TPP, climate deal, war in Syria, 2nd amendment? Basically make him the same puppet as previous presidents, so they finally get their Hillary.

       If they were to make stuff up, Trump and his attorney would kick up enough of a steam to delegitimize it IMO.  If they find something, it would need to be undeniable.

       You think it's that easy to manufacture evidence against a sitting President?  The bullshit they pull works great in a court of public opinion, not in a court of law.  For example, they can say that Russia hacked the DNC and they can say they have evidence, but they will never prove it in a court of law.  There's no chain of custody.  None of the 17 intelligence agencies ever even had access to the server.  But it was never meant to be used in a court of law.  It was meant to be used in the court of public opinion to justify aggression against Russia after Hillary won.  But she didn't win, and now we have the Mueller investigation instead.

       I think Trump is an idiot. But what you said is a possibility I've been thinking of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is an ego guy who cares so much about what people think. He knows the American people from both sides do not want some fake ass reason to go to war in Syria or wherever else. He wants people to like him even though he does a terrible job at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might get downvoted for it but just look at his last response to Syria in 2017. In hindsight it was as restrained as possible when he could have went much harder. Once again Trump sucks IMO but I really don't feel like he wants a war. But he can easily be persuaded into one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody finds the timing of Trump's attorney and the Syria shit a bit odd? Trump probably has a lot of criminal shit they could dump on him but they can use it as leverage instead.

       What a mature response. You also took one line I said out of context. I said he's an idiot and that hes terrible at getting people to like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump probably has the thinnest skin of any human ever but you feel he doesn't care what people think..makes sense.

       I think they have been making him their guy over the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did it by having the threat of an indictment hanging over his head his entire presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did it by painting him as a Putin puppet so he couldn’t cooperate with Russia on anything without the Media jumping all over him.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did it by throwing someone off the roof of Trump Tower and lighting the place on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       They sent “Anthrax” to his son’s wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       They put Stormy Daniels on every Tv channel to talk about their affair and then had the FBI raid his personal attorney’s office.
      </p>
      <p>
       All he has to do is say the word and do what he’s told and it all goes away.

       Do you think he will ‘say the word’?
      </p>
      <p>
       To those who have been able to see through the media brainwashing, his rhetoric throughout the campaign has been that he is aware of these deepstate tactics and that he wanted to give back to his country and not be ‘that guy’.  Do you think he will endure?

       Use it to make him their guy. This is actually and interesting prospective. Now if the Mueller investigation ends with findings of his innocence, I can't trust that it isn't just a result of him being flipped. I suppose the best indicator will be the reaction of the msm. Their reactions are always very telling of the deep state narrative.
