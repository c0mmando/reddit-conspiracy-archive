        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The Catholic Church must be the biggest corporation in the United States. We have a branch office in every neighborhood. Our assets and real estate holdings must exceed those of Standard Oil, A.T.&amp;T., and U.S. Steel combined. And our roster of dues-paying members must be second only to the tax rolls of the United States Government.&quot; Avro Manhattan</p>

<p>In this post I highlight some important connections and prove that the Catholic church was dominating the commerce of the world in the early 1900&#39;s.</p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 180:&quot;With the increasing size and importance of his oil holdings in Mexico and the United States, Doheny found his political influence growing in proportion to his economic power. Although he did not emerge as a figure of national importance until 1920, he had been a prominent Democrat on the West Coast since the late 1890s. From the beginning, Doheny&#39;s devotion to the party was rooted in his Irish-American heritage, faith in the Catholic church, and his long years on the Western frontier, which had made him a sympathetic follower of William Jennings Bryan.(Bryan was a member of the Sigma Pi literary society. He studied law at Union Law College in Chicago, He practiced law in Jacksonville from 1883 to 1887, then moved to the boom city of Lincoln, Nebraska. In Lincoln, he was raised a Master Mason in Lincoln Lodge 19, A.F. &amp; A.M.[8], A $4,000 scholarship for Creighton University(Jesuit) students participating in Speech and Debate at the university is named after William Jennings Bryan.) Over time, however, his financial success eroded the logic, if not the sentiment, behind those positions, and, by the early 1920s, he found himself at a political crossroads. Had his ideas been totally mercenary, Doheny would probably have given up on the Democrats in 1916, when Republican presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes emphasized the Mexican crisis as a major campaign issue in opposition to Woodrow Wilson. Instead, Doheny&#39;s significant financial support in California helped Wilson achieve an improbable victory in his bid for reelection. &quot;</p>

<p>The Jesuits were very infiltrated into the United States Government at this time in history.</p>

<p>A good example of this is George Bruce Cortelyou, (July 26, 1862 – October 23, 1940) who was an American Cabinet secretary of the early twentieth century. He held various positions in the presidential administrations of Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Born in New York City, Cortelyou worked for the United States Postal Service, earning the attention of Postmaster General Wilson S. Bissell. On Bissell&#39;s recommendation, President Cleveland hired Cortelyou as his chief clerk. On Cleveland&#39;s recommendation, McKinley hired Cortelyou as his personal secretary. After McKinley&#39;s assassination, Roosevelt asked Cortelyou to lead an effort to reorganize the White House.At 20, Cortelyou received a BA degree from Westfield Normal School,He graduated from the law schools of George Washington University and Georgetown University(Jesuit). He was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at George Washington University.[1]</p>

<p>Impressed by Cortelyou&#39;s performance, Roosevelt appointed Cortelyou to the position of United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor in 1903. He left that position in 1904 to become the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and starting in 1905 he also served as the Postmaster General. He left both of those positions to become the United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1907. In that position, he worked to keep the economy stable during the Panic of 1907. After Roosevelt left office in 1909, Cortelyou became president of the Consolidated Gas Company.</p>

<p>Coleman Livingston Blease (October 8, 1868 – January 19, 1942) was a South Carolina politician who served as a Democratic state legislator, 90th Governor of South Carolina, and U.S. Senator. Blease was educated at Newberry College, the University of South Carolina, and Georgetown University(Jesuit), where he graduated from the law department in 1889. Blease was notorious for playing on the prejudices of poor whites to gain their votes. He was pro-lynching and anti-black education. As Senator, he advocated penalties for interracial couples attempting to get married, as well as criticizing First Lady Lou Hoover for inviting a black guest to tea at the White House. Blease was 90th Governor of South Carolina In office, January 17, 1911 – January 14, 1915. Blease was a United States Senator from South Carolina, In office, March 4, 1925 – March 3, 1931.</p>

<p>Edward Douglass White Jr. (November 3, 1845 – May 19, 1921), American politician and jurist, was a United States Senator and the ninth Chief Justice of the United States. He served on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1894 to 1921. He is best known for formulating the Rule of Reason standard of antitrust law.White&#39;s paternal ancestors were of Irish Catholic descent, and he was reared in that religion, a devout Roman Catholic his entire life. He studied first at the Jesuit College in New Orleans, then at Mount St. Mary&#39;s College near Emmitsburg, Maryland. Last, he attended Georgetown University(Jesuit) in Washington, D.C., where he was a member of the Philodemic Society. In 1910, President William Howard Taft elevated Edward White to the position of Chief Justice. Wow.. would you look at that.. Skull and Bones member President Howard Taft, appoints Jesuit educated Edward White Jr. as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court...</p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 126: &quot;Doheny&#39;s new 6,000-barrel-a-day refinery specialized in Mexpet (also a brand name for Mexican Petroleum&#39;s products) road oil and asphalt, which were marketed from a southern sales office in New Orleans(There just happens to be a Jesuit University in New Orleans!). Mexpet road oil was sold primarily to cities and railway companies that used it to control the dust along their lines. The asphalt needed no introduction, since it had been used for years on the East Coast with excellent results. Within a short time, the company was making deliveries as far north as Milwaukee, and in 1915, it added another station at Tampa, Florida, which included facilities for bunkering large ships and served as a distribution center for rail deliveries from Destrehan.48 To promote its operations along the eastern seaboard, Mexican Petroleum set up a main sales office in New York City and smaller outposts in Boston, Portland, Maine, and Providence, Rhode Island. Since oil was cheaper and cleaner to use than coal, this area became a prime location for securing industrial customers. In Portland, the largest purchaser was the International Paper Company. In Providence, the Jenckes Spinning Company kept Mexpet&#39;s three delivery trucks busy throughout the day. Mexpet also had smaller contracts with the American Woolen Company, the Manville woolen mills, D. Goff &amp; Sons textile mill, and the Loutitt Home Hand Laundry Company. Apart from economy, the conversion from coal to oil provided unique benefits to each of these customers. Goff &amp; Sons, for example, ran their boilers at full capacity only for half of the day but needed a minimum level of steam around the clock. Previously, the coal fires had to be banked at night, which consumed fuel during non-production hours. Converting to oil allowed the company to shut the burners off completely, except for one fifteen-minute interval, and still maintain the required amount of steam without any waste of fuel. Abandoning the use of coal at the laundry achieved a minor revolution by setting loose for other tasks a large group of workers who had been needed to pick the soot off the collars and clothes handled at the plant. To control these northeastern marketing and distribution centers, Doheny organized another subsidiary in 1915, the Mexican Petroleum Corporation of Maine. That company took over the existing outlets and added one more—at Carteret, New Jersey, located along the west side of Staten Island Sound. There, they constructed an oil storage depot and a large deep-water wharf capable of handling ships of any size. In addition, they employed a fleet of tugs and barges to supply Mexpet fuel oil to ocean liners at their respective piers anywhere in New York Harbor. By the end of the year, Doheny had fuel oil contracts with the International Mercantile Marine for its ships going from New York to California via the Panama Canal and with the Eastern Steamship Company for several of its lines, as well as a large contract to deliver crude oil to the Atlantic Refining Company in Philadelphia.49 Negotiations for transatlantic business began in the spring of 1914, when Doheny met with Lord Pirrie, Chairman of the Board of Harland &amp; Wolff, one of Britain&#39;s largest shipbuilding and engineering firms. Pirrie headed an investment syndicate representing almost all of the major companies: Cunard, White Star, American, Red Star, Atlantic Transport, Dominion, National, and Leyland. And these organizations represented dozens of smaller steamship lines around the world. In April 1915, Doheny and Pirrie agreed to form the British-Mexican Petroleum Company to handle fuel oil sales in western Europe. This was an incredible opportunity, since the British investors involved were linked to a variety of manufacturing and railway enterprises in addition to their shipping interests. Although the first draft of the incorporation papers was ready by the summer of 1915, the agreement had to be put on hold when World War I diverted everyone&#39;s attention, and the company did not begin operations until 1919.50&quot;</p>

<p>Notice how Ed Doheny met with Lord Pirrie, and they agreed to form the British-Mexican Petroleum Company to handle fuel oil sales in western Europe. This furthered the Vatican&#39;s monopolized control of the oil industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pirrie,_1st_Viscount_Pirrie">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pirrie,_1st_Viscount_Pirrie</a></p>

<p>From Wikipedia we read &quot;The following year he(Lord Pirre) was appointed Controller of the Household to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in 1908 he was appointed Knight of St Patrick (KP).&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Patrick">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Patrick</a></p>

<p>further down we read &quot;Lord Pirrie was jeered in the streets after chairing a famous meeting of the Ulster Liberal Association addressed by Winston Churchill. That same year he was to travel aboard the Titanic, but illness prevented him from joining the ill-fated passage.&quot; Hmmm maybe Lord Pirrie had prior knowledge that the Jesuits intended on sinking the titanic!</p>

<p>From Bill Hughes the Secret Terrorists chapter 5 we read : &quot;All the wealthy and powerful men the Jesuits wanted to get rid of were invited to take the cruise. Three of the richest and most important of these were Benjamin Guggenheim, Isador Strauss, the head of Macy’s Department Stores, and John Jacob Astor, probably the wealthiest man in the world. Their total wealth, at that time, using dollar values of their day was more than 500 million dollars. Today that amount of money would be worth nearly eleven billion dollars. These three men were coaxed and encouraged to board the floating palace. They had to be destroyed because the Jesuits knew they would use their wealth and influence to oppose a Federal Reserve Bank as well as the various wars that were being planned.</p>

<p>Edward Smith was the captain of the Titanic. He had been traveling the North Atlantic waters for twenty-six years and was the world’s most experienced master of the North Atlantic routs. He had worked for Jesuit, J.P. Morgan, for many years.</p>

<p>Edward Smith was a ‘Jesuit tempore co-adjator.’ This means that he was not a priest, but he was a Jesuit of the short robe. Jesuits are not necessarily priests. Those who are not priests serve the order through their profession. Anyone could be a Jesuit, and their identity would not be known. Edward Smith served the Jesuit Order in his profession as a sea captain.</p>

<p>Many interesting points about the Titanic are discussed in a videotape made by National Geographic in 1986. The videotape is entitled The Secrets of the Titanic. When the Titanic departed from Southern England on April 10, 1912, Francis Browne, the Jesuit master of Edward Smith, boarded the Titanic. This man was the most powerful Jesuit in all of Ireland and answered directly to the general of the Jesuit Order in Rome. The videotape declares:</p>

<p>A vacationing priest, Father Francis Browne, caught these poignant snapshots of his fellow passengers, most of them on a voyage to eternity. The next day Titanic made her last stop off the coast of Queenstown, Ireland. Here tenders brought out the last passengers; mostly Irish immigrants headed for new homes in America. And here, the lucky Father Browne disembarked.... Father Browne caught Captain Smith peering down from Titanic’s bridge, poised on the brink of destiny. — The Secrets of the Titanic, National Geographic, video tape, 1986.</p>

<p>Here is Jesuit treachery at its finest. The Provincial [Father Francis Browne] boards Titanic, photographs the victims, most assuredly briefs the Captain concerning his oath as a Jesuit, and the following morning bids him farewell. — Eric J. Phelps, Vatican Assassins, Halycon Unified Services, p. 427.</p>

<p>Browne went over with Edward Smith one last time exactly what he was supposed to do in the North Atlantic waters. The Jesuit General told Francis Browne what was to happen; Browne then tells Smith and the rest is history. Edward Smith believed that the Jesuit General</p>

<p>. . . is the god of the [Jesuit] society, and nothing but his electric touch can galvanize their dead corpses into life and action. Until he speaks, they are like serpents coiled up in their wintry graves, lifeless and inactive; but the moment he gives the word of command, each member springs instantaneously to his feet, leaving unfinished whatsoever may have engaged him, ready to assail whomsoever he may require to be assailed, and to strike wheresoever he shall direct a blow to be stricken. — R.W. Thompson, The Footprints of the Jesuits, Hunt and Eaton, pp. 72, 73.</p>

<p>Edward Smith was given an order to sink the Titanic and that is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>By the command of God, [the Jesuit General] it is lawful to murder the innocent, to rob, to commit all lewdness, because he [the Pope] is Lord of life, and death, and of all things; and thus to fulfill his mandate is our duty. — W. C. Brownlee, Secret Instructions of the Jesuits, American and Foreign Christian Union, p. 143.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pacinst.com/terrorists/preamble.html">https://www.pacinst.com/terrorists/preamble.html</a></p>

<p>Surely Lord Pirrie knew the Jesuits intened to sink the titanic to get rid off Benjamin Guggenheim, Isador Strauss,Department Stores, and John Jacob Astor... these 3 men opposed the incoming federal reserve act that was passed in 1913.</p>

<p>Pirrie built the Temple of the Four Winds near the Devil&#39;s Punchbowl, Hindhead. The octagonal plinth still remains.[8]</p>

<p>From Wikipedia we read &quot;In the months leading up to the 1912 Titanic disaster, Lord Pirrie was questioned about the number of life boats aboard the ship. He responded that the great ship was unsinkable and the rafts were to save others. This move would haunt him forever.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Patrick">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Patrick</a></p>

<p>The Knight of the Order St. Patrick Lord Pirrie knew the Jesuits intended on sinking the titanic.</p>

<p>Ed Doheny was also very affiliated with the Catholic church, and was raised and kept his Irish Catholic faith his whole life.</p>

<p>This is shown in the book Material Dreams: Southern California Through the 1920s, By Kevin Starr page 127/128 : &quot;The Arch Bishop allowed the Doheny&#39;s the privilege of a private chapel in their various homes, with permission to have mass said there and consecrated Eucharist reserved on the alter for veneration. They became Knight and Lady of the Equestrian Order of the holy Sepulcher in 1925, and in 1939 his holiness Pope Pius XII raised Estelle Doheny, onetime telephone operator to the rank of papal countess. Through its legacy of European culture, its titles and tutelage the Roman Catholic Church, in this instance the Archdiocese of Los Angeles the most reverend John J Cantwell Archbishop, helped the ever genious Doheny&#39;s in the vital matter of taste and social self confidence. A psychological reserve of self esteem became very much necessary for both Doheny&#39;s in August 1924 when E.L Doheny was charged in the Federal District court of Los Angeles with bribing secretary of the interior Albert B Fall in November 1921(a loan of $100,000 in cash, carried to fall in a satchel by Edward Doheny) so as to obtain favorable leases on naval oil reserves at Elk Hills in Kern County. President Harding had previously transferred the administration of the two reserves at Elk Hills and Teapot Dome in Wyoming in May 1921, itself a dubious action. Fall in turn, had signed favorable leases with Doheny and oilman Harry F Sinclair. The teapot dome scandal dragged on for six long years of investigation and trail. In 1927, the government canceled the leases and in 1929 Fall was convicted of taking a bribe from Doheny, and went to jail. Doheny however got off on technicalities after two trials, thanks to Frank J Hogan of Washington DC, who once observed that the ideal client was a rich man who was scared&quot;</p>

<p>Harry F Sinclair was a Roman Catholic aswell... &quot;PASADENA, Calif., May 15 (AP)—Mrs. Elizabeth F. Sin­clair, widow of Harry F. Sin­clair, founder of the Sinclair Oil Corporation, died last night at her home. She was 85 years old.</p>

<p>The couple were married in 1904. Mr. Sinclair died Nov. 10, 1956.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sinclair recently was honored by Pope Paul VI with the Cross Pro Ecclesia et Pon­tifice (for the Church and the Pontiff) in recognition of her service to the Roman Catholic Church.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jesuits bailed Dohney out from going to jail for bribing Albert Fall 100,000$, how is it possible that Fall was convicted of taking the bribe but, Doheny got off scotch free?.... Answer= The Jesuits!!</p>

<p>Frank J. Hogan (1877-1944) was a lawyer who co-founded the firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson in 1904 and served as president of American Bar Association (ABA) from 1938 to 1939. He represented several high-profile clients, including former president Warren G. Harding, oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny, and banker Andrew Mellon. As ABA president he created the association&#39;s Committee on the Bill of Rights and supported the controversial Walter-Logan bill.</p>

<p>In 1938, Hogan denounced racial and religious intolerance in a half-hour speech aimed at fellow Catholics; the speech was aired on the same 34 radio stations used by the notoriously antisemitic priest, Charles Coughlin, immediately following Coughlin&#39;s regular broadcast.In 1898 Hogan joined the U.S. Army and put his clerical and railway experience to work in logistics, serving as secretary to the Chief Quartermaster of the Army, secretary to the Quartermaster General in Washington, and Secretary to the Chief of Staff of the Army. After work he spent his evenings studying law at Georgetown University(Jesuit). He completed the three-year program in two years, graduating at the head of his class in 1902.[1]fter graduation, Hogan went into private practice. At first he practiced law part-time in the evenings while working for the War Department during the day. He co-founded a Washington law firm, Hogan &amp; Hartson, in 1904. From 1912 to 1919, he lectured at Georgetown University on the law of wills, evidence, and partnership.[1]</p>

<p>Hogan rose to national fame working on several high-profile cases in the 1920s and 30s. His most notable case was his defense of oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny and the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company in a series of trials from 1924 to 1930. In what came to be known as the Teapot Dome scandal, Doheny was accused of bribing Interior Secretary Albert Fall to lease the oil production rights at Elk Hills Oil Field. The company was forced to cancel its lease, but Hogan succeeded in clearing Doheny on charges of bribery and conspiracy to defraud the government. And just like Ed Doheny Frank Hogan received an award of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.[1]</p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 85 : &quot;In looking back over the period from 1900 to 1910, which formed the introductory phase of the Mexican petroleum industry, it is clear that Doheny was primarily responsible for the direction the industry would take. As a result of his past experience in California and his financial backing, Doheny succeeded where others feared to try. In reviewing his work with Canfield, Doheny noted that: &quot;Our lifetime spent at prospecting and our experience in developing oil in the vicinity of the exudes in California, constituted in us the proper frame of mind to fully appreciate the evidences of petroleum which existed in Mexico, and which undoubtedly had been seen by thousands of natives and perhaps a great many intelligent Mexicans and foreigners, who, however, by reason of not having had the proper experience which we had, were not sufficiently impressed to undertake the task of developing oil there, which task did not prove light, even though we went into it with health, strength, enthusiasm, and practically unlimited cash resources(The Catholic church....), and a great belief in our own judgment and good fortune.86 &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Here is another excerpt that shows Doheny&#39;s ties with the economic goals of the Catholic Church. Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 127: &quot;As early as 1904, the United States Navy had released a report based on its own extensive experiments which detailed the superior results of fuel oil versus coal. But due to the unreliability of the supply, the navy had been unwilling to use oil except for &quot;special purposes and in particular localities.&quot; At the time, the navy concluded that the commercial demand for petroleum products was so large that only about 3 percent of the world&#39;s requirements for marine (merchant and military) fuel could be offset by using oil. By the early 1910s, however, almost all of the military ships under construction had oil burners.55 The British Navy had been following the same path, and Weetman Pearson—now Lord Cowdray—made an aggressive bid to tie up his excess production from Mexico with the British Admiralty. Like Doheny, Cowdray hoped that his newly founded Eagle Transport Company would capture a major share of the oil-bunkering business that was just beginning to refashion the maritime fuel industry. The sixty oil tankers under construction in Britain during the summer of 1912 provided evidence of this transformation.56 Naturally, both Doheny and Cowdray wanted to promote this situation with their respective governments. In December 1913, Cowdray even tried to get the Royal Navy to invest in the Mexican Eagle Oil Company. But British officials had no interest in propping up Cowdray&#39;s enterprise at a time when Mexico was in turmoil. Furthermore, the Wilson Administration was hypersensitive about British relations with the Huerta regime and looked upon the British government as a pawn of Lord Cowdray. Then, when the British acquiesced to American control in Mexico in November 1913, they had no desire to prove Wilson right by signing an agreement with the Mexican Eagle. Given these constraints, the British Admiralty turned to the newly formed Anglo-Persian Oil Company and signed a long-term contract for naval fuel in May 1914. In the meantime, the British purchased fuel oil from the United States, and especially from Texas distributors, to meet their current demand. While heavy Mexican crude offset these shipments, it did not meet British fuel oil standards on its own.57&quot;</p>

<p>I have already shown above that Ed Doheny was a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the holy Sepulcher .</p>

<p>Weetman Dickinson Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, GCVO, PC (15 July 1856 – 1 May 1927), known as Sir Weetman Pearson, Bt, between 1894 and 1910 and as The Baron Cowdray between 1910 and 1917, was a British engineer, oil industrialist, benefactor and Liberal politician. He was the owner of the Pearson conglomerate. Cowdray was in the Royal Victorian Order!(Vatican knighthood)In 1900 his company took over the construction of the Great Northern and City Railway in London and after completion in 1904 ran it for four years.[2] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order</a></p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 132: &quot;Doheny&#39;s choice of an Irish shamrock for the Mexpet logo suggested that he, too, had come to believe in his own good fortune. But such confidence(The Jesuit order backing youre company would make any CEO Confident....) seemed misplaced in the case of the California Petroleum Corporation, which came together just as the oil market hit another downturn. Although it was never in financial difficulty, the company failed to meet the high expectations of its investors. A snapshot of the industry in July 1913 showed that Calpet&#39;s producing subsidiaries, American Oilfields and American Petroleum, were among the strongest independents in the state. At that time, American Oilfields, which operated in the Midway oil district, was the largest and most important member of the Independent Oil Producers Agency. Of the 129 companies belonging to the Agency, American Oilfields alone produced 264,906 barrels of oil that month, or roughly 27 percent of the Agency&#39;s total production. In comparison, the next largest company was Nevada Petroleum, at 75,000 barrels a month, while the remaining companies averaged about 5,000 barrels apiece. The situation in Coalinga, where American Petroleum produced 186,317 barrels on contract with the Associated Oil Company, was not quite as strong. Still, American Petroleum accounted for 12 percent of the Associated&#39;s business. Overall, for the month under review, the combined production of the two companies made California Petroleum—at 451,223 barrels—fifth among the seven largest producers on the West Coast, after Union Oil at 843,871 barrels, Standard Oil at 751,906, Kern Trading and Oil Company (Southern Pacific) at 678,302, and Associated Oil Company at 564,840. Santa Fe (formerly a combination of Chanslor &amp; Canfield Midway Oil and Petroleum Development) and General Petroleum Company were right behind, with 397,143 and 362,559 barrels, respectively.8 Facing another oil glut, however, Doheny used the cash received from floating Calpet to build an extensive storage network and cut back production to just meet his contract obligations. Planning for the future, though, he continued to buy up prospective oil land outside of the San Joaquin Valley. In doing so, Doheny was able to open and close various fields according to the market and, thus, gain control of a strategic combination of proven, but undeveloped, properties. This left him free to rely on his long-term contracts to the Independent Oil Producers Agency and Associated Oil during the bad times, and to open up new &quot;freelance&quot; properties, outside the control of either marketing organization, when prices went back up.9&quot;</p>

<p>Doheny contributed money to foundations. He helped fund the construction of St. Vincent de Paul Church(Catholic). After the shooting death of his son, Edward Jr., he donated $1.1 million in 1932 to University of Southern California (USC) to build the Edward L. Doheny, Jr. Memorial Library.[40] His second wife, Carrie Estelle Doheny, donated her rare book collection to St. John&#39;s Seminary in Camarillo, California.</p>

<p>The Doheny Mansion, three miles south-west of Downtown Los Angeles, is the centrepiece of the Mount St. Mary&#39;s College Doheny Campus. Doheny, Sr., meanwhile, lived in his own mansion, which he had purchased in 1901.[41] It was part of Chester Place, a gated community of Victorian mansions, and by his death in 1935, Doheny ended up owning most of the houses, as well as the street.[31] Built in 1899 in the French Gothic architectural style, this three-story, twenty-two-room residence was damaged in the 1933 earthquake but was repaired. It is within Mount Saint Mary&#39;s University&#39;s Doheny campus, where it houses college departments, runs docent tours, and hosts chamber music concerts by The Da Camera Society. After he began basing his Mexican oil operations near Tampico, Tamaulipas in 1902, Doheny donated much money toward the construction and maintenance of the Cathedral of Tampico there. Also known as The Temple of the Immaculate Conception, it is located in Plaza de Armas in the city. The Doheny Estate has donated money to Loyola Marymount University(Jesuit) for the construction of buildings and residence halls, and the land for one of the campuses of Mount St. Mary&#39;s College south of downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 148:&quot;At the time America entered the war in the spring of 1917, business and industrial leaders of all types were becoming vital participants in the effort to bring the nation up to full strength. The demands of the war also made the security of the Mexican oil industry a primary concern for national defense and reinforced the strategic value of the California oil fields for the future. According to a recent study of the international oil industry during this period, there &quot;is no time when business competition is so heavily politicized as in war, which for business means a covert struggle for advantage under a publicly emphasized desire to serve the national interest.&quot; Without question, Doheny took advantage of America&#39;s role in the war to propel himself and his company into national prominence. And as the next two chapters will show, it was almost impossible for him to draw a clear line between duty and opportunity during a national emergency.3 From the very beginning of the European conflict, there was every indication that oil would play a prominent role. In the fall of 1914, for example, an article entitled &quot;Gasoline and the War&quot; noted that oil had already become more important than food or ammunition. &quot;It has been an axiom of war since wars began,&quot; the author wrote, &quot;that an army travels on its belly .. . As it is now, an army travels on its gasoline.&quot; The possession of oil, therefore, was essential to the prosecution of modern warfare. And right from the start, the United States served as the principal source of petroleum products to the Allied forces, especially for the fuel oil demands of the British Admiralty. American refineries along the Gulf Coast were particularly important in this trade, and heavy Mexican crude was used to replace the lighter products needed for the European theater. Mexican oil played an even larger role as an industrial fuel for American factories in the Northeast, where Doheny&#39;s companies dominated the business.4 &quot;</p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 126 :&quot;The ability of the war to alter present circumstances was particularly evident when Doheny, Herbert Wylie, and George Henry returned from England on the final voyage of the Cunard liner Lusitania, before it was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915. During the trip, Doheny was still conducting business as he and Wylie inspected the Lusitania&#39;s engines and boiler rooms in preparation for turning it into one of the first commercial vessels to burn oil. Doheny then outlined his plans for the British-Mexican company to Leonard Fanning, a well-known journalist for the oil press, as the Lusitania steamed into New York Harbor for the last time. Fanning wrote that two English companies would be formed: one to build tank stations and refineries throughout Europe and another to handle oil deliveries from Tampico. The Mexican Petroleum Company had a half-interest in the latter and a one-third share of the refining and sales operation. Mexican Petroleum would also receive a twenty-five-year contract for crude oil as soon as the parties signed the agreement.51 Doheny explained these arrangements to his stockholders a few months later and gave some specific reasons for taking the company&#39;s business so far afield. First of all, Doheny believed that they now owned &quot;the greatest of all oil properties&quot; in the world, which had already produced 50 million barrels of oil from a handful of wells. And since so many other wells were either closed in or seriously cut back, production could be increased fivefold at a moment&#39;s notice. This excess capacity demanded an extraordinary effort to find outlets for the oil.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow right before the Jesuits used the sinking of the Lusitania as propaganda to drive the American public&#39;s support for entering World War 1, you have Papal Knight Edward Doheny making business negotiations on the Lusitania... and Doheny as quoted above in the source was on the last cruise of the Lusitana before It was used as a propaganda tool, just like how the Jesuits used Weapons of mass destruction to scare people after there artificially contrived 9/11, that had Jesuit Georgetown University professor Viet Dinh draft the Patriot Act as a response the staged attack...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_D._Dinh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_D._Dinh</a></p>

<p>Here is a good write up on the false flag that was the Lusitania: <a href="https://jamesperloff.com/2014/05/21/false-flag-at-sea/">https://jamesperloff.com/2014/05/21/false-flag-at-sea/</a></p>

<p>Oil Baron of the Southwest, Edward L. Doheny and the Development of the Petroleum Industry in California and Mexico, page 241 : &quot;Doheny emerged as a national leader of the oil industry in the late 1910s. Throughout this period, his companies accounted for the largest production of fuel oil in the world.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The history of slavery and the slave trade, .ancient and modern, William O. Blake page 373/374: &quot;The English trade to Africa, a monopoly in the hands of the Royal African Company, does not seem to have been prosecuted with much spirit ; and such supply of slaves as that company furnished was chiefly engrossed by Jamaica and other sugar colonies. In 1671 an act was passed by Maryland(The Jesuits were in Maryland!) encouraging the importation of slaves. In 1682 the slave code of Virginia received some additions. Slaves were prohibited to carry anus, offensive or defensive, or to go off the plantations of their masters without a written pass, or to lift hand against a Christian even in self-defense. Runaways who refused to be apprehended might be lawfully killed. The condition of slavery was imposed upon all servants, whether negroes, Moors, mulattocs, or Indians, brought into the colony by sea or land, whether converted to Christianity or not, provided they were not of Christian parentage or country, or Turks or Moors in amity with his majesty. An unsuccessful attempt was made in the council, whether dictated by humanity, by policy, or by a wish to promote the interests of the Royal African company, to reeuact the old law prohibiting the enslavement of Indians. The attempt in Maryland to prevent the intermarriage of whites and blacks seems not to have proved very successful. The preamble to a new act on this subject recites that such matches were often brought about by the &quot; instigation, procurement, or connivance of the master or mistress,&quot; who thus availed themselves of the provisions of the former law to prolong the servitude of their female servants, and, at the same time, to raise up a new brood of slaves. To remedy this evil, all white female servants intermarrying with negro slaves were to be declared free at once, and their children also ; but the minister cel- ebrating the marriage, and the master or mistress promoting or conniving at it, were subjected to a fine of ten thousand pounds of tobacco. The settlement of South Carolina commenced about 1660. In the scheme of government for this colony, drafted by the afterwards celebrated metaphysician, John Locke, there was inserted a provision that &quot; every freeman of South Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves, of what opinion and religion whatsoever.&quot; In the code of laws known as the &quot;Duke&#39;s laws,&quot; enacted for the govern- ment of New York in 1665, there is a provision that &quot;no Christian shall be kept in bond slavery, villeinage, or captivity, except such who shall be judged thereunto by authority, or such as willingly have sold or shall sell themselves,&quot; in which case a record of such servitude shall be entered in the court of ses- sions, &quot;held for that jurisdiction where the master shall inhabit.&quot; This provision, borrowed, with some modifications, from the &quot; Massachusetts Fundamentals,&quot; did not exempt heathen negroes and Indians from slavery. In Virginia, in 1692, an &quot;act for suppressing outlying slaves,&quot; after setting forth in a preamble that &quot; many times negroes, mulattoes, and other slaves unlawfully absent themselves from their masters&#39; and mistresses&#39; service, and lie hid, and lurk in obscure places, killing hogs, and committing other injuries to the inhabitants of this dominion,&quot; authorizes any two justices, one being of the quorum, to issue their warrant to the sheriff for the arrest of any such oat- lying slaves. Whereupon the sheriff is to raise the necessary force, and if the slaves resist, run away, or refuse to surrender, they may be lawfully killed and destroyed &quot;by guns, or any other way whatsoever,&quot; the master, in such cases, to receive from the public four thousand pounds of tobacco for the loss of his slave. &quot;﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Papacy and the Civil Power, RW Thompson, pages 683-686: &quot;There is no difficulty in seeing the object and precise nature of the oaths prescribed by Lord Baltimore for all officers and citizens, when it is considered that both by the laws of England and those existing in the colony at the time of his settlement, the English Episcopal was the established Church. And while the practice of religious toleration was compulsory, being provided for in the charter, it is undoubtedly true that these oaths were specially designed to give undue preference to the Roman Catholic colonists a preference destructive of the equality which the charter was designed to establish. This is one of the requirements :&quot;And I do further swear I will not by my selfe, nor any other person directly, trouble, molest, or discountenance any person whatsoever in the said province professing to believe in Jesus Christ, and in particular no Roman Catholic, for or in respect of his or her Religion, nor his or her free exercise thereof within the said province, so as they be not unfaithful to his said Lordship or molest or conspire against the civil Government established under him.&quot;(u ) We must necessarily look to the character of the civil government established by Lord Baltimore, in order to as- certain the obligations imposed by this oath. The oath of fidelity to him required that he should be acknowledged &quot;to be the true and absolute Lord and Proprietary &quot; of the colony ; that &quot; true faith &quot; should be rendered to him and his heirs, and that his and their &quot;Right, Title, Interest, Priviledges, Royal Jurisdiction, Prerogative, Propriety and Dominion over&quot; the colony should be maintained.( IT ) Here was a manifest attempt to substitute his own royal power for that of the king, to whom all the original colonists were ready and willing to pay obedience. But the same is further shown by the commissions, writs, and processes that were issued. The law of England required all these to issue in the name of the &quot; Keepers of the Liberty of England ;&quot; but, in disobedience of this requirement, they were issued in his name a clear usurpation of royal jurisdiction and do-minion. (&#39;&quot;) The plan of government constructed by means of these usurped powers and prerogatives became such that the Protestant inhabitants of the colony who were loyal to England could not conscientiously take this oath, because it imposed the obligation of violating the law of the mother country. Whether that law was right or wrong is not now necessary to be inquired into ; it was in accordance with the spirit of that, though not of the present age. It prescribed the line of duty for all English citizens, whether at home or in the colonies, and these Maryland colonists by violating it would have been subjected to prosecutions for sedition and treason. All this Lord Baltimore knew perfectly well, and therefore he prescribed an oath of fidelity to himself of such a nature that a loyal Protestant could not take it, being well assured, at the same time, that the Roman Catholics would all do so. And to show the little favor he was disposed to exhibit toward those who should refuse if, indeed, he did not design to drive out the Protestants entirely he caused a proclamation to be issued to the effect &quot; that all such per- sons so refusing shall be forever debarred from any Right or claim to the Lands they now enjoy and live on ;&quot; that is, their property should be confiscated ; and &quot; his Lordship&#39;s Governor&quot; was instructed &quot;to cause the said lands to be entered, and seized upon to his Lordship&#39;s use.&quot;( 1B) As might well be supposed, the results were just what Lord Baltimore designed they should be, and are fully set forth in this tract. &quot; Papists and Priests and Jesuits &quot; flocked into the colony. &quot; Papist Governors and Counselors, dedicated to St. Ignatius,&quot; filled the offices. The Protestants were &quot; miserably disturbed in the Exercise of their Religion.&quot; A number of &quot; illegal Executions and Murthers &quot; occurred. There were &quot; Imprisonments, Confiscations of many men&#39;s Estates, and of widows&#39; and orphans&#39;, to the destruction of many Families.&quot; Those who would not take the oath were disarmed and plundered. &quot;Popish Officers &quot; were appointed, &quot; outing those&quot; who were previously in office. &quot;Lands and Plantations&quot; were seized and confiscated. And it can not fail to arrest attention that all these persecutions were visited upon Protestants, while not one Roman Catholic suffered from them!( so ) As for these, they were so favored that if one of them was called &quot; Papish Priest, Jesuit, Jesuited Papist,&quot; etc., the offender forfeited a penalty of &quot; ten pounds !&quot;(&quot;) The inferior position occupied by laymen in those days should relieve them from any responsibility for these measures. The civil authority of the colony was entirely in the hands of those appointed by Lord Baltimore, who, as it appears, selected Roman Catholic agents exclusively. At that time, in England, the papists were chiefly under the influence of the Jesuits, whose vigilance was too sleepless to permit this opportunity of planting their society in the New World to escape them. How far they had the sympathy and support of Lord Baltimore is, of course, not known ; but it is undoubtedly true that they were the authors of all these measures in the Maryland Colony, and that they had pretty much their own way there. This appears from a narrative preserved in the Jesuit college at Rome, which is also found among the &quot;Historical Tracts&quot; above referred to. It was prepared by the Jesuit fathers appointed by the superior general of the order at Rome, to superintend the first emigration of Roman Catholic colonists who left England in the fall of 1633. They went, as it is declared, to &quot; carry the light of the Gospel and of truth where it has been found out that hitherto no knowledge of the true God has shone &quot; that is, where neither the pope nor popery had been heard of. History has amply shown the kind of light they throw upon the pathway of nations as well as individuals, and the events in the Maryland Colony show that they acted there, as everywhere else, under instructions from Rome. &quot; Bulls, letters, etc., from the pope and Rome &quot; that is, from the pope and the general of the Jesuits became familiar to the colonists. (&quot;) By means of these the Jesuits became omnipotent in the colony;and in the tract last named they show how successfully they exercised their power. Then, as now, the first object of the order was the acquisition of wealth, with the right to govern and control their property without any reference or obedience to the laws of the country in which they reside. On this subject Father White, one of these Jesuits, reports that when they set up this claim in Maryland, they were met by those who insisted that the laws of England, which bound the colony, forbade it; and he speaks of them as those &quot; who, too intent upon their own affairs, have not feared to violate the immunities of the Church by using their endeavors that laws of this kind formerly passed in England, and unjustly observed there, may obtain like force here, to wit : that it shall not be lawful for any person or community, even ecclesiastical, in any wise, even by gift, to acquire or possess any land unless the per- mission of the civil magistrate first be obtained. Which thing, when our people declared it to be repugnant to the laws of the Church, two priests were sent from England who might teach the contrary.&quot; And then, in order to show his superior what admirable success he had in resisting this unjust English law, and how all-powerful the order had already become in America, he continues: &quot;But the reverse of what was expected happened ; for our reasons being heard, and the thing itself being more clearly understood, they easily fell in with our opinion, and the laity in like manner generally.&quot;(&quot;) And thus the Jesuits won their first triumph in the United States.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good, Youre alta mater Georgetown is Jesuit fortress! &quot;Superior:</p>

<p>My son, heretofore you have been taught to act the dissembler: among Roman Catholics to be a Roman Catholic, and to be a spy even among your own brethren; to believe no man, to trust no man. Among the Reformers, to be a reformer; among the Huguenots, to be a Huguenot; among the Calvinists, to be a Calvinist; among other Protestants, generally to be a Protestant, and obtaining their confidence, to seek even to preach from their pulpits, and to denounce with all the vehemence in your nature our Holy Religion and the Pope; and even to descend so low as to become a Jew among Jews, that you might be enabled to gather together all information for the benefit of your Order as a faithful soldier of the Pope.</p>

<p>You have been taught to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities, provinces, states that were at peace, and incite them to deeds of blood, involving them in war with each other, and to create revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous, cultivating the arts and the sciences and enjoying the blessings of peace. To take sides with the combatants and to act secretly with your brother Jesuit, who might be engaged on the other side, but openly opposed to that with which you might be connected, only that the Church might be the gainer in the end, in the conditions fixed in the treaties for peace and that the end justifies the means.</p>

<p>You have been taught your duty as a spy, to gather all statistics, facts and information in your power from every source; to ingratiate yourself into the confidence of the family circle of Protestants and heretics of every class and character, as well as that of the merchant, the banker, the lawyer, among the schools and universities, in parliaments and legislatures, and the judiciaries and councils of state, and to be all things to all men, for the Pope&#39;s sake, whose servants we are unto death.</p>

<p>You have received all your instructions heretofore as a novice, a neophyte, and have served as co-adjurer, confessor and priest, but you have not yet been invested with all that is necessary to command in the Army of Loyola in the service of the Pope. You must serve the proper time as the instrument and executioner as directed by your superiors; for none can command here who has not consecrated his labors with the blood of the heretic; for &quot;without the shedding of blood no man can be saved.&quot; Therefore, to fit yourself for your work and make your own salvation sure, you will, in addition to your former oath of obedience to your order and allegiance to the Pope, repeat after me---</p>

<p>The Extreme Oath of the Jesuits:</p>

<p>&quot;1, _ now, in the presence of Almighty God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the Archangel, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the holy Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul and all the saints and sacred hosts of heaven, and to you, my ghostly father, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, founded by St. Ignatius Loyola in the Pontificate of Paul the Third, and continued to the present, do by the womb of the virgin, the matrix of God, and the rod of Jesus Christ, declare and swear, that his holiness the Pope is Christ&#39;s Vice-regent and is the true and only head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth; and that by virtue of the keys of binding and loosing, given to his Holiness by my Savior, Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose heretical kings, princes, states, commonwealths and governments, all being illegal without his sacred confirmation and that they may safely be destroyed. Therefore, to the utmost of my power I shall and will defend this doctrine of his Holiness&#39; right and custom against all usurpers of the heretical or Protestant authority whatever, especially the Lutheran of Germany, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the now pretended authority and churches of England and Scotland, and branches of the same now established in Ireland and on the Continent of America and elsewhere; and all adherents in regard that they be usurped and heretical, opposing the sacred Mother Church of Rome. I do now renounce and disown any allegiance as due to any heretical king, prince or state named Protestants or Liberals, or obedience to any of the laws, magistrates or officers.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire basis of your fantasy is that people who went to elite universities that the Jesuits started are in positions of power.  Alumni of Jesuit schools are NOT Jesuits.  Source, I’m a graduate of two and I’m sure as shit not a Jesuit.  The Jesuits, unlike other priestly orders and contrary to Rome’s wishes, believe in and stress the importance of education and have since the beginning, which is why they’ve founded schools around the world.  The content of your posts belies an ignorance of the Order and of what goes on at Jesuit institutions.  The fact that you’re casting ignorant and unfounded accusations about a group of people and then have the gall to call me a bigot for calling you on your bullshit would be comical if it wasn’t so pathetic.</p>
