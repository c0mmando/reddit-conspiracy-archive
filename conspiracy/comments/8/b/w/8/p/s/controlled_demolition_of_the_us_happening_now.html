<p>There is a Currency Transfusion happening right now, and it happens every 100 years or so.  It&#39;s a controlled demolition, designed to relaunch a new world reserve currency, under the guidance of a new set of countries and people.  In reality, it&#39;s just a slight of hand by the BIS, and it&#39;s partner central banks, as they will control the new currency too.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the American people are the collateral damage.</p>

<p>Buckle up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it easier to manipulate? Granted there are 100&#39;s of scam coins, but the main ones, bitcoin, litecoin, etherium, and monero are open source. They are decentralized and a large portion of early adopters are wise to the banking system, and it&#39;s evil. On top of that you can&#39;t just print more. I respectfully disagree with what you said. Crypto currencies will save us.</p>

<p>It don&quot;t matter when the people who are already rich because of the banking system can just invest more into mining or trading that these early adopters will ever be able to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true the elite have the ability to manipulate things. I&#39;m point is that crypto is the best we have, other than gold perhaps. </p>

<p>I assume they can control fiat currencies about 99.99%. I don&#39;t know what % they can control crypto, but they can&#39;t control the rate it&#39;s produced, how much of it there is, and many other factors. So to me it is a much better alternative.</p>

<p>What alternative would you suggest? </p>

<p>Check out monero, you can&#39;t track transactions or figure out how much monero is in any address. It has a lot of features that make it appealing to anyone that doesn&#39;t want others spying or meddling in their financial business. It os used quite a bit on the dark/deep web.</p>

<p>Considering that they are the people with more miners under their hands and have a lot of crypto stores that they can put on the market or not according to their desires, i&#39;d say that they do control these things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short of it is that bch aims to scale on-chain, transactions being equal. Blockstream and cronies want to scale off-chain. There is no problem but they created one and their solution is the lightning network which will lead to new centralization. This problem got introduced with segwit intended for side chains (which in and of itself might not be bad) and the unwillingness to increase the blocksize of 1mb to open up to new growth. Litecoin is nothing more than bitcoin-light and real suger is the lesser of 2 evils perhaps. BCH aims to provide economic  freedom and control over personal finances.</p>

<p>Yep.  Agree with all of this.  Things seem to be coming to a head, right in line with the transition of the Yugas - from the lowest, darkest, most degenerate one (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Kali</a>, which we are said to have been in for quite a while) to the next, higher, more evolved one (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvapara_Yuga">Dvapara</a> - which we are said to be just entering).</p>

<p>I believe I see what you&#39;re saying, but I personally wouldn&#39;t call it a great performance because there&#39;s been a lot of deceit and death involved.  Yes, that can be said to be a great part of how we learn and evolve, but again, I personally wouldn&#39;t call it a &quot;great performance&quot; - more like an intensely difficult lesson/grade of development/evolution.</p>

<p>On another note...</p>

<p>If our money was backed by gold, we could issue bonds to citizens, therefore making it profitable to save money again. Rothschild&#39;s strung America through war after war after war, rang up huge debt and then they fuck with the inflation. It make money valueless <strong>PLUS</strong> it makes saving absolutely pointless. This is why so many elderly people are having to work into their 70&#39;s. I&#39;ve got a father in law in his 80&#39;s that had to find part time work because the money they saved isn&#39;t worth fuckall anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandfather worked in the Steel Mills for 27 years after the war. He was given the choice for his pension, upon retirement- lump sump or annuity. He chose the lump sum, and 2 years later the mill folded. His neighbor, who chose the annuity, lost everything, and had to go back to work, even though he started the same year my grandfather did.</p>

<p>I have his hard hat on my bookshelf, and it serves as a reminder, every day, that his America is long gone. We are indeed the collateral damage. The current Middle Class is built on debt, and the unfortunate, and chilling, economic reckoning is coming. I will now link the sobering numbers from a previous post of mine.</p>

<p><strong>copypasta</strong></p>

<p>41% of jobs lost in 08 were High Wage jobs, but only 30% of jobs created since then are High Wage. 37% of jobs lost in the Recession were Middle-Wage jobs, but only 26% of jobs created since then are Middle Wage. And 21% of all jobs lost in &#39;08 were low wage, service sector jobs...yet a staggering 44% of all jobs created since &#39;08 are low wage, service sector. This means millions of Americans are literally locked out of the Middle Class.</p>

<p>US Credit Card debt has reached record highs as of Q4 2017, at $1.023 Trillion. This is higher than in &#39;08. Student Loan debt is at 1.2 Trillion, and rising. Auto Debt is up to $1.2 Trillion, and delinquencies jumped in Q3 and Q4 from 6.5% to 7.2%. Mortgage debt is up, and the average new home price in the US is higher than in &#39;08, at $250,000. The economy isn&#39;t doing good. The US Middle Class is drowning in debt, and when &#39;08 part two hits, sooner rather than later, it is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. QE 1-3 only postponed the pain, so enjoy these times now, because the reckoning is coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isnâ€™t anything wrong with mortgage debt. Whatâ€™s happening is called skill biases technological change and itâ€™s causing this. You can no longer make middle class wages without developing high skills because someone overseas will do it for less. While low wage workers donâ€™t like it, there is something that can be called fair about it. </p>

<p>The solution is for the government to hire these people to build infrastructure, pay for retraining, and help them out. Unfortunately, the ruling party wonâ€™t do it and has brainwashed its voters that helping people is muh socialism.</p>

<p>Btw, mortgage debt isnâ€™t necessarily bad if people can pay for it i.e. not all debt is bad. This doesnâ€™t like anything like â€˜08.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input.  I disagree with your second paragraph.  I&#39;m a business owner in a &quot;blue collar&quot; trade.  There are many apprenticeships and opportunities available within the trades that build infrastructure and provide tangible services, but the younger generation (I&#39;m a millennial myself) has been trained that blue-collar work is beneath them.  The government has already brainwashed many people into going to college, as they benefit from the student loans.  Although the government should invest in infrastructure, which will lead to job opportunities within certain sectors, it&#39;s not their role to &#39;help them out&#39; by direct intervention.  They bastardize most things through direct intervention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google skill biases technological change. It will explain whatâ€™s happened with the job market nationally. Your anecdotal experience is simply your experience in your area. Research shows the broader view that you cannot see. </p>

<p>Level of mortgages was never a problem, per se. People couldnâ€™t afford their mortgages. There is no evidence that what happened in 2008 is happening now. Underwriting is happening as it should, no liars loans, etc. Whatâ€™s happening is that some middle class people are getting richer and some poorer due to skills differences. As city jobs pay more, housing costs increase. But the people buying them can afford the note, because they are making money. There is a huge difference between the upper and lower tail of income distribution. Itâ€™s the upper end buying these houses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the statistics of higher debt and lower wages are a result of the modern trend of companies creating brands and not jobs.  (See Naomi Klein <em>No Logo</em>)</p>

<p>Walmart, Starbucks, McDonald&#39;s and others all try to cut work hours to below full time, or simply redefine full time as less than 40 hours so they can avoid paying overtime and benefits.</p>

<p>Couple this with an out of control political machine that quashes labor rights and supports legislation like NAFTA and the TPP and you see why  having a family and owning a home while working blue collar is becoming nearly impossible in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>The 2008 mortgage bubble was awful, but there was a slow burn to jobs happening since the 1970&#39;s that accelerated with Reagan and went into overdrive with the birth of the neoliberals (Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama).  </p>

<p>We are seeing now what 40 years of job erosion does.</p>

<p>I agree that it feels like something big is set to happen with currency, especially if we see major impacts from the Petro Yuan; surely it&#39;s a good time to save for a while instead of going deep into debt.</p>

<li><p>It shouldn&#39;t be able to be printed by one country to prevent the exportation of inflation (and demand for $$ outside the US simply to complete transactions) and increased use of credit which has happened in the US.</p></li>
<li><p>I doubt it will be commodity based, or at least, the final world currency we move to will be some strange kind of fiat. As we&#39;ve seen with gold,silver, etc. wealthy entities can manipulate them in the markets using contracts and at that point is the value any different from how fiat is assigned value?
-Plus commodity-based currencies incentives society/government acquisition of that commodity over anything else and drastically increases the value of that commodity being used for transactions. Any other economic activity with it is then that much more expensive.</p></li>
