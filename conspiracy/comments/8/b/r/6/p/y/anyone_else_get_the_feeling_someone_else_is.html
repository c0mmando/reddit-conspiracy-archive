       Anyone else get the feeling someone else is trying to start WW3 and that it involves a group or country that isn't in the news?

      <p>
       Something about everything that's going on lately just makes me feel the US, Russia and China are being played like puppets.

       Right. I'm the lemming. Tell me. How great are those tax cuts (which expire in a few years) are for your pay checks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did we get the first check from Mexico for that wall yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's gonna take care to stop the deficit frpm going up like Obama did Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       He hires only the best...till they leave or get fired.  How's that governmental spending freeze doin ? Let's ask Scott Pruitt..does he really need 20 armed security to travel for half a day to Morrocco? Let's talk to Ben Carson about that  $31000 dinner set "his wife" bought on your dime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet John Bolton is really just a big softy and is advocating for peace right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw when did Obama care get repealed? 
Never mind we are too busy worrying about the illegal immigrants he a deporting that the Dems just let on...even though Obama deported more than the last 2 Republican president combined...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you'll support him because he's gonna..what drain the swam or is he h just changing the water ?

       The US and the UK are doing as they always do and using there Jewish pawns in the middle East to do there dirty work and cast Russia as the enemy giving them reason to control more of the region, war is coming but only when they have the strongholds to win at present they dont have.
In direct answer to your question yes someone else is orchestrating the current situation but this  shouldn't be a surprise it the same groups that scheme and control all the other bs that goes on.
Learn your history better this will give you deeper understanding as to who what and why then these will be questions you don't ask.
This isn't an attack on you more some friendly advise and if I've misjudged your reasons for asking then I apologise.
Don't follow the herd the wolf won't see you.

       It sounds like you know exactly what’s happening just by the way you write that question. But if you don’t, the answer is Israel. Israel Israel Israel Israel. All American wars are fought for Israel in the name of the Yinon plan and gathering resources for Israel and rich Jewish bankers and corporatists so they can sell it on the world market

        The latest Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), set to go into effect in 2018, will provide Israel with about $3.9 billion a year in military aid for 10 years. The real value of this agreement, however, isn’t in the dollar amount, but in the defense technology that Israel will receive and the depth of the security cooperation between the two countries

       I think this is likely true for many people who criticize the Israeli government. I also think its true that there are many people who use criticism of Israel as a way to express their anti-Semitic beliefs. It is possible for both things to be true. Of course not every criticism of the Israeli government is an example of anti-Semitism just as not every criticism of African governments is emblematic of racism. That being said, would you not agree that there are many people whose criticisms of African governments are fueled by racism?

       Okay, but lets examine one of those critiques. You say Israel is a "welfare" state ostensibly because we send them weapons and military technology. Would you say the same about Egypt? They are the second largest non-NATO recipient of US military aid on Earth. They also received $30 billion in economic aid from us. Israel on the other hand is our nation's oldest partner and has created

        thousands of jobs in our country
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Another critique you made was that Israel wields undue control and influence in our government. What precisely is this a reference to? Are you referring to AIPAC? If AIPAC is so powerful, how come they were unable to stop the Iran nuclear deal despite their strong opposition towards it? It also should be noted that AIPAC is an organization of American citizens and in 2012 both AIPAC and J street combined spent $3.25 million in lobbying. While that sounds like a large sum of money, it's actually

        less than 1% of total lobbying expenditures for that year
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here I guess is where I should point out that the idea that the Jews control our government (through Israel or otherwise) or that Jews are leaches stealing money from hard-working gentile nations, are pretty common antisemitic tropes. This further increases the difficulty of separating the legitimate critiques from the antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel I should say however, that I don't necessarily believe you to be an antisemite personally. I also dont believe that criticisizing Israel is inherently antisemitic, even if the criticisms are rooted in an inaccuracy. But man, just look at the comments in this post and tell me honestly that you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believe that none of these commenters are attacking Israel because its a Jewish nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and to answer your last point, I have zero love for Netanyahu and believe he and his political posturing and rhetoric, are largely to blame for the death of Rabin.

      <p>
       Your government basically owns and controls all of it's so-called allies and even gets them to work for it's own military ambitions through NATO where being the biggest player at the table it gets to call all of the shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover the decisions made by NATO are also backed up by those allies representatives in the UN at which the US is also the biggest player at the table and if it doesn't actually get to call all the shots it can certainly prevent anyone else who tries to from calling any.
      </p>
      <p>
       And NATO's stated position and ultimate goal? To militarily surround Russia both as a prelude and as a provocation that will ultimately result in a war where the nuclear missiles the US has moved into Europe and now "shares" with it's NATO allies there will be used to utterly destroy Russia from close range.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the game plan and the object is to put Russia in a position where it will either surrender it's sovereignty and economic autonomy or face total destruction if it refuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the Russians keep a close eye on those nukes and where they are and if they make any pre-emptive or retaliatory moves it will be first and foremost against those targets and the nations that they're in, not targets in the US although the US is clearly behind and responsible for that existential threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of Europe aren't stupid and all realize that and want no part of it but like you they have no say and no more control over their governments participation in NATO or the military commitments and plans they have endorsed in the name of their own so-called "national security" than you have over your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor do they have anything to say about being sacrificed to both protect and further US ambitions to completely dominate and control the rest of the world if Russia fails to comply with US demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren't aware of it they are already a part of that world that's dominated and controlled by the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel doesn't share a relationship that even remotely resembles that. It doesn't live under the US' thumb or have to dance to it's tune on any issue. In fact it's only too obvious that it's the US that dances to Israel's tune, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Israeli jets violate both International Law and Syrian and Iranian airspace to bomb and strafe what it considers to be some kind of a remote threat by it's own definition, that's an unprovoked and open act of war that doesn't get treated as one because to make war on Israel will automatically place anyone else at war with the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the US has sworn to defend Israel to the death, no matter what it does or who it manages to provoke with any outright act of war.

       No offence, but that is not an argument at all. The size of Israel really doesn't matter in what it does and how it oppresses the Arab world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel not only has one of the most powerful armies in that area (including nuclear weapons) and massive funding from the US, it also has the Mossad, likely one of the most proficient intelligence agencies that can easily subvert, manipulate and use any means necessary to help maintain Israel's superiority in the region (
       <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyberwar-stuxnet/researchers-say-stuxnet-was-deployed-against-iran-in-2007-idUSBRE91P0PP20130226">
        including with cyber warfare, which was used against Iran and their nuclear facilities, for example
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Their foreign policies against neighbouring countries have never been too friendly and their treatment of the Palestinians is atrocious.

       Then you are complicit and I say this...
      </p>
      <p>
       To all Israeli Jews and Zionist Christians we say, denounce and renounce your Zionist leaders, for just as they sold you out to Hitler and his 150,000 Jewish soldiers, they will sell you out once more to be butchered. First, do not think for a minute that they have your best interest at heart. No government in the world has the best interest of their people at heart. Otherwise why have they led you into a country under false pretense and brainwashed you to hate all your Muslim neighbors, when you are surrounded on all sides by these very neighbors? Where will you run to when all hell breaks loose? Into the sea? Isn’t that what they’ve been telling you over and over, that “they” want to run the Jews into the sea?
      </p>
      <p>
       With that meme they’re getting you accustomed to that very idea for when it actually happens. The sea is the only place where they have not created enemies for you, and they would if they could. They want to watch you flail and drown, while they fly away in their private jets to Switzerland after they have stolen all your money and transferred it to some tax haven, only to reinvent themselves somewhere else. Ask George Soros how he did it during World War 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, your country Israel is a mess: Ashkenazim and European Jews discriminate against Sephardic and African Jews, as they control most everything in the country; Russian Jews, who are mostly pretend Jews, escaped the Soviet Union, courtesy of the US, and now constitute a fifth column; Orthodox Jews hate all the non-religious Jews and vice versa; Israeli Arabs are kept as third-class citizens, with Sephardic and North African Jews as second class, and Black African Jews as no class; most Israeli Jews hate the Palestinians, either in the occupied territories or within Israel itself, and would love to excise them from the land, while the Palestinians, under the weight of 70 years of ruthless occupation, would love to see you finally leave, so they could become free from your Apartheid. Third, your leaders always turn intransigent when America and the world try to coax them into making peace: Have they forgotten the stain that the Crusades left on Christianity? Do they not remember how those Crusades ended? Have they no knowledge of history to understand how empire after empire lost Palestine? Do they even ask themselves what their own Crusade will leave behind this time? Have they not witnessed what happened to Apartheid South Africa? And most importantly, why do they not make a just and lasting peace with all of their neighbors, even if they lose considerable land? Isn’t peace better?
      </p>
      <p>
       Together with imperial America, your Zionist leaders have ignited the suffering of millions of innocents, Christians and Muslims, who are presently living in torment, not only in Palestine but throughout the Middle East, while you sit there, do nothing, and even applaud. Unfortunately, this has been orchestrated in order to create a cauldron they hope to pour on all the inhabitants of the area, you Israelis included.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, when all hell breaks loose and fire starts raining on your heads, you’ll have only yourselves to blame. Because you colluded with your leaders.

       Not necessarily. Zionism is defined as "a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel." There are a LOT of people who support the "development" and "protection" of Israel who are NOT Jewish at all. The US government could itself be collectively called "zionist" because of the support and protection we give them.

       If the brackets mean Jews, I agree with you 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there have been many uses for those brackets and nowadays they are used pretty liberally. They could also mean Zionists which is of course not the same as Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way context is important, but sadly genuine antisemitism is still rampant here and everywhere.  People that think Zionists and Jews are synonyms do exist and it is disgusting honestly. It's the exact misplaced ignorant hatred that those in power want, against a whole group of people, most of which have absolutely nothing to do with world events or Israel's warmongering agenda. Jews are the ultimate scapegoat of Zionist wars.

       People are judged by their group, and by their most influential members. Jews are judged by their Zionists, and Muslims are judged by their terrorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will ALWAYS be judged by their group members. If you don't want to be judged like your group, then police your group and change it.

       In your defense, dude, I feel the same way. Some of the highest profile globalists, truly evil men are indeed of Jewish bloodlines... and Christian bloodlines... and Muslim bloodlines... and they come in all shapes and colors too! But the truth is, by their own mouths these are godless men and much worse. To represent the threat as one race or religion is just biased and reductive.

        Simply put, the globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interest of the private international financiers and the royal, dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain, Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone on earth. Through their control of the ability to create money, they are able to exercise control over all the power centers of society including the corporations, the media, culture creation, the educational system, the historical societies, the political system, the military, religion, foundations and other NGOs, medicine, and law. Over time they have extended their network of control to include elites from countries all over the world working towards the same end.

       I’ve thought this since 2008. Only further backed up when China went into the red by trillions. Then backed up even more when the cash for gold craze went everywhere to take as much gold of us as possible. I can’t see how this is sustainable with funny money indefinitely.

       Well it seems to me someone’s getting ready for a war. Missile Defence systems surrounding Russia, China building airbases in the China sea, Russia’s annexation of Crimea to secure a southern warm water port, troops being filtered slowly but surely to the Baltic’s from both sides, proxy wars and trade embargoes. I may be totally wrong here, but hardly looks like peace manoeuvres.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was suggesting that since 2008 I was expecting that the global economy would need a reset and they’d use a war to do it. How long ? I don’t know. Maybe I’m wrong of course, but so far things seem to be bumping along quite nicely for a good old scrap.

       What’s pessimism and thinking war is possible got to do with each other ?  Surely you’ve seen the clip of Purim saying war is going to happen if America carry on with its missile defence program in Romania ?  When respected world leaders like mikael Gorbachev suggest the world is sleep walking into war I would advise we take some notice. Or is that pessimistic ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just saying I’m not surprised, since 2008 this is what I’ve been expecting. And so far nothing has changed my mind, War will happen because of economic reasons.

       I’d agree with that, but even in the 80s living with the threat of nuclear war, it didn’t feel like things could kick off at any moment like it does today.  We had peace after the 90s (yes I know apart from America whaling on small countries) but in terms of what we lived through in the Cold War, it was nice to not have to worry about nukes anymore. Yet here we are,nukes been mentioned on a daily basis.

       And re the military build up on borders ? No I don’t recall ever seeing that sort of behaviour.

       First of all the crashes seem to keep getting bigger and bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly the 2008 crash was very close to crashing the whole world economy. Only the trillions(?) in bailouts worldwide prevented it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is now in massive debt because of this (and other things), if an even bigger crash happens (and it will), then they will simply not have the cash to do more bailouts and they can't borrow more because they are already in so much debt. So they will have to basically print more money (devalue the dollar) which will probably also crash the world economy anyway.

       Yes this. Because it was clear after 2008 collapse, that the world economy will not survive the next crash which is guaranteed 10-15 years after, which is about now and within the next 5 years.

       any precedent for this? Has Israel ever actually pulled the US into a war by starting one? From my recollection, every war that Israel has ever fought, the US helped (militarily) not at all (sure in the very first war American pilots defied orders and went there to help).
      </p>
      <p>
       however maybe you mean more indirectly, more so not dragging the US into war, but having the US fight a war for their purposes.

       If we're going to take the conspiracy route on 9/11 it's much more plausible that Saudi Arabia helped plan and finance it and maybe we can even throw in George HW for good conspiracy sake. Especially when there evidence to suggest SA was involved not mentioning the fact that OBL was Saudi Arabian. The Jewish connection is circumstantial at best and laughable classic r/conspiracy anti Semitism that I never fail to get downvoted over for calling out.

       I'm just picturing hundreds (thousands?) of Israeli dudes dressed as dirtbag art students roaming the buildings, talking to each other like Zohan, planting explosives. Oh and nobody noticing anything or being suspicious. They would need to remove and replace the drywall to place thermite on the columns, which would seem pretty fucking weird if they were just supposed to be putting up art?

       im not sure if you guys cant read or what, but the comment I responded to specifically says that they are going to start a war with another country and pull us into it. When did they start a war with another country on 9/11? When did they start a war with another country in any of your other examples?
      </p>
      <p>
       False flags are not the same as starting a war with another country. The only times Israel has ever actually fought in a war, the US has had nothing (militarily) to do with it whatsoever. Other than supplying weapons that is.

       I think it's a bad idea to just imagine there's only one powerful actor. All too often people think it's just CIA/NSA/MOSSAD/MI6/KGB ... there's a bunch more intelligence agencies, powerful corporations, etc..

       The Obama administration started the Iran deal. This was the first time a us president actively tried to aid a foriegn country that was the grave enemy of that country that must not be in the news. Hillary Clinton was SOS and helped draft this. Shortly after her departure, she began working as a diplomat to further the deal. Their mission was to calm the region so Israel coukdbt have such leverage over the us if Israel attacked Iran, knowing thus would cause a terribke situation for America being stuck between supporting Israel and war with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       A little later, the NSA caught Israel had hacked the entire Obama administration to blackmail them into ending JCPOA. Israel leaked clintons private server used for the Iran deal. This is when clinton began saying shed nuke Iran. Then she fades out if the scene for a year. During that time, Obama cut Israel out if the negotiations. Israel responded by running a smear campaign on Obama calling him antisemetic and telling him his oarty would oay in 2016. As clinton began to run for president, her stance on the Iran deal was brought up at an AIPAC function. She said she stood with the Iran deal but that America would defend Israel if Iran misbehave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Trump enters the scene and is talking about CHINA... He meets with Netanyahu once and then begins talking about the Iran deal being terrible. He meets with Netanyahu a second time and begins talking about clintons emails and dirt. This is the famous hoodwink when he's like "Russia if youre listening." This was because he knew Israel had a sophisticated cyber warfare army posing as Russians and Chinese. Shortly after the Clinton dirt and dnc dirt starts getting leaked. The people being trashed all had a role in the Iran deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich, a devout pro-zion member gets killed. He had access to tge information and had told the NGP VAN exec Courtney Wilson that he wished the democrats not participate in JCPOA. This is when a Sanders supporter hacked ngp van and his campaign was cut off because they thought it was sabotage from Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel created a malware to exploit 0 day vulnerabilities called duqu 2.0. It is everywhere that was hacked leaked and so on in the DNC. Shadowbrokers begins to push out these cyber weapons they've taken over. Thats when israel alerts america that Russia is using their spyware malware through Kaspersky. Israel had been in the us systems since the Iran deal. This attack took over our infrastructure and power plants. Israel could cause a nuclear meltdown with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here we are with Trump giving Israel Jerusalem, the only valuable bargaining chip in the israel palestine two state talks, to Israel and telling palestine fuck you its off the table. Trump then gets Nikki Haley to place prosaudi and prozion I to the un bodies investigating the two. He gives Israel almost 10 billion more over 10 years. He also gives israel better access to American technology by signing EO to allow raytheon boeing Rafael applied science to connect in beersheba.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump then plays the russia angle so Israel isnt outed bc he knows the dnc is scared of blackmail so he is acting it up while letting israel control his cabinet and foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel and Saudi then make a pact.the gas attacks in Syria mirror the attacks in Yemen and Israel America are attacking both Yemen and Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is super sloppy I know but that's basically the gist of trump being a zion stooge for power.

       I actually know a fair amount about this and the notion that the yuan will be the reserve currency or that china suddenly doesn't want dollars makes no sense. if you think I'm wrong, then you have to answer some questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it had a huge effect on the dollar and China has a huge dollar position, why would they do this? Why would they decide to fuck themselves over? if it doesn't fuck over their dollar position through inflation, why would some nebulous they and the fed care?

       It's more everyone's rearing up to be the new leader of the free world more or less. Russia wants to take back some of its russified regions like the baltics, the arctic, and some of Ukraine.

       China wants to take over the Indian Ocean, including East Africa, Pakistan, and some of the weaker bandwagoning S.E.A states.

       I think the shift towards an origin for power is more at-hand than kind of superiority. After-all we are all humans, we share the same DNA etc... I'm not of jewish decent but I was the top 3% of my Ivy league class. There are many cases just like mine. So that disproves your point right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to origins, when monotheism became prevalent around 2000 years ago, the Jewish religion was the only one that allowed for the accumulation of wealth and dealing in interest. Christians could not accumulate wealth as apart of their faith, and Muslims could not deal in complex financial instruments such as interest. The Jewish faith had nothing against these things and as we know today currency and interest controls everything. Within the thousands of years between then and now its not incomprehensible to think that the Jewish faith (transformed to Zionism) does have a grip on these tools of economy and bends them to their whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, since they hold these powers they are able to place those they believe with common interests in power as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to include in this that I'm not anti-semetic at all and I have Jewish friends that I love dearly. I am just an objective person.

       Your Ivy League education wasn’t in statistics or science or you would claim an anecdote disproves a trend. And your history isn’t even wrong. Jews lost most everything many times. Nice try though. Clearly they are superior. They run the world and excel in nearly anything they try, from arts to business to science to combat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is you have to choose one. They either don’t run the world or they are superior. Choose.

       Many races, religions, creeds, and societies have lost everything as well. The Armenians, the Jews, the Muslims of Myanmar, the Palestinians, the Native Americans etc... All have paid a dear price. Yet all have held power, but what seems common is the prevalence of Zionisim. Jews were given a state at the expense of others, Jews have been portrayed as the most attacked coalition of peoples, Jews have always had the right of way. Event today Isrealies kill and mame innocent people but they are viewed as the do-gooders. They stole a country from inhabitants of 2000 years and claimed it thier own. Do you think there was no behind the scenes influence there?Zionist power is stemmed deep and it may have dwindled before but it remains still.
      </p>
      <p>
       My anecdote does nothing to disprove statistics of course, but have you provided the statistics of success by faith? Does such a study even exist? Most probably not. Your offensive demeanor is absurd and your argument is invalid at best.

       WWIII was started with the false flag of 9/11,   and there have been numerous escallations already including the coup in the Ukraine by the US and the failed states created in Iraq,  Libya,  etc.

       Russia eventually started to put their foot down,  and China is also starting.

       The people in the US have been kept in the dark.    Millions have already died in this WWIII and yes,  it could be escallating to a new level once again.    The world already has 65 million refugees.    It could get a lot worse.

       well, i think they may be in the news, just not in the way you think. The reality of the US government financials is that they are unsustainable. this is nothing new. we crossed that line back in 2011, when it would have taken massive austerity or a GDP in excess of 10% to pull us out of debt. ever since then we have been circling the drain, borrowing more every year just to service the debt on what we have already borrowed. most of the members of our government are quite aware of this, and have taken steps to get out of office before the ceiling collapses. But now we circle back around to the topic of war. see, in war, all bets are off- especially for a world war. the government can effectively seize the means of production and ramp it up, not for actual debt, but in the face of survival. things like government debt are forgotten if you win, especially if you bail other countries out like we did in WW2. back then, this put the american economy on the cutting edge of world development, because nobody else had the size and scope we did. unfortunately, this time around,it wont be so easy. We still benefited from geographic isolation in the 1940s. a world war this time around will reach american soil all too quickly, and take a lot of people with it. not a terrible thing if you're looking to shed some extra weight while forcefully boosting the economy. war also comes with some unique rules that are easily enforced on the populace. rationing, employment with less stringent regulation, easy-to-sell nationalism, all things that come with the territory. there are a lot of people that would benefit from a world war, and most of us arent them.

       You have to go less on statistics and more on tactics. Sure, america has a bigger military than the next 12 countries combined, but.. that an easily be neutralized with well placed nukes early in the fight to guam, okinawa, hawaii, san diego, and norfolk. And thats just hampering american deployment capability.

       Yes, it certainly feels that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think the true cabal is transnational and exceeds the US, Russia, China,...yes even Israel. I sincerely doubt they are a nation, a state or anything as obvious as that. They are a group of families that work together to keep power, wealth and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are they? Anyone's guess. But I don't think Israel, as most people here think, is anywhere near the top of the pyramid of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately it's not even important to know who is doing the pushing for war, what's important is that people push back for peace. If humanity worked together and didn't give in to fear, hate or allowed themselves to be herded like sheep, if people actually used their minds and to think and discern, ... it wouldn't matter who is doing the controlling, becaue at that point humanity would be uncontrollable

       I wouldn't be surprised if Mossad poisoned that Russian agent in the UK to blame it on Putin and faked a chemical attack to blame it on Assad in Syria. Israel's greatest threat is the alliance of Iran/Russia/Syria right next to their border. Israel wants to weaken its enemies at all costs, and history shows they have no limits.

       Hit the nail on the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is dumb enough to leave tracks behind when they supposedly hacked the DNC servers, even though we know now that the CIA and NSA hacking tools got out and were in the hands of Russia—tools in which any state can essentially make themselves appear to be any other state actor? We know this because of Wikileaks and media reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is dumb enough to attempt to kill one of their ex spys with an agent that could easily be traced back to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and Assad are dumb enough to drop chemical bombs on civilians after they've practically won the war in Syria and after the US President says he wants US troops out? Doing it against their own self interests?

       Keep an eye on those representatives with dual citizenship. Many times the interests of the U.S. are #2 with them. They don't want to admit it, but look at how they vote or the bills they work to produce. Often it's contrary to what you'd expect to favor sovereignty of the nation or respecting the rights of citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's one thing I hold issue with. They should instead be holding office in the other countries their interests actually align with. They don't belong where they currently are in the practice of influencing or dictating U.S. law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably also one of the reasons why the office of the President in the U.S. also requires that the citizenship is due to the natural born status. (It's expected that the alignment would be with the home country first and foremost.) Other offices in the U.S. government don't have that protection.

        Also, Israeli military aid benefits the US since Israel is contractually obligated to buy our weapons and equipment with that money which boosts our GDP and provides employment for our people.

       I agree, Somalia is a breeding ground for multinational conflict. Remember the reports last year that AQ was mining Uranium there to reportedly send to Iran?

       <p>
        Simply put, the globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interest of the private international financiers and the royal, dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain, Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone on earth. Through their control of the ability to create money, they are able to exercise control over all the power centers of society including the corporations, the media, culture creation, the educational system, the historical societies, the political system, the military, religion, foundations and other NGOs, medicine, and law. Over time they have extended their network of control to include elites from countries all over the world working towards the same end.
