        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They include Dave Chapelle who turned down 50mil and a Faustian deal, realized money isn&#39;t everything and that celebrity can do dark things to people. A couple years ago he proudly proclaimed that he did the Netflix specials because &quot;he needed the money.&quot; He got used to living a rich lifestyle without an evil super-rich one. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that. He showed his views early on using a Dead Prez instrumental as his intro. </p>

<p>Dead Prez could never sell out. Neither could Immortal Technique or any artist on viper records. Being Conspiracy theorists is their bread and butter. </p>

<p>Doug Stanhope has built a persona around not selling out. Performing crude truth telling bits like a modern Bill Hicks. Look up his bit on Mental Health.</p>

<p>Lupe Fiasco could have had it all after &quot;Kick Push&quot; but he would rather not stray from songs like &quot;American Terrorist&quot; and continued to make similar music. His album got held up by Atlantic records until Anonymous (an early incarnation) got his album released. He&#39;s had problematic lines about not voting for Obama, building 7, NWO, and many other lyrics.</p>

<p>I wonder about Kanye West who started out criticizing the diamond industry before it was en vogue to do so and once rapped &quot;I know the government administered AIDS.&quot; Being anointed but with political lines in New Slaves and Black Skknhead and then ranting about supporting Trump (didn&#39;t vote for him) he was forced into an asylum for a brief stay.</p>

<p>Lewis Black seems to have a &quot;peace treaty&quot; with the establishment where he doesn&#39;t directly attack it but limits his exposure to it. The same goes for Larry Wilmore after his show was dubiously canceled the October before the election. He had been nice enough to Obama but on his show was exposing how the DNC was in the tank for Hillary by means of super delegates long before WikiLeaks&#39; release. </p>

<p>MIA had a video censored from broadcast in the US for a line supporting the PLO. She had lines supporting resistance fighters in Sri Lanka before paper planes. She flipped off the crowd at the super bowl halftime show featuring Madonna and had a video where all gingers were rounded up in the US and had a line about the govt listening to iPhones years before Snowden. She released a mixtape named &quot;Vicki Leaks&quot;</p>

<p>Russel Brand has been bashing the BBC and American Media for a long time and was blacklisted after his break up with Katy Perry for reasons I am unaware.</p>

<p>Also Jesse Ventura and Roseanne. I don&#39;t feel like going too in depth about them.</p>

<p>Lots of Bad News on here. I just wanted to post about some principled folks.</p>

<p>Edit: Also comedian Patrice O&#39;Neal (RIP), frequent ONA, FNC, contributor, and sometimes InfoWars contributor.</p>

<p>Other edits were done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to write about them. I don&#39;t have much reference for the visual arts. I would include Ron English and almost all apolitical graffitists as well, but Banksy became a dubious character, but it&#39;s possibly not his fault. The best thing he could do when hearing about the appraisals being off the chart would be to stop. This list is like this because I&#39;ve spent a couple decades watching Comedy Central and listening to rap music. Most of the reading I do is either article/essay length or for pleasure. The only book length political expos√® I read was &quot;Diary of an Economic Hitman.&quot; I would think that there are many authors that could qualify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The secret teachings of all ages by Hall is a decent jumping in point I suppose. Or fingerprints of the gods by Hancock. Graham Hancock also put out a doc called  quest for the lost civilization ide suggest for anyone looking for the good rabbit holes. The source field investigations by Wilcock is interesting but he&#39;s kind a shill these days. The Phoenix by manly Hall is also definitely worth a peek. Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, a bit easier to take in than Mr. Icke at first hah.  Lately I&#39;ve been into the books in the bibliography of this PDF on the gateway project. Stalking the wild pendulum is a fantastic read, the only other place I&#39;ve heard it mentioned we&#39;re during the  &quot;Trilogues&quot; with Ralph Abraham, Terrence McKenna, and Rupert Sheldrake. Also outstanding.

<p>PKD was a modern mystic, and way ahead of his time. He saw decades ago the direction our society was taking, and predicted a lot of what is unfolding now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rosanne ran for a far left party in 2012 but voted for Trump. Wilmore makes sense going up against Colbert but apart from a possibly divisive stance on BLM the show was very interesting. The panelists were rarely partisan lackeys and they had a few &quot;Trump making sense&quot; segments (while the show was anti Trump) and they had an ongoing segment with &quot;Conspiracy Guy&quot; (Mike Yard) who would say several BS things and then make sense towards the end. Wilmore also liked to play around with the Scalia theory. The show was interesting and to can it without notice (most shows get advance notice well more than a week) without letting it run an extra month to cover the election when it had run for two years, is what makes it odd. I could see your points on West and Black. I saw an interview with MHP where she appreciated Trump for bashing the media. Possibly because it sucks, possibly sour grapes, or a mix. Her show sucked a lot worse than &quot;The Nightly Show.&quot; You can probably guess my political bias. I agree that it was &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot; with Brand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shit. I&#39;m just separating the wealthy who&#39;ve fallen out of the spotlight to the elite. For comedians, it&#39;s a huge part of the game. Most comics start locally and make a very small amount of cash very early and naturally crash and burn. I don&#39;t think Dead Prez and IMT have ever had to sacrifice what they believe for any status. Everyone on the list stayed true to themselves and what they believe. That&#39;s the point. The comic on the list who most exemplifies this is Stanhope.</p>
