       The news in the last few years has been like reading a fictional story its that bad, in the last few months we've had false flag after false flag and people still religiously defend the mainstreams piss poor reasoning and evidence. Your attacked by people who follow the narrative constantly if you even dare to question what you have been told.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we have reached a point of no return, I dont think anything can be done, society is just shattered in so many ways right now, you have the flooding of Islamic zealots into western society that wont even attempt to integrate, you have the whole SJW movement and anyone who doesn't agree 100% with you is a Nazi and should be de-platformed, not to mention racism, political correctness, LGBTQ to infinity and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just so tired of everything right now, I'm barely into my 20s and I'm constantly bombarded with crap, you cant even enjoy films or television anymore without there being some god awful agenda behind it ( Hint: Black Panther )
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a very real possibility of a WW3 happening in the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this seems a little all over the place, just a little annoyed right now.

       Yup. 90% of the tension in this country created by politics is due to people refusing to admit they are wrong or anything they support is wrong. Hard core liberals and conservatives think their "team" is 100% right about everything and the "other team" is 100% wrong. Basic logic should tell people that is not the case, yet here we are.

       We move forward by finding things we can agree about.

       The whole objective is to prevent us from agreeing that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the source of the problem. Self-segregating, self-censoring, self-oriented peer groups convinced they are under attack by every other group is the ideal State.

       You sound a little burned out on too much information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution is simple, stop giving a fuck for a week or two, let yourself relax and process. Close off ALL info streams that are related to the things you've mentioned. 
When you're ready, relaxed, refocused and reinvigorated, the same old same old will still be here, Only you're be stronger and ready to get back into the fight.

       As for WW3 I'm of the opinion it's some Saber Rattling. It's spooky, no doubt, But (Here comes the gatekeeping lol) You younger folks Missed some all time classic brinkmanship. This shit is bush league. When aircraft are scrambling and you hear them screaming overhead, and/or, air raid sirens blasting all over your city or town, THEN you'll know the pantshitting terror of MAD.

       I appreciate what you're getting at bud, and I agree; we are spoiled in the US/Europe.  However, although it may seem like it on the surface, I don't think he's complaining about day-to-day life.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I think he's trying to say the same thing many of us feel in our collective gut:
       </strong>
       As a whole, the world is in chaos.  And whether anyone wants to admit it or not, "their" agenda is closer to completion than it ever has been.  This is a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       burden for anyone aware of it, regardless if you live "in the shit" or not.  Regardless of location, we don't know how long we'll be here if we keep at this rate.
       <strong>
        It's a general feeling of instability due to:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       -Our planet's climate is becoming more unpredictable, before our eyes
      </p>
      <p>
       -Living is becoming impossible for many, and college is slowly becoming a pipe dream for kids, which is further dichotomizing the poor from the rich
      </p>
      <p>
       -There are almost 50,000,000 slaves globally
      </p>
      <p>
       -Sex/violence-driven media is impossible to avoid, which is leading to a corrupted youth without a childhood (
       <em>
        Have any of you seen a 12-13 year old recently?
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       -People are slaughtered in the Middle East and South America
       <em>
        daily
       </em>
       , as spoiled SJW brats in the West complain about "Manspreading" and "White Privilege" to have an out for their lack of work ethic and social abilities
      </p>
      <p>
       -All the while, Trump is busy starting wars over Twitter with a national debt that's skyrocketing, China has rolled out a social credit system, certain cities are collecting people's guns, and the UK is banning delivery of KNIVES.  Not to mention California's new bill regarding control of the news, the pollution in the Pacific three times the size of France, and the 30-40 year attack on men around the world, evidenced by physiological changes such as unprecedented reductions in testosterone and sperm count
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Don't get me wrong:
       </strong>
       Technology, medicine, and day-to-day peace is incredible; it's an absolute miracle, and I like to believe none of us takes that for granted.  However, I think our compadre here is struggling with the internal burden of knowing this information.  It seems like he wishes he could go back&lt;/3

         the climate has gone through many changes.  I’ve read articles that say we can get to 10-11 billion &amp; still be ok.  All 7 billion of us currently alive &amp; born today will be dead in under 120 years unless significant life extending advances take place.  It’s not even proven fact that humans have a major impact on the fluctuating temps of the earth.  The sun is most likely the biggest influencer on global temps.

         “Living is becoming impossible for many, and college is slowly becoming a pipe dream for kids, which is further dichotomizing the poor from the rich” - i disagree.  Many people do not need college.  Many of the degrees &amp; classes in college are bullshit.  I had to pay a couple grand to take a tennis class &amp; i was on my high school team - this is why college is so expensive.  Dumb shit classes.

       Sorry but I things are worse than you know. There is a death cult running most things. Notice how Donald Turnip is doing the same things the Clintons, Bushes, and Obama did, regardless of what he said to get elected, they all march to the drumbeat of
       <em>
        death
       </em>
       . How that was accomplished, by what entities, we can argue. The best example I can give you is the USA Defense/Security budget. Combined it's over a trillion dollars. This whole "Empire, World Police" is a death cult. We didn't "win" the Cold War. The evening news and the movies you mentioned all lead back to the death cult.

       Agreed. However, why are they so consumed by money? I make shit money 40-55k (in B2B sales) and I am pretty happy! I live in a great neighborhood, got a awesome gf, and all my family/friends are happy and healthy. Isn't that what life should be focused on? Sure, I would love millions of dollars, but is there an influx in happiness? Probably not.

       As livestock, it doesn't make sense to just flat kill your herd. A comprehensive plan includes letting you live as long as it is profitable, your work is valued until the costs associated exceed that value. Overall management dictates fertility control and moving some of the herd, like from Africa and the Near East to, say, Europe, Scandinavia and Mexicans to the US. War is needed in the cases of projected rapid population growth or if it is determined that some breeds are expected to be less profitable. Basically you manage the herd over the life cycle of the individual. Eventually it is useful to drain the older individuals of any retained capital, hence the insane pricing system of most of healthcare. The husks, and harvested can be discarded, that too is another business model. Why can we communicate? Certain interactions give the herd a sense of well being, and more importantly it keeps them distracted from the ranch owners.

       If Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc, has to censor or change their search results, it's because they don't want the truth to get out but the fact that these companies are actively doing this now means that too many people are on to their BS and that's never going to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also means that we have done something and it's making these companies scared.

       IT has been this way for a long time.  A very long time. People just have more access to information nowadays.

       Life is beautiful if you let it be, or you can carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. What is your responsibility?  Figure that out.  Start small.  Fix the things in your life, then tackle the worlds problems.

       Most definitely.  Been waiting for WW3 to strike since 1979 when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.  It has been pretty much Business as usual with things simmering since then.

       Didnt read everyones reply, but bruh, Ivr been stufying a loy of stuff since abouy 09. There seems yo be a real possibility of alien involvement on our planet. Also, there seems to be a lot yo the bible and christianity. Jordan Maxwell seems yo yalk a lot about RCC (Roman Cayholic Church) and how its been a major player for years. Atm, Im going a church, studying up on the bible, and trying yo figure if there's any correlation between current events and prophecy. Are the origins of the bible man-made, alien, or divine? Idk... I dont want to sterr anyone wrong, buy thats what Im looking at, atm: aliens and religion. Havent studied flat earth very much. I think its a psy-op (thats what my intuition tells me) to make conspiracy theorists look coo-coo, but again, I havent went deep into it, which I might... My serious thoughts are: alien/religious, and do the 2 mingle? Im thinking it could br some religious stuff, like "aliens are fallen angels", or vice-versa: "fallen angels are aliens"... I make videos about stuff, but people love to talk shit, even in times like these... Its crazy... I agree with you, there seems to be no more "saving this ship"... Everyone is so deluded, it seems hopeless. I wish you well in whatever may come... Stay strong.

       I will be honest. I have kept bees for 5 years, just moved to 10 acres in the country. Picked up 14 chickens this year and I've picked up over 30 lbs of different grains and cover crops to begin planting this year. So no, I don't grow all my own food but I'm working in it.

       Well if we the people just sit around and accept whatever the government says and do there isn't anything we can do. People have the power to demand change, but instead we sit in front of the internet and argue about who's good and evil. About the social credit system, if the people want they can go to the street and change things. Is China going to bomb all it's people?

       If there was any revolution, it wasn't organized by some kind of good people quorum trying to rescue country from th evils in power, and bring the power back to people. Never!
      </p>
      <p>
       It was always of people who recognized the moment in time, and who were deeply connected to powers that was, and simply made overturn in order to satisfy people's need for change. Then they take out the ones who are the most idealistic, and who scream "This is not what we fought for!" and install the most obedient people into positions that need controling.

       What we need is evolution, and it's happening as we speak. You just need to make some sense of it and find your role in it.

       "The truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction. It was growing evidence that the people on the other side were not the demons I was led to believe. These realizations were life altering. Once I saw we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth, but flawed human beings, I couldn't pretend otherwise." ~

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This has been at the front of my mind lately, because I can't help but see in our public discourse so many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church. We celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory, and still we grow more and more divided. We want good things -- justice, equality, freedom, dignity, prosperity -- but the path we've chosen looks so much like the one I walked away from four years ago. We've broken the world into us and them, only emerging from our bunkers long enough to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp. We write off half the country as out-of-touch liberal elites or racist misogynist bullies. No nuance, no complexity, no humanity. Even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side, the conversation nearly always devolves into a debate about who deserves more empathy. And just as I learned to do, we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponent's. Compromise is anathema. We even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line. This path has brought us cruel, sniping, deepening polarization, and even outbreaks of violence. I remember this path. It will not take us where we want to go.
       </p>
       <p>
        What gives me hope is that we can do something about this. The good news is that it's simple, and the bad news is that it's hard. We have to talk and listen to people we disagree with. It's hard because we often can't fathom how the other side came to their positions. It's hard because righteous indignation, that sense of certainty that ours is the right side, is so seductive. It's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion to people who show us hostility and contempt. The impulse to respond in kind is so tempting, but that isn't who we want to be. We can resist. And I will always be inspired to do so by those people I encountered on Twitter, apparent enemies who became my beloved friends. And in the case of one particularly understanding and generous guy, my husband. There was nothing special about the way I responded to him. What was special was their approach. I thought about it a lot over the past few years and I found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible. These four steps were small but powerful, and I do everything I can to employ them in difficult conversations today.

       Just curious Op, how old are you?
I know things seemed fucked now, but trust me things have been way more fucked and we came back.
During the civil rights movement people were being sprayed with fire hoses, attacked by dogs, lynched in the street, etc.
During Vietnam, american soldiers were murdering woman and children
Before that there was World War 2, literally the whole world was at war.

       This is pretty mild compared to our history. But the positive is that through the labor pains usually comes a positive ending
