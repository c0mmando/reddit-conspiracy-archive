        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings!</p>

<p>I decided to make this post after I shared some of these threads from Godlike Productions in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> roundtable about ancient civilizations. The OP of these threads was somebody posting under the name Alterwelt.</p>

<p>Alterwelts first post on GLP was on 11/24/2014, and was followed by two more posts over the years. </p>

<p>I also believe that there was another account from him, or the same group of people he was involved with under the account &quot;Außenseiter&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is Alterwelts opening comment from his first post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Greetins.</p>

<p>I come from Germany. My introduction maybe somewhat lacking but i&#39;m not a great fan of lying to people so here&#39;s what i have to share.</p>

<p>No personal details nor details of any sort.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an employee in an educational facility of sorts. Together with my co-workers we&#39;re engaged in what ypu&#39;d call remote viewing with a specific goal of targetting and describing ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>The goal itself is to provide our benefactors with crucial information, technological and historical artifacts and whatever data might be useful commercially or otherwise.</p>

<p>On a fun night we&#39;ve decided to provide our initiative with a little leak.</p>

<p>You may ask whatever you want concerning old history and ancient civilizations, historical or beyond. If its covered by our work you will get an answer, if not then no.</p>

<p>Sumer, Babylon and beyond, ask away, someone will log in every day for an hour or so to answer those questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are the thread links</p>

<p><a href="https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2702754/pg1">Alterwelt Thread #1</a>
<a href="https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3219865/pg1">Alterwelt Thread #2</a>
<a href="https://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3454086/pg1">Alterwelt Thread #3</a></p>

<p>Then I found this one thread which seems to be very similar but from a different OP</p>

<p><a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3573977/pg1">Außenseiter Thread</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s some really interesting stuff, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.</p>

Unfortunately &quot;Alterwelt&quot; is very vague about how he gets his information (Sort of got Bad &#39;Q&#39; vibes) but his answers are very much inline with the research I&#39;ve been doing about ancient history for the last couple years which leads me to believe it&#39;s not 100% bullshit. </p>

<p>However, I wish more about his method and research techniques could be shared, I don&#39;t see a reason for the secrecy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it definitely is. I actually got to meet Graham Hancock a couple years ago. He was a really nice guy.</p>

<p>Alterwelt is interesting because he takes Hancock&#39;s ideas a whole step further by saying there have been several high points of civilization, while Graham is doing everything he can just to get people to accept we aren&#39;t the first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. It would rewrite our entire history of the human race. I grew up being taught that everything really kicked off for humanity with the discovery of agriculture in the fertile crescent.</p>

<p>After reading Grahams books and then countless hours of independent research, what I find most fascinating is the massive correlation between flood mythology. </p>

<p>I found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Flood-Handbook-World-Myths/dp/1481966685">this book about flood myths</a> in a used bookstore a while back, and it is fascinating how prevalent flood mythology is all over the world.</p>

<p>If Graham was correct about the sudden and unexpected world wide flood, it would certainly account for all these myths. I also love to read how these myths speak of how they tried to survive the flood. </p>

<p>Many cultures speak of going to much higher ground to wait it out, while others ran to cave systems or &quot;into the earth&quot;. </p>

<p>Another factor to the flood mythology lining up with Graham Hancocks research is the matter of the massive smoke plume created by a meteor breaking up across a massive ice sheet. These myths describe the blocking out of the sun, which in itself would be more than enough to really fuck up any well off civilization.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a lot of ideas to discuss and bounce off people, which is why I&#39;m so happy that other people are willing to discuss it here. I find that when I try to discuss this with someone not already exposed to these theories is very difficult as it really forces someone to completely reconsider everything they&#39;ve been taught about the history of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought it was interesting seeing all the good myths out there and seeing actual scientific evidence from soil deposits all across the world corroborate the myth. This is why I believe in the ancient aliens mythology too. Too many stories from so many cutkures so far apart that are similar. </p>

<p>This subject is one of my favorite along with UFO&#39;S, there is more to our history that what we have been told or that we even know. Like.graham says, we&#39;re a species with amnesia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the more accepted the theory becomes in mainstream research, the more we will learn about it.</p>

<p>Once it becomes more accepted that this isn&#39;t the first high point of civilization, research will get more money behind it and we should start to learn some incredible stuff.</p>

What intrigues me the most about this one, is that the US military only deals with real shit as far as i can tell. And if someone came to them (or you or me), claiming to have these abilities, wouldn&#39;t it be really damn easy to prove they were faking it? like, have Bob go into the room and ask the remote viewer, &quot;how many fingers is he holding up?&quot; or give them an address half way across the world and tell them to describe the building. interesting indeed.</p>
