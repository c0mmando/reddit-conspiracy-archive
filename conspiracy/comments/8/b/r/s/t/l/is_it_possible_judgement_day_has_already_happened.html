    <div class="md"><p>Maybe that&#39;s just how it plays out in our minds/brains/subconscious when we die if we were unaware that we have perished? Kind of like how you never actually remember the exact moment you fall asleep? I think about what comes a lot. Is there an actual place of praise and reward along with torment and punishment? Or are they constructed ideas we buy into through a life of being told we&#39;re going to one or the other? Or is just one big after life and life was just school for the soul to graduate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The King James Bible lays it all out with a timeline and everything.  We are still in the dispensation of grace.  People who are alive now do not need to see the Great White Throne of Judgement (from the front side).  It can be avoided by repenting and believing the gospel now.  If you get saved then you will see the Judgment Seat of Christ after the catching away of the saints which is not a judgement of sin but of works and it involves receiving (or not) eternal rewards.  Every saved person will see this Judgment and their souls are eternally secure.  Nobody goes to hell that is saved by the grace of God in this dispensation.</p>

<p>To be saved just realize you are a sinner and headed for an eternal lake of fire but God died for your sins so you don&#39;t have to.  Believe this and trust in it alone for your salvation.  Tell God you understand in the best way you know:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1Â  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;Â 
1Co 15:2Â  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.Â 
1Co 15:3Â  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;Â 
1Co 15:4Â  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I refuse that any god, who creates an eternal reward/punishment system for the deeds done here on earth, is worthy of being worshipped and submitted to.</p>

<p>Selfishness is the root of all evil, and living a good life just so that you get to go to heaven is a selfish act.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting saved has nothing to do with being good.  It&#39;s about understanding that you in fact are not good and all of your righteousness are filthy rags to God.</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p>

<p>Getting saved is about ending your own self righteousness and realizing that you are guilty of sin before a perfect, holy God and heading for a lake of fire.  Yet he loved you enough to die for you and shed his blood so you don&#39;t have to.  He offers you his own righteousness as a free gift though repentance and belief in his gospel which is in the above post.</p>

<p>Rom_6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>Eph_2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:</p>

<p>You have the free will to refuse his gift if you want.  He gave you this life (and his) freely and you can use it however you like.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t aim to knock anyone else&#39;s beliefs, but I also believe that is part of the straw man god pushed by the vatican.</p>

<p>The god pushed by the vatican is a vain and jealous god which doesn&#39;t even live up to the principles he expects from us.  </p>

<p>Feel God, Know God, but any concept of god we could worship is a false idol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding of apocalyptic texts, there is no questioning once the judgement day arrives. On that day, it will be undeniable what is happening, and the truth of who is God will ultimately be revealed. </p>

<p>But I can appreciate a little speculation on the end times. The only thing we know about them for certain is that we can know nothing for certain, so my point is essentially irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The false god you are criticizing is a straw man pushed by the world...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you 100%.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting saved is about ending your own self righteousness and realizing that you are guilty of sin before a perfect, holy God and heading for a lake of fire. Yet he loved you enough to die for you and shed his blood so you don&#39;t have to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t aim to knock anyone else&#39;s beliefs, but I also believe that is part of the straw man god pushed by the vatican.</p>

<p>The god pushed by the vatican is a vain and jealous god which doesn&#39;t even live up to the principles he expects from us.  </p>

<p>Feel God, Know God, but any concept of god we could worship is a false idol.</p>
