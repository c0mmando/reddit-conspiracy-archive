One way to mislead is to control the acceptable range of discussion. On reddit, this often takes the shape of posts and comments being removed and users being banned. I want to thank the mods for making the log public, as I believe this transparency does a lot of good for reddit.</p>

<p>You can view the mod log here: </p>

<p>There are also many sites to buy up votes, fake accounts, even moderators sell their accounts.

    <div class="md"><p>As someone invited to the &quot;secret club&quot;, I can only state my opinion in that people who have been invited have been those who over a long period of time have shown to honestly encourage and stand for honest and open civil discourse, regardless of one&#39;s political stance or bias. Essentially mirroring the rules of this sub. </p>

<p>Express your opinions no matter what they may be, conduct yourself and back up your opinions when challenged, respect the person challenging your beliefs, and never resort to condescension/name-calling/harassing. If you&#39;re incapable of doing this you get banned (see TMoR for butthurt examples of people who are a victim of their own inability to debate with civility.)</p>

<p>From what I see, sub only appears to discuss how to circumvent the obvious circumvention of organic discussion within this sub. I&#39;m no mod so I cannot speak to the exact reasons as to why one would be invited, but a strong stance against stalkers/harassers/serial-strawman-astroturfers is a good start. </p>

<p>Compare the comments here to something like politics, news, worldnews, futurology, or even programming. You will get away with more in any of those subs than here.</p>

<p>This is supposed to be a forum for free thinking, but it has some of the most draconian rules on the site aside from perhaps T_D.</p>
