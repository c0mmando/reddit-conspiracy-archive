    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you! From my own experience, I have felt that it heals your consciousness, which means it removes blockages, which means it increases awareness (where the blockage exists) which means it exposes you to the unfamiliar, which provokes a fear (paranoia) response, which you can either cave into and remain unhealed, or overcome -- in which case you chip away at the blockage and accept the healing! Hooray! If you go into it thinking it&#39;s a medicine, you won&#39;t feel the fear so much and it is more effective, but if you go into it as recreation then you are expecting fun and easy so you react to the fear strongly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You either buckle under and live in fear, or are relentless in your efforts to rise above. You have to figure out your own life and how to resolve the fears. Or you can choose to say &quot;I can&#39;t, I&#39;m not strong enough&quot; and take a pill or hide in a cave. We are supposed to be talking about our real fears with each other so we can help each other to rise above and evolve. But religion and taboo and ego get in the way, and there is this cultural idea that I DON&#39;T DESERVE TO HAVE TO EXPERIENCE PAIN!! For real, that&#39;s ridiculous. Pain is how your body and spirit communicate where they need to heal. Pain is part of life, a regular fucking human experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t. I&#39;m a former alcohol abuser who wouldn&#39;t listen to anybody and insisted on learning about life the hard way. So many people and religions talk about how life is suffering, and people don&#39;t want to hear it because they desire pleasure and ease. The way I see it now, we have all been brainwashed by this concept of &quot;suffering&quot; -- instead of being a bad thing, it is pressure on your spirit to evolve! It&#39;s a good thing, pushing you in the right direction, something to be celebrated! Of course I&#39;m still trying to change and live this ideal in my actual life. Not easy at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>News flash: that ain’t a fuckin news flash. </p>

<p>What im saying is after a certain point, anxiety becomes your crutch to feel deliberately anxious and depressed. Yes, extremely shitty things and events in your personal life can make you feel that way but to say you can’t or will never get out of that hole is a mental disorder in its own. </p>

<p>Only a person will take themselves out of depression. It’s a mental state you must put yourself in to become happy and less anxious. And no, it’s not as easy as the flip of a switch. It takes a lot of effort that most people just don’t want to attempt to go through because it’s actually easier to be sad and unhappy.  I’m a depressed person. I hate life. But I don’t want to end it. And I don’t want to live the rest of my life endlessly feeing like shit. So I choose to decide to be happy. I choose to decide to try to put myself in happier, healthier mindsets and moods without the help of a pill because I know that I control my own fucking reality. Every day isn’t easy to say that and actually put myself into that mindset but I am completely aware of the cancer that is depression and what it takes to get out of it. It’s like going to the gym. You must work on it as much as possible or you will give yourself the reason, any reason not to go. You will give yourself all the fucking reasons to be sad or anxious or depressed when you can just say, fuck the world I’m gonna be happy today. </p>

<p>Fuck what you think. Stay sad. Stay anxious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are definitely right about that. I really dislike that it’s become sort of cool to identify being depressed or diseased like you say it. </p>

<p>Pop culture and social media could be to blame but there’s so much more stuff involved in that. 
And thank you. I don’t say all that like I know exactly what I’m doing but it’s the fact that I’m aware of my own depressive feelings that make me want to fight to be happy. </p>

<p>I feel like a lot of people don’t realize that the act of just attempting to change your attitude about certain things like depression is a basis for fixing your feelings and emotions. They just want to complain about it without actually doing anything. </p>

<p>I hope whatever battles you have can be fought with valor and confidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i believe this is true</p>

<p>i also believe a big part of achieving success in modern society (aka not a survival situation) is self delusion. confidence is so huge in social settings and getting promotions(thinking you deserve it, and convincing your boss you deserve it) etc</p>

<p>being too realistic can hold you back. something about potential. jordan peterson kinda covers this. potential is what you can be, and if you take a realistic look at yourself as you are, you might fall into the trap of thinking its all you can be. sounds like some self help bullshit but theres a reason its cliche</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reply is interesting.  So your backing up my thought?  You basically saying that &quot;Truth&quot; does not push possibility forward.  Right?  Let me frame it in a different way.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Your Thought: Truth is useless because it does not support reaching a higher potential</li>
<li>My Thought: Belief (faith) is truth because it supports reaching a better potential. </li>
</ul>

<p>What is real truth?  Believing in limit or believing in the ability to reach higher potential?  This is why faith (belief) is so damn powerful. </p>

<p>theres scientific hard truths, and theres truths that are not useful when run through the human machine, and there are truths we believe to be true which may not be accurate but are useful for achieving our goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannabis sativa was defined by Linnaeus meaning any cannabis plant that has been cultivated. So technically everything is a sativa. Lamarck described indica as anything being exported from India(which included plain ol’ fruit) You can grow a sativa at a high altitude and get a short, broad leaf plant(indica traits) what really determines the high is how cannabinoids interact with terpenes. IMO I/S/H classification is far too broad. Should be broken down into what region they hail from. Plus everything’s a friggen hybrid nowadays. Sorry just thought I’d expand a little. </p>

<p>Hoffman&#39;s initial description of his LSD experience does not match with LSD experiences. Nichols claims Hoffman had a mystical experience (which he was prone to.) My thoughts? It&#39;s the 1940s, the Swiss were also doing human experiments, Hoffman helped it escape from the lab (for what reasons: good or bad? who knows.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fascinating point of view, thanks for sharing. It would seem to suggest that this spontaneous mystical experience caused Hoffman to reconsider a spiritually potent drug, which then lead to the spiritual awakening of many who came to experience it. </p>

<p>Like a spiritual virus facilitating its own spread through the strategic use of spontaneous inspiration. Sounds pretty out there, but I like the concept quite a bit. </p>

<p>It certainly feels very much as though we&#39;re allowing ourselves to be possessed or temporarily entered by certain spirits when we take specific drugs. Perhaps they don&#39;t require the drugs, themselves, but our brains to be on a certain wavelength, and Albert was naturally close to the frequency of LSD.</p>

<p>Of course this is mumbo jumbo, but I think it&#39;s something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me say what drug dealers and other people have told me about “laced weed” over the years. NOBODY IS GONNA WASTE GOOD DRUGS SPRINKLING ON WEED. PERIOD! No one is sprinkling crack, coke, acid or whatever on your weed. That’s just not a thing. And less you have an asshole friend or somebody that’s trying to take advantage of you, chances are your stops probably not least at all. That’s like getting syringes and shit in your Halloween candy. It just doesn’t really happen. I think people that claim that they had laced weed in the past were just too high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the above and more. There has been a lot of new research produced lately coming out of Eastern Europe. These researchers basically suggest that there was an empire larger than any other that was removed from all maps after 1860 called grand Tartaria. pre 1800s maps show the  territory stretched from Eastern Europe to china and Japan, North America North Africa and India. In all these regions we find cannabis use. Japanese used weed up until ww2. Northern Africa Ethiopia is where we get Rastafarian culture from and there an abandoned town in Siberia called epiphany which had weed on their coat of arms. I could go on but I&#39;m on mobile. I&#39;ll have to make a longer post latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those two things are in no way mutually exclusive. It&#39;s at the very least one of the most plausible explanations for the exceptional human capacity to be conscious, to think abstractly and to conceptualize possible futures and bargain with it to our advantage, that some of our earliest primitive ancestors found magic mushrooms in cow dung as they were forced to leave the forest and venture out into open fields and other terrains.</p>

<p>Should this hypothesis be true, then tripping apes would be the first tangible step towards any civilization, ours, or others before ours. </p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that a vast and sophisticated civilization existed before any other culture we have records of, before the Sumerians, and before the Dogons and before the Egyptians. Water erosion on the Sphinx would indicate that it alone has to be at least 12500 years old, more than twice as old than mainstream archeology maintains.</p>

<p>There is nothing speaking against the idea that our early primate ancestors were kick-started into creative endevours like language creation, construction of tools and structures, art, and culture through the discovery of mind-altering drugs like psilocybin, cannabis, ergot, DMT, poppy seeds, and probably a range of other things, some 500k years ago, building many kinds of proto-societies along the way, some of which are still around, as well as some very sophisticated ones, capable of many things we either take for granted or which we don&#39;t know how to do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite conceivable that an earlier civilization has had a presence around the world. Building boats that last an oceanic journey is difficult, but not out of the question, and yet still, such a society could collapse just as well as ours can at the drop of a hat (or a large asteroid), leaving barely a trace.</p>

<p>If our society broke down tonight, how much would be left of our footprints in 10k years? The Hoover dam? The Chinese Wall? Certainly not the Golden Gate Bridge or Manhatten, not without maintenance. Rust, decay, and erosion would take down virtually everything we built in a matter of a few thousand years. Books would be gone, so would the internet. By the time the next civilization arises, would they even consider that they might not have been the first one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I smoked a lot of pot and just experienced paranoia once in my life that was caused by mind control tech, at the same time they were squeezing my heart every hour, caused forced speech, forced crying, virtual reality dream, more overt stalking/street theater, at this point I knew about their remote influencing technologies so felt really fake and I knew I wasn&#39;t losing my mind but when your brain&#39;s being hacked you just can&#39;t control the effects of the synthetic signals they send, it was over in less than a week.</p>

<p>I think pot can cause VERY LITTLE paranoia if smoking some where you don&#39;t feel safe cuz it heightens senses, this kind of paranoia feels normal and might make someone just a little jittery or  feeling on edge it can be managed very easily by meditating, calming one&#39;s mind or trying to focus on an activity. Control the smell, try to be indoors or not in a crowded place, if there&#39;s a high chance of being arrested consider not doing it or use edibles, most of all don&#39;t go on for a long time smoking pot in a place you don&#39;t feel safe that could really fuck you up (not speaking from experience btw that&#39;s just how brains tend to work) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to smoke all the time, everyday multiple times a day. Recently my insomnia came back and I decided to try smoking to help me sleep, and it did not go well, I was an anxiety ridden mess. I will say that I have anxiety without pot that has gotten really bad recently, but what the pot did was make me think about everything wrong in my life and hyper focus on it and then have panic about it and about myself, and the only way I was able to get rid of it was by having sex with my boyfriend to wear me out and then watching adventure time to cheer me up and I ended up being up all night still. So maybe pot makes our minds more aware of the subconscious but I’m not entirely sure it’s a good thing, it’s subconscious for a reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the primary reasons some drugs (psychedelics in particular) are illegal because they expand your consciousness, allow you to think for yourself, and ignite the natural curiosity within you. This inevitably makes one question the validity of this dystopian reality the governments have forced upon us. This is dangerous to them for they require subservience, ignorance, and blind faith in order to maintain their control over the world&#39;s population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume that thc can make people panic who arent accustomed to getting high, like any unfamiliar experience</p>

<p>If its not a case of an inexperienced smoker, i actualy do believe that the paranoia from a thc high is a self awareness thing. as a lifelong smoker I know that I mostly enjoy my highs , particularly w sativa weed, when i have my shit figured out (Im in a job for the forseeable future, i have some roots planted, my money situation is good etc) even if i hate my job, where i live, etc.. I can enjoy my highs and relax. </p>

<p>If Im in a transitional period, like between jobs, moving, trying to figure shit out-- even if im enjoying life in those moments-- i get antsy paranoid etc when i smoke - particularly sativa..</p>

<p>ive always reasoned that this is because the weed benefits me with relaxation when its supposed to (make shit i HAVE to deal with less shitty), but when I need to figure shit out and get off my ass it reminds me that i need to start moving... if this makes sense</p>

<p>My favorite is the one about &quot;over 400 chemicals&quot; in marijuana. Which is true. 400 chemical compounds... AKA molecules. Everything is made up of friggin chemicals. They make it sound like weed growers add liquid bleach or something. </p>
