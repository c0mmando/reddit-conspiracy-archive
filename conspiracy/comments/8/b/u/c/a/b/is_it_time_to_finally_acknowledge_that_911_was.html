        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Very few people on this sub still believe the &#39;Osama did it&#39; fairytale. Thank god.</p>

<p>There are however many people here who still believe that the <em>rest</em> of the official story is basically true: planes rammed into buildings and 3,000 people died.</p>

<p>This thread is not intended to reignite <em>that</em> debate.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is find out how many people have woken up to the <strong>esoteric</strong> elements of what happened that day.</p>

<p>&#39;Esoteric&#39; simply means something that is likely/able to be understood by only a small proportion of people. The majority of the masses can never and will never understand the <strong>symbolism</strong> of the 9/11 event. They are too distracted by constant thoughts of &#39;I&#39;m hungry&#39; and &#39;I don&#39;t like that person&#39; and &#39;I want to travel somewhere exotic&#39;. That is the depth of their thoughts.</p>

<p>For those with eyes to see, the symbolism of 9/11 is breathtaking in its complexity and even its beauty. Interwoven among the events of that day are a paper trail of &#39;synchronicities&#39; in film and television, which conspiracy n00bies generally see as merely &#39;predictive programming&#39;, a red herring if ever one existed.</p>

<p>A mind-blowing introduction to the esoteric elements of 9/11 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ULjJ3EqyY">this short video</a>, which was produced by a top 10 NBA draft pick.</p>

<p>What are <em>your</em> favourite symbolic connections concerning 9/11? And when did you realise that 9/11 was more than just a &#39;false flag&#39;?</p>

<p>I remember when I used to buy into this meme. Boy I was naive back then.</p>

<p>The process of deprogramming is a time-consuming one. Patience is a virtue.</p>

<p>As always, the best method is to simply ask oneself:&quot; &#39;what is my evidence?&#39;</p>

<p>Without appeals to authority or appeals to consensus, &#39;what is my evidence?&#39;</p>

<p>Do you know anyone from NY or NJ? Throw a stone in Northern NJ, you could probably find someone who knew someone who was lost on that day. Basing your theory on the fact that no one died is disrespectful to your fellow citizens, and pointless as you are just flat out wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can already look up newspaper articles claiming that people died.</p>

<p>Every time I try to find <strong>actual</strong> evidence, I find nothing.</p>

<p>Then on internet forums, where every conspiracy under the sun is discussed, whenever I dare to express my opinion that we have been lied to about the victim count, people like yourself turn up and post &#39;dont be teh disrespectfulz&#39; comments.</p>

<p>Then you offer to provide evidence, and then when I say, &#39;great, that&#39;s exactly what I want&#39;, you say, &#39;oh but I can&#39;t give any actual evidence, just more rehashed nonsense from the same MSM who lies about everything else&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that this is how you feel, but like I said - If I blur out any information - you will call bullshit, and I will say I&#39;m protecting my family. Understandable on both sides. </p>

<p>I understand you want the truth, and invest time into it. I do too. I am a researcher myself. But I want to make sure WE BOTH press for the truth. I want you to know what I know. We are both here because we want to know more about the truth. I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. People died in NYC on 9/11 as a result of the WTC. My closest was a FDNY rescuer, and my connections had family/friends that were employees in the WTC in finance roles. I can provide you with companies and engine numbers if you would like. </p>

<p>I am not fighting you, just want to help us all come to the truth. I&#39;ve admitted to you that I don&#39;t believe in the MSM narrative, so what would I have to gain by lying about any of this? </p>

<p>And as for 9/11, if you want to believe that 3,000 people died that day, go right ahead.</p>

<p>I grew out of that nonsense years ago and am much better and happier and mentally healthier for it.</p>

<p>One particular esoteric order of note, founded by Aleister Crowley for its initiates to practice &#39;Scientific Illuminism&#39; and perform the Great Work, intended to be his successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> and counterpart to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis">OTO / Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A.A. or Argenteum Astrum</a>, which translates to &#39;Silver Star&#39; and a direct reference to Sirius, the star of initiation.

<p>According to theosophist Alice Bailey,:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is the great star of initiation because our Hierarchy (an expression of the second aspect of divinity) is under the supervision or spiritual magnetic control of the Hierarchy of Sirius.”</p>

<p>“All that can be done here in dealing with this profound subject is to enumerate briefly some of the cosmic influences which definitely affect our earth, and produce results in the consciousness of men everywhere, and which, during the process of initiation, bring about certain specific phenomena.</p>

<p>First and foremost is the energy or force emanating from the sun Sirius. If it might be so expressed, the energy of thought, or mind force, in its totality, reaches the solar system from a distant cosmic centre via Sirius. Sirius acts as the transmitter, or the focalising centre, whence emanate those influences which produce self-consciousness in man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the renowned Albert Pike, a prolific Masonic writer and philosopher who restructured the bulk of the ritual and content of the 32 degrees of the Scottish Rite (the 33rd being symbolic) and authored Morals and Dogma:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Ancient Astronomers saw all the great Symbols of Masonry in the Stars. Sirius glitters in our lodges as the Blazing Star.” </p>

<p>“To find in the BLAZING STAR of five points an allusion to the Divine Providence, is also
fanciful; and to make it commemorative of the Star that is said to have guided the Magi,
is to give it a meaning comparatively modern. Originally it represented SIRIUS, or the
Dog-star, the forerunner of the inundation of the Nile; the God ANUBIS, companion of
ISIS in her search for the body of OSIRIS, her brother and husband. Then it became the
image of HORUS, the son of OSIRIS, himself symbolized also by the Sun, the author of
the Seasons, and the God of Time; Son of ISIS, who was the universal nature, himself
the primitive matter, inexhaustible source of Life, spark of uncreated fire, universal seed
of all beings. It was HERMES, also, the Master of Learning, whose name in Greek is that
of the God Mercury. It became the sacred and potent sign or character of the Magi, the
PENTALPHA, and is the significant emblem of Liberty and Freedom, blazing with a
steady radiance amid the weltering elements of good and evil of Revolutions, and
promising serene skies and fertile seasons to the nations, after the storms of change and
tumult.”</p>

<p>“Our French Brethren place this letter YOD in the centre of the Blazing Star. And in the
old Lectures, our ancient English Brethren said, &quot;The Blazing Star or Glory in the centre
refers us to that grand luminary, the Sun, which enlightens the earth, and by its genial
influence dispenses blessings to mankind.&quot; They called it also in the same lectures, an
emblem of PRUDENCE. The word Prudentia means, in its original and fullest
signification, Foresight; and, accordingly, the Blazing Star has been regarded as an
emblem of Omniscience, or the All-seeing Eye, which to the Egyptian Initiates was the
emblem of Osiris, the Creator. With the YOD in the centre, it has the kabalistic meaning
of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from Kenneth Grant, founder of the fringe Typhonian offshoot of the OTO:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Set is the initiator, the Opener of mans’ consciousness to the rays of the Undying God typified by Sirius – the Sun in the South.” </p>

<p>“Sirius, or Set, was the original “headless one” – the light of the lower region (the south) who was known (in Egypt) as An (the dog), hence Set-An (Satan), Lord of the infernal regions, the place of heat, later interpreted in a moral sense as “hell”.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I think it is interesting to note that we replaced what were officially known as &quot;World Trade Center 1&quot; and &quot;World Trade Center 2&quot;, with what is, legally, known as &quot;One World Trade Center&quot;. To those paying attention to these things, that is significant. Secondly, I believe that in ritual magick acts, the number of observers grants it further power. 9/11 was broadcast live to America and to the world. Millions watched those towers fall <em>live</em>. Millions more watched again and again as the news coverage in the following months played those clips over and over.</p>

<p>So we have the ritual element of the spectacle, with the end result of a new name and symbolic place, One World Trade Center, being created. We also have elements of blood magick- 3,000 people lost their lives that day, adding to the agony of the spectacle, witnessed by millions.</p>

<p>9/11 was used to cast a literal spell over the West, and especially America. It destroyed the innocence of a nation, and riled millions up for war. It fundamentally altered history in doing so- and the course and destiny of the Western world and the US.</p>

<p>9/11 was, in my opinion, a ritual blood magick sacrifice with incredible memetic power used to manipulate the fabric of Reality in the favor of a chosen few and their agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Can&#39;t believe I never saw this before.</p>

<p>This short film made me think of 9/11 as a giant global electro-shock treatment. The first BTTF film in 1985 is the phase where the patient talks over the symptoms with the doctors with all the usual warnings, the procedure itself (9/11 about half way 15 yrs later) is the shock itself, and the 2015 movie (30 yrs later) is the patient struggling to understand all the alarming after-effects of the &quot;therapy&quot; the doctors administered.</p>

<p>Something went wrong. The treatment has had unexplained side-effects, and the only way to understand and counteract the worrisome new condition of the patient (Earth and humanity) is to travel back in time, to some point prior to 9/11. </p>

<p>Thanks. I too was surprised when I stumbled upon this line of thinking/research, years after I first &#39;woke up&#39; to the 9/11 lies.</p>

<p>It seems as though someone or something would prefer us to waste our time discussing red herrings (thermite!) than the esoteric significance of the symbolism and synchronicities involved in the event we call 9/11.</p>

<p>Only those who can set aside their ego will be able to see, and then try to understand, what happened and is still happening to this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But I still struggle mightily that after all these years and all the ink spilled and time invested in understanding it, we are still very little advanced over the conspiratorial understanding many of us came to almost immediately, but were too shocked and frightened to stand up and insist we be heard.</p>

<p>So even if it was an elaborate &quot;ritual&quot; for lack of the right word, it was still planned, plotted, permitted, and covered up by - well by every person of power and prestige that might have clarified it, from politicians to scientists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about it &#39;sounds wrong&#39;?</p>

<p>One of the effects of engaging your mind into the 9/11 event is this &quot;resort to mythos&quot; to explain something that simply is not explicable.</p>

<p>The enormity of the event alone, and the exponentially greater impact on the course of history, the ripples, make it more of a Sphinx than a terror act.</p>

<p>I think the video presents aspects of the 9/11 riddle. There are many thousands more...</p>

Like it or not we sell war.  That is our fucking business and we make no apologies for it when it comes down to it.
There is no doubt that it is evil and it is colossally stupid to believe the lies that are told on its behalf.<br/>
The whole world over governments kill their own people.<br/>

Nothing lasts forever, nobody gets left alone and everyone has to know how to treat each other, so blame the will of humankind to grant us a fate fueling the arms race.

<p>Drowned out maybe, but still there. Starting in the 16th century with Great Power diplomacy (which failed at WWI), then to the League of Nations (which failed at WWIII) then to the United Nations (which fails consistently in real-time) the people of the earth have desired, demanded, yearned for such a reign of peaceful co-existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think 9/11 was the initiation of a deep state plan to form a new world order. It wasn&#39;t about the oil; the U.S. has plenty of oil reserves, and fracking only opened up more domestic oil flow. The real purpose was to rally support behind the homeland security act. Essentially it was the first publicly known mass surveillance agency able to act without a warrant. They used terrorists as a way to boost public support of such an invasive thing. Not much later, social media came out, starting with the first &#39;fad&#39; - MySpace; it went from Tom and a couple pals to millions of users almost exponentially. The initial plan was to use MySpace as the primary way to collect information, saving the NSA resources as well as generating extra taxpayer money. Somewhere along the line MySpace failed, and just a fast as it grew, it sank. Then another company steps out from the depths of nowhere: Facebook. FB was the perfection of the original false flag plan. Rather than having content stay property of the user, FB claimed rights to any and every thing on its site in the terms of use. Now the NSA had a corporation doing its dirty work, and every individual forfeited rights to their information by agreeing to the terms (ironically we all gave them permission). Facebook sells the info to advertisers and the government for pure profit, making investors and the gov profits as well. NSA creates a criminal database using the data, creating a profile of pretty much every person in the country. Once it was complete it was time to start the next phase, which is happening right now with the Cambridge analytical drama. This was the public reveal of the relationship. The idea from this point is to create more public acceptance and awareness of mass surveillance. Let&#39;s face it, there is no replacing Facebook at this point; It became too engraved in everyday life for America. Also going on now is seemingly more frequent mass shootings than ever, and the coverage of these sometimes show social media posts, emails, phone calls, etc. that could have prevented the violence. The goal is to get the public opinion swayed towards preemptive NSA action regarding these acts. While I think that would be great, I see the obvious snowball forming. First international terrorism, then domestic terrorism, and so on. The end goal is a crime free society, ritcheous in name, but just as dirty as the worst criminals. A corperate totalitarianism is forming, and the masses are being slowly convinced that it is right. Along with this, the wage gap will continue to rise. Historically speaking - when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, at some point revolution and reform usually happen. The kings are toppled from their thrones - in our day and age we have corperations and government acting as our lords and ladies, and the shadow kings stay out of the spotlight calling the shots. This time they are prepared for a resistance, and they have they technology to stop it before it starts. All of it together is false flag - the plan to make an untoppable ruling power, one to unite the people under manipulation, fear, and control. No one would dare stand up against such a power, and thus the ruling class establishes itself for future generations. From there it&#39;s speculation, the next step would be to unite the continent and eventually the world. To them, the idea of world unification is the ultimate ends to justify the means, but essentially it&#39;s a monarchy; it will be the start of a new dark age, and the ruling class will stunt technology in order to hold their positions as long as possible.</p>
