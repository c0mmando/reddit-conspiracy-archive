    <div class="md"><p>A major tenet of spying in the 21st century is the &quot;third party&quot; or &quot;stream of commerce&quot; notion. This idea says that when you use a service provider, you give up your rights to the data. This is a blatant end run around the Constitution and one that should infuriate everyone.</p>

<p>There is actually a case at the Supreme Court in this area where a business is trying to have the Court allow it to require what essentially amounts to a general waiver of Constitutional rights in contracts.</p>

<p>Budget Rent A Car has a contract provision that allows police to search a rented vehicle when the renter violates the <em>contract terms</em>. In other words, by renting a car, yo8u waive your Fourth Amendment rights. If that&#39;s not business hegemony, what could be?</p>

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts seems to love this idea. He went so far as to suggest that the fact that Budget owns the care alone is enough to require Constitutional waivers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the NSA records all phone calls, and yes, all of their spying going on is infinitely worse than we can imagine, since we have only seen a tiny slice of leaks
from the Snowden dox, and of what has been published, it has been heavily censored and redacted and staggered in a way to minimize the public&#39;s anger in reaction.</p>

<p>Voiceprints</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/19/voice-recognition-technology-nsa/">https://theintercept.com/2018/01/19/voice-recognition-technology-nsa/</a></p>

<p>NSA needs to record all phone calls so they can scan them all and create a unique voice print identifying every person on Earth, so that when Amir al Mumineen Caliph Ibrahim Abu Bakr Baghdadi calls Dominoes to order a pizza, the SIGINT system can detect him without manual labor by a human, and pop up an Alert List
in a tin hut in Creech Air Force Base for a Drone pilot to deliver Baghdadi&#39;s pizza with extra Hellfire missiles in 30 minutes or your money back.</p>

<p>XKEYSCORE + phone calls</p>

<p><a href="https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/AnalyzingMobileCellularDNIinXKeyScore2015-07-01_nsadocs_snowden_doc">https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/AnalyzingMobileCellularDNIinXKeyScore2015-07-01_nsadocs_snowden_doc</a></p>

<p>When Obama said &quot;nobody is listening to your phone calls&quot;, he was demonstrating a &quot;lack of candor&quot; like his man-servant Andy McCabe. While technically true--
there isn&#39;t a one-to-one mapping with one NSA pervert assigned to listen to each one of your phone calls.</p>

<p>What NSA is doing is much worse than that, because at least a manual labor effort would give us the serendipity of simple human error. </p>

<p>But when transcribing all phone calls is done with the brutal efficiency of AI and algorithms and machine learning, there is zero margin of error, and no room for
an on-the-spot judgement call.</p>

<p>VoiceRT, SPIRITFIRE and &quot;Voice Cuts&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone thinks of NSA listening to their phone calls as depicted in the Simpsons, with a stadium-sized open office of thousands of NSA analysts with headphone listening to all calls.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/5e/08/7a5e08059483a6b77a17e01248b6c5e4.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7a/5e/08/7a5e08059483a6b77a17e01248b6c5e4.jpg</a></p>

<p>From reading these Snowden dox, I have a hunch that NSA has approached the &quot;voice cut&quot; problem on an industrial scale like any ruthless multi-national enterprise corporation would solve it.</p>

<p>They broke the process down into discrete steps and outsourced it.</p>

<p>NSA&#39;s AI system is programmed to watch for certain hot key words, in certain contexts and under certain conditions. After any phone call voice cut dings all of the criteria, only then does a live person become involved. Then the AI system
flags that call for manual transcription, where a human will listen to it to evaluate what it means.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T BLARNEY</p>

<p><a href="https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/MobilityBusinessRecordsFlowSignificantlyIncreasesVolumeofRecordsDeliveredUnderBRFISA2015-08-15_nsadocs_snowden_doc">https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/MobilityBusinessRecordsFlowSignificantlyIncreasesVolumeofRecordsDeliveredUnderBRFISA2015-08-15_nsadocs_snowden_doc</a></p>

<p>AT&amp;T sends 1.1 billion phone calls to NSA per day.
&quot;Business Records for All Tangible Things&quot; yeeaa baby.
That was in 2011.
Imagine how big that number is now?</p>

<p>FASCIA</p>

<p><a href="https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/FASCIA2013-12-04_nsadocs_snowden_doc">https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/FASCIA2013-12-04_nsadocs_snowden_doc</a></p>

<p>FASCIA is one of NSA&#39;s massive databases of all phone calls. That slide shows
NSA is ingesting between 15-25 BILLION phone calls every single day. Because Greenwald and Pierre&#39;s Paid Pals are cucks, and because Barty G is a sinecure snitch and because Ewan Macaskill is a Redcoat, we have only seen a tiny number
of pages from slides about all these programs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really clear what the difference is between FASCIA and DISHFIRE and MARINA and MAINWAY and STORMBREW and BLARNEY and the dozens of seemingly redundant mega databases disguised within unexplained &quot;SCI&quot; subcompartment code words. How many damn different duplicate databases containing all phone calls does Joe Taxpayer gotta pay for NSA to run?</p>

<p>HLT</p>

<p><a href="https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/HowisHumanLanguage(HTL)Progressing%3F2015-05-05_nsadocs_snowden_doc">https://search.edwardsnowden.com/docs/HowisHumanLanguage(HTL)Progressing%3F2015-05-05_nsadocs_snowden_doc</a></p>

<p>NSA may record all phone calls on earth, but they can&#39;t yet listen to them. So they automated it. HLT is one of their programs for automating speech2txt, to converse voice data to text data, so that it can be indexed, searched, and scanned.</p>

<p>MYSTIC</p>

<p>NSA record 100% of phone calls in 5-6 Caribbean countries. Its program 
named MYSTIC records the Bahamas. Makes you wonder how all of the globalist elites doing money laundering through fake offshore shell corporations get away with it, considering NSA has <em>definitely</em> automated an AI system to count the number of turds they plunk each morning through their iPhone microphone. Makes you wonder if perhaps some Central Bankster Chairman wants a shadow economy with trillions in offshore money laundering to happen.</p>

<p>What value is recording all phone calls?</p>

<p>It gives NSA a bargaining chip to trade to our allies in exchange for whatever favors we want from them, because if you want the best population surveillance system that money can buy, you always buy American.</p>

<p>Like Turkey. NSA spies on the Kurds and the PKK&#39;s phone calls, then gives that data to Erdogan so he can have them all executed. Then Erdogan is a happy little
dictator, since NSA helped him purge his political opponents, and hopefully Erdogan will be more cooperative with us when we want him to keep invading Syria and to support Zion and to antagonize Russia and to continue sending millions of illegal refugees into Europe to complete the Kalergi Plan and genocide all of the native white Europeans from their own countries.</p>
