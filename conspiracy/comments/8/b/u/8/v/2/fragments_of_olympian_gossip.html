        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;re like me, and have gone deep enough down the rabbit hole, you&#39;ll eventually come to the realization that modern astrophysics and cosmology is pseudoscience. It all started with a pesky little experiment by Michelson and Morley. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>from wiki: It compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether (&quot;aether wind&quot;). The result was negative, in that the expected difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether, and the speed at right angles, was found not to exist; this result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent aether theory, and initiated a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which rules out a stationary aether.[A 1] The experiment has been referred to as &quot;the moving-off point for the theoretical aspects of the Second Scientific Revolution&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, light behaves like a wave, and waves are not a thing, it&#39;s what a thing does. For example, if you go in the middle of a pool and splash your hand, you&#39;ll see the waves. But the waves themselves are nothing, they are oscillation of water. Same with sound. Sound itself is not a thing, but air vibration. in order for you to see light in a vacuum, there must exist something that the light goes through, and that was ether. It&#39;s all around you, it&#39;s everywhere. If you asked a fish about water, he is going to reply; what is water? From Plato to Kelvin, Newton to Tesla. Everyone agreed it exists. </p>

<p>Now, Michelson–Morley went about to determine the speed at which the earth moves around the sun, using lights, mirrors and prisms. They  should have measured about 30KM/s, but the results were NONE. Now, they will tell you that the MM experiment was to prove ether doesn&#39;t exist but is absolute  bullshit. That is NOT what they set out to prove. As i said, their job was to measure this estimated 30KM/s and the results was null/zero. That meant the earth is not actually moving. This was a pesky problem. How could it be? earth is not moving? a few years later, Einstein came up with his special theory of relativity in 1905 which basically said, speed of light is constant (C), and there is no ether! tadaaaa. fixed the problem! </p>

<p>Everything was fine until a gentleman name Georges Sagnac did the MM experiment but on a rotating table, and when he rotated the table, he measured interference patterns. That proved ether existed after all. Then it took 10 years for Einstein to concoct the General theory of relativity to deal with that problem. With it, it opened up a bunch of paradoxes and it was an assault on human intellect. suddenly you have black holes, and dark matter and dark energy and slowing down time, all to make the mathematics work. If you are interested in that, read a book by Herbert Dingle (free pdf online) called Science at the cross roads. Dingle used to be the out most authority on General theory of relativity, but later in his life, he realized it was all bullshit but he couldn&#39;t get his papers published. He used to be Einstein&#39;s  #1, but that&#39;s a whole other can of worms. I encourage everyone to read that book if they are more interested in this subject. </p>

<p>Which brings me to Fragments of Olympian Gossip. It was a poem, written by Nicola Tesla. I&#39;m sure he needs no introduction here but he is the father of modern day technology. From Alternating current, to Radio. From X-ray to induction motor. He is the man who lit up NY by harnessing the power of Niagara falls. He literally brought the human race out of the dark, and of course he believed ether existed and like Dingle, thought Einstein was a fucking Crank.  I&quot;ll try to break this poem down as much as I can, because it&#39;s a bit confusing at first read.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Olympian_Gossip">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Olympian_Gossip</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>While listening on my cosmic phone
I caught words from the Olympus blown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>basically saying he is eavesdropping on the gods. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A newcomer was shown around;
That much I could guess, aided by sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>he is talking about his good friend Lord Kelvin who had died just recently and is now with the gods of science. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s Archimedes with his lever
Still busy on problems as ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone is showing Kelvin around and is pointing out Archimedes who is still busy doing work. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says: matter and force are transmutable
And wrong the laws you thought immutable.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is the chorus of the poem. Saying Matter and energy are one in the same (einstonian thought) and they are breaking laws of nature which are immutable by claiming such absurdities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Below, on Earth, they work at full blast
And news are coming in thick and fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of stuff is happening on earth the gods are pointing out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest tells of a cosmic gun.
To be pelted is very poor fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he is talking about Marconi, who claimed they were going to make ray gun and how thats is probably not a good thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are wary with so much at stake,
Those beggars are a pest—no mistake.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not fully sure what he means here. But i think he is calling them pests. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renown
And turned your great science upside down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we know who is showing his friend (Kelvin) around up there. It&#39;s Issac. and Kelvin is saying that they are shitting all over his science. because Newtonian physics didn&#39;t work with cosmic bodies, maybe because they are not what we think?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now a long haired crank, Einstein by name,
Puts on your high teaching all the blame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>pretty self explanatory </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says: matter and force are transmutable
And wrong the laws you thought immutable.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hmmm</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am much too ignorant, my son,
For grasping schemes so finely spun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newton is being sarcastic and saying, I guess I&#39;m too dumb to figure out such BS. (schemes so finely spun aka Bullcrap) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My followers are of stronger mind
And I am content to stay behind,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he is saying that people will figure out the truth in the long run, and i can just stay back and let people with 2 brain cells to rub together to figure it out on their own. (Sad) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I failed, but I did my best,
These masters of mine may do the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he is being lethargic here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come, Kelvin, I have finished my cup.
When is your friend Tesla coming up.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is asking Kelvin lets keep walking, and by the way, when is Tesla going to die? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh, quoth Kelvin, he is always late,
It would be useless to remonstrate.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kelvin says, oh... he is always late! lol no point in protesting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then silence—shuffle of soft slippered feet—</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then they walk away quietly as Newton shows more of whats up there to Kelvin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I knock and—the bedlam of the street.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Tesla stops listening and walks out on to the NY busy street. </p>

<p>Now, you are right in saying modern cosmology is bull. The fact they have to resort to fudge factors such as Dark Matter and Energy is indicative something is wrong (the problem lies in assuming we&#39;re an arbitrary moving point in the universe, rather than being basically the center and stationary).</p>

<p>Then magnets bend space time, I mean.. the energy has to come from somewhere!</p>

<p>Well the spin of the atomes is fixed in a direction, decreasing the energy of the total system (magnet), so the energy is geting from there: the diference in free energy due to the arangement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you are pretty much completely wrong, but its good you are seeking out truth using Tesla. </p>

<p>Tesla is referencing his enlightenment with this poem. Pretty much all of Tesla’s work is devoted to preaching enlightenment, true enlightenment that is... not the shitty fallen angel Kundalini version. </p>

<p>Cosmic Phone = Mind in a meditative state/astral form
Olympus Blown = finding the wind, aka sound, from the Gods which leads to one becoming a ‘God’
Newcomer Shown Around = Tesla being introduced to Olympus, the ‘realm of Gods’ aka the Enlightened, PLUS the next line
...aided by Sound = metaphor for the process of enlightenment which requires visualizing all of creation from the Aether which happens by sound which first generates a 2D circle
(In the beginning was THE WORD, sound)
Archimedes Lever = Circle Pun to clarify the previous lines
... problems = Arch cattle problem aka cows in a herd for the Sun God - this is a jab at religions which are all Sun worship, specifically Judeo-Christians and their 144k chosen golden cows
Matter/Laws Transmutable = Tesla knew everything was made of Light. Matter which is just tightly spinning waves of visible Light and Force which is the Magnetism produced from the ‘dark’ particle form of a Light wave. </p>

<p>I can continue if you want?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind Tesla was not a poet or well spoken.  His rhyme scheme is obviously atrocious, but this makes it easy to discern what he wanted to say versus what he needed to rhyme. 
Why is he exchanging letters with a Nazi Poet?
Maybe poets know something about enlightenment...
Or maybe because Vril had something to do with Tesla’s work and there is a hidden meaning in the poem...</p>

<p>“Below, on Earth... coming in thick and fast.”
= joking about Tesla’s Teleforce/Ray Gun where the news used “blast, thick, fast” for headlines regarding the Tunguska Blast
^ v
“The latest tells of a cosmic gun.”
^ v
To be pelted is very poor fun.
= again, you are ‘pelted’ by Cosmic Rays
“We are wary with so much at stake”
= Tesla team wary to share technology
“Those beggars are a pest—no mistake.&quot;
= double pun, US Govt begging for his tech and ‘no mistake’ is for religious people begging for salvation instead of saving themselves</p>

<p>“Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renown
And turned your great science upside down.
= Newton wrote a couple personal letters to Locke about an ‘anomaly’ he found when polarizing Light. He first did this with a lantern (dimmed) and saw the image of the flame was reversed (upside down). Newton himself was trying to understand the working theory behind a certain cults ‘torch in cave’ ritual
“Now a ... high teaching all the blame.”
= implying Newtons ‘high teaching’ is from God aka Truth proven by Light</p>

<p>—This is voiced by ‘God’
&quot;I am much too ignorant, my son,
For grasping schemes so finely spun.”
= Lots of puns - son pun for Sun, finely spun for Light spinning to create matter, also God not grasping his own creation
“My followers are of stronger mind
And I am content to stay behind,”
= true followers of God find him through Truth, Intellect, and Reason. He will stay behind and watch over stupid humans until they figure it out. 
“Perhaps I failed, but I did my best,
These masters of mine may do the rest.”
=‘Ascended Masters’ spreading the word because God said that he would not come to man after Christ
“Come, Kelvin, I have finished my cup.
When is your friend Tesla coming up.&quot;
= So punny, God talks with Thomson over HOT tea. Tesla pays homage to William Thomson, thermodynamics guru </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, quoth Kelvin, he is always late,
It would be useless to remonstrate.&quot;
= focus is on remonstrate, double pun. God cant force Tesla to die and ascend, but also remonstrate means “to show” and God does not have ‘to show’ Tesla the creation from aether because he has already visualized it. </p>

<p>Then silence—shuffle of soft slippered feet—
I knock and—the bedlam of the street.
= we find out Tesla was listening to them all along, silence occurs as they cease convo and Tesla begins to exit meditation. Soft slippered feet alludes to how quiet this ‘voice of Olympus’ is within the mind. Knock, a sound on a door, ever hear of ‘praying in your closet and shutting the door’? Bedlam reveals this truth, he ‘knocks on the door’ exiting his meditation and returning to the sounds of uproar in the busy streets of the physical world. </p>

<p>Nikola Tesla, Novice 
= this couldn’t be any more obvious unless Tesla signed it ‘Adept’</p>

<p>Kelvin is talking to Isaac. telling him a long haired crank by the name of Einstein is blaming your teaching for his stupid theory. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not talking about Einstein, he&#39;s talking specifically about Newton and his &#39;high teaching&#39;. Surely you see right there where it says &#39;high teaching&#39;! That is the only part he is addressing. God save us from fools that think they are brilliant...</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin is talking to Isaac and he is saying: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>they dimmed (dumbed down) your renown, (your renowned findings) and turned your great science upside down ( they flipped your teaching on it&#39;s head, thats what relativity does! Thats why it&#39;s incompatible with newtonian physics! Do you understand?</p>

<p>Now a crazy hair douchebag, i&#39;ll name him, his name is Einstein, blames you for the fact that his theory is incompatible with his.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sentence contains clauses. You can talk about them without regard to other clauses within the same sentence.</p>

<p>Newton has a high teaching. Einstein blames it for something.</p>

<p>One can talk about the high teaching without talking about Einstein. You may not understand that, but even so there is no need to get all ridiculous about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mental gymnastics, huh?
“Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics,”
Newton considered himself a theologian and natural philosopher, or what we now call occultists. Secret Occult Societies dont exist though, right?</p>

<p>The vision ‘anomaly’ Newton described became:
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpuscular_theory_of_light</a>
“Newton&#39;s corpuscular theory was an elaboration of his view of reality as interactions of material points through forces. Note Albert Einstein&#39;s description of Newton&#39;s conception of physical reality”
If you want to learn something go ahead and read how Einstein proceeds to explain why he thinks Newton’s defining of reality is wrong.</p>

<p>The ‘...’ is not omission, I didnt feel like pasting the verse in its entirety because its just mocking the fool that is Einstein. 
“Long haired crank” truly words of endearment. 
“Puts on your high teaching(,)all the blame”
Reading comprehension is hard, especially when the source is a scientist writing poetry. </p>

<p>Einstein blames the ‘faults’ in Newtonian Physics based on his opinion that Newton’s definition of gravity is wrong. Newton’s teaching is “high” by Tesla’s account because gravity doesnt exist, Newton knew this and as such defined the force as magnetism. If you disagree with this you have no business quoting or researching Tesla. </p>

<p>Intellectual dishonesty... lmao. Read a fucking book. You are currently lost to the world and your ancestors weep at your arrogance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only if all else fails. Usually the theory is tweaked somehow to save it. That&#39;s why we have black holes, inflation, dark matter... And that&#39;s all fine, but it&#39;s easy to see why some people are quicker to reject current theory than others when effectively the goalposts keep being moved.</p>
