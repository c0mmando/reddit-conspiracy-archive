    <div class="md"><p>I know it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;m just showing that your reasoning can be faulty. Obviously if the Earth is flat plane, and other planets aren&#39;t, that would imply that the Earth was either made to be flat by aliens; perhaps they terraformed what was once a planet. Or perhaps it implies that the world is literally some kind of infinite plane, which would mean that it was created with some kind of cosmic powers, or that this is some kind of simulation program. Or maybe there is literally a dome above us, which would mean this place was created by a god, or again by aliens wishing to trap us here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your question doesn&#39;t show that my reasoning can be faulty. </p>

<p>this answer just creates more questions </p>

<ol>
<li>Who were the Aliens?
2 Why did they do it?</li>
<li>Where is the evidence for those Aliens?</li>
<li>Where is solid, tangible, verifiable evidence for any Aliens? </li>
<li>Why would they terraform a planet for us?</li>
<li>Why would anyone want us trapped here?</li>
</ol>

<p>... those questions can pretty much be asked again (with minor changes) regarding the &quot;beings with cosmic powers&quot; and the &quot;god&quot; explanations </p>

<p>I honestly think some people are so fucking desperate to believe everything is a conspiracy they will grasp at straws... </p>

<p>I saw one which implied Australia wasn&#39;t real and didn&#39;t exist.. now as someone who was born and raised in Australia, I tried to tell them they were mistaken but they just REFUSED to listen to reason they NEEDED it to be true, It was like I was trying to destroy their whole world view lol! </p>

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li>Who were the Aliens? 2 Why did they do it?</li>
</ol>

<p>I dunno. Reptilians? Greys? To suck of dry of our energy? Maybe they&#39;re higher dimensional beings that can harvest emotions on an ethereal level. Maybe this place is designed to make us suffer. There is quite a lot of pain in this world. Or maybe they want us on a physical level, for food. Maybe they eat humans. Where are all of these missing children going? Maybe Earth is a farm for them, in the same way humans slaughter animals everyday. </p>

<ol>
<li>Where is the evidence for those Aliens?</li>
</ol>

<p>Uhh UFO sightings? Ancient artifacts depicting aliens.</p>

<ol>
<li>Where is solid, tangible, verifiable evidence for any Aliens?</li>
</ol>

<p>There is none and you know that. Although I myself have witnessed a black spherical UFO flying waaay high up in the sky. This of course could be a US secret military vehicle though.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why would they terraform a planet for us?</li>
</ol>

<p>To keep us here. For energy? For meat? Research?</p>

<ol>
<li>Why would anyone want us trapped here?</li>
</ol>

<p>To eat us. To study us. Ethereal energy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you were getting trolled. </p>

<p>Also if you&#39;re interested in this stuff (you&#39;re probably not), I would look into the Saturn-Moon matrix. Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>UFO sightings don&#39;t count, they are not solid tangible verifiable evidence of Aliens, our memories are so flawed it can&#39;t be trusted as evidence alone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt you think you&#39;ve witnessed what you say you have BUT UFO doesn&#39;t mean Alien.. they have Drones now! you know? </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I was being trolled as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look up the Saturn-Moon matrix!</p>

<p>also, the numbers thing was quite easy dude!

<p>ALL I originally asked was &quot;Why are all the other planets we can observe round while ours is flat?&quot;</p>

<p>You replied with &quot;Maybe it isn&#39;t a planet&quot; I&#39;m assuming referring to earth (you haven&#39;t answered, In fact you have failed to answer any question I&#39;ve asked)</p>

<p>So then I asked &quot;what would lead you to think this? what hard, credible evidence would you have to back this up?&quot; - I am asking for you to back up what you said! I NEVER stated earth was a planet, the ONLY thing I&#39;ve done is ask questions! you have FAILED to answer ANY of these questions and instead want to go around some rhetorical merry-go-round, asking me the questions I&#39;ve asked YOU while NOT answering anything at all. </p>

<p>Which requires you to ASSume earth is also a planet. so, we had to take a step back. What solid evidence do you have that earth is planet. </p>

<p>no, we have to take a step back. What makes you think earth is just like Mars and Venus but the only difference is that it has life and atmosphere? And no, I don&#39;t wanna CGI image from nasa, of earth or mars! The best consumer telescope just shows a tiny light in the sky. I know, maybe i should be a Jesuit so i can get access to those good telescopes huh?</p>

<p>which ASSumes earth is a planet and a spinning ball. so your loaded question was full of ASSumptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re correct, when I asked that original question I assumed that a flat-earthier thought earth was a planet! (I guess, evidently.. they don&#39;t?)

<p>YOU posed that earth isn&#39;t a planet at all, to which I asked &quot;what would lead you to think this? what hard, credible evidence would you have to back this up?&quot;</p>

<p>up till this point you have bogged this topic down in misdirection and deflection trying to poke holes at the questions I&#39;ve asked rather than simply tell me WHY you think earth isn&#39;t a planet AND give me the credible, tangible, VERIFIABLE evidence to support YOUR claim that earth isn&#39;t a planet.</p>

<p>It would be SO MUCH FUCKING EASIER for you to just supply the VERIFIABLE, CREDIBLE, TANGIBLE evidence to support YOUR claim that earth isn&#39;t a planet, rather than go in merry-go-rounds here over nothing.</p>

<p>and the &quot;last chance&quot; line, was simply because I grow tired of this conversation and unless you can balls up and supply evidence to support this whole &quot;earth isn&#39;t a planet&quot; thing, then I see no reason this should continue.</p>

<p>Right you are. We are going in circles. You have to prove to me that earth, this place we live on, with bees, whales, mountains, rivers, trees, cats and rats... is equivelnet to that tiny light in the sky we see at night, except that place is has a hotter climate.

    <div class="md"><p>How could air ever meet vacuum? How could the vacuum not pull out the air? Gravity?</p>

<p>Gravity comes from a word meaning &quot;heavy&quot;, simply to mean heavy things fall. Large objects attracting each other has only been &quot;observed&quot; by a single man in the Cavendish experiment where we&#39;re supposed to take that man&#39;s word that he totally saw two big balls move toward each other in his shed. Everything else about outer space gravity forming balls that go around each other is theoretical at best and blind faith at worst. If gravity is fake then orbits aren&#39;t possible. Look into satellites, really look into it, and see for yourself if you think they&#39;re real. Everything a satellite can do can be done by towers, cables, or balloons. GPS: tower triangulation. Satellite pictures: taken from high altitude planes. And so on. My hypothesis is that there are no satellites, because orbits are not possible. But what <em>is</em> really beyond could really only be a guess.</p>

<p>For one, they could be hiding vast continents from us, keeping us inside a prison area with limited resources and an economy based on scarcity, while &quot;they&quot; the powers that be, could live in that civilization beyond comfortably and with unlimited resources. All they would have to do is wrap a small map on a ball and forbid anyone from venturing out into Antarctica. This is true: you cannot explore Antarctica. If this is all true, you are stuck here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to get back to you with links (you could search youtube or google) but several private expeditions speecifically set out to explore Antarctica from a flat earth perspective have gone missing under mysterious circumstances, their well-stocked boat found with the men gone without a trace. In the 1930s a woman set out to do the same, her snowmobile found without her. There was another expedition not long ago, Scandinavian man whose name I can&#39;t remember. These were very well prepared voyages by experienced and fit crews. </p>

<p>The Antarctic Treaty is militarily enforced, the coadtline guarded by patrols. There is only a <em>very</em> small and highly controlled tourist area you can go to; civilians cannot wander far from there. If you manage to get by these defenses, the prison perimter if you will, my guess is you&#39;d be &quot;disappeared.&quot; We all may as well get used to the fact that if this is all true, there is no escape. If you haven&#39;t put any thought into that, then you&#39;re more of an optimist than me.</p>

<p>There are no bases. However, if something is prohibited, while you may imagine they will ask nicely that you don&#39;t wander off the path, I imagine they would probably try to be a little more firm, with a little more oomph behind their authority. But maybe I&#39;m more of a realist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The present Treaty shall not prevent the use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purpose</p>

<p>Everything they say they do in Antarctica is claimed to be for science, so as you just quoted, there will always be military personnel allowed.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t imagine.  KNOW.</p>

<p>Article 1 says (which you edited out in your response to me) that ANY measures of a military nature is prohibited.  That would include that &quot;little more oomph&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you take for evidence? All of Einsteins theories are fake for example, they only work to further the illusion trap, anybody who accepts Einstein just because of the authorities tell them to is taking all the wrong proofs as valid.  I can answer your questions because I have obsessively tried to figure out if the earth was really round, I have been surprised with the findings myself cause I dont care where it takes me, I want to know what is really out there and I accept the ones hiding it have all the power, always do your own research and make your own proofs math or otherwise, dont believe anybody, I can tell you what I have come up with, you can proove it or disproove it yourself, I have done my work and Im willing to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is not like I saw it on a book or video and suddenly believed it, when I hear something outrageous like &quot;some old tree species were able to think and talk&quot; &quot;modern humans have existed for more than a million years&quot; or &quot;saturn used to be as close to us as the moon&quot; I register the thought and move along, it is only when in the research the crazy think pops up many times that you start to believe it, and then through much confirmation from many little references it becomes a belief... In the tree example, I bet you have never considered smart trees as a possibility, but  if you think about it now you can come up with dozens of &quot;trees with a face&quot; In movies and stories, then you can go deeper and deeper until you find &quot;proof&quot; that satisfies you, or maybe you find none and forget me because you think Im crazy, but if you look into the things I tell you, you will get to believe after digging</p>

<p>Do you feel the electrical impulses in your nerves? Do you feel viruses invading your cells? Can you feel a 1/1000th change in barometer? Ever been in a plane? How were you able to sleep moving that quickly, its almost like it isnt moving at all. </p>

<p>We can detect the Earths rotation using gyroscopes senors focault pendulums, coriolis observations etc. </p>

<p>Again you arent getting the physics. In a plane you are moving 600+mph and so is the air in the plane with you. Thats why you dont feel it. All you feel is acceleration or deceleration. </p>

<p>In this example you me the atmosphere are all moving at the same speed. We are all in the plane cabin together. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is patently not true. I work for a company that makes MEMs based sensors, your lack of knowledge is showing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>water that is not behaving like water on a spinning ball</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How should it behave? You dont even understand acceleration so why should I trust your opinion on how water should work? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>obvious movement of the sky objects,</p>

<p>Which supports a globe Earth and a heliocentric model. </p>

<p>Just look at the orbit of Mars, that makes zero sense in any model but a heliocentric one. </p>

<p>Why would you feel motion of the Earth?  You feel changes in velocity, not speed.  I can pour a softdrink out of a can while I&#39;m going 500+ MPH over land in a plane.  There are people that sleep going 500+ MPH in a plane.  You don&#39;t feel speed.  You feel velocity change.  And there&#39;s no reason to feel velocity change while sitting still on land.</p>

<p>For me, actual evidence of a flat Earth.  Like showing a photograph of the entire thing.  Or, if you can&#39;t get that high because of the firmament, showing evidence of the firmament.  Take measurements of it.  Find where the firmament intersects the Earth.</p>

<p>If you cannot do that for some reason, such as an international military, show evidence of this international military.  Show people that have tried to reach the firmament but have been stopped by this military.  Who is employed by this military?  Who heads it up?  Do they have a website?  Do soldiers have LinkedIn accounts?</p>

<p>Just...well, ANYTHING other than YouTube videos getting basic science and math wrong.</p>

<li><p>It&#39;s still somewhat of a mystery what lies beyond Antarctica, the infamous Admiral
Byrd TV interview has him claiming there is another landmass. The wall meme is kind of ridiculous, although there are large parts of Antarctica with a ice shelf and a steep cliff, some of the coast line just looks like a Arctic beach. The most important thing is Antarctica has the highest average elevation of any continent, and that&#39;s what is required to contain the oceans. The Antarctic treaty, and the general interest in Antarctica during WWII shared by the Nazis and other powers is very interesting, as well as the history of Antarctica and the expeditions by Captain Cook and Admirial Byrd in operation High Jump/Deep freeze. Antarctica is much more deep a subject than many people would assume off hand. </p></li>
<li><p>Like someone else mentioned, the deepest that has been drilled is 8-9mi. in Russia. The theories about the core and the make up of the earth are primarily determined by what the gravitational calculations require the mass of the earth to be and guesswork as to what the elements should be to create that total mass. It&#39;s essentially just guessing.</p></li>
<li><p>There very well may not be space at all, many theorize a firmament like described in ancient religions and the Bible. They may have tried to break the barrier in operation starfish and operation fishbowl (operation domino). The amount of evidence for NASA and Russia/China space program fakery is outstanding when you dig into it and stop suspending your disbelief.</p></li>
<li><p>I favor the suppression of the spiritual and replacing with atheistic random meaningless scientism. If people are depressed and demotivated by a shitty world view everything is random and they aren&#39;t special then they are easier to control and oppress. You also got financial incentives to embezzle funds from NASA and military programs, sell people sci-fi media in books, TV shows, movies. The Jesuit origins of the big band and standard cosmological model are interesting, Copernicus&#39; connections with the church, the Big Bang was conceived by a preist, the Jesuits brought ball earth theory to the Chinese in 1700s and prior to that they believed the earth was flat like every other culture on earth did in ancient times. </p></li>

Once I got past that initial aversion and sunk my teeth in it was astounding how much there was to it.

    <div class="md"><p>How could air ever meet vacuum? How could the vacuum not pull out the air? Gravity?</p>

<p>Gravity comes from a word meaning &quot;heavy&quot;, simply to mean heavy things fall. Large objects attracting each other has only been &quot;observed&quot; by a single man in the Cavendish experiment where we&#39;re supposed to take that man&#39;s word that he totally saw two big balls move toward each other in his shed. Everything else about outer space gravity forming balls that go around each other is theoretical at best and blind faith at worst. If gravity is fake then orbits aren&#39;t possible. Look into satellites, really look into it, and see for yourself if you think they&#39;re real. Everything a satellite can do can be done by towers, cables, or balloons. GPS: tower triangulation. Satellite pictures: taken from high altitude planes. And so on. My hypothesis is that there are no satellites, because orbits are not possible. But what <em>is</em> really beyond could really only be a guess.</p>
