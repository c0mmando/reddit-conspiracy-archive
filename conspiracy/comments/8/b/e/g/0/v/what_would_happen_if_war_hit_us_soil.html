        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>WW3 Conspiracy theories always seemed kind of loony to me. Sure, bad things were happening and the elites were abusing their power. But now it feels closer than ever. The mainstream media has absolutely no regard for the truth anymore. It was an obvious false flag chemical weapons attack, even General Mattis admits to that. But the war drums stay a bangin from all of the usual suspects. </p>

<p>Donald Trump is an absolute disgrace of a human being. Not too long ago he was tweeting and speaking out against stupid wars. Now the guy is literally willing to risk WW3 over some minor chemical weapons attack. Clearly proving that he is absolutely owned by rich bankers, defense contractors, gas companies, and the heartless Zionist war machine. Russia has said they will retaliate if the US strikes in Syria. They probably would not hit the US mainland first, but things can escalate and they do indeed have the technology and the support to carry out an attack on US mainland. </p>

<p>This leads me to wonder. What would War in the USA look like? Crumbling infrastructure? Dead bodies strewn everywhere? Increase in violence and theft? Strain on resources? Martial Law? Total societal collapse? 
Perhaps a blessing in disguise though. Theres a lot of problems with modern society. Some People are spending 10 hours a day on social media, or looking at an electronic screen. The family unit has become weak. People put acquaintances over family. People think smoking and drinking is cool and hip. People are jerking off to porn way too much. You know perhaps a large scale conflict could completely reverse all of this degeneracy. Communities would get tighter. Families would get tighter. People would stick together and they would start acting in the best interests of humanity. Men would become strong again. </p>

<p>I donâ€™t know, it sure is horrible to think about. Makes me sick to my stomach thinking about all the dead children because our leaders are stupid psychopaths. And this suffering, already occurring around the world, may be closer to our doorstep than many people want to believe. </p>

<p>I have already taken the black pill. I think about all the people that tried to fight against this nonsense. I tip my cap to Ron Paul. Ken Okeefe. Jesse Ventura. Alex Jones before he sold out. And Tucker Carlson grew some balls today and condemned the war mongering. Hats off to him. But even with all of this opposition, none of it has worked and the show goes on. The same people in power yesterday and 15 years ago are in power today. Thereâ€™s nothing we can do about it except pray to God. </p>

<p>So, any thoughts on WW3 in the US? </p>

Its somehow become ingrained in our culture. I try not to cast judgment one way or the other, I have also had those thoughts and the freedom we have out here breeds a different way of thinking. To each their own.
 Personally I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll see it in my lifetime. </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve asked my friends once or twice, &quot;hey, you know that global collapse that&#39;s coming right around the corner...how bummed would you be if it DIDN&#39;T happen in your lifetime?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh man. Super bummed.&quot;</p>

<p>Actually quite a bit lower, if you&#39;re going purely on numbers. The average in the USA per annum is about 50.</p>
