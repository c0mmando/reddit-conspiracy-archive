        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all of the conspiracies and scandals surrounding Hillary, as well as the fact that so many of her private emails were made public and opened up to the scrutiny of her political enemies, how has she not even been charged yet?</p>

<p>Republicans control the entire government at the moment, don’t they? They definitely control congress, the presidency, and the judiciary.</p>

<p>Many of her alleged crimes are more than a decade old too, so it seems like there would have been plenty of time to put together a case against her.</p>

<p>I’ve heard so much about her here that I’m starting to come around to the idea that she really is as bad as everyone has been saying, but just like I wouldn’t condemn Trump for Russia collusion without any evidence, I’d rather not condemn Hillary without any evidence.</p>

<p>I just tried looking for “evidence of Hillary Clinton crimes”, but couldn’t find anything besides opinion pieces from obviously biased sources.</p>

<p>If you have any evidence of crimes Hillary has actually committed, please share them here. Or if you have records of any crimes she’s been charged with, please share.</p>

<p>This should be really easy, since apparently it’s common knowledge what a criminal she is at this point. </p>

<p><strong>Edit - I’m not looking to get into yet another Hillary debate with this thread. If you have any evidence, post it and I appreciate it, thanks.</strong></p>

<p>I’m having a hard time finding evidence of any actual crimes though, and a wiki isn’t really a source.</p>

<p>If you have something real, post it and I’ll read it, but I’m not seeing anything on that wiki that’s evidence of crimes she’s committed.</p>

<p>Hey, I can find you some really good rants by Glenn Beck. Oh, and Tomi Lahren has some good rants. I&#39;m sure those are just as good as evidence.</p>

<p>They were good enough for millions of conservatives! Why shouldn&#39;t they be good enough for a court of law?</p>

<p>Sometimes I think we are too picky about what constitutes actual evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Isn&#39;t it enough that the entire conservative movement hates Hillary and has been ranting about her for 25 years? That ought to be worth at least a couple of convictions!!</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that the same people who keep shouting about how serious its getting for Trump when someone takes a plea deal...can at the same time completely dismiss any possibility of serious crime when Hillary&#39;s aids and lawyers got immunity deals...</p>

<p>Something here doesn&#39;t add up....does it?</p>

<p>Always a big fucking deal when anyone associated with Trump &quot;might&quot; be getting an immunity deal because they&#39;re going to flip..</p>

She may have done this by accident but the law does not care if there wan an &#39;intent&#39; to do it or not. If you are responsible for that data and it is released you have committed a criminal act. Again doesn&#39;t matter if it was done on purpose or by an accident.</p>

<p>Comey job was to provide facts of the case to the DoJ. Instead he decided to choose to not prosecute Hillary, something that he does not have the power to do. In his speech he stated her crimes then said they are not pressing charges. You are innocent until proven guilty but that speech he made sounded like they had a lot of proof that she was guilty. How and why Comey f*cked up so bad I do not know. </p>

<p>Gosh. You know, it&#39;s funny, because I&#39;ve been closely following right wing news and media for a long time, and I can&#39;t ever recall any conservatives asking for actual evidence! It was always enough to throw around a bunch of accusations! Empty, fact-free accusations were good enough for tens of millions of Republicans, they should be good enough for you! Who do you think you are to get so hung up on something like &quot;evidence?!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She’s a boogie man who the Right paints as incredibly corrupt and mired in illegal behavior, even though they’ve never presented sufficient evidence to have her charged or convicted of anything.  The right wing formula mandates the creation of an enemy who the pundits can hold up to their uneducated and uninformed as THE person who is responsible for the changing state of affairs.  </p>

<p>Hillary made an easy target when she rose to prominence as head of the Clinton administration’s push for healthcare reform.  Limbaugh and the like recognized her for what she is - an unlikeable person with a lot of power who had the gall to not be a man, which signifies yet another change coming down the pike for the salt of the earth men who expect their wives to raise the children and have dinner on the table by 6.  Limbaugh and other media figures seized on all of that and then started presenting speculation and innuendo as fact.  Then they kept after it for 25 years.   Lots of speculation that she’s a criminal has caused a lot of people to believe she’s a criminal.  Perception has become reality, even though she’s never been charged or convicted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posts like this are the posts I despise the most. The Op is obviously a Hillary supporter, but they take on the guise of being anti hillary in order to manipulate others to their position. He pretends to be looking for evidence against Hillary when he is actually attempting to discredit the info when he receives it. By pretending to be neutral it gives hus voice credibility. It is a well known fact that Hillary sent and received classified and top secret documents on her unsecure, personal server. That act violates the Espionage act. Intent of a crime is not required under the Espionage act. It was purposely written so that carelessness is indictable. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not alone.  Every family has one, they all think they&#39;re very clever and unique just like OP, and so anymore most folks just look right through them.</p>

<p>You see, the D in DNC stands for &quot;D&quot;uplicity.  They think they&#39;re really smart though, and that no one has their number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you so sure I’m a Hillary supporter? Because I don’t buy into the religious dogma against her promoted by the alt-right? Because I want to see some actual evidence?</p>

<p>I don’t really like Hillary, but it’s obvious she has been made into a right-wing bogeyman and is being used as a scapegoat whenever something goes wrong for Trump. It’s also pretty obvious that there isn’t any actual evidence for these so called crimes, or she would be in jail considering Donald Trump is president and the right controls congress and the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>But since you don’t have any real evidence, since there is none, you’ve decided instead to engage in the most obvious strawman / ad hominem by screeching “ur a Hillary supporter!” as if that matters when the fact is that none of you have yet been able to say...</p>

<p><strong>she’s guilty of this crime and here is the evidence for it</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you&#39;re Hillary supporter because you ignored the part of my post where I discuss the evidence. In the Emails the FBI collected that were sent and recieved by Hillary were classified and top secret documents. They were sent over an unsecured server. This is a violation of the espionage act.  And everything I just stated is a fact not an opinion. All of that can be found in a simple google search. The reason she wasn&#39;t indicted was because Comey&#39;s boss Loretta Lynch didn&#39;t want her to be prosecuted and neither did Lynch&#39;s boss Obama. As they are of the same party as Hillary. And she hasn&#39;t been indicted since is because Comey gave immunity to all the key players as well as destroyed the evidence. Such as the laptops with the info. This makes it nearly impossible for someone to prosecute. All the evidence, you need to the fact that Hillary having committed a crime is Comey&#39;s announcement that Hillary wouldn&#39;t be charged. He doesn&#39;t say Hillary didn&#39;t commit a crime, but states that no prosecuter would move forward with charges because their was no intent. </p>

<p>Not seeing the crime here. Sure she fucked up and ya she should have lost her job or something, but not seeing any evidence of an actual crime. </p>

<p>Also it’s funny that this whole thing, the political attack on Hillary made possible by the hacking of her emails, always comes back to the emails.</p>

<p>Because that’s apparently all there is. People act like she’s a career criminal with a long list of crimes, but at the end of the day all they can point to is her mishandling of classified information, of which she is definitely not the only person who’s guilty. </p>

<p>In fact I think I remember a recent instance of a very high ranking government official leaking classified information to other countries to the dismay of our allies.</p>

<p>Anyways:</p>

<p><strong>what is the crime?</strong></p>

<p><strong>where is the evidence of the crime?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I will explain it like you&#39;re 3 yrs old. It is illegal, a crime, to send classified info using an unsecured line. Everybody acknowledges that&#39;s what Hillary did. Therefore, it is proof of a crime. What you are demanding now is proof of prosecution or indictment. Which is different than proof of a crime. But because you are Hillary supporter you&#39;re going to keep moving the goal posts. Which proves my first claim that you are being deceitful and manipulative.</p>
