       I believe that the hypersonic missile tech Russia announced is actually a cover for the backengineered ET tech that they have had for quite a while, but let's just even if they don't have the UFO tech,   there are still good reasons to believe that it is a bluff from Putin to deter and wax strength rhetoric.

       There are two things I think the reasons why they said they couldn’t find origins. One they don’t want anger Russia anymore, the UK is afraid of them after they threw out there spies. The second is Russia didn’t do it and the UK or someone else America or someone helped. Because of secrets. But my bet is still Russia did it. They have been so obvious in the past 2 decades with this. That it’s hard not to just see it’s them.

       Maybe they want to invade some countries and seize some resources, but they can’t just go marauding around, so they’d rather start a conflict and bait the West into making the first move so they can “respond” and expand their territory.

       They're not baiting the west. If you're referring to the supposed chemical attack, that is definitely a white helmet set up. With the previous chemical attack Mattis admitted that they had no evidence it was Syria.

       White Helmets report it and are in league with the rebels who are backed by the West. Here's something for you to watch as to why the attack is a false flag.

       not by any means a key piece of evidence on this, but the nerve agent is so not Russia's style. NK has done it, but not Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia's national animal is the bear and its pretty accurate. When it comes to taking action Russia busts in like the Kool Aid man and takes it. Just look at Crimea, the Ukraine war, and Syria.

       That was not a nerve agent attack by Russia.

       Last year, Kim Jong Nam had VX nerve agent splashed on his face and he was dead within 20 minutes.

       Because some people are fucking idiots. They fall for the same thing over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this week’s Syria gas attack is meant to prop up the Novichok story because it was falling apart. Now they can just state it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which they are. Just like they are stating that the previous Syrian has attacks are a fact that Assad was responsible.

       America is just posturing, they aint pushing for war. Chemical attacks are a violation of the geneva convention. Whoever did them was explicity looking for a response from the US.

       I think things have shifted with Russia. Russia talk used to be BS deep state propaganda psy ops aand smoke screens, but now it seems that Russia has pivoted to ally with China, Iran, NK, and Assad. Thats an evil alliance if I ever heard of one.
      </p>

       Russia by itself is not bad, but Russia is and always was power hungry. their zero sum mentality means that anybody who stands in their way is their enemy. Always been that way.

       I dont think that Russia had the money or scientific discipline to develop this tech.

       Corruption has been too endemic since the fall of the USSR to be productive. You gotta grease everyone's wheels just to get anything moving over there. Corruption leads to leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way they could have gotten the tech if they even have it at all is from a previous US or UK administration, maybe Germany or a corrupt third party like Raytheon, Lockheed, or Boeing. prob one of the 'born black project' contractors.

       Trying to figure out why 'he who must not be named' mccain was the one pushing to stop using russian rockets for launches.

       Seems they make a cheap commodity. Not seeing they have any progressive rocket tech though.

       Because some people are fucking idiots. They fall for the same thing over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this week’s Syria gas attack is meant to prop up the Novichok story because it was falling apart. Now they can just state it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which they are. Just like they are stating that the previous Syrian has attacks are a fact that Assad was responsible.

       Maybe they want to invade some countries and seize some resources, but they can’t just go marauding around, so they’d rather start a conflict and bait the West into making the first move so they can “respond” and expand their territory.
