<p>If you haven&#39;t been following, here&#39;s some of the back and forth that has been going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two things I think the reasons why they said they couldn’t find origins. One they don’t want anger Russia anymore, the UK is afraid of them after they threw out there spies. The second is Russia didn’t do it and the UK or someone else America or someone helped. Because of secrets. But my bet is still Russia did it. They have been so obvious in the past 2 decades with this. That it’s hard not to just see it’s them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not by any means a key piece of evidence on this, but the nerve agent is so not Russia&#39;s style. NK has done it, but not Russia.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s national animal is the bear and its pretty accurate. When it comes to taking action Russia busts in like the Kool Aid man and takes it. Just look at Crimea, the Ukraine war, and Syria.</p>

<p>Skripol has deep state written all over it.
They were getting silenced for their links to the Steele dossier. pretty straightforward &#39;frame it as the russians&#39;</p>

<p>Corruption has been too endemic since the fall of the USSR to be productive. You gotta grease everyone&#39;s wheels just to get anything moving over there. Corruption leads to leaks.</p>

<p>The only way they could have gotten the tech if they even have it at all is from a previous US or UK administration, maybe Germany or a corrupt third party like Raytheon, Lockheed, or Boeing. prob one of the &#39;born black project&#39; contractors.</p>
