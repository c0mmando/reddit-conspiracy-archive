        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s your annual reminder that we&#39;re approaching a ritualistic time that coincides with several Pagan traditions (like the ancient Gaelic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane">Beltane Festival</a> and the Germanic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night">Walpurgis Night</a>).</p>

<p>Six years ago, it appears that several rituals set the stage for the &quot;death&quot; of Osama Bin Laden on May 1 (the same day as the <em>alleged</em> death of Hitler):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/h3hzx/a_triple_ritual_just_took_place_on_the_occult/">A triple ritual just took place on the occult dates of Walpurgis Night/Beltane in the City of London, the Vatican and the District of Columbia: the royal alchemical wedding, the pope&#39;s beatification (resurrection) and the burning/sacrifice of the straw man</a></p>

<p>The next year I posted this to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ca0uf/the_dates_april_19th_to_may_1st_are_said_to_have/">The dates April 19th to May 1st are said to have occult significance. April 19th-20th in particular involves sacrifice by fire: Waco, the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine, and the Deepwater Horizon explosion occurred on those days. Will a &quot;fire sacrifice&quot; take place this year?</a></p>

<p>...and two days later the Boston Bombing occurred.</p>

<p>2014 reminder:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22uvwi/in_some_occult_traditions_a_period_of_sacrifice/">In some occult traditions, a period of &quot;sacrifice by fire&quot; begins in mid-April, when, curiously, many false flag events occur.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/328iz1/heres_your_annual_reminder_that_midapril_marks/">2015</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ez7gf/flashback_the_dates_april_19th_to_may_1st_are/">2016</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/657vw6/midapril_begins_the_season_of_occult_sacrifice/">2017</a></p>

<p>The recent &quot;gassing&quot; in Syria seems to have many of the hallmarks of a false flag as well. Let&#39;s hope it wasn&#39;t a prelude to another similar event.</p>

<p>Peace and love.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not accurate. You&#39;re disagreeing and the thread hasn&#39;t been modified. The threads are modified when they are heavily brigaded and hit by vote bots, and the community overwhelmingly supports these actions because we are sick of the bullshit and just want to have a conversation.</p>

<p>There is no proof of this, and the community is tired of these lies/excuses. </p>

We had one literally low-ranking mod who was also unfortunately also active in TMOR, primarily because he had helped me out with the CSS of another sub before I was aware of his association with that sub and posted decent content to OC regularly. His account has since been deleted and no longer a mod of the sub. All of the other mods have no associated with that sub, as far as I&#39;m aware. To say it&#39;s &quot;controlled&quot; by any one couldn&#39;t be more inaccurate. I&#39;m the current owner of the sub, and allow pretty much anything to be posted related to the occult, secret societies as well as any research or conspiracies involving the two. The only content I&#39;ve removed as of late consisted of literally one comment, because he violated the sole rule of the sub (see the sidebar), resorting to using a personal attack and ridiculing another user. I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OccultConspiracy/comments/8b5ftr/why_did_the_wachowski_brothers_matrix_become/dx4bl4p/">politely asked</a> him to remove the offending remark so I could re-approve his comment.

<blockquote>
<p>Prophesied events during the Kali Yuga
A discourse by Markandeya in the Mahabharata identifies some of the attributes of Kali Yuga. In relation to rulers, it lists:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Rulers will become unreasonable: they will levy taxes unfairly.</p></li>
<li><p>Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.</p></li>
<li><p>People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;At the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the subject of God, even at the residences of so-called saints and respectable gentlemen of the three higher varnas (guna or temperament) and when nothing is known of the techniques of sacrifice, even by word, at that time the Lord will appear as the supreme chastiser.&quot; (Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.7)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With regard to human relationships, Markandeya&#39;s discourse says:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Avarice and wrath will be common. Humans will openly display animosity towards each other. Ignorance of dharma will occur.</p></li>
<li><p>People will have thoughts of murder with no justification and will see nothing wrong in that.
Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.</p></li>
<li><p>Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.</p></li>
<li><p>People will become addicted to intoxicating drinks and drugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Gurus will no longer be respected and their students will attempt to injure them. Their teachings will be insulted, and followers of Kama will wrest control of the mind from all human beings.</p></li>
<li><p>Brahmins will not be learned or honored, Kshatriyas will not be brave, Vaishyas will not be just in their dealings, and the varna system will be abolished.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>seems like the four varnas (Shudras (Artisans and Workers); Vaishyas (Farmers, Merchants, &amp; Business People); Kshatriyas (Warriors, Police, &amp; Administrators); and Brahmanas (Priests, Teachers, and Intellectuals)) pretty much cover everyone except homeless beggars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My fears are that the World Cup in Russia will be used to distribute a bio weapon so be on the lookout for a new deadly bug after that event. I fear it will be a two phase where one agent is released that is variably bad and then another is released and the resulting combination of the two bugs does the most damage so that is why I say within a year of the World Cup. /conspiracy enjoy this freebie from me to you.</p>
