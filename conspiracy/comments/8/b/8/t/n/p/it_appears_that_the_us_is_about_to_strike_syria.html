        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If allegations are &quot;evidence&quot;, and accusations are &quot;proof&quot;, shouldn&#39;t Trump, Hillary, Netanyahu, Putin and <em>and countless</em> other political figures be sitting in prison right now? </p>

<p>Each and every one has, after all,  been <strong><em>accused</em></strong> of crimes, haven&#39;t they? </p>

<p>But of course we would never dream of taking such rash actions, would we?</p>

<p>Even in common criminal cases, <em>the basic principles of Justice</em> forbid that the <strong><em>accused</em></strong> be subject execution or other punishment <em>without Due Process</em> - including a proper investigation, the presentation of evidence, and the right of the <strong><em>accused</em></strong> to confront his accusers, and to defend himself against the charges.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind, of course, that the Burden of Proof is <em>not</em> on the accused, but the <strong><em>accusers</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Some would argue that the <strong><em>allegations</em></strong> against Assad/ Russia/ Iran should not be  compared to cases of simple criminal justice... and I would agree... </p>

<p>Why? Because as unjust as it may be, taking extrajudicial action by summarily executing an <strong><em>accused</em></strong> common criminal -- <strong><em>without Due Process</em></strong> -- would be unlikely to unleash repercussions that may well escalate into full-blow war among powers that have arms capable of destroying most of the higher life-forms on Earth.</p>

<p>Is there some pressing need to STRIKE the &quot;Animal Assad&quot; based on accusation alone?</p>

<p>Pause and ask: What would be the benefit of doing so? <strong><em>Do the benefits outweigh the risks?</em></strong></p>

<p>Maybe we should think twice on this one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Little wonder that Corbyn is constantly being attacked by <strong><em>Some People</em></strong>...</p>

<p>Tablet Magazine [Jewish] - May, 2016: <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/202104/anti-semitism-labour-party-corbyn">Who Is Responsible for Anti-Semitism in the Labour Party? Jeremy Corbyn.
</a></p>

<p>NY Times - June, 2016: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-labour-antisemitism.html">A Remark on Israel by Jeremy Corbyn Incites Outrage in Britain and Abroad</a></p>

<p>Sky News - September 2017: <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/expel-labour-members-who-make-anti-semitic-remarks-11053856">Jeremy Corbyn should be &#39;embarrassed&#39; by Labour anti-Semitism row</a> </p>

<p>NBC - March 27, 2018: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/europe/british-opposition-leader-jeremy-corbyn-faces-anti-semitism-accusations-n860276">British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn faces anti-Semitism accusations</a></p>

<p>Like Assad, Corbyn has been pronounced <em>&quot;Guilty by Reason of Accusation&quot;</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>What qualifies as &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;?</em> </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. That depends on <em>who</em> is saying <em>what</em>, and under what circumstances. It could be almost anything. In fact, <strong><em>failing</em></strong> to say the <em>&quot;right things&quot;</em> can qualify as anti-Semitism. <em>(<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/omitting-jews-and-anti-semitism-trumps-holocaust-day-statement-causes-stir/">Donald Trump learned this painful lesson last year</a>)</em> </p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>Who gets to decide whether any statement, action, person or entity is &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. Guess... go on, guess!</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>Do such accusations require substantiated proof?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. No, accusation is proof enough. (and only an <em>anti-Semite</em> would <strong><em>dare</em></strong> ask such a question. You should be ashamed of yourself!)</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. If the prefix <strong><em>&quot;anti&quot;</em></strong> is removed from the term <strong><em>&quot;anti-Semitism&quot;</em></strong>, what remains?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. Nothing. Nothing remains. There is no such thing as <strong><em>&quot;Semitism&quot;</em></strong>, only anti-Semitism.</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>Believe it or... else.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you find a single example where any US intervention has ever left anyone better-off than they were before the US decided to presumably <em>help them</em> by going to war against their various governments and bombing the crap out of all their roads, railways, bridges, power and water treatment plants, vital public administration buildings and killing countless innocent civilians right along with them?</p>

<p>Clearly the American people aren&#39;t &quot;politically free&quot; if they can&#39;t see or stop their own government from such immoral, hypocritical, and completely illegal wars and acts of war while they&#39;re about it, so what kind of &quot;political freedom&quot; is it that the US government seeks to bestow on those people that is in any way better than what they already had to put up with? </p>

<p>Whatever else their government might have been it at least maintained a relatively functional society they could manage to live and get by in without millions of them losing the roofs over their heads and facing the grim prospects of starving to death or dying from sicknesses and injuries because there&#39;s no longer any help to be had from the wrecked and ruined lives the US created in order to make them &quot;politically free&quot;.</p>

Besides, he has both parties on board so this escalation could improve his poll numbers and help fundraising for everyone. The real trouble comes in if Russia objects to their national interests taking the backseat to the EU, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US.

    <div class="md"><p>Russia may have assisted Trump in the election - I&#39;ve seen zero actual evidence but it is possible. Id imagine moreso that Trump, and others, has shady business deals with Russians so they have mutual self interest. You could make the case that the same goes for the Clintons and Podesta brothers though so it&#39;s not just one sided. As it relates to Syria however, Russia does not want the Saudi pipeline with Qatari gas being built in Syria. They rely on their gas being sold to Europe as it is one of if not the most important export they possess. It makes no sense they would self destruct after investing so much time, energy, and money into the war just to prolong it and potentially lose their market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if that works out. The pipelines have not been constructed yet. Qatar and Iran &quot;share&quot; the same gas fields or at least can both pump out LNG. There are 2 proposed pipelines linking through Syria. 1, which Assad wanted, would run from Iran, into Iraq, through Syria and then shipment to Europe. This is Russian supported as Russia can exert more influence over its &quot;allies&quot; Iran and Syria while still selling its own gas to Europe, thus controlling a large chunk of the market. The 2nd proposed pipeline would start in Qatar, run through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, up into Syria then Turkey and the European market. So this is essentially a win for Saudi Arabia (which controls Qatar), Turkey, and Saudi Arabia&#39;s biggest cheerleaders -  corporations in the US. The second pipeline also diminishes Russia&#39;s grip over European gas sales which the EU favors as they can boss ME countries around moreso than Russia. But as I said earlier this is very dangerous as Russia relies on their gas exports for revenue and they will not easily be pushed off. I would say it&#39;s more likely Trump is told what to do by big businesses and the military  which works for those businesses. They could easily hold impeachment over his head as at  any moment they could kick  him out of office for any crap they make up or any real conflicts of  interest he does have. If on the other hand Trump was in Putin&#39;s pocket there would be no need to bomb Syrian airfields and instead the first pipeline - the Iran/Iraq - would start construction in a year or two after this phony war wraps up. Russia is in a very difficult spot here and this especially holds true as they can&#39;t access the oil fields in Siberia (with Exxon&#39;s assistance) because of the US sanctions. Russia has a country of 140 million people yet their GDP is less than Canada&#39;s. They rely heavily on selling their gas and if this is threatened it will have consequences. They do not want Western countries involved in Syria as it could easily backfire. Almost every move in the Syrian proxy war and the Ukrainian &quot;invasion&quot; boils down to oil and gas pipelines, followed closely by weapons sales and posturing. As for this chemical attack, I&#39;d say it&#39;s also as likely that ISIL or other terror groups, known for commiting atrocities, could have denoted or released a chlorine bomb during a Syrian military raid. Or they just released it and blamed Assad. Or it&#39;s all just made up. Who is there to report the truth to us? Regardless, terrorists have no concern for innocent lives and if they are able to draw Western assistance in the war - all the better for them and Saudi Arabia and big corporations that will make billions. What are the lives of a dozen children  compared to billions of dollars? Yet there is hardly any critical thinking from media outlets and &quot;journalists&quot; and instead we are flooded with propaganda from a dumb James Bond movie.</p>

<p>Like Assad, Corbyn has been pronounced <em>&quot;Guilty by Reason of Accusation&quot;</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>What qualifies as &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;?</em> </p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. That depends on <em>who</em> is saying <em>what</em>, and under what circumstances. It could be almost anything. In fact, <strong><em>failing</em></strong> to say the <em>&quot;right things&quot;</em> can qualify as anti-Semitism. <em>(<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/omitting-jews-and-anti-semitism-trumps-holocaust-day-statement-causes-stir/">Donald Trump learned this painful lesson last year</a>)</em> </p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>Who gets to decide whether any statement, action, person or entity is &quot;anti-Semitic&quot;?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. Guess... go on, guess!</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. <em>Do such accusations require substantiated proof?</em></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. No, accusation is proof enough. (and only an <em>anti-Semite</em> would <strong><em>dare</em></strong> ask such a question. You should be ashamed of yourself!)</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>. If the prefix <strong><em>&quot;anti&quot;</em></strong> is removed from the term <strong><em>&quot;anti-Semitism&quot;</em></strong>, what remains?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>. Nothing. Nothing remains. There is no such thing as <strong><em>&quot;Semitism&quot;</em></strong>, only anti-Semitism.</p>
