       Elon is way too good to be true. He invented the way we all use to pay online (PayPal), space X, hyperloop, neuralink, openAI, boring corp (tunnels), power walls and most of all, Teslas. 
In my opinion, there is 2 options, in 5 hundred years humans will talk of Elon as if he were the saviour of humanity, the one who made very high technology very accessible to the public. The one who made it to mars, The one who made every house auto sufficient electricity wise, the one who made transports easy and secure etc. 
OR
they will talk about him like the great deceiver he was, he made us all believe he was going to make humanity better, only to turn his back on us last second. 
He really sound like the villain played by Sam L Jackson in Kingsmen. ''I will give everybody VERY LOW COST LOW LATENCY INTERNET'' by putting 4000 satellites in orbit. There is nowhere on earth where there won't be signal. Think about that. I like him a lot, and he scares me quite a bit too.

       PayPal is what he used to bankroll and get investors for the other projects. He is a good salesman and in this case, he sold shares/investment opportunities to wall street and venture capitalists. I dont think hyperloop is feasible for many reasons. but Elon strikes me as a guy who throws lots of ideas at a wall and sees what sticks. He has the money and sales/bullshitter ability to do that endlessly. Most people dont. He can also afford with all the investment money to hire the top people (scientists for spaced for example)

       I agree with you he is an amazing salesman. But, his company are  more of a "long therm" investment in my opinion and they are very expensive. My reasoning is that these kind of projects are done in a very good intent or a very bad one

       Elon has a couple of gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is the ability to see where things are heading. He has a more accurate idea of what trends are real and how to pick them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       His other gift is related to this one. In an abstract way, he can "see around corners". He's able to figure out what the consequences of a trend will be and spot the resulting business opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an example. Huge tunnel making machines available for a good price. Real estate in cities is super expensive. Roads are crowded.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Elon gets the idea to make offshore ports where cargo ships can unload. Hyperloop delivers cargo via tunnels deep under the ocean floor to some offload point inland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Opportunity arises not from shipping, tunneling or building hyperloops under the ocean floor. It comes from all the coastal real estate that opens up when the old docks on the shoreline are no longer needed. Real estate developers can buy up old docks and turn it into ultra-valuable oceanfront properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more, the potential for this exists in every major port city in the world. We're talking trillions, not billions.

       How is anyone suppose to take you seriously? Again, my question stands.  You cant this far cognitively and be serious, I mean you are on a computer, typing words...yet claim that space is a fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not refuting anything, no specifically naming anything or giving a thread of what you mean to the audience of people you feel the need to inform, but not enough to give a glimmer of why, resources available or anything.  From this end it just like a street corner hobo yelling nonsensically at street signs giving a wonderful impression to people already doubting the population here.

       You notice the thick bear hide armour you opponent is wearing covers hid light chainmail vest and silvery dagger bound to his waist, sheathed in a bejeweled scabard. He flings open the drapes of bear hide off his muscled dwaven forearms and appears to have not liked being confused for a Troll. His clenched teeth you can see through his thick facial hair show he is determined, and starting to rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm no Troll. Have at theee!!!! The dwarf charges you after gaining initiaive roll and bonuses to reaction time"

      <p>
       <strong>
        You notice he has stated charging you with a long spear from 14ft away, he will be able to attack next round. The dwarf fighter has a THACO of 12.
       </strong>
       <em>
        (no bonus to reaction time due to failed attempted turn mob spell, the spell had no effect, the air crackles with failure as you decide your move)

       SpaceX.  We can't even go back to the Moon after almost 50 years but Elon claims he's going to take man to Mars soon.  It's all about dangling the carrot to keep peoples hopes up and the billions of dollars coming in.  Did you not see that SpaceX recently "shot a car into space"?  It was so over the top fake that even Elon said "you know it is real because it looks so fake" Lol.  SpaceX is no different than NASA with all of the lies they have been caught in.  They are marketed as the "independent private space organization" when in fact they are the other side of the NASA bs coin.

       They are 100% an independent space org, which is good for space travel and space industries because it keeps govt red tape out of it, our tax dollars out of it and innovation thrives. And, do you understand the magnitude of the lie if we haven't been to space? Every govt on earth would be in on it since the '60's? Not only that, all of the scientists, employees and people from around the world would be in on it for 60 years? Really? And for what reason would the continued lie be for? I get why it would have happened back in the '60's but now? Why? So Elon Musk and other private businesses can get billions of dollars for no reason?

       Why would anyone want to go to the moon again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you serious??
      </p>
      <p>
       Exploration, research, resource mining, webcam streams, HD cameras pointing toward Earth with 24/7 live feed, HD cameras pointing toward space, permanent research bases, rovers that you can control from earth, put the first female on the moon, put the first cosmonaut on the moon, the first non American on the moon, tourism just to name a few.  That would be the logical steps before you did the impossible Mars mission.

       Too bad they have already received multiple billions of tax dollars.  Funny how passionate you are about space x yet you have done so little research that you think "our tax dollars are kept out of it"
      </p>
      <p>
       So you apparently believe a car is floating around in space simply because Elon said "you know it is real because it looks so fake". You can have faith in Elon and SpaceX all you want but you will eventually be disappointed when you finally realize they are a sham.

       I just made the same comment about him sidestepping your points, only to find that you’d already mentioned it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes it so hard to have a real conversation when, as soon as they’ve exhausted their supply of rhetorical retorts, they immediately move to saying “no one is going to convince you so bye”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucks because the moon hoax is worth discussing, but what’s the point if it won’t even be a real discussion. It’s almost like it is intended to throw off the conversation.

       Because I've responded to him many times in the past.  He is a brigader that does this every day.  It doesn't matter how many times you "retort" someone if they are not in the thread for genuine conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it pretty odd that you come to the aid of his comments because they were so "good".  They were literally terrible "counter points" on why we haven't been back to the moon.  Saying that "China is planning moon bases" as a main counter point is so stupid it isn't even worth a response.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are probably new to this subject matter but if you continue to look into it you will see the same group of users brigading the same topics.  You can't continue to engage with those users once you realize they are not genuine and have no desire for real conversation.

       My counterpoint to "China is planning on building moon bases"?  Seriously?  My counterpoint is saying that you are "planning" something means absolutely nothing.  Richard Branson from Virgin Galactic has been "planning" space tourism for 30 years.  Doesn't mean it's happening.  The idea that Elon Musk is going to pull off taking people to Mars before we even go back to the moon is ridicules and only the most gullible could possibly believe it.

       Resource mining? Lol. And who would pay for that? Oh! I know, maybe the guys from Gold Rush can make that their next spot to mine. Any non American country that can go the moon, doesn't care to because there probably is no reason at this point. And there already are cameras in space.

       Don't get me wrong, I am 100% in knowing that we have tax dollars going to them but the amount that they get compared to what NASA was getting is a pittance. And because they are a private company(and get tax dollars, just like almost all companies), they can do many more things, much faster than NASA could have ever dreamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could care less about the car, I care more about the fact that there is a company out there pushing the boundaries of things. Not some typical company doing the same old shit. That is what this country was built on, visionaries and innovation.

       I know what you mean. Uni assignements this year have had me researching alot on automation, he talks about it alot. He says that Google are the only ones we should worry about whilst pushing for his own AI and autonomous tech. Pretty sure if he could, then OpenAI would be as poweful as DeepMind. But i do like him and want to trust him but then I saw her.

       Musk is like Thomas Edison. He's a self-interested jerk taking advantage of others to rise himself up. However, he's become enormously wealthy by advancing industry for the benefit of the common person. Edison brought things like electric light, audio recording, and film to the public. He didn't invent these things himself, and he profited off of the efforts of others unfairly just as all wealthy capitalists do, but it's still a good thing that we have electric light for the masses.

       My counterpoint to "China is planning on building moon bases"?  Seriously?  My counterpoint is saying that you are "planning" something means absolutely nothing.  Richard Branson from Virgin Galactic has been "planning" space tourism for 30 years.  Doesn't mean it's happening.  The idea that Elon Musk is going to pull off taking people to Mars before we even go back to the moon is ridicules and only the most gullible could possibly believe it.

        What research could we conduct on the moon we couldnt do on ISS? What benefit would a livecam have on the moon to justify the cost of putting it there?

       You said it’s worth going to the moon, but you basically just took it for granted that it really is worth it. Why is it worth it to go back to the moon?
