       Because there really is an Illuminati/Elite conspiracy that run the Western World. They cover up when they get caught. Over and over and over. I agree with you, but that's the name of their game. Rape children, genocide over-seas and cover it all up.

       Why would you expect most Americans to know who he is? No one here watched Top of the Pops with Jimmy Savile because SUPRISE... it wasn't broadcast here. He literally had no cultural presence in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, we don't see most standard BBC programming unless it is licensed independently through venues like Netflix which means we see limited shows like Black Mirror. What we do see is BBC America which is a commercial venture with AMC Networks which shows things like Top Gear and Doctor Who. Hell, half the shows on it are American shows to begin with like 17 different versions of Star Trek. We do get the BBC World Service if you pay for it on cable with BBC America or through XM/Sirius Satellite or if your local NPR station pays the licensing rights.

       Your point stands, and is valid, there's no real reason Americans should have heard about Jimmy Savile. But the whole tone of the original post is that this is all some big secret / cover up that nobody knows about... It's simply not. It was all over the mainstream media for months. Both the scandal of the crimes of Savile, and the scandal of the cover up / those who knew/turned a blind eye/facilitated his crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, although a foreigner, I do know of both Garrison Keillor and Arsenious Hall.

       So 'you guys' means 'your investigators'? The police were crooked and covered it up - politicians, establishment figures. A bit like what's going on in the US - from the Clinton foul dating and the podestas to Jeffrey epstein, Kevin spacey, Dennis Hastert etc - maybe look into the 'conspiracy of silence' documentary:

       That's jus wrong the amount of times he alludes to being accused of this shit is harrowing a truly truly depraved man. Everything about him shouts werido minimum. He drove around in a fucking camper van. Its sad these people were known whilst I was coming up but there is still a massive problem worldwide!

       When I was young in like 2004 or so there was a version of Amarillo done for comic relief with Peter Kay doing a music video with loads of celebrities. About a week ago we rewatched it and suddenly out of nowhere Jimmy Saville was in it. All of us literally recoiled in shock, cause we all see him as a monster here now.

       I can admit the American population is in the dark about pedophilia in Washington, we haven't had a Jimmy Seville, you on the other hand can't admit complacency despite you admitting everyone in the UK knows about Jimmy. See the difference?

       We know now. We didn't know then. This man practically invented DJ-ing. Playing records to people above shops in Leeds before his radio career took off. He was one of the pioneers of music radio and radio one. He then regularly hosted top of the pops, the biggest music TV show in British history. He THEN started hosting various other kids TV shows and then Jim'll fix it - a show on early Saturday evening (prime time) where he basically granted wishes to kids that wrote in! This show ran for about 30 fucking years!! Whilst he was doing this he was running marathons for hospitals and children charities - earning millions of pounds for numerous causes - enough to have hospital wings built for him. He had a room at stoke Mandeville hospital.

       Definitely. Loads. And it's still going on, in plain sight. 1,400 girls abused in Rotherham over The years 10 - 20 year period, Rochdale, Telford, towns all over the UK. All over Europe, all over the United States, Canada, Australia, the entire planet. And people know! People are actually aware that millions of people around the world fuck kids. This is the world we live in.

       Nah. Savile is literally King Paedo. He even dressed to fit the title. Cosby doesn't even come close, Savile was literally given the keys to a school for troubled girls, and had free reign of hospitals full of disabled children.
      </p>
      <p>
       His victims reach the hundreds in number, and all the while he was a national treasure, loved by the country. He effectively abused and betrayed an entire nation, and he died a hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's in his own league of evil.

       He is massively (in)famous in the UK. It was a huge scandal a few years ago, all over the mainstream media. Theres will be barely a person in the UK who doesn't know about this evil man. The reason he isn't a household name around the world (I'm guessing by that you mean the USA) is that most nations take a quite parochial view of the news... If it's not happening in your own country, it doesn't make the news.

       Interestingly, one of the few people who called Jimmy Savile out, while  he was still alive, was Ricky Gervais.

       Just watched the show where I thought he did it back on YouTube. (here:

       </a>
       ) He didn't, I'd misremembered it. It's uncomfortable to see the adoration of the audience for Savile though... Still considered a National Treasure at the time. Hiding in plain sight. Seems it was only Johnny Rotten/Lydon (although that was half hearted) and David Icke (who was a bit of a laughing stock back then, perhaps less so now?).

       protecting him in THAT sense.  And why? even after his death and now that he's supposedly long gone?  Well, they keep the truth about
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       he did from coming out even now because it would implicate and involve some very powerful people that are currently still alive and very much in public office and in places of power - people that are actually
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       committing horrible crimes.  A pretty big and heinous house of cards would all come tumbling down if EVERYTHING that Saville was truly involved with and protected by was allowed to all come out into the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that he would have been able to be as horrible and criminal as he absolutely was and with absolutely no consequence while he was alive and be that way all on his own with no protection and no one else knowing about all those horrible things he was doing?  You think he was just some "lone pedophile nut that worked in isolation to everything and everyone else"??  Really?  You think there was no one else that was involved in what he was doing with him? that he didn't have anyone else helping and abetting his horrible acts?

       You might never have said that, but I bet you were one of the people that downvoted my original comment, no?  The comment you made in its attempted snarkiness seems to be a great indicator of the extent to which you misunderstood and misinterpreted what I had initially said and meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, what I stated above still applies in terms of anyone (you or otherwise) who might have been critical of my initial statement - a statement I still 100% stand behind and is still very much true.

       Absolutely household name in the UK.
Synonymous with utter sociopathic pedo monster. 
Subject of many tasteless jokes.
Though his connections to the monarchy are often overlooked and passed off as just some sort of unfortunate misjudgement by Buckingham Palace.

       Well:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's dead, so there's never really going to be any new news about him.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Like most criminals, they fade from public view very quickly after incarceration, though in this case, incarceration was death and discovery.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Monsters have lives too, so you can't prove that everyone who knew him is connected. Just look at the religious molesters in the States: most of the church isn't in on it, most of the time, so we can't just dive into the lives of everyone connected to him -- and as a celebrity, he would have associated with a lot of other celebrities. So, that's a bit of dead end.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He's dead, so it's not like he's about to tell us who helped him.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Otherwise, he is a 'household name' -- just one of those household names you use in crude jokes and hushed tones.

       Because he was always seen as an oddball. Nobody was
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       surprised that he turned out to be a massive nonce because there'd always been nods and winks about it. Sure - not many expected the
       <em>
        scale
       </em>
       of the thing, but we expected the fact of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add that to the fact that justice wasn't served while the old fucker was still alive, and he passed straight from a weird figure of fun to being a lazy punchline to a joke about 1970s culture.

       Richard Herring mentioned doing sketches about Saville in the90s and how there were rumours about him and corpses . Seems like lots of people at least had an idea of what he was up to and it’s probably the top people at the bbc who covered it up for so long

       It gets even worse when you learn Savile (for some unexplained reason) had complete access to the Leeds mortuary where
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/savile-bodies-sex-acts-corpses-glass-eyes-mortuary">
        he would regularly go in and fuck the corpses.

       , Think about that for a minute and let it settle in: Jimmy Savile had unrestricted access to a morgue and used to fuck dead people.

       People in UK showbiz knew something was wrong with Saville years before the stories came out in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a collection of clips from British TV and radio refering to his behaviour
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeB9ZxffQAE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeB9ZxffQAE
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The author Irvine Welsh wrote a book featuring a character who was an obvious stand-in for Saville and was a pedophile and necrophiliac, in 1996:
       <a href="https://dangerousminds.net/comments/irvine_welsh_on_jimmy_savile_was_savile_a_necrophiliac_then_or_what">
        https://dangerousminds.net/comments/irvine_welsh_on_jimmy_savile_was_savile_a_necrophiliac_then_or_what
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And someone took the time to write this in about 2000:
       <a href="http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/rogerb/jokes/HIGNFY.txt">
        http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/rogerb/jokes/HIGNFY.txt
       </a>
       . It's fake (Paul Merton has confirmed that) but the original author clearly knew about Savilles double life.

       Not sure if anyone has mentioned it yet but I’ll comment anyway.  I think the focus of this post is valid but missing a huge point, people 100% knew about Saville, particularly in the BBC.  As far as I’m aware no one from the BBC has been sacked or arrested?  From what I can remember the BBC just carried on as normal, which is disgraceful.

         Under the ‘Kentler Experiment’ of the 1970s, Berlin welfare authorities handed over homeless teenagers to known paedophiles. In most cases they were asked to care for 13 - 15-year-old drug addicts and prostitutes. “It is simply unimaginable that something like this happened with state oversight.”

         Members of a U.N. peacekeeping mission engaged in "transactional sex" with more than 225 Haitian women in exchange for food and medication, a sign that sexual exploitation remains significantly underreported in such missions. About a third of alleged sexual abuse involves minors under 18.

         A new report commissioned by the Colombian government and FARC rebels has concluded U.S. soldiers and military contractors sexually abused at least 54 children in Colombia between 2003 and 2007. The investigator cites one case where 53 girls in the town of Melgar were targeted by contractors who filmed the abuse and sold the films as pornography. In another case, a 12-year-old girl was allegedly drugged and raped by a U.S. Army sergeant and a contractor. Under immunity agreements, none of the alleged abusers were ever punished. The media group FAIR notes the story has received no coverage in the U.S. corporate media. A number of U.S. outlets have reported on a new Justice Department probe which concludes U.S. drug enforcement agents in Colombia participated in "sex parties" with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartels.

       I think pizzagate is what has brought all the attention to this in the mainstream. Bill and Hillary Clinton flew on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express plane and visited Orgy Island known for underage sex trafficking. Its looking like most governments, at least the ones together with the federal reserve world banking system globalist new world order agenda, are led by these same people embroiled in the same scandals and all affiliated with the same people.

       In the 80's, head of the FBI Ted Gunderson blew the whistle on what he said were rogue groups in the FBI and CIA that perpetuate human trafficking. Digging deeper Gunderson learned that these groups work together with the government for human trafficking for sex including children, that these people were part of the illuminati and satanism who's ultimate goal is to establish the New World Order. Much of the people in political positions and power are compromised in these sex scandals so that they are owned and controlled under threat of blackmail. It was found that satanism was deeply imbedded in these cults that took advantage of the human trafficking. At these satanic ceremonies children are sacrificed to gain spiritual power. John De Camp also wrote about much of these groups in his book 'The Franklin Coverup'.
      </p>
      <p>
       These stories of satanic groups and child trafficking and sacrifice were much of the time ignored by the media; either intentionally or unintentionally considering the claims and evidence that much of the government owns mainstream media and censored many of these stories. The controversy of the hacked and leaked Podesta emails show a link not only to pedophilia but satanic ceremonies and brought a major spotlight onto the issue in our current era. Many celebrities and even political officials like Hillary Clinton appear to be implicated in these particular ceremonies called 'spirit cooking' which was created by Church of Satan founder Aleister Crowley and performed by Marina Abromovich. Another case further implicates the Clinton's and Clinton Foundation in human trafficking. By their assistance to Laura Silsby in reducing the sentence of child trafficking when she was caught trying to smuggle 33 children across the Haitain border. After Silsby's arrrest, her original lawyer Jorge Puello was arrested in connection to an international smuggling ring accused of trafficking women and minors from Central America and Haiti. Silsby owned New Life Children's Refuge Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission and emails were found by this institution in the leaked Hillary Clinton emails. Monica Peterson member of the Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking mysteriously died in Haiti while investigating the Clinton Foundation's involvement in human trafficking. Peterson wrote 'Hillary Clinton should get far more scrutiny for her scandalous conduct in Haiti; from rigging the March 2011 presidential election for her favored candidate Michel "Sweet Mickey" Martelly (supporter of the CIA created death squad FRAPH) to insuring that her brother Tony Rodham and "a company that barely exists" got a "sweetheart gold mine concession in Haiti" that "royally cheated" the state of Haiti. According to a friend, Peterson had uncovered two huge trafficking scandals and a social displacement scandal with billions of accounted earthquake aid leading back to the Clinton Foundation.

       Mark Passio, an ex-satanist turned whistleblower tells of his story of being invited in the church of satan by Anton Levey in order to become a recruiter. He claims that in every high up institution of government, education, and political circles there are satanists who are trying to infiltrate and control all aspects of society. These satanists are connected to ancient pagan cults that sacrifice children to pagan deities such as Moloch and have been for thousands of years. Ronald Bernard, another whisteblower, claims that when he got to the top level of banking circles in europe and the netherlands he was invited to participate in satanic ceremonies where children were sacrificed. Ronald's claims are extremely similar to what has been found from many other sources. That there is a very dark elite force that practice these satanic ceremonies and are the puppetmasters behind most of governments and world banking institutions. That the New World Order is part of their Luciferian Agenda. That all suffering on Earth is a business model and system of control through corrupt banking that makes the poor poorer and rich richer.

       I don't think there are any new knife control laws on the cards, although the police are stepping up "stop and search" in certain areas, due to a spate of stabbings / murders mainly in London. This is more down to cuts in police numbers / government cuts in funding of effective any gang ) knife crime prevention programs over recent years than anything else. Depressingly avoidable, as this same issue was successfully addressed in the 90s, and in other cities such as Glasgow.

       It looks very much like they are banning the delivery of knives to residential addresses. I'm sure legitimate knife users and manufacturers are overjoyed. I know a few chefs who will be absolutely livid.

       Think he's as much or more of a household name as Epstein.  It's talked about and referenced by the Brits often.  Not 24hour news cycle mentioned as most things aren't of they aren't easy to talk and speculate about and politically dividing, which is perhaps most important.  Think it's pretty much universally agreed who he was and that it was bad so no news after his death

       Was he actually a proven necrophiliac? I dont think so and wasnt the rest alleged or did they find evidence ? I know an investigation concluded that the testimonies made it likely but I'm not sure if there was any physical evidence or court cases ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he was a pervert but it's important to stick to facts even with conspiracies to show that just because its a conspiracy doesn't mean it's not real.

       No I won't.

       Also it's not an apologist anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're comment is an ignorant and aggressive response and  exactly the knee jerk reaction I referred to.   Facts matter which is why I linked actual professional articles on the issues for further reading .
      </p>
      <p>
       I also clearly wrote that I consider the man an evil pervert.  What more do you want?  Shall we call him the devil? If we do we give a simple man supernatural powers which leads to a false claim that he wasnt human but a monster. Jimmy saville was a deeply flawed person but a human being like you.  The fact that he was well respected and did many good deeds is an important part of learning how to prevent future cases of abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because he was just a man we can learn and protect ourselves and others in future by studying his case and that means facts not heresay or conjecture or ignorance born of fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who works with children and has encountered paedophiles and sexual abuse in and outside the work place id rather know what I was facing than blindly lashing out hoping to make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to continue blindly lashing out at me and the world but that won't help anyone.

       You answered your own question. He's NOT a household name specifically because he DID have dinners with the PM, etc.   If he had dined with me or you, both our names would be household.   People would walk up to you on the street and say, "Hey, aren't you the guy that was buddies with that child raper?"

       In the UK, Savile is and always has been a household name ever since he reached celebrity status.
The biggest difference is that he is now more known for his horrific crimes than he work on TV and as a DJ.

       Just watched the show where I thought he did it back on YouTube. (here:

       </a>
       ) He didn't, I'd misremembered it. It's uncomfortable to see the adoration of the audience for Savile though... Still considered a National Treasure at the time. Hiding in plain sight. Seems it was only Johnny Rotten/Lydon (although that was half hearted) and David Icke (who was a bit of a laughing stock back then, perhaps less so now?).

       Nah. Savile is literally King Paedo. He even dressed to fit the title. Cosby doesn't even come close, Savile was literally given the keys to a school for troubled girls, and had free reign of hospitals full of disabled children.
