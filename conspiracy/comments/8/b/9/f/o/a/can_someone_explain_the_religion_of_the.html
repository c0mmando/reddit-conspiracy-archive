        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the title suggests I&#39;m sort of at a loss on what these deepstate people believe and why they are &quot;evil&quot;. As far as I understand they seem to worship duality and Lucifer(who is the light-bringer to humanity) etc, which alone I am confused on because after looking into the Gnostic texts everything seems more correct yet backwards to orthodox religious teachings. I&#39;m under the belief that these deepstate members preform satanic rituals and do some really evil stuff including all the pedophilia and sacrifices and so on. But they also seem to understand and follow self empowerment, some really spiritual beliefs, and the true understanding of how this world works, at least more than the common man due to secret societies and whatnot. If someone could just give me a rundown of their beliefs and how the evil stuff(along with why, like what they get out of it) came into play then that would really help. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This form of illuminism that you are describing is one that lacks a truth of God (or a God).  They may worship at the alter of mock idols, but at it&#39;s core, it is atheism.  This is how/why they use moral relativism to dispel the teachings of Christ.  This is the worship of man as his own sovereign God - not necessarily confined to or dictated by any specific religious edict.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on mobile rn, but i can dig it up later. Ronald Bernard&#39;s interviews are a good watch on this, though obviously by itself it isn&#39;t enough. He is completely genuine, imo. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, the NWO was always this. It wasn&#39;t always called the &quot;New World Order,&quot; though. Its origins can be traced back to the JP Morgan group, the Rockefellers, the Council on Foreign Relations, and of course the League of Nations, if I were to oversimplify it.</p>

<p>The format of the Council on Foreign Relations was eventually used to make a similar global institution, the Trilateral Commission. The LoN obviously became the EU. </p>

<p>The rest of your sentence is correct though. Where do you think the phrase &quot;useless eaters&quot; came from? ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To denote what &quot;evil&quot; really falls back onto would need to consider what and how it is canonized.</p>

<p>To some, evil is a way of life.  The concept of evil may not even be considered evil because good is not a part of that worldview.  </p>

<p>What I can put out there is that evil is a direct inversion of what could be good.  The may point of evil is to not be divine.  Any perversion of divine would be to smear, deceive, hide, trick or blur the lines of what can be determined between good and evil.</p>

<p>If you do not know what act is good or evil then evil has succeeded.</p>

<p>One example is a mark of true evil which is misunderstood by the aspect of inversion.  The mark ƐƐƐ would be more accurate of evil because of its inversion.  Most people do not know that divinity also naturally comes in threes.  Its the inversion of a false light that twists everything is what defines evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the Bible turned upside down.  They believe God is a tyrant who has imprisoned us and Lucifer is the good guy trying to break us free from his tyrannical control (the original rebel as Saul Alinsky wrote).  You will see this idea played out in all sorts of media and entertainment such as Truman Show, Westworld, Kubo and the Two Strings, etc.</p>

<p>It goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden when the Dragon (serpent/Lucifer) cause man to fall so he could regain his crown he lost when he fell from the 3rd heaven and God created and crowned Adam King.  </p>

<p>These verses show this:</p>

<p>Luk 4:5  And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. </p>

<p>Luk 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. </p>

<p>You see when the devil tempted Jesus he told him the glory of the kingdoms are delivered to him to give to whomsoever he wills.  He has the power to give power here.  Jesus does not correct him and simply rebukes Satan for trying to tempt God.  This temptation however works wonders for all the rich and powerful of this world:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6I-XQ2t6w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-6I-XQ2t6w</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s been in control of this world ever since and trying to lead people away from God through all of his various institutions.  He gives power to those who are deceived into thinking they will be able to avoid the judgment of Jesus Christ in the end.</p>

<p>The way out of this is to repent (change your mind) and believe the gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Simply repent and trust in what Jesus Christ did for you alone for your salvation and he will be the door out of here for you.  You must repent and believe the above gospel in your heart and understand that you are a sinner that deserves hell yet God himself came to earth as a human and sacrificed himself to be your Passover lamb so you don&#39;t have to go there.  It&#39;s that simple.  Repent and believe!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s all about understanding what you are (a sinner) and what he did (sacrificed himself to wash your sin away) and what that means (you avoid the wages of sin which is death, and an eternal lake of fire)</p>

<p>All you need to do is understand that and believe the gospel.  He didn&#39;t die the most excruciating death and voluntary shed his blood for you to then work in your own self righteousness to be saved.  The point is to realize there is nothing you can do and you for yourself.</p>

<p>Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p>

<p>We are justified by faith and when that happens there is a spiritual transaction where we receive Jesus Christ&#39;s perfect righteousness.</p>

<p>Rom 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
Rom 3:24  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
Rom 3:25  Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
Rom 3:26  To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 
Rom 3:27  Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Rom 3:28  Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. </p>

<p>God has made it this easy to be saved.  Many who believe in God have this stumbling block where they refuse to believe he is this forgiving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story of the garden of eden has always troubled me. If I&#39;m being honest then it really seems like Lucifer gave us the ability of Freewill, which to me seems like a good thing. It feels weird saying because I really want to believe in what is right and that has always been taught to be completely wrong. Freewill seems like a great thing because it allows us to learn and make our own choices instead of being forced into one narrative. I mean if you were in the Garden of Eden would you eat from the Fruit? Don&#39;t slam me, just saying whats on my mind! I&#39;d like to be convinced otherwise personally</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adam and Eve had freewill from the beginning.  The the tree of knowledge of good and evil was there the entire time and they never thought to eat from it because God told them they would die.  Lucifer simply lied and they had never dealt with a lie before in their entire life.  Eve already had the free will to believe Lucifer over God and chose to do so.  Lucifer&#39;s lie as always consisted of half truths.  They did become aware of good and evil but their spirits died and sin corrupted the earth and we are still dealing with it today.</p>

<p>I have looked into the Gnostic texts a bit, mostly Enoch (many don&#39;t even believe it&#39;s Gnostic) but never sat down and read them.  I was saved last spring and now I would never touch them.  They all seem to lead to Luciferian doctrine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>May have f&#39;d up the freewill thing, my curiosity was mainly aimed at the whole fruit of knowledge part. I just feel as if there is a much deeper meaning here that what is portrayed on the outside</p>

<p>Couple honest questions:
If God is all knowing then wouldn&#39;t he have understood the flaw of the situation and therefore intended for them to eat the fruit?</p>

<p>Why would God Lie in the first place? Couldn&#39;t he have just explained it?</p>

<p>Why shouldn&#39;t we have learned what good and bad is anyway? </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t we already be imperfect beings if we made the mistake in the first place? I thought we were made in his &quot;divine image&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God didn&#39;t lie.  God can&#39;t lie since lying is a sin.  He said:</p>

<p>Gen 2:17  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. </p>

<p>When they ate they died a spiritual death and lost their immortality.  This is what Jesus Christ fixes for us.  We are reborn spiritually and gain immortality through him.</p>

<p>Lucifer is the father of lies and he told the first lie to a human in the garden.  It&#39;s the same lie he tells today to new age types, Gnostics, and the like that &quot;ye shall be as gods.&quot;</p>

<p>Adam was made in God&#39;s image and after his likeness but he was still a created (from the earth) being with his own free will.  Adam was created immortal, naive, and without sin just like a child.  The Bible says he was a &quot;living soul.&quot; before the fall.  </p>

<p>The eternal Godhead is something impossible to understand.  We however are not in God&#39;s image.  We are in the image of Adam after the fall which is why we have a sin nature.  This verse is post fall:</p>

<p>Gen 5:3  And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth: </p>

<p>So contrary to popular belief, we are not in the image of God but in the fallen state of Adam.  Only our Soul can be reborn in the image of God when we are born again by the spirit via repentance and faith in the gospel.</p>

<p>After the fall of Lucifer and his sin corrupting the world between Gen 1:1 and 1:2 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki6XFfEmDVs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki6XFfEmDVs</a>) God wanted to create something for his pleasure to fellowship with.  Something that would voluntarily worship him, replace whatever Lucifer&#39;s kingdom was, and give him glory but he clearly does not want robots.  He gave us free will to choose to believe him over fallen Lucifer (this is still going on today).  God did know what was going to happen and that&#39;s why the Bible also says Jesus Christ was foreordained before the foundations of the world were laid to die for us.</p>

<p>1Pe 1:19  But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 
1Pe 1:20  Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 
1Pe 1:21  Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we can really comprehend this stuff because God exists outside of time.  Here is an interesting verse about the future where time will cease and the mystery of God will be revealed.</p>

<p>Rev 10:6  And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: 
Rev 10:7  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.</p>

<p>Currently the mystery of God is great and that&#39;s why we can&#39;t comprehend some of these things like his Godhead or why he makes some of the decisions he makes.</p>

<p>1Ti_3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>

<p>I personally think this can all be thought of as a relationship between a child and a parent.  The parent can tell the child not to touch a hot stove but until the child touches the stove for themselves they have no real concept of why the parent said not to do it.  I think this is is a lesson of some sort.  Adam and Eve had perfection and didn&#39;t even know it.  They had to touch the stove and see what happened to comprehend what they had.  Ultimately this is hard for us to get our heads around because:</p>

<p>Isa 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I guess I was more so trying to express my confusion is why shouldn&#39;t we be allowed the ability to know good and evil and attain wisdom? Also why does the &quot;all loving God&quot; have to be such an asshole for an innocent mistake that was pretty much bound to happen considering they had no fundamental understanding of good and bad in the first place? Could he have intended it? Like i said in a reply to a different comment, I really believe there is a deeper meaning to this story or just something we&#39;re missing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My belief is it is because our knowledge and wisdom is not comparable to God’s.  If you look at all of the corruption in the world today, it comes from the weakness and evil in mankind, originating from this event and the serpent’s deception.  I believe this wisdom was not wisdom that mankind could handle without bringing about the evil things we see in the world.  Even now, people are continuously deceived by Satan.  There is no doubt in my mind we would have been better off not eating the fruit.</p>

<p>Eve and Adam rebelled against what God told them.  They were the ones in the wrong.  God gave Adam and Eve many things and they rebelled against him in return.  To not punish is to allow evil and not make it come at a cost.  God is the only one who is to judge as He is a perfect judge having created everything.</p>

<p>It may seem to be an innocent mistake to us but I believe ourselves to be far more corrupted than Adam and Eve were then.</p>

<p>I do not think God intended it:</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm">http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-6.htm</a></p>

<p>I believe the deeper meaning is meant to come from trying to answer questions like you asked ourselves, using the Bible as the basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They desire a return to some Saturnian Golden Age where Man had a different relationship with Nature than we currently do.</p>

<p>This era seems to have existed, multiple old cultures reference it.  In theory, the Mystery Schools were created to house the collective memory and wisdom of the Saturnian Golden Age.  Over time, through the Silver Age, Bronze Age, and now into the Iron Age, the Mystery Schools warped and transmuted as humanity devolved from this Golden Age.  </p>

<p>Formerly a repository of knowledge to save humanity from disaster, they are now a repository of knowledge committed to plunging humanity into a disaster.</p>

<p>The modern-day adherents, the deepstate, etc, are playing out their rituals, etc, in an attempt to honor or recreate this Golden Age.  They have no knowledge that the origins of their Schools (Cults) were totally different.</p>

<p>Their knowledge includes methods of self-empowerment using the human body which our modern science does not understand.  This allows them to do &quot;magick.&quot;  So they can enlighten themselves, but only in the context of increased personal power, not increased personal salvation or connection or love.</p>

<p>Their knowledge base is essentially unbroken for eons.  10&#39;s of thousands of years of knowledge more or less passed down in an unbroken chain to today.  They totally know &quot;how this world works.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply! Few questions:
Why are they so committed to destroying our civilization? or are they even aware or just really disillusioned into believing that they are making it better?</p>

<p>When you say &quot;magick&quot; is it literal or just context for implying that thats what they call their rituals? Like are they actually spiritually gaining something we do not understand?</p>

<p>Are they really that confused about their own knowledge? They seem like fairly capable people considering the status they have risen to through manipulation etc. so I would think they would have done their research intently?</p>

<p>Lastly, what do they get from doing all this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are committed to destroying the civilization in order to bring their Saturnian cults into power.  And not just background power like now, they want to rise like a Phoenix from the ashes of civilization in order to rule it &quot;better,&quot; per their own definitions.</p>

<p>They also see Western Civ as too Christian, which they see as a corruption or distortion of their &quot;true&quot; Saturnian religion.  Like, Jesus/Christianity is a Sun-worshipping religion, and the only true Sun is Saturn.  Our current Sun is a fake or imposter and will (again) be out-shone by Saturn.  If only they conduct more sacrifice!!  (sarcasm at the end).</p>

<p>They are extremely aware and, IMHO, blinded by proximity or power.  I also think they belief that if they drop the opopulation down vis-a-vis the Georgia guidestones then the world will be better and more humans will thrive (those just happen to be &quot;their&quot; humans, convenient).</p>

<p>Magick is both literal and a concept.  They can&#39;t cast Fireball or Teleport, but they can summon energy, harness energy, and direct energy.  To them, magick is Will plus Action.  They Will a concept into reality thru Action.  Thus with the power of their mind they can create and/or destroy.  Hence, magick.  Crowley put the &quot;k&quot; after magic to separate the concepts of magic and magick, kinda like White Hat vs Black Hat.</p>

<p>They are not confused at all.  They think they&#39;re doing it right.  Better than right, True.  My hunch is most get swept into the cults through the pursuit of professional success, with less swept in through sexual... proclivities.  The cult is an avenue to get somewhere, and the cult has vast amounts of occulted knowledge they can tap.</p>

<p>The last question is tricky.  The lower ranking members get earthly power (money, sex).  The medium ranking members get access to occulted knowledge (how the body works, how the brain works, how the universe works) which helps them control people.  The higher ranking members are, IMHO, likely in contact with non-human entities.  This starts to drift into Archons and soul contracts and weirder stuff so I&#39;ll just trail off....</p>
