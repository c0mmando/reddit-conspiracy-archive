<p>Well it is a family run business that he turned over to his sons. Why would they change the name? And if he isn&#39;t running the business, how would people using the hotels impact him? The company doesn&#39;t even own all of the hotels with his name on them.</p>

<p>or he was a con man from the beginning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s always been a con man. Probably the greatest of all time considering how high he rose. The reason this administration had been such a shambles is because Trump and those around him have no idea what the fuck they are doing and it is my opinion that they never intended on winning the election. The rhetoric in the days leading up to the election from Trump and his team was how there was a bunch of voter fraud etc. They were prepping for the inevitable Hillary victory then Trump was going to start his own propaganda network with Bannon etc.</p>

<p>The facts are there for everyone to see but Trump and the republicans/Fox News have done such a good job of muddying the water and making facts meaningless that we now have a huge portion of the population that is effectibely brainwashed. If Trump tried to pull a Jonestown he would have tens of thousands of people willing to drink that store-brand Kool Aid and that says a lot.</p>

<p>Imagine all the two faced liars that were willing to do and say whatever it takes to get on Trump’s good side just so they can get a piece of the POTUS pie.</p>

<p>Trump preaches about loyalty. They hear that they need to be Yes men. But what the POTUS doesn’t understand or know is where these opportunistic wolves will do most of their damage.</p>

<p>It’s not that Trump is comprised. It’s that he has no idea what he’s doing. </p>

<p>His days are planned. Meeting with all kinds of people. Travel. And on top of that he’s got to have the mental fortitude to lead the country.</p>

<p>How much is delegated to the opportunistic people around him? </p>

<p>He’s practically given up. There’s more backbone in his tweets than in the White House. He’s given bills he doesn’t even read and signs them because he’s told to. It’s not the deep state. It’s Trump being uninformed about how everything works. You learn about problems in 2 min FoxNews pieces and expect to solve them by insulting and dissing others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He only ever opposed TPP because he was able to associate it with Obama, and Obama = Bad to his cavemen supporters. He had no fucking idea what it actually was.</p>

<p>Turns out a big selling point for TPP was that it&#39;d put a check on Chinese influence in the region, particularly with intellectual property protections, an issue Trump keeps criticizing China on.</p>

<p>Now that he&#39;s actually trying to hardball with China, someone with half a brain finally informed him about this, and he&#39;s reversing his position. </p>

<p>Like the other 9 times out of 10 Trump reverses a position, it&#39;s because his original position was an ignorant hot take that he made purely to score quick and easy political points and now someone&#39;s actually taught him some of the relevant substance behind the issue.</p>

<p>Uh, nah. Leftists (real leftists) tend to be much smarter than Liberals, who are really just Conservatives-With-Compassion. Conservatives are pretty dumb, but they at least know a little bit about Econ 101 and so they can competently manage Capitalism so it produces wealth for the rich. Right wing populists like Trump are the dumbest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah, because it&#39;s written by a bunch of rich Capitalists and is designed to generate profit for them, with nothing in there to benefit the proletariat.</p>

A patriot who genuinely supports the 2nd Amendment will never give one inch to the anti-gun Left.  It also sets the dangerous precedent that a President can just ban firearms by executive order.

It’s Trump being uninformed about how everything works. You learn about problems in 2 min FoxNews pieces and expect to solve them by insulting and dissing others. </p>
