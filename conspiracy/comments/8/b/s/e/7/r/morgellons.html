    <div class="md"><p>Think about it. You sitting there high as fuck, look down and see some weird blue/red fibers (obviously lint to the un-stoned mind) that look like they’re coming out of your skin. Then you look it up and BAM!

    <div class="md"><p>Well I often sit somewhere in a state that one would describe as &quot;high as fuck&quot; but I&#39;ve never experienced any sensation remotely similar to hallucinating blue/red fibers, nor have I seen anything coming out of my skin, so I suppose I&#39;ll never understand. </p>

<p>That sounds more like genuine psychosis than anything. Even on hallucinogens, that sounds like a bit of a stretch. Also unsure of how any of it relates to chem trails, but I may be missing something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a nematode like organism that feeds on dead nerve endings. It creates glassy blood scabs when injured and string-like expulsions from the nerves especially around the head (gums etc.)<br/>
I battled it when I was burning off my nerve endings with IV cocaine back in the 90&#39;s - when they were using ether to process cocaine rather than solvents like kerosene or acetone or whatever the hell they use nowadays.<br/>
I have a witness that watched as a nematode just under the surface of my skin made it&#39;s way to a vein in my upper arm and latched on - you can still make out the M shape in that vein and see the scar that made it&#39;s path to this day. I know cocaine psychosis and parasite paranoia and this is NOT it.</p>
