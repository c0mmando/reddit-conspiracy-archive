        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/thegerbilking.html">thegerbilking</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sure most of you are aware of Q anon by now, as he is at nearly 1200 posts, and has quite a following.</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t think this person or group is connected to the White House in any way, you have to admit that they must be extremely adept and knowledgeable about current happenings.</p>

<p>I think the biggest finding so far is the Instagram page of Rachel Chandler. This wasn&#39;t some hidden message that had to be decoded and that you&#39;d need to make a graphic to comprehend. </p>

<p>Someone posted this picture of <a href="https://archive.fo/ymYU8/dc54b5c8763149120a4f9376283d353835b63c45.jpg">Rachel Chandler with Prince Andrew</a>, and Q replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look up Ray.Chandler.</p>

<p>None are safe.</p>

<p>Q</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that ray.chandler is Rachel Chandler&#39;s Instagram handle. How did all of the pizzagate researchers miss this one? Rachel Chandler has also been pictured with Bill Clinton, and is a known associate of Jeffrey Epstein (#carisjames = Caribbean Island of St James aka pedo island, fyi), and many other celebrities. Most people who followed that story have seen those pictures. And her Instagram has been public this whole time - until Q posted about it. </p>

<p>This demonstrates that Q is at the very least a very adept researcher, if not some kind of insider. I won&#39;t link to what was found in the Instagram. Needless to say, it was very bad - much worse than what was found on Comet Ping Pong&#39;s instagram. The worst ones I saw were of a child&#39;s feet dangling in the air as though they were being hanged. </p>

<p>Pizzagate was very widely discussed here when that was all going down, so I&#39;m surprised to see that this wasn&#39;t brought up in a bigger way.</p>

<p>Here are two other recent ..let&#39;s call them coincidences. </p>

<p>On April 10th, they post &quot;A clean House is very important.&quot;</p>

<p>On April 11th, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is all over the news as he doesn&#39;t seek re-election.</p>

<p>On April 3rd, Q posts &quot;We are under attack. WAR. NO DEALS.&quot;</p>

<p>There happened to be a string of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/disturbing-string-aircraft-crashes-in-2018-continues-deadly-trend-for-us-military.html">military aircraft crashes</a> that week.</p>

<p>&quot;Coincidence or silent war?&quot;</p>

<p>There was also this hint about McCain&#39;s exact location before the Syrian false flags: <a href="https://i.redd.it/92nnggvyerq01.jpg">https://i.redd.it/92nnggvyerq01.jpg</a></p>

<p>So why isn&#39;t this more widely discussed? You can find lots more information on <a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> if you&#39;re interested. It&#39;s a very welcoming community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only is he not saving us, but Trump is heavily involved in these Pizzagate type Conspiracy theories. Trump is a friend of Jeffrey Epstein, and was invited to pedophile island Lolita Express on multiple occasions. He is also longtime friends with the Clintons during and after their crimes and he funded Hillary’s Senate campaign. Wake up people, we elected Hillary Clinton. The Wars overseas, no wall, and a multi trillion dollar omnibus spending bill that will surely increase our debt to the deep state bankers. Also has done nothing about NSA spying and has said nothing about Google and Facebook censorship of Conservatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is going to appeal to a certain type of person, the type that want to believe. P-gate isn’t a fringe conspiracy theory as apparently Q wants you to think, as the need for a gradual ‘mass awakening ‘ because the “normies”  aren’t ready for the truth is provided as one of the reasons for the breadcrumb style gradual revealing of information. Hillary talked about it in a prime time tv interview and listed it as one of the reasons she lost.  Everyone has heard about it, and more importantly they have pretty much made up their minds about it either way. Q is a way to herd and corral the people that believe in it, and these are the types of people that were already talking about the Rothschilds before Q ever hit the scene. The theory that Alefantis was secretly a Rothschild was circulating on Twitter and elsewhere way before Q hit the scene for example. Now these people can be labeled tin hat wearers and conspiracy theorists by the msm, and wouldn’t you know it there they are talking about central banking dynasties and possibly other legit angles but it wouldn’t matter because no one would believe them at that point because they were gullible enough to fall for the Q schtick in the first place.  That’s why Q would go out of their way to talk about the Rothschilds  and zionism if it was a psyop by the “deep state”. They get the bonus of labeling Q believers as anti-semites as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all true except you don&#39;t acknowledge that Q is actually giving us good intel. Where is it coming from? How does he obtain this information? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good intel? Are you sure about that? It would be easy for an intel agency to manufacture the “coincidences”, especially after conditioning Q’ers to think that such a thing doesn’t exist in the first place. With Donald ‘I like the heat’ Trump onboard with the plan it would be childs play. Most of the stuff Q references are recycled memes and already discussed conspiracy theories anyway. Here is a conspiracy theory centric rap video from 2012 that features the deep underground military bases meme at the 3:10 mark for example:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jEPFapslSnM">https://youtu.be/jEPFapslSnM</a></p>

<p>Here is a japanese movie from 2014 that features straight up pizzagate and other conspiracy theory references including the Illuminati, cannibalism, the Catholic Church secretly being involved in human sacrifice and devil worship, the concept of ‘divide and conquer’ being used to keep the peasants fighting each other by the the powers that be through the tribalistic nature of hip hop and gang culture, etc...The main villain has an all seeing eye tattooed on his neck btw.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2808986/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2808986/</a></p>

<p>Now here is the kicker, every single one of those themes was discussed in a viral af forum thread from 2008 including the weirdness of Japanese pop culture post WWII, and how it seems like re-programming/brainwashing of Japan by what would now be called globalists. Plus a whole lot of other conspiracy theories. None of this is new or revelatory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched Q from the start. I&#39;m no &quot;head&quot; on the topic. I&#39;ve been following along for a while now.</p>

<p>But I see more of a Nostradamus quatrain thing going on. Like if you feel like digging enough you can start to connect the dots. </p>

<p>IMO the biggest problem is most Q heads are alt right and think there is some Devine power pushing trump and Q is some kind of man of god helping him. In reality I feel like trump is more towards the middle then the alt right. But because he has an R in front of his name the extremes of his party attach to him. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just say in some parallel world  he had a D in front of his name. Had the same crazy personality but was constantly pissing off the right wing and hauled by the left. Q existed, I feel like the left base would have the same passion the right currently does. Q would then be serving there purpose. </p>

<p>So like anything else the people in the middle just kind of write Q off cause there nothing but a string of strings instead of any concert evidence. </p>

They try to paint a false persona of Trump as some kind of pious Christian, some kind of ultra-patriotic military man and savior of the nation. They lead you to a suduko-style puzzle to keep you busy and distracted from noticing how Trump has filled the swamp with the same monstrous creatures the Hildebeest would have chosen.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you&#39;re looking for fictional conspiracy or something that can be filed under entertainment, then you may receive downvotes here. It&#39;s kind of like the MSM and their goal of filling up the place with propaganda and the like.  Mixing fact with fiction won&#39;t result in anything except users who think you may be here to add to that garbage.</p>

<p>Make a choice.</p>
