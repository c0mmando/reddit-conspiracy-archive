       So, allegedly, Eratosthenes discovered earth's radius in 240 BC, and after aprox 1700 years of civilization, which included wars, expeditions, and map making they should have known how small of a place they were occupying (Europe). Then in 1492 they charter a ship to circumnavigate earth but they only go like a 5th of a way there, before they hit the Caribbean and they thought it was India? I thought they knew how big the earth was.  What about the width of America, and ALL of pacific ocean? WTF

       I honestly believe the majority of written history is just elites jerking off to themselves, they never really knew wtf was up. Eurocentrism has always been a big issue in our societies. Western Europe is the same place where the idea you could conquer Russia without preparing for winter played out over and over again. It's the same people that said everyone that wasn't exactly like them were savages.

       The origin of the term "Indian" is debated, and was a much broader term at the time. "India" referred to all of Asia, a huge amount of land that could have many islands still undiscovered and still in need of a name. Even then, Indian could have not been a reference to the region but to how Columbus referred to them in his journal "una gente in Dios", "a people of God", referring to their gentle nature. One thing for sure is, though, is that Columbus did not think he was in the country now known as India.

       The etymology is really easy to look up and it's definitely not from a romance language that uses "independent" or any lingual variant. It's from the Indus River which is, in turn, from something like Shindu, which just meant water.

       Much of the knowledge held by the ancient world, the one of the last 13K years or so anyway, was lost when Rome fell to the illiterate Northern European tribes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This knowledge began to resurface in Europe during the Crusades in particular, and the knowledge held in the Iberian Peninsula by the Muslims who ruled there from about 800AC until Around 1400, just before the explorations.

       It was a slow process that had started as you probably learned earlier by Monks copying what books and papers were still hanging around so they could be passed around and while most of Europe was being converted to Christianity, the Muslims took the Iberian Peninsula and it was the big knowledge and intellectual center of those days, and for the Jewish population there as well.

       Well some people do know stuff.  Some people literally spend their whole lives investigating the truth of current scientific models.  Sciences like history have very large, heavily investigated models - and they really wouldn't stand if they were comprised primarily of bullshit.  That's not to say there isn't a lot of bullshit, but to act like it's all bullshit - well that's just silly.  There actually really are a lot of people in any given academic field that actually care a lot and devote their lives to finding the truth and most of them are not particularly fringe or radical in the beliefs they end up forming.  Again, that's not to say that that there isn't a lot of bullshit - just that it's not all bullshit.  Thinking it is all bullshit is basically thinking that everyone but you is either ignorant, an asshole, or both - when in reality there are tons of people who are better than you and smarter than you at one thing or another.

       This book provides an excellent look at recovering some of the ancient knowledge.  I listened to an audio version free, via the internet and my library. I generally prefer reading, but this book was more enjoyable as audio.

       Basically, Columbus had his own pet theory about the size of the Earth that was at odds with the mainstream opinion. He thought it was a 25% smaller than everyone else did, and he thought that Asia extended much further East than everyone else did as well.

       Is it? Once dumbed downed Catholics had the power to decide which information should be shared and to whom, every bit of information before these dumbed downed idiots came to power got burned because it was considered heretic. Don't tell me you're a Catholic?

       It is a catholic sorted, edited and compiled group of texts. Protestants took some books out of the original one. I don't know why they did it considering it was a direct handwritten work of the catholic god.

       Aktually... Pythagoras first theorized the Earth was round, at least he was the first recorded example. This was around 500BC

        Then in 1492 they charter a ship to circumnavigate earth but they only go like a 5th of a way there, before they hit the Caribbean and they thought it was India? I thought they knew how big the earth was. What about the width of America, and ALL of pacific ocean? WTF

       Well some people do know stuff.  Some people literally spend their whole lives investigating the truth of current scientific models.  Sciences like history have very large, heavily investigated models - and they really wouldn't stand if they were comprised primarily of bullshit.  That's not to say there isn't a lot of bullshit, but to act like it's all bullshit - well that's just silly.  There actually really are a lot of people in any given academic field that actually care a lot and devote their lives to finding the truth and most of them are not particularly fringe or radical in the beliefs they end up forming.  Again, that's not to say that that there isn't a lot of bullshit - just that it's not all bullshit.  Thinking it is all bullshit is basically thinking that everyone but you is either ignorant, an asshole, or both - when in reality there are tons of people who are better than you and smarter than you at one thing or another.
