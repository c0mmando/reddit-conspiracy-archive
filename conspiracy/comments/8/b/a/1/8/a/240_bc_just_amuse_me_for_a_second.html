Then in 1492 they charter a ship to circumnavigate earth but they only go like a 5th of a way there, before they hit the Caribbean and they thought it was India? I thought they knew how big the earth was.  What about the width of America, and ALL of pacific ocean? WTF </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The origin of the term &quot;Indian&quot; is debated, and was a much broader term at the time. &quot;India&quot; referred to all of Asia, a huge amount of land that could have many islands still undiscovered and still in need of a name. Even then, Indian could have not been a reference to the region but to how Columbus referred to them in his journal &quot;una gente in Dios&quot;, &quot;a people of God&quot;, referring to their gentle nature. One thing for sure is, though, is that Columbus did not think he was in the country now known as India.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some people do know stuff.  Some people literally spend their whole lives investigating the truth of current scientific models.  Sciences like history have very large, heavily investigated models - and they really wouldn&#39;t stand if they were comprised primarily of bullshit.  That&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t a lot of bullshit, but to act like it&#39;s all bullshit - well that&#39;s just silly.  There actually really are a lot of people in any given academic field that actually care a lot and devote their lives to finding the truth and most of them are not particularly fringe or radical in the beliefs they end up forming.  Again, that&#39;s not to say that that there isn&#39;t a lot of bullshit - just that it&#39;s not all bullshit.  Thinking it is all bullshit is basically thinking that everyone but you is either ignorant, an asshole, or both - when in reality there are tons of people who are better than you and smarter than you at one thing or another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then in 1492 they charter a ship to circumnavigate earth but they only go like a 5th of a way there, before they hit the Caribbean and they thought it was India? I thought they knew how big the earth was. What about the width of America, and ALL of pacific ocean? WTF</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some people do know stuff.  Some people literally spend their whole lives investigating the truth of current scientific models.  Sciences like history have very large, heavily investigated models - and they really wouldn&#39;t stand if they were comprised primarily of bullshit.  That&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t a lot of bullshit, but to act like it&#39;s all bullshit - well that&#39;s just silly.  There actually really are a lot of people in any given academic field that actually care a lot and devote their lives to finding the truth and most of them are not particularly fringe or radical in the beliefs they end up forming.  Again, that&#39;s not to say that that there isn&#39;t a lot of bullshit - just that it&#39;s not all bullshit.  Thinking it is all bullshit is basically thinking that everyone but you is either ignorant, an asshole, or both - when in reality there are tons of people who are better than you and smarter than you at one thing or another.</p>
