       I have a theory. To breed a new strain of brainwashed sheep to gain power from the people. Take your guns, your rights, your ability to fight back and it's all done by turning the people against each other. This radical leftism didn't happen before 2015. It just sprang out of nowhere as if injected into society and left to spread amongst the weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be real. Obama and his expert team knew that women aren't paid less than men for the same job but he still tried to pass it off as a fact. They know that guns save more lives than they take per year. They know everything we think they don't but it's all theatre. Just a theory though.

       I have this theory that you have fetal alcohol syndrome and have read no more than two books in your life.

       Being anti gun and pro equality of pay is not radical leftism. These are token issues used to divide people.

       Radical leftism involves avowing a differently ordered society around concepts and principles other than property.

       First, stay civil. Secondly, equal pay already exists. It is against the law to pay anyone less for the same job. Men make more as a whole because of men and women's different life choices. It's a biological fact that women are more caring and suited to childcare which is why most women take time off work to spend time with their baby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying you're all for equal pay is great and all but don't go protesting a problem that doesn't exist.

       Here is my thought on that, I think the youtube, facebook, etc. are developing faster than our laws.  These services have become the equivelent of town squares before technology was invented.  Thus if they are going to allow any opinions, they must allow all opinions good or bad

       They do. They do have a right to filter, but they can't turn around and say they're an open platform for all content creators. I'm more upset with the double standards and hypocrisy of the whole censor war.

       Exactly, it's like the BBC (but not funded by my tax to spread misinformation) but a private company. Pretending they are unbias platform for all views and pretending they give equal treatment to their content creators when in reality they do the exact opposite. It's deceptive, it's lying, YouTube is clearly a political activist site now.

       It's not about right. It's about consequences. Of course they have a legal right to do whatever they have a right to do. Even if they do, there will be a decline in open conversation about many ideas and thus a lack of coherence in our collective mind. It will lead be replace more by a centralized decision making process of which information our minds get to see and discuss. This limits us and empowers those who decide what we can see. THAT matters regardless of a red herring that is obvious.

       Often unmentioned cause is adblocker. I have a friend who runs a descent channel. 90% of his watches had adblock. Even his smallish 20,000 subscriber channel would provide him full living income if no one had an adblocker.

       Would it be possible to have a YouTube type service that uses bit-torrents? The huge downside would be that you would have to download a video before you can view it. And you would rely on hundreds to thousands to millions of people willing to seed the files. But it can start niche for videos that don't make it on YouTube, then grow to the place you'd rather share your videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be super cheap to set up and see if it can grow.

       A few weeks ago, just trying to find something to watch on YouTube with a friend, she types in "conspiracy theories" or something right along with those words. We went through like 5 videos before we found something that wasn't "debunking" or completely talking shit about conspiracy theorists. It was fucked up.

       People voluntarily submit their dna into a big database. All of a sudden, you can't get insurance for certain illnesses because someone in your family has the genes that make them susceptible to this illness. Law enforcement can track you down as being somewhere when something went wrong. All sorts of other unintended consequences just because your mother or sister wanted to see what percentage of random minority they are.

       If this is true, it would be extremely easy to compile the data. Compare health insurance denials and increased premiums between people who have used 23&amp;Me and people who haven't.

       Not that may people use 23&amp;Me and it seems very foolish to mine that data to save a few bucks, when it can easily be proven.

       You know how in court they convict people saying "it's one out of a million"  well there are over 7 billion of us. That leaves lots of room for dopplegangers.

       Aprapos anecdotal tale:
      </p>
      <p>
       I was at a bike race once, with my wife, and went up to a woman selling drinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well they hire pretty hot scantily clad women to do this job it seems and I was being nonchalant about checking her out. All of a sudden she goes "Hey Steve!!' and hugs me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't go over too well with the Mrs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say "oh you have me mistaken for someone else"
      </p>
      <p>
       And she hits my arm and goes "Oh, so... Steve!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that there are random people who look alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for YouTube... Yeah it's shit. It was once it started to monetize it started going downhill. Now it's too big for its britches.

       That reminds me of the time my mom and I saw her doppelganger. We were at a stop sign and my mom quickly glanced at the rear view mirror and had to do a double take. She told me look at the woman in the car behind us, and so I did. It was a massive mindfuck seeing my mom in the car behind me and in the car with me at the same time.

       No false memories there, I’ve seen some pretty conclusive evidence of crisis actors in sandy hook and Boston bombings. I love the 9:11 crisis actor who seemed to know the towers came down because of fire before any civil engineers had a chance to pretend to investigate. I couldn’t believe how blatant it was. It was so blatant and obvious I’m just shocked there wasn’t more people demanding answers.

       Interviews done on the day of an incident are also not good source material.  Nobody is sure what happened yet, everyone has a theory, confusion and fog of war reigns.  Reporters are desperate to grab headlines and ratings, so they'll grab a hold of whatever they can find that seems juicy and try to sell it.

       Yeah well we can all have differing opinions as to what that shows. Fell because of structural failure mostly due to fires ?

       And the fact he is an actor ?  That’s not disputed that’s a fact. Doesn’t it strike you as a little strange ?  You’re probably not paid to find it strange so I’ll not worry about the answer. But still.

       Yrah. As I was watching the towers burn, I was worried myself about the girders holding up under that fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the first one fell. I felt ill. I had been right, the structure couldn't take it.

       Ahh, okay, I did some googleing.   I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       you're referring to some sort of "10 falling floors should only collapse the 10 floors below them" thing, which has nothing to do with Newton's laws in the first place.   Maybe you can explain how that term got applied?
If you think that is an "Action and reaction" thing, then you need to review Newton's laws, as you've got a fundamental misunderstanding of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's use some round numbers.  You slag the 90th floor of a 100-story building.  The 89th floor is designed to take the static load of the 10 floors above it.  It is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       designed to take the dynamic load of decelerating those 10 floors once they start moving.  So it collapses, too.  Buildings are not vehicles, they are not designed with crumple zones, nor are they designed to act as brakes.   To do so would be a massive increase in weight and cost, and would make skyscrapers impractical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, to the 88th floor.  It's now got the dynamic load of 11 floors falling on it. It, too, was designed for static load, so it goes.  12 floors fall and hit the 87th.  The weight of the debris in motion keeps increasing. An already-crumbled floor has the same weight as an intact floor, but no longer adsorbs any energy itself, so the effects get worse every time a floor collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm having to take guesses on your vague comments to Newton, so I can't tell if I'm even addressing your concerns.

       A "hammer" is the wrong analogy.  A hammer delivers the same force every time it is swung.  In the case of a collapsing building, the force is
       <em>
        increasing
       </em>
       every time the weight of a new floor is added.  Hammers do not get heavier each time they strike.

       But that's not what happened.   The 10th floor of the building is not going to survive when the 90 floors above get crumbled into rubble and drop on it.

       At no point is a "smaller" object hitting a "bigger" object.

      <p>
       Back to the analogy:  Take out the 90th floor.  You now have 10 floors landing on one floor, then 89th.  It collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have 11 floors landing on the 88th.  It collapses.

      <p>
       Now 12 land on the 87th.  It collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to look at it: 
Chop off floors 100 thru 88 and put them on the ground as a 12 story building.   Slag the 2nd floor.  It, plus the top 10, crush the first floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reset to an intact building and add another floor. Take out the same one.  11 floors crush one, then 12 floors crush the new 1st floor.

       Where did you get the impression I thought 9:11 wasn’t real ?  I said there was a crisis actor (yes it was confirmed he was an actor by the way) interviewed on the day of 9:11 on the street saying how the towers came down “by the fires” in an attempt to instill the nonsense that they came down by fires.  It’s on the net somewhere I just can’t find it (like the post here suggests they have been removed but why ?)

       You don't understand, let me explain. A couple years a go if I searched for conspiracy theories I would get them and with no filter. Now, if you search for conspiracy theories they actively try to suppress it and immediately claim it's false (hence the "Fact Check" system that links to a Wikipedia that "debunks" them straight away)
      </p>
      <p>
       When you search "crisis actor" they show you their mouthpiece for taking your ability to fight back, David Hogg, and give you searches to convince you he isn't a crisis actor (wether he is or not I don't know) even though he has said that he both was and wasn't at the school as the shooting took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they are stopping people watching what they don't want people to see and claim that they are an unbias platform for all.

       Youtube have made public statements about changing algorithms to deliver fewer videos from 'questionable sources'. Its not blatant agenda pushing its a public stance designed to stop the site from losing money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even 'alternative news sources' as main stream as Phillip DeFranco have mentioned issues with their videos no longer showing up on the front page, even for subscribers, or trending.

       One time I tried to find flat earth videos where flat earthers explain why they believe what they believe on Youtube and I was redirected to all these videos that prove the earth isn't flat and videos making fun of stupid claims made by people who were obviously trolling and made for kids. I understand the evidence that explains why the world is not flat and I believe it, but I just wanted to see what flat-earthers believed. Instead of popular videos where the flat-earthers explain their beliefs, I am directed to big corporations that making it a joke. I don't care whether you understand basic physics and science to support round earth, or just believe in a flat earth with based on your ideas, but I think we can all agree that censorship is getting worse.

       In regards to the flat earth theory, "flat" refers to the earth not being a sphere. It does not mean the earth is flat in a literal sense. With this in mind, the earth could be both "flat" and hollow...think of a conical shape as just one example where the center portion is hollowed out beneath the surface.

       I wonder if people who watch videos on the Apollo missions get recommended videos on how it was fake. The same with people who watch outer space and Earth videos, do they get recommended videos that offer an alternative Earth shape theory? Because I get videos recommended to me all the time about how the Moon Landing totally happened, and Earth is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       a spinning ball nothing to see here, debunking flat earth and so on. I have a feeling these recommendations are lopsided. It's okay, because for most conspiracy theory-minded people the corporatocracy trying so hard is just further evidence of a conspiracy to hide the truth, and will only eventually backfire on them.

       Okay so I don't buy any of this crisis actor bullshit. I will however talk about YouTube. You realize that one the moment you upload something on YouTube they own it and there for have the right to do what ever they want with it right? And two, that YouTube is by no means the only video streaming site on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might think that YouTube has some moral responsibility to provide a even platform for free speech but there terms of service totally disagrees with you. YouTube has guidelines and whatnot but these are not etched in stone, and are loose and open to interpretation. Like how nudity is banned from YouTube but you can find videos on breast feeding. Really though you give them the right to remove a video for literally any reason the second you upload it on there site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call it censorship, disagree with what they consider factual, stomp your feet, only use LiveLeak. YouTube always has and always will reserve the right to remove any video for any reason. As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure every streaming video site on the internet reserves that right. Sites like Streamable and LiveLeak just choose not to try and steer the direction of content. Upload a video of a murder that is currently being investigated or some child porn and watch how fast those sites swing the banhammer.

       Sandy hook is like that. I started researching it sometime last year. Videos and everything were easy to find. Then suddenly they have either been removed, or made impossible to find with the search functionality.

       Yesterday I was looking for a single fucking video calling out the rapper “Logic” who is quite possibly the music industry’s own little antichrist. Not only are there no negative videos of this guy, there are virtually no negative comments on any of his interviews or songs.

       The dude is a saint what the fuck are you on about? Have you ever seen any of his interviews? He’s got great morals and spreads an incredibly positive message. It’s not strange to me that nobody is hating on him, it
       <em>
        is

       Why would celebrities want to symbolize the devil and pedophilia in their music videos? What purpose would that serve other than to let others know their secret agendas? What agenda would that even be? I think you’re over analyzing things man, and definitely giving these artists wayyy too much credit when it comes to their secret agendas. Bathtubs and mirrors are common within every single household it’s not weird that they show up in several music videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m all for symbolism and digging deeper but only in cases where it makes sense. None of the celebrities you listed are even smart enough to use symbolism in their videos to portray some dark message. You can watch literally any video and come up with a crazy conspiracy about the “symbolism” used if you claim common items are symbolizing some deeper message.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really think about what you’re saying, given the “symbols” you provided, you’re pretty much claiming that all of Hollywood and the music industry is one
       <em>
        giant
       </em>
       conspiracy pushing the agenda of the devil through symbolism that
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       even notices except for people like you who are
       <em>
        looking
       </em>
       for a deeper meaning when there isn’t one. There are thousands of videos with snakes in them, maybe some are symbolizing the devil, but I guarantee the majority of them are not.

       You’ve brain washed yourself by eating up every conspiracy theory you read buddy. People over at r/insanepeoplefacebook found your delusions laughable actually. But I guess we’re all just brainwashed sheep and you’re an all-knowing 14 year old YouTube conspiracy theorist with all of this speculated “evidence” to prove us wrong so what do we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, support conspiracy theories that actually have hard evidence, not loosely formed theories that are so far fetched you’d get thrown into a mental institution just for talking about it with family or in public. Supporting theories that are concocted from merely symbols and speculation is a dark road you don’t want to go down. It’ll leave you questioning every aspect of reality and destroy any sliver of sanity you still have left. Supporting those theories serves you no benefit other than giving yourself a sense of superiority and it’s just not healthy.

       I haven't read through their Terms of Service.  Since YouTube is a private company it would strike me as odd that they would be under any obligation to guarantee that you could find anything you want using whatever search terms you deem appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an old guy, so I guess I don't understand all of this completely.  If I go to a grocery store to find "Sugar Fruit Crunch" and find that they don't carry "Sugar Fruit Crunch", I feel no compulsion to go on the internet and bitch about how my grocery store is conspiring to deny people access to "Sugar Fruit Crunch".  I tell the manager.  And if he tells me to "go pound sand" my only recourse is to shop elsewhere.  That store is a private enterprise and can sell what they please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last I checked, YouTube is a private enterprise as well.  They allow what they allow and provide an interface that gives you access to whatever they make available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally... I'm glad that people have posted videos on how to lay engineered hardwood flooring and tile a bathroom shower.  Saved me thousands.
      </p>
      <p>
       It strikes me that there is a generation out there that expects that everything they want should be available instantly to them online.  And if it isn't, then it is because of some grand conspiracy against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube owes you nothing.  And I'm just guessing that they probably don't give a rip whether you are able to find "flat earth/David Hogg/Fake Moon Landing" videos that satisfy your need for instant gratification or not.

       With all due respect, what are you even talking about here? I'm saying they claim that they are an unbias platform for all views and opinions and that everyone gets equal treatment when this is measurably false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes they are a private company, but they shouldn't lie about the fact they clearly want to push a certain agenda and censor others.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were honest and said "yh we are a left wing platform pushing left wing ideals", like Twitter should do as they claim they are unbias, same as Facebook then there would be no problems but it's fundamentally deceptive and disingenuous to say you're for all opinions and then immediately dismiss and suppress those they deem bad.

       You are looking for a couple old videos that conclusively proved that MSM used the same people under different names for different tragedies.  And you couldn't find them using a variety of search methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know for a fact that they exist?  If so... how do you know this?

       It is possible that they were deleted by the authors (or taken down for other reasons by youtube).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also possible that youtube is manipulating search results to hide things that don't fit the narrative. In this case, it appears that certain subjects that are conservative are hidden, while an alternative viewpoint is put to the top of the list.  Twitter was just caught red-handed doing this, so it does happen.

       Interviews done on the day of an incident are also not good source material.  Nobody is sure what happened yet, everyone has a theory, confusion and fog of war reigns.  Reporters are desperate to grab headlines and ratings, so they'll grab a hold of whatever they can find that seems juicy and try to sell it.

       A "hammer" is the wrong analogy.  A hammer delivers the same force every time it is swung.  In the case of a collapsing building, the force is
       <em>
        increasing
       </em>
       every time the weight of a new floor is added.  Hammers do not get heavier each time they strike.

       Okay.... I think whomever wrote that is making an assumption that all of the debris is cleanly ejected out the sides of the building.   That would change things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not what happened.   The 10th floor of the building is not going to survive when the 90 floors above get crumbled into rubble and drop on it.

       At no point is a "smaller" object hitting a "bigger" object.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the analogy:  Take out the 90th floor.  You now have 10 floors landing on one floor, then 89th.  It collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you have 11 floors landing on the 88th.  It collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now 12 land on the 87th.  It collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to look at it: 
Chop off floors 100 thru 88 and put them on the ground as a 12 story building.   Slag the 2nd floor.  It, plus the top 10, crush the first floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reset to an intact building and add another floor. Take out the same one.  11 floors crush one, then 12 floors crush the new 1st floor.
