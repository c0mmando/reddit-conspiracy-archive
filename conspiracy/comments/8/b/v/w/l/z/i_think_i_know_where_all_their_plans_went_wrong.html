    <div class="md"><p>I think they didn&#39;t quite anticipate the success of Netflix and the like. Blockbuster had the opportunity to buy Netflix, and they refused. Old Media didn&#39;t see the Reality, and didn&#39;t accept that People would prefer, when given the choice, to binge their favorite shows and watch them at their own time- outside of the TV&#39;s rigid schedule. TiVo and DVR also helped to exacerbate this trend imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well aside from all that. If they had kept key shows around it would have crippled Netflix. Especially if the price of cable had been reasonable.</p>

<p>They Cancelled Firefly, Enterprise, Dead Like me, TSSC, Dark Angel, V, Heroes, KyleXY, Roswell....etc..etc</p>

<p>Who knows why all these great shows were cancelled. But it sure hurt the platform. After the cancellation of Firefly,and Enterprise I was for sure looking for a way out of Cable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no no, you get the whole thing wrong, cause that is the &quot;American dream idea&quot;, like the Netflix dude had a good idea and that&#39;s it.<br/>
No no no, there were multiple streaming platforms on the internet and Megaupload was the king of them.<br/>
Netflix is just the by product of stealing an idea and jailing his author to then centralize the business and spread your propaganda freely.<br/>
So first you have the business idea from real geezers (Megaupload with Kim, or Napster with that dude, Myspace with whomever) and then you get the monopoly business idea from &quot;THEM&quot; (Netflix with a jew, Spotify with whomever, Facebook with the Zucc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Even though they absolutely own and control YouTube and Reddit, there’s no way they could moderate it like with TV because everyone is given a platform and there are so many videos that it’s near impossible to moderate, plus you can just make a backup account if they delete you. </p>

<p>I’m extremely surprised by the awakening that has occurred just within the last few days. I don’t know, maybe it’s just me but it seems like the awakening is happening at an exponential level. The news media’s coverage of Syria has been a colossal fuck up of the highest order. It’s the stupidest thing they’ve done in my lifetime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Holy shit, sorry for the novel; this is just way more interesting than spreadsheets and e-mails. TL;DR at bottom)</p>

<p>While I&#39;m definitely pumped to see topics like this get brought up/discussed on a broader scale, I&#39;m pretty wary of this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I worry that tossing out info on these operations/events/theories/people without proper consideration to context/their significance, it just kind of &quot;subconsciously&quot; registers in the audience&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to have 2 line mention of MK Ultra in 2 or 3 different episodes of Stranger Things and a series on MK Ultra that acts as more of a character story.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like how The Punisher references some CIA torture programs; if that&#39;s the only time you&#39;ve heard of Operation Cerberus (or whatever it was), then how is that brief aside enough to really help counter the bullshit that&#39;s out there?</p>

<p>To me, it seems like a quiet, quick mention to &quot;familiarize&quot; people with &quot;dubious&quot; terms/info in advance of when MSM/Gov&#39;t. (if there&#39;s actually a difference) need to attack those ideas and can make BS soundbites/memes, out of it (like &quot;Oh man, MK Ultra? Someone&#39;s been watching too much stranger things! *Hurr Durr.&quot; Or &quot;The government doesn&#39;t torture like that; that&#39;s just sensationalized comic book stuff - move on.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, kinda reminds me of how overshadowing stuff with the same name might be a tactic. The example that comes to mind for me is how former FBI (translator?)/whistleblower Sibel Edmonds&#39; memoires (for which I believe a documentary was made) is called &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;; same title as the Jeremy Renner movie about Gary Webb, from a few years ago.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong; Gary Webb was the man and I was pumped to see it get any attention, but from the perspective of TBTB, what&#39;s the bigger risk for the public to see? Both involve people exposing collusion between intelligence services, organized crime, global narcotics trade, and international terrorism, but one of these is basically an interview from an actual insider and one is an MSM-produced, intentionally open-ended suspense flick with a beloved action star.</p>

<p>Idk, typing that makes me feel kinda crazy, but after learning about Edward Bernaise and the development of the Public Relations/Human Resources industries, I no longer have doubts about such sneaky, base-level manipulation, going on. I mean, the US Military has psyops branches for a reason; they wouldn&#39;t dump the money in it, if it didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Popular references to historical/contemporary conspiracy shit is a mixed bag; do they inform people of these things or just give then the most basic information so that they can interpret and regurgitate targeted/pre-programmed views, later on? Probably both, but I&#39;m wary that it&#39;s for our benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea for $40/mo I would probably still have cable. I don&#39;t know if it was greed but I feel like channels like the Hallmark channel and other niche channels operate at a loss and are propped up by the networks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be so quick to declare victory.</p>

<p>Yes, they lost control. While they still have many tools and many tactics, they no longer hold an unassailable monopoly on what information people get.</p>

<p>Except now we live in the age of &quot;post truth&quot;. Everyone&#39;s opinion is equal. Everyone has a platform. Everyone has an agenda. There is a demagogue or an &#39;agent provocateur&#39; around every corner.</p>

<p>Just because a media outlet is &quot;alternative&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it is a trustworthy source. We have lost any kind of commonly agreed upon baseline reality, and people just believe whatever suits them. Most of these new narratives are put out by content creators who just want money from clicks and take zero responsibility for what they are presenting as &quot;facts&quot;. </p>

<p>Critical thinking is dead. The truth has in many cases become unknowable, because the flood of unfiltered information makes it impossible to discern. <em>But we think we know it and fight to defend it.</em></p>

<p>I bet this post made a few of you angry. Good.</p>

<p>They have lost for now, but we didn&#39;t win. </p>
