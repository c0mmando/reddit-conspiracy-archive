    <div class="md"><p>Historical rule of Rome and Roman Papacy over Jews; their anti-Jewish actions and sentiments:
Romans were ruling the land of Israel in Jesus&#39; time. In AD30, Romans crucified Jesus Christ knowing He was guiltless. Soon after that, Romans fed hungry lions with living Christians, and burned them alive as torches to light up the city. Rome then sacked Jerusalem and the Temple of God in 70AD, slaughtered thousands of God&#39;s chosen people and sold them into slavery all over the Roman Empire. In AD135, the Romans crushed the revolt of Shimon Bar Kokhba, during which Jerusalem and Judea were regained and the area of Judea was renamed Palaestina in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land of Israel...</p>

<p>After Rome converted to Roman Catholicism, it continued its Jew-hatred through its Canon Law to persecute Jews for 1200 years, from Synod of Elvira in 306 to Council of Basel in 1434. The the Jesuits fueled the Vatican hatred to its peak –– the Nazi Holocaust.</p>

<p>Then on 14 July 1555 came the Papal bull Cum nimis absurdum, which condemned all the Jews to eternal slavery, and forced all of Rome to live in the ghetto, a walled quarter with three gates that were locked at night. The Jews must pay for the construction of the ghetto built in the most undesirable quarters of the city, subject to constant flooding by the Tiber River. The total area amounted to three hectares, where at the time of Sixtus V roughly 3,500 inhabitants were living in inhuman conditions.</p>

<p>Life in the Roman Ghetto was one of crushing poverty, due to the severe restrictions placed upon the occupations that Jews were allowed to perform. Roman Jews were allowed to work only at unskilled jobs, such as ragmen, secondhand dealers or fish mongers. They were permitted to be pawnbrokers which had been prohibited to Christians; and this activity excited the hatred of many Christians against them.</p>

<p>When Jews went outside the ghetto, the men had to wear a yellow cloth (the &quot;sciamanno&quot;), and the women a yellow veil (the same color worn by prostitutes). During the feasts they had to amuse the Christians, competing in humiliating games. They had to run naked, with a rope around the neck, or with their legs closed into sacks. Sometimes they were also ridden by soldiers.</p>

<p>Jews had to petition annually for permission to live there. They paid a yearly tax for the privilege. Jews of Rome were required to swear yearly loyalty to the Pope at the Arch of Titus, which celebrates the Roman sack of Jerusalem of 70 CE. Each year, on the Campidoglio, the Rabbi had to pay homage to the chief of the city councillors (&quot;Caporione&quot;), receiving by him in exchange for it a kick to his bottom. This &quot;ceremony&quot; meant that the Jewish community had been allowed to stay one more year in Rome. Every Saturday, the Jewish community was forced to hear compulsory sermons in front of the small church of San Gregorio a Ponte Quattro Capi, just outside the wall.</p>

<p>Paul IV&#39;s successor, Pope Pius IV (1559-1565), enforced the creation of other ghettos in most Italian towns, and his successor, Pope Pius V (1566-1572), recommended them to other bordering states. (Wikipedia, May 20, 2015)</p>

<p>Jesuit La Civiltà Cattolica magazine inciting anti-Jewish fury from its inception in the mid 1800s until World War II (second half of the Jesuit&#39;s Second Thirty Years War):
&quot;Judaism still aims for world domination.&quot; La Civiltà Cattolica 1890
Jews are described as &quot;a depraved race&quot; and &quot;an enemy of mankind.&quot; La Civiltà Cattolica 1890
Hitler&#39;s first anti-Semitic pamphlets were published by the Christian Socialists which reprinted several articles from La Civiltà Cattolica
In 1914 the Jesuit journal La Civiltà Cattolica described Jews as drinking blood as if it was milk in the context of killing Christian children.
A 1920 article in La Civiltà Cattolica described Jews as &quot;the filthy element&quot; who &quot;were avid for money&quot; and who wanted to &quot;proclaim the communist republic tomorrow.&quot;
Der Stürmer (a weekly tabloid-format Nazi newspaper, 1923-1945) printed a special edition dedicated to &quot;Jewish ritual murder&quot; which included extensive quotations from &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot;.In 1934, La Civiltà Cattolica equates Jews with Freemasons, describing Jews as the &quot;relentless irreconcilable enemies of Christ and of Christianity, particularly of integral and pure Christianity, the Catholicism of the Roman Church&quot;
In 1936, La Civiltà Cattolica reported that &quot;if not all, still not a few Jews constitute a grave and permanent danger to society&quot; because of their economic and political influence.
In 1936 La Civiltà Cattolica quoted a fellow Jesuit to prove that Jews were &quot;uniquely endowed with the qualities of parasites.
A series of articles in 1937 expanded on the theme of Jews who were &quot;a foreign body that irritates and provokes the reaction of the organism it has contaminated.&quot;
La Civiltà Cattolica in 1938 wrote that Hungary could be saved from the Jews, who were &quot;disastrous for the religious, moral, and social life of the Hungarian people&quot;, only if the government &quot;forbids [Jewish] foreigners to enter the country&quot;
The new Italian race laws revoked the citizenship of anyone of Jewish race who had acquired Italian citizenship after 1918, ordering those who were not citizens to leave the country within six months. La Civiltà Cattolica September 1938
In September 1938, three weeks after the Italian government marked all foreign Jews for expulsion and Jews were being harried and terrorised, La Civiltà Cattolica published and article asserting that &quot;anti-Christian sectarians&quot; who had granted Jews equality had brought together freemasonry and Judaism &quot;in persecuting the Catholic Church and elevating the Jewish race over Christians as much in hidden power as in manifest opulence.&quot;
In 1941 and 1942 La Civiltà Cattolica accused the Jews of being &quot;Christ Killers&quot; and being involved with ritual murder.
Michael Phayer notes that La Civiltà Cattolica continued to publish &quot;slander about the Jews even while they were being murdered en masse by German mobile killing squads.﻿

    <div class="md"><p>David Kertzer&#39;s book &quot;The Popes Against the Jews&quot; page 267 &quot;In France the main champion of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and the best known exponent of Catholic anti-Semitisim in the 1920&#39;s, was Father Ernest Jouin, a man who had come to devote his life to alerting his fellow Catholics to the Jewish Threat. In publishing the forgery in France in 1920, he was able to sign his foreward, aimed at establishing the work&#39;s authenticity, &quot;E.Jouin, Prelate of His Holiness&quot;, for Pope Benedict XV had honored Jouin with the recognition of his work on behalf the Church. Jouin&#39;s prominence in the French Catholic campaign against the Jews dated back to 1912, when he began the Revue Internationale des Societes Secretes (International Review of Secret Societies). The following year he founded the French-Catholic League, of which he remained president the rest of his life. Both the Journal and league were motivated by his desire to serve the Church. He sought only he said, to follow the Pope&#39;s injunction that the clergy battle the forces that were conspiring to destroy Christianity. His special obsession was the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy, and, in a speech to the Congress of the Anti-Judeomasonic League in 1929, he proudly took credit for hving been the one to coin the term &quot;Judeomasonic&quot; nine years earlier. He proclaimed &quot;Israel is King, the Mason is his helper, the Bolshevik his executioner. The Jew believes in the world domination of his race&quot;. Jouin&#39;s harping on the supposed Jewish Masonic conspiracy was in harmony with the devolpments of the German anti-Semitic movement.&quot;</p>

<p>David Kertzer The Popes Against the Jews page 273: &quot; Indeed, the seeds of Catholic anti-Semitism in Austria that had been planted with the Vatican&#39;s help in the last two decades of the nineteenth century continued to bear fruit in years following the First World War. A widely distributed lecture by a well known Jesuit curator, Victor Kolb, reflects the tenor of Austrian Catholic attitude toward the Jews as the war began. At a meeting of the Catholic organization Piusverin(Puis Association), an organization devoted to promoting the Catholic press in Austria, Father Kolb warned of the dangers facing the country. &quot;Wherever you look, you always see Judaism&#39;s work, a conscious work, backed by unlimited means, always aimed at supremacy in every form&quot;. It was well to remember the motto of the Pius Association, he thundered &quot;protection of the German people, internally and externally, From Jewish penetration from the destructive work of the Jews&quot;. Kolb&#39;s speech was immediately translated into Italian and printed at the request of Father Wladimir Ledochowshi( the future black pope!!!), the Polish priest soon to become head of the Jesuit order worldwide. He had copies of the speech distributed throughout the Vatican.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Kertzers book pages 135-136 : &quot;The notion that the Jews were secretly conspiring to achieve world domination is another of the pillars of the modern anti-Semitic movements that took shape in the late nineteenth century and would later nourish Nazism itself. But the theme of a vast Jewish conspiracy against Christian society was far from new. In the fourteenth century it surfaced during the Black Death, when throughout Europe people slaughtered Jews suspected of having spread the disease out of their hatred for Christians. But at that time the Popes had defended the Jews against such allegations. Now in the last decades of the nineteenth century, it was the Vatican itself that was spreading such theories of evil Jewish conspiracies, with Civilta Cattolica taking the lead.</p>

<p>In earlier incarnations of such conspiracy theories, people had focused on rabbis and Jewish ritual specialists. But now the greatest threat came from Jews who had become atheists and freethinkers , the secularized Jews. These, [Jesuit Civilta Cattolica director] Oreglia argued, retained &quot;all their ancient hatred of Christianity.&quot; It was they who formed &quot;the principal nucleus of the secret sects that are now ascendant and which threaten the ruin and the extermination of all Christian society.&quot; Such sects &quot;express that anger, that vendetta and that satanic hate that the Jew harbors against those who - unjustly, he believes - deprive him of that absolute domination over the entire universe that he Jewishly believes God have him.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Popes Against the Jews David Kertzer page 285 : &quot;n an 1893 article titled &quot;Jewish Morality,&quot; another Jesuit author, father Saverio Rodina, listed all the charges aimed against the Jews in Europe, ranging from fraudulent banking practices to charges of murder. Together with the mushrooming anti-Semetic movement, he wrote, these accusations &quot;invite us to return to an argument that for over a decade we have treated at great length in this journal, but whose timeliness and importance...are now greater than ever.&quot;</p>

<p>A clearer statement of the themes of modern anti-Semitism would be hard to find. The Jewish nation, Father Rodina wrote, &quot;does not work, but traffics in the property and the work of others; it does not produce, but lives and grows fat with the products of the arts and industry of the nations that give it refuge. It is the giant octopus that with its oversized tentacles envelops everything. It has its stomach in the banks...in the postal services and telegraph companies, in shipping and in the railroads, in the town treasuries and in state finance. It represents the kingdom of capital...the aristocracy of gold...It reigns unopposed.&quot;</p>

<p>Here modern anti-Semitism rises directly out of older Church views; the Jews&#39; emancipation is the catalyst that transforms the earlier forms into the new.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Germany&#39;s Catholic population would find the notion of a Jewish conspiracy wholly believable should hardly be a surprise. For years, the Vatican-vetted La Civilita Cattolica - among many other Church publications - had warned that Jews were the evil force behind a dangerous conspiracy. They were said to be the secret masters of both Communism and capitalism, all aimed at enslaving Christians. The only notable difference in the Nazi version - other than the additional layer of pseudobiology - was the omission of the Protestants.</p>

<p>Among the most influential Vatican figures pushing this conspiracy theory was Wlodzimierz Lodochowski, head of the Jesuit Order. In a handwritten letter in 1936, Ledochowski urged the pope to issue a worldwide warning about the &quot;terrible danger that grows more menacing each day.&quot; The danger came from Moscow&#39;s atheistic Communist propaganda - all the product of Jews, he said - while &quot;the great world press, it too under Jewish control, barely speaks of it....A encyclical on this argument,&quot; he advised, would, &quot;lead not only the Catholics but others as well to a more energetic and better organized resistance.&quot;</p>

<p>Sharing Ledochowski&#39;s belief that Communism posed a grave danger, Pius XI agreed to have a special encyclical prepared and, over the following months, frequently sent him drafts for his comments and suggestions. Unhappy that they said nothing about the Jews, Ledochowski kept pushing the pope to add language linking them to the Communist danger. &quot;It seems necessary to us in such an encyclical,&quot; he advised, in reaction to one such draft, &quot;to at least make an allusion to the Jewish influence, being certain that not only were the intellectual authors of communism (Marx, Lassalle, etc) all Jews, but also that the communist movement in Russia was staged by Jews. And now, too, although not always openly in every region, if you look more deeply into it, it is the Jews who are the primary champions and promoters of communist propaganda.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he charge that Jews were the evil force behind a worldwide conspiracy against Christianity and European civilization had long been heard in the Vatican; the Jesuits of La Civilita cattolica were among its most avid proponents.</p>

<p>A feature article, titled &quot;The World revolution and the Jews&quot; had appeared in the Vatican-supervised journal in late October 1922, as the Facists were marching on Rome. It described a world in chaos, where secret forces orchestrated labor strikes and unrest in pursuit of the goal of Communist revolution. The credulous masses participating in the revolts were mere stooges, manipulated by an occult power that showed telltale signs of coming from &quot;the ghetto.&quot;</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The 1922 article has great significance, for its argument would be used by the Nazis as a central justification for their anti-Semitic campaign. Taken up by Church publication throughout Italy and beyond, the myth that the Russian revolutionary leaders were virtually all Jewish - and not &quot;real Russians&quot; - became one of the most important, and deadly, rationales for government action action against Europe&#39;s Jews.</p>

<p>The next issue of La Civilita cattolica, the first to appear after Mussloni came to power, carried news from Austria under the headline &quot;Jewish-Masonic Socialism Tyrannizes Austria.&quot; Following the Great War, the journal reported, Vienna&#39;s nineteen Masonic lodges had formed a Grand Lodge. &quot;All of its high functionaries, without exception, were Jews.&quot; Their goal was to rule the world &quot;under the domination of the Masons, themselves under the Jews&#39; power.&quot; IF the Jews in Vienna got their way, the journal warned &quot;Vienna will be nothing but a Jewish city, houses, houses and belongings will all be theirs, the Jews will be the bosses and lords, the Christians their servants.&quot; Austria, La Civilita cattolica concluded, &quot;will be absolutely the subject, tributary and slave of the Jews, this in short the guiding idea of our socialist Jewish-Masonic leaders.&quot;</p>

<p>The belief in a worldwide conspiracy of Jews, Masons, and Protestants was not one that Mussloni shared at the time, but in the next years the pope&#39;s Jesuit emissary Tacchi Venturi would employ all his powers to persuade him to see the world in these terms.</p>

<p>David Kertzer, The Pope and Mussolini, pg. 193-194</p>

<p>Alas, wrote [Jesuit] father Oreglia, people had not followed the Church&#39;s teachings and had come to regret it. &quot;The Jews - eternal insolent children, obstinate, dirty, thieves, liars, ignoramuses, pests and the scourges of those near and far - ...immediately abused [their newfound freedom] to interfere with that of others. They managed to lay their hands on...all public wealth ...and virtually alone they took control not only of all the money...but of the law itself in those countries where they have been allowed to hold public offices.&quot; Yet, Father Oreglia continued, despite all this the Jews had the nerve to complain that they were being persecuted &quot;at the first shout by anyone who dares raise his voice against the barbarian invasion by an enemy race, hostile to Christianity and to society in general.&quot;</p>
