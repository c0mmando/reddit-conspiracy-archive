<blockquote>
<p>Facebook today unveiled a project from its secretive Building 8 research group that’s working to create a brain-computer interface that lets you type with your thoughts. Regina Dugan, a former director of DARPA and the ex-head of Google’s experimental ATAP research group, announced the news today onstage at Facebook’s F8 developer conference. Dugan, who now heads up Building 8, says the goal is “something as simple as a yes-no brain click” that could fundamentally change how we interact with and use technology. While it does not exist today outside of very specific medical research trials, Dugan says her team is actively working to make it a reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do it through scarier means, IMO. They know who you are friends with. They know location data. They know almost all your online habits. So if you are searching for product X, and it is tangential to product Y and someone you are physically close to for a period of time just bought Y, they will assume you also want product Y as well. So if you see someone with a new watch, FB knows they just bought it online and you were close to them, then they assume you also might be interested in that watch, even if you never spoke of it to anyone. This is a simplified answer, but it is crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope I can explain this properly. Ask questions if I don’t.</p>

<p>Me and three friends wanted food. We didn’t want to drive. The places we wanted food didn’t deliver. We were searching Google for a third-party solution.</p>

<p>We couldn’t find the business we wanted because it had gone out of business. And so we were searching things like does Uber deliver food. Can you get a taxi to get you beer and pizza. Things of that nature. What is the business that used to deliver food? Etc etc</p>

<p>So as this is happening a friend of mine on Facebook messenger messages me and says hey do you know about XXX business? I wanted you to know because I thought you’d like it. They do delivery of any place you want.</p>

<p>The girl has never pitched a product to me in her life. I am mediately thought she had been hacked or something. She lives Away and we don’t communicate much.</p>

<p>And I kept thinking what in the heck. How could they even do this. Did something on her screen flash about me and this business at the same time enough to connect in her brain to reach out to me?</p>

<p>And I’ve often found that certain situations bring up Spanish ads. I’m not sure what combination of information. It’s more than just a mic though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn that is more intense than what I was thinking about. But it is insane what triggers in our brains. Not facebook related, but my wife and I both smoke. We usually smoke L&amp;M&#39;s but one day we both brought home Winstons because we decided independently that we wanted a no additive cigarette. We hadn&#39;t discussed this previously and didn&#39;t recall any ads recently. We just both had an idea to try a new brand and picked the same one for the same reasons. Something had to trigger that. It could have been coincidence, but man that is a long shot.</p>

<p>For the record, before I am called a shill, my wife thinks Winstons suck and switched back the next day.</p>

Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re definitely doing shady shit.

<p>This is the scary part of data mining, the enormous volume of data being able to predict things by correlating events a human mind can’t even begin to see the pattern in.  It’s annoying when it is advertising, it will be different once they start using probabilities to try and get warrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true that they could know, assuming you use your gmail account that you are normally logged into as the email you use for Amazon. This also assumes that they scrape email with AI specific commands like &quot;Hey look for their Amazon purchases (or emails that look like purchase confirmations), and make a list of those specific things they purchase&quot;, rather than having those scrapes just gather key words that influence how they treat your profile when it comes to serving ads to you. The former could very well be true. I personally think it is likely that they do the former, but don&#39;t know it to the point that I would state it as fact. </p>

<p>I also think it is possible that the ability of the Google assistant that you speak of has that data scraped specifically for that one app&#39;s functionality. In the case that you had given permission to the Google assistant to do so, based on your &quot;I know that I&#39;ve had Google assistant or whatever scrape...&quot;, I would think that it is even more likely that it is app specific.</p>

<p>It is also true that they could use Chrome to do this, though I think this is extremely unlikely that they do based on having not seen similar cases (chrome scraping large amounts of data based on anything visited), having not seen this as a goal or purpose of them creating chrome both to their investors or the public, and having not seen data that suggests that browsers are uploading this information to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it like this, there&#39;s 2 forms of data.  Hard data, and soft data.  Hard data is tangible information, likes dislikes, location, gender, race, etc..  These are the kinds of things Facebook openly admits are used for ad targeting.  Soft data, which I like to think of as <em>implied data</em>, is where Facebook <strong>really</strong> gets to know you.</p>

<p>Imagine you are looking inside a graphically modeled version of the entirety of the Facebook User Information database.  You would see groups, like, Catholics, Nickleback fans, people who like cat pictures, conspiracy theorists, you get the point.  What you would also see are a bunch of lines connecting different groups, and these lines creating group combinations, overlaps, even aggregating many, many different groups into one.  The lines are the soft data, the implications, predictions, assumptions about how you will behave on the internet and how you will react to anything put in front of you.  These implications gained from comparing your data, to every single possible &quot;location&quot; that you could exist in within this massive framework of interest relationships.  </p>

<p>Example; &quot;you&quot; belong to 5 groups (not literal Facebook groups, just groups of individuals within their database), open to conspiracy theories, Star Wars fan, Brony, anti-Hillary, Liberal on most social issues.  So there&#39;s <em>obvious</em> targeting you could get hit with, it&#39;s fairly straightforward.  But, Facebook also knows that in their database, there are 14,859 other people who belong to those 5 groups, and of those 14,859 other people, 85% of them click and end up liking, posts about Bernie Sanders, and posts about Nickleback&#39;s new album.  Without even knowing Nickleback has a new album, or being too politically involved, you will be targeted with these advertisements, and chances are, you will click on them.  This is obviously a fake correlation, but apply all of your current interests right now to this idea of Facebook Database Groups, and it makes sense that someone unaware of the kinds of implications gained by having so much data on so many people, could be seen as Facebook reading your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scariest truth is that we&#39;re all pretty much predictable automatons at this point. If you see an ad for something after you mentioned it, it&#39;s likely because your other shopping history correlates with people who later bought a particular product. So the companies are showing you an ad for a product that people like you bought after buying other things, and that happens to correlate with when you start thinking about it and talking about it. People are a lot less unique than they want to believe. It&#39;s easier to believe that Facebook is literally listening to our conversations or spying into our brains than admit that we&#39;re basically predictable robots. </p>

The fact that this one instance sticks out at you more than anything just proves that its that; a one-instance. These is a possibility of it just being a coincidence, a good portion of videos on facebook are of dogs, which i assume some are of dogs swimming. And the fact that your friend was talking about dogs just shows that dogs somehow correlate with his life. Either he was watching other dog videos on his phone and it triggered a conversation he wanted to have, or he has dogs himself. There are many ways for facebook to know he has or is interested in either A) dog products, or B) watching dog videos. </p>

<p>When you get your information from a predictable location, e.g. reddit, podcasts, similar youtube channels, facebook whatever, you can link advertisements in a less linear way.</p>

<p>For example, the podcast I listen to shills a brand of razers, mattresses, underwear and a few other services. If I use the code for just one of those products, they know to double down on the others for me in particular because I&#39;ve assigned myself a position in a group that has heard of those products. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This absolutely happened to me and I thought it was the spookiest thing ever. I ran into a local grocery store after work because I wanted to make a dirty martini, but I’d already used all the olive juice from my jar of olives, so I bought a bottle of the dirty martini mixer stuff. Used the credit card I use on amazon, went home and made my drink without incident. </p>

<p>The next morning I’m checking my personal email (the same email address I use for my amazon account) and there was a fucking email ad for dirty martini mixer from amazon!!</p>

<p>I absolutely didn’t converse when I was in the grocery store (used the self-check out), I didn’t talk to anyone that night, I didn’t mention buying dirty martini mixers to anyone at all. In fact, it was the first time I’d ever purchased a dirty martini mixer in my life. I’m normally a beer drinker, but had been on a martini kick for a week (I blame Mad Men...)</p>

<p>So if they’re not pulling information from our debit/credit cards, how on earth did they decide to target me for that particular item??</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To make it happen, Facebook would need to record everything your phone hears while it&#39;s on. This is functionally equivalent to an always-on phone call from you to Facebook. Your average voice-over-internet call takes something like 24kbps one way, which amounts to about 3 kBs of data per second. Assume you&#39;ve got your phone on half the day, that&#39;s about 130 MBs per day, per user. There are around 150 million daily active users in the US, so that&#39;s about 20 petabytes per day, just in the US.</p>

<p>To put that in perspective, Facebook&#39;s entire data storage is &#39;only&#39; about 300 petabytes, with a daily ingestion rate of about 600 terabytes. Put another way, constant audio surveillance would produce about 33 times more data daily than Facebook currently consumes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if it was feasible and possible, that would use a whole lot of transmission data that would show up in a lot of cell phone plans by blowing their caps out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Rough translation of my previous comment in German:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>The hypothesis that Facebook would record conversations and use them for advertising has existed for several years now.</li>
<li>With over 2.2 billion active users, immense public attention, and hundreds of thousands of IT specialists, researchers, scientists and analysts using as well as observing the social network, no one has been able to publish actual empirical evidence over the years to date. Just some anecdotes. There&#39;s literally no scientific evidence. </li>
<li>iOS and Android have supported the individual assignment of rights for apps for years. The user must explicitly allow access to the microphone. To overcome these barriers, Facebook would have had to exploit two undiscovered, massive security holes in the core products of the two largest IT companies in the world for years.</li>
<li>iOS does not allow an app to be active indefinitely in the background. In addition, a clearly identifiable notification is displayed during an audio recording (red/blue status bar). To work around this, Facebook would have to program an even greater security hole in the app, which would completely override the fundamental functionality of iOS. And Apple would not have had to suspect or be aware of this vulnerability to millions of its users&#39; diagnostic data for years.</li>
<li><em>Technically</em> it is possible on Android to start an audio recording without a notification. However, (since that&#39;s how Android works) a permanent recording would be extremely unreliable in the background without a permanent notification (which would give the app more resources from the OS and not close it so quickly). Again, Facebook would at least have to bypass the entire energy management of Android in order not to shoot through the ceiling in case of permanent audio recording in the battery statistics. This would also require an excessive security gap, because neither Google, technical experts nor users can prove a difference in the battery consumption of the Facebook app between allowed and denied access to the microphone.</li>
</ol>

<p>Either the two largest IT companies in the world, hundreds of thousands of experts and literally billions of users fail to fix, find or even prove Facebook&#39;s massive security hacks after years and the social network is able to exploit several unprecedented 0-day security gaps... Either that; or the anecdotal reports of personalized advertising, which a layman could not explain without knowledge of the algorithms, are simply a massive example of collective selection bias. </p>

<p>Anyone who has 2.2 billion users and places an ad for baby food with one billion women will certainly meet one who told her girlfriend 10 minutes ago their baby. It doesn&#39;t matter if absolutely nothing suspicious happens to 100,000 users and the 100,001th has this creepy coincidence that the &quot;right&quot; advertisement comes at the right time. And this story is of course shared and seen as strong evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) yes it has</p>

<p>2) the only 100% proof scientific evidence would involve decrypting and intercepting the data. extremely difficult. it is way too weird that you can talk about things and see ads for them within hours.  IMO not a coincidence when you&#39;ve never searched for them.</p>

<p>3) whats your point?  there are many undiscovered massive security flaws on these devices.  The NSA might even call those &quot;features&quot; if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>4) That is incorrect, certain types of apps can be active in the background, also, I don&#39;t see why it would be weird to think that Apple doesn&#39;t know?

<p>5) Again, using the mic and storing the resources would take very little power.  The mic is a system service, the only thing the app would really be doing is updating a hash set of keywords for later submission.... my assumption is that they are probably accessing it outside of normal OS features, probably with custom C or assembly code.  If random children continuously are rooting and finding ways to unlock their phones, I&#39;m pretty sure massive companies would be capable of finding exploits too.</p>

<p>A scientific and empirical study would only take some smartphones, fresh Facebook accounts and a controlled testing environment for each of these devices. Four identical setups are already sufficient:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mic permission granted, targeted conversations with certain keywords. </li>
<li>Mic permission granted, <strong>no</strong> targeted conversations with certain keywords. </li>
<li><strong>No</strong> mic permission, targeted conversations with certain keywords. </li>
<li><strong>No</strong> mic permission granted, <strong>no</strong> targeted conversations with certain keywords. </li>

<p>If there&#39;s a significant difference regarding advertisements between the phones you&#39;ve statistically and empirically proven the hypothesis. </p>

<p>IMO not a coincidence when you&#39;ve never searched for them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen countless of Facebook ads targeting completely irrelevant things for me and never saw any ad about a product I&#39;ve just talked about. Randomly getting some things right when you target hundreds of ads to literally billions of people is pretty much the definition of coincidence. </p>

<p>Simply wrong. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I see why this sub is called &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Flawed hypothesis? Just add another dozen of far-fetched premises!</p>

<p>Paying Apple for not fixing an unprecedented massive security flaw in their own OS would mean billions of dollars in bribes. How do you hide these transactions from tax investigators and investors? Is it worth billions to show some users that fluffy puppy toy they&#39;ve just talked about? I suppose you don&#39;t care about plausibility since it&#39;s all about the great conspiracy that somehow has to work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also, we didn&#39;t say anything about &quot;recording&quot;... just listening and analyzing and extracting metadata.</p>

<p>You just said &quot;recording&quot; with different words. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you call it &quot;listening and analyzing&quot;. In order to analyze and extract data from an audio <em>recording</em> you have to at least temporarily save it. That&#39;s the definition of &quot;to record&quot;.</p>

<p>Your last paragraph misses the point of my previous comment since I didn&#39;t say it&#39;s technically impossible to do any of that but requires an insane amount of premises that all perfectly work together, includes several pivotal security flaws in iOS and Google while all 2 billions users <em>and</em> the two biggest tech companies in the world fail to find any incriminating evidence. The only thing we have are some random reports from heavily biased users that can&#39;t fathom how advertising and coincidences work.</p>

<p>Again, you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.  This is literally how the siri and google assistant apps work.  Yes, 3rd parties aren&#39;t supposed to be able to do this, but big companies like Apple and Google have been known to give advantages to certain deep pocketed companies already because of big money.  There is massive cash to be made on advertising.  It is not that far fetched at all.</p>

<p>I can definitely fathom how advertising coincidences work.  I&#39;ve been working with &quot;big data&quot; for many years and I know all about how they keep scores in pairs etc to show people things based on how likely they are to be interested after something else happened that you did... or even people near you in cases of location data on FB and them knowing who you are friends with.  But the stuff I&#39;ve seen cannot be explained away so easily.  As you say it doesn&#39;t constitute 100% proof either.  I say it doesn&#39;t matter either way though... they clearly are able to accumulate way too much data no matter how these &quot;coincidences&quot; are occurring.</p>

<p>Right but we all tend to see EULA that say we give consent to have &quot;metadata&quot; collected.  We don&#39;t typically give consent to have all our conversations &quot;recorded&quot;.  See the difference?  They can mince words and have plausible deniability if they get caught because much of the public without a technical background will believe the explanation.</p>

Even the best machine learning models have a hard time on detecting relevance of keywords in small content. They need training on millions of labeled text to determine relevance. And the speed at which any tech entity can do this is not there. Advertisers are only able to generate ads from from what you directly search because they KNOW it is contextually relevant to what you are interested in. Even then people complain that the ads they see aren&#39;t relevant. Add in a multi-level complexity of speech processing, language derivation, and contextual relevancy and no tech company on Earth is close to being able to serve ads or do anything useful based on speech to text labeling.</p>

<p>The way I understand how things like Alexa or Google assistant work is They re always listening for the key words &quot;Hey Alexa&quot; or &quot;Ok Google&quot; and then they start recording what immediately follows. If there were some key phrases like &quot;I need&quot; or &quot;I want&quot; that Facebook listened for and only recorded a few seconds of audio immediately afterward it could be technically possible. </p>

<p>I&#39;m by no means an expert on any of this, but it makes sense in my mind that if they ran it like Alexa or a similar device they wouldn&#39;t need to send a dickload of audio all the time all day, only small packets of audio occasionally that could then be processed for words like &quot;Lawnmower&quot; or &quot;Cat food&quot; and be deleted immediately after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A masters in computer science, an academic background in machine learning, and professional background in embedded systems engineering.</p>

<p>The ARM chipsets on most modern phones will have zero issue running a basic voice-to-word maching algorithm, particularly when the word set is (1) limited, (2) localized, and (3) accuracy is not critical. It&#39;s not that computationally intensive when the user isn&#39;t there assessing it.</p>

<p>Siri, for example needs to know a shit load of words, and needs to be correct at least 99% of the time, or users will bitch excessively. FB? If they can pick up just a few ad-worthy words per day, that&#39;s an easy way to make money. They don&#39;t need to parse an entire sentence and respond. They just need to hear &quot;furniture&quot;, or something, and they can start trying to sell you shit.</p>

<p>And the thing about accuracy is that, going from 50% recognition accuracy (false positives = false negatives, or some other arbitrary point) requires much, much less effort and computation than 100% accuracy. It is not a linear scale. Low hanging fruit make up the majority of the basket.</p>

<p>And the microphone is not connected to the processor with magic. The microphone IC will have analog lines connected to an ADC of some variety, and then digital lines to that ADC will make the long journey across the logic board to the CPU&#39;s GPIO pins. You could place some sort of sniffer on that bus to determine when the mic ADC is in use.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;m less than completely certain about is the routing on the mic. This is going to vary from phone to phone, and I&#39;m sure there are at least a few devices out there which could be easily inspected. In the worst case, they&#39;re carrying analog lines buried in the PCB all the way home...but even then, someone with more skill than myself could figure it out, unless the host OS is for some reason already always listening to it. At that point, you&#39;d need to inspect where the signal goes in software.</p>

<p>On that front, root (kernel-space) access is readily available on most android devices, and infrequently on jailbroken iOS devices. If the kernel is sending mic data to a process in the userland, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to track that down.</p>

<p>If its not hard to track that down, then wouldn&#39;t someone have better evidence than what is presented in this thread? Wouldn&#39;t there be a way to tell?</p>

<p>I...agree? If it were happening, there&#39;d be much more substantial evidence of it. That&#39;s my entire point.</p>

<p>Or are you saying that there should be more substantial evidence that it isn&#39;t happening? That&#39;s just a logic error. You can&#39;t easily prove that something isn&#39;t, or has never, happened. This often comes up during religious discussions, more discussion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot">here</a>.</p>

<p>In any circumstance, don&#39;t you think its better to adopt a belief in this when we have better evidence than anecdotes from anonymous strangers on the internet?</p>

<p>What?</p>

With phones that come pre-installed with fb&#39;s suite, I&#39;ve heard that these can&#39;t be deleted without root access. Do you think in these instances, they would be able to do the keyword recognition under the surface? Perhaps if they had a deal worked out with the manufacturer to subsidize cost?</p>

<p>Exactly.  You can easily throw wireshark up on your network and watch your traffic from your phone.  </p>

<p>If Facebook was monitoring all of our data, someone would have sniffed the traffic by now.  Even if it were encrypted, someone would have said &quot;hey what&#39;s this encrypted shit&quot; and there would be thousands of basement dwellers investigating.</p>

<p>Fact/anecdote of the matter is, I turned off Facebook’s access to my microphone and gained back two hours of battery, as well as no longer being able to deliberately make it show advertisements for bizarre products when speaking about them nearby. Wife and I have cats, so we tested speaking about dog products off and on with the app open. Within about 48 hours we’re being served targeted ads about collars, de-wormer, outdoor dog runs, and boarding services.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all based on the ridiculous idea that every device is transmitting 3KB/s audio 24/7.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take much processing power to do crude voice analysis. You don&#39;t need 100% precise transcription, you only need to recognize when someone says &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;plane&quot; or &quot;new TV&quot; with half decent accuracy. Computers have been doing that for decades. There are Nintendo 64 games that do it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to store or transmit the audio at all, only a simple analysis of it. You don&#39;t need to listen all the time; phones have all sorts of ways to tell if you&#39;re active. That&#39;s why it can turn the screen on when you pick it up, and reduce power consumption when in your pocket.</p>

<p>You also don&#39;t need to keep the data around forever. One argument I keep hearing is that if it&#39;s not being sent in real time then it must be stored, and the storage would fill up. Why do you think it wouldn&#39;t automatically purge old recordings to make room? They don&#39;t need to hear 100% of what you say to get useful data.</p>

I was talking about Hawaii (something I hadn’t discussed in a few months at the time) and targeted ads started popping up.  So I started talking about Chik fil A to see if the ads were based on a microphone listening in.  I’m a vegetarian and do not eat food there nor do I have a reason to ever discuss it.  After probably 10 times of loudly saying things like “Chik fil A sounds good” or “we should go to Chik fil A for lunch” I got a banner ad for Chik fil A within the same day.  That cinched it.  </p>

<p>Everyone who’s talking about predictive purchasing or WiFi networks or Google searches being the source of creepy ads needs to try this.  Pick a random item or establishment that you can assume has a marketing budget (so nothing super obscure) but that you have not discussed in months or years and that you certainly would not be purchasing as someone in your demographic.  Your lawnmower example is perfect.  Then just talk and wait without doing any internet searches.  Those ads will roll in.  </p>

<p>I am in online marketing and study patents like these to reverse engineer ways to game Google&#39;s algorithms. They take into account an insane amount of information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar situation here using Google where I was talking in the car with a family member.  He was asking me if I remembered a boxer with a certain characteristic... I forget exactly what it was, but for the sake of this example, lets pretend it was &quot;Boxer with 1 arm&quot;.  I am not into Boxing and definitely hadn&#39;t searched for anything like this, but I pulled out my phone to look this guy up and started typing &quot;Boxer wi&quot; into Google and it automatically suggested the sentence &quot;Boxer with one arm&quot; (or whatever it was) as the top result.  I pulled it up and instantly got that boxer&#39;s name.  </p>

<p>I just checked and when i type boxer into google, it auto completes to searches related to dogs.  I&#39;ve searched for plenty of Kangaroo boxing videos (which are awesome by the way) - anyways, this was weird.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve experienced similar situations with ads being served via Facebook for things I&#39;ve talked about in my daily life and am also convinced they do this, but as like someone else said, probably a 3rd party is doing the heavy lifting somehow and Facebook is obtaining the data that way.  </p>

<p>Who knows, they could have an entirely different way of capturing, storing, and analyzing the data necessary for this type of advertising that it can&#39;t conceptually be described as &quot;we listen to you all day and serve you ads based on your verbal dialogue&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first noticed this a couple years ago. My friend asked in a casual conversation where something was, I said “Oh that’s off of ______ by the Rooms To Go.” I wasn’t looking for furniture, never have, never searched it... a couple hours later I get an ad for Rooms To Go. </p>

<p>There’s been a few other weird instances over the years. I’ve noticed the ads are more specific on Instagram. </p>

<p>A couple weeks ago my girlfriend was sick. I asked if she wanted me to get her her favorite mint gelato ice cream from the store on the way home. She said yes. Next day I get an ad for Talenti Mint Gelato ice cream. The same exact little speciality brand, the same exact flavor I <em>specifically asked her.</em></p>

<p>I work at a school. Last week I told the kid to get in the breakfast line... he said he wasn’t hungry, he already ate. I said what did you eat? Cereal? And he said yep, Froot Loops! And I said “Froot Loops?!” back kind of loud. I haven’t had Froot Loops in years. I haven’t searched for Froot Loops or any other cereal in God knows how long. Guess what I get for an ad the next time I opened Instagram?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. Me and a friend talked about adult diapers to test this out. Literally just punctuated every few sentences with &quot;incontinence&quot; and &quot;Adult undergarments&quot;, etc. I have the Facebook ap disabled on my phone, and it has been since I got it, but when I logged in through the browser, they served me ads for... wait for it... adult diapers. Trust me when I say that there&#39;s no reason to serve me an ad for diapers. I think it&#39;s an ad-serving sub-system that is built right into the Android OS, and aps just latch onto the cached keywords. I have no evidence to back this up, but it would make sense, and would be the loophole that Zuckerdick is using here; &quot;No, Facebook doesn&#39;t listen to your mic to serve you ads... Google does that, we use their data&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So at this point it’s 100% obvious that they are doing this, and yet they continue to deny that ads are based off of conversations picked up on mic. In my own life I have seen so many examples of this and even tested it to prove a point. I’ve spoken about teeth, cavities, dentures, etc. in front of my phone and despite the fact that I’ve never had so much as a cavity or searched any of the aforementioned topics, I began receiving ads for dentures and dental implants the very next day. All I can think of is that they have a defensible legal position that allows them to deny that this is what they’re doing. It must be that Facebook itself is not using the information obtained through the mic to tailor the ads. If that’s the case they can probably say that they do not serve ads based off of snippets of conversation picked up on the mic. That is not to say that they don’t provide information to a third party that then uses that information to custom tailor their ads. I would like to see someone question them about whether or not they collect information through the mic and if that information is made available to advertisers to do with what they please. Because from where I stand that is the only explanation, someone just needs to box them in with their line of questioning. Unfortunately, I don’t see anyone looking for real answers getting to do the questioning any time soon. This whole thing is a dog and pony show to appease he masses and give them a harmless little bone to chew on before moving on to the next bullshit news story.</p>

<p>It certainly isn’t, and it’s not even possible to use the microphone in the background covertly on iPhones, for example.</p>

<p>Yes, because they likely aren’t, and there is only anecdotal evidence from people not trained how to do proper scientific experiments and subject to psychological biases. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how you <em>don&#39;t</em> see the connection. They&#39;re listening to everything your phone is near. Plain and simple.</p>

<p><sup>Also, I am aware it&#39;s lo and behold but there&#39;s a thing called autocorrect which gets more wrong than right.</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking his no is that Facebook is an aggregator of data. So they are not using it for advertising, because they are selling the data. That data is instantly sold to the advertising contractor who &quot;uses&quot; that data. &gt;Plus, and this is the most important part, we already agreed to give away this freedom by ignoring the contract when Facebook asks for control of our phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, every time this comes up I say the same thing: There are tons of ways to figure out what you are interested in. The second you stop scrolling through your news feed and linger at a content item is enough to target you. And yes, you do this subconsciously. So yes, this means the algorithm knows what you&#39;re interested in before you do. Facebook is not listening through the mic. People would have found out already by monitoring the upload on their network.</p>

<p>I think hating on Zuckerberg is a useless distraction.  A good meme to keep people placated by giving them a bad guy to throw rotten fruit at.  Facebook itself is the real evil, and we should focus more of their attention on bringing that down instead of crucifying the guy who created it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to get hard evidence.  I captured packets through WireShark and analyzed the data.  I didn&#39;t come up with anything concrete.  I think I established some ground rules if Facebook were listening.  For a long time, I believe they did.  It&#39;s certainly not implausible.  I just don&#39;t have any hard evidence to back it up.</p>

<p>My current assumption of how this works:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Audio is recorded in small samples, maybe 10 seconds or less, with a very low-quality compression algorithm (like 32 kbps compared to a bad Napster mp3 of 96 kbps)</p></li>
<li><p>Audio is stored in a temporary cache after recording</p></li>
<li><p>Audio is uploaded to Facebook via FB_ZERO encrypted packets whenever Facebook/Instagram are accessed. The audio upload is hidden in three ways - the compression makes the file size pretty small, it&#39;s injected with all other traffic when the app is being loaded, and it&#39;s encrypted with a proprietary protocol.</p></li>
</ul>

The experiment involved reading a script with a few famous brands to my phone, then logging into Facebook, and then seeing if I saw an ad for those brands.  I never got a positive hit.  I could only see the packet sizes going to and from Facebook.  Because the packets are encrypted with a proprietary method - FB_ZERO - they can&#39;t be analyzed.  FB_ZERO was made to be a zero-round-trip encryption handshake, which optimizes content delivery, but it also has the additional benefit of being a black box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>!!!!</p>

<p>So I am extremely minimalist on my phone, absolutely avoid notifications and ads.  The Facebook apps (including Spotify and Instagram) were the absolute worst at constantly requesting me to turn on notifications every single time I opened the app to use it. It got more and more aggressive on requesting it and even disabled features for a while. If I were a betting man, I would say they did a lot of data transferring through notifications.  </p>

<p>Another fun one is that my phone is Jailbroken and has a feature where I can specifically give apps permission even further than iOS.  Instagram had access to my camera, but still it would have to ask for access to front or back camera when it would use them.  No joke Instagram requested the front facing camera when I &quot;Liked&quot; a photo. Why it would want to look at my face when I&#39;m liking a photo is beyond me, but it absolutely requested it and I stopped giving it permissions to my photos or any location data or cameras after that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t communicate through notifications. They are one way communications. If FB already has a long running service that listens to you then they can simply send data any time they want. There is no way a notification would help that in any way. </p>

<p>The reason they push notifications is that it is their way to drag into their hell over and over. If you only use the app when you want to look at FB you open it maybe 1-4 times a day. If you click on every notification FB thinks is important for you then you load their ads 20 times per day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as my highest belief goes, objective and logical perspective. The reason to why I am questioning your statement and demand evidence is because many other just took what you presented and accepted it as facts. </p>

<p>Now obv this is reddit and people should be aware of checking their sources but conspiracy believers  are created due to lack of evidence. They are satisfied with what is presented. I, myself, do not want to leave any &quot;ifs&quot; unsolved. In this case it might have been the jailbreak that cause the app to act up the way it did. We dont know, we can assume but we dont know. Assumptions are very handy whenever the result is very little affected by them. But in this case it is determining true or false.</p>

<p>If all you care about is capturing human speech, very specialized compression algorithms can reduce your bitrate to 700 bits per second. Considering the fact that noise will be more common from a phone mic, i think 1kb/s or maybe 2kb/s is the bitrate used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  That could certainly be at play.  I think low bandwidth is actually a help for voice audio, because it helps block out background noise and focuses only on the vocal spectrum.  The Nyquist theorem says the highest frequency captured is half of the sample rate, or the sample rate is twice as high as the highest frequency upon playback.  Cutting down the sample rate, and using only mono audio, which helps cut down the file sizes, would be a huge help to focusing only on vocal noise.  I&#39;m surprised they still use 16 bit PCM, cutting down the bit depth would also save on file size, but would cause distortion and cut out lower volumes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it, after having talked to several different experts on the subject.  Both programmers and advertisement data analysts have told me that Natural Language Processing (NLP) is so processor-intensive that it would <em>have</em> to be cloud-based parallel processing.  Siri, Google, and Amazon Echo are all cloud-based for example.  One programmer told me it would take five minutes for a phone to figure out what you said, while it takes Siri only a couple of seconds.  The speed at which you talk, the language that you use, the differences in tone of voice and length of saying each word, the accent with which you speak, and your gender, create a huge set of variables that a phone could not natively process.</p>

<p>I think the app is bloated because it&#39;s constantly trying to load content (especially video content, nearly every post is a video now), and also trying to upload your interactions with everything.

    <div class="md"><p>I admit upfront I&#39;m not networking tech savvy, but I used to always play devil&#39;s advocate to the notion they were listening in on a hot mic. I always said basically &quot;why not just connect your phone to your home wifi, disconnect all other devices, and watch the outbound traffic.&quot;</p>

<p>But then I played devil&#39;s advocate to my devil&#39;s advocate and wondered a conjured up a very similar scenario to the one you&#39;ve described. The only difference in my imagined scenario is that the audio is analyzed locally by the Facebook app and keywords are noted in more of a simple-text format and then that string data is sent off to FB only while the app is being used so it not only helps mask the transmission but also keeps the data file size numbers very low.</p>

<p>Is that at all feasible in your mind -- the local analyzing of audio bit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all nice work. No expert on this at all (I studied ee some time ago)</p>

<p>Could it be that they check the background noise? Like are you in a car or outside? 
You could load a pretrained simple neural network onto the device and analyse the data, then it says sth like &quot;outside&quot;, the nn gets some additional data, like the difference between a predefined status like&quot;outside&quot; and send it to train a bigger central neural network at Facebook. Update the nn Everytime the app is updated. This would give Facebook the ability to monitor extreme amount of data from you. </p>

<p>For example if you are inside a room but there is a high echo which fades over days than you just moved into a new home. The background noise of your car changes, well you just got a new car. I assume with enough phones ( so extreme amount of samples) and beacons you could pinpoint positions in puplic places to extreme accuracy, like is he stopping in front the TV&#39;s in the supermarket or the chairs or whatever. The other thing that is easy this way is your salary. The cleaning lady and me both work in the same complex sometimes at the same time, but my environment is very quiet hers will sound much different.</p>

<p>PS. I am not entirely sure that this is possible or reasonable. I will link someone that has a better understanding of how nn work and delete it if anyone points out that this is in fact bullshit. <a href="/u/benjaminhornygold">/u/benjaminhornygold</a></p>

<p>I work with and on such software. Example: say you&#39;re in the market for a haircut. Using a proprietary software and API integrations purchased from a digital agency, a user who has visited your salon&#39;s Facebook page can be retargeted and if they pull up at your salon, they will receive a notification on their phone from Google asking them opinions, questions about your location. You can also serve a greeting, advertisement, or message with this push notification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of classes in the Facebook app, it&#39;s doing crude speech recognition. That would be much less noticeable, less data-intensive, and less load on their servers, than transmitting audio. It doesn&#39;t have to work great either, just well enough to pick out key words fairly reliably. And it doesn&#39;t even have to send back the actual words, just a list of frequencies (how many times you said keyword X, keyword Y...), so you also wouldn&#39;t see the words themselves in outgoing data.</p>

<p>Much of this sounds paranoid, but it&#39;s really just &quot;if I were designing such a tool, how would I do it?&quot; It&#39;s only taken a few minutes to come up with something relatively simple, which encodes the result into very little data - a feature which is meant to reduce server load and bandwidth, but which has the handy side effect of being harder to detect.

Look at the programmatic media buying industry - The Trade Desk, all their data partners. Facebook is just a small piece of it.

<p>Try it, just talk about it few minutes a day around your cellphone with facebook open.</p>

<p>You will have your evidence. This is the best evidence you can get. Ive tried it myself 1 year and a half ago. When I started seeing diapers ads, (was talking about having a baby even tho i&#39;m 100% against having children), this is when I deleted my account. Never went back. No ragrets.</p>

<p>If you are lazy about testing it yourself (because it can take 3-5 days before seeing results) watch this video : <a href="https://youtu.be/U0SOxb_Lfps">https://youtu.be/U0SOxb_Lfps</a></p>

<p>Would it have to listen through the FB app?  If I search for power tools on Google Chrome (keeping my mouth shut about power tools at all times), power tool ads still show up on my Facebook feed.  So, clearly, there is some connection between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be a confounding factor which is causing both you to think about that person, and them to show up in your suggested friends.</p>

<p>Even if Facebook isn’t listening to your mic, they already have an incredible amount of data about almost everything you do online, whether through posts you like, friends you keep, or even sites you visit with a widget on the page.</p>

<p>For example, if I showed you an ad for gum and then a couple days later you were talking about gum, and then the next day i showed you another ad for gum, you might have just forgotten about the first ad and thought that the second was because you were talking about gum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think this whole &quot;interrogation&quot; was just to create the illusion that Facebook is actually being reprimanded, when actually the government has probably been one of the biggest consumers and customers for the data Facebook has collected.</p>

<p>At the end of the day Facebook will continue spying on us and the government will continue to do nothing, especially considering how crucial this spying was to our president&#39;s victory.</p>

<p>Like maybe if Hillary had won and she didn&#39;t use Facebook&#39;s data and then this all came out, then she might go after them, but arguably Facebook through CA helped Trump more than almost anything else.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that fucking simple. They didn&#39;t notice the millions of times cat food showed up when they weren&#39;t doing this experiment, or the hundreds of irrelevant ads that show up at other times.</p>

<p>Facebook are shady fucks, but Reddit is literally turning into conspiracy nutcases with this &quot;DEY LISYEN TO USSSSS&quot; bullshit. It would be technologically impossible and would give Facebook no useful information that they couldn&#39;t get elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what confirmation bias even is? I suggest you look it up before replying.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;I have never had ads about cat food&quot; just shows how utterly ignorant you are about confirmation bias. You <strong>don&#39;t notice</strong> when you get irrelevant ads to you because most people don&#39;t focus on ads.</p>

<p>Facebook 100% does scan IMs and phone calls because it&#39;s actually technologically possible. To constantly record and parse language in noisy environments without any visible trace in network analysis would be an incredibly feat, yet would provide Facebook with barely any data in comparison to their other methods.</p>

<p>I fully believe that Facebook would record 24/7 <strong>if it was possible and profitable</strong>, but it simply isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There is no sufficient evidence to suggest that Facebook records everything.</p>

<p>There is a <strong>TON</strong> of evidence to suggest it would be both impossible and useless for Facebook to record 24/7. It would require significant processing power or significant data usage, both of which you can see yourself are not the case.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can install applications which track when your mic or camera is being accessed on android. Surprise surprise, it isn&#39;t constantly being accessed by Facebook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly that&#39;s Google, not Facebook.</p>

<p>Secondly, he is <strong>LIVE STREAMING ON YOUTUBE</strong>. i.e. he is  using his microphone to stream on a Google website. That&#39;s simply not a fair test at all, and completely invalidates the results of the experiment. For this to be accurate the only source of information gathering must be through the mobile phone.</p>

<p>I fully believe that Google/Facebook will record what you&#39;re saying <em>if</em> you&#39;re livestreaming on their site, the question is whether they do it 24/7 from your phone (which isn&#39;t really technologically possible)</p>

<p>Furthermore, he completely ruins his own experiment by clicking the first dog toy ad he sees. Clicking on an ad will result in you getting more ads that are similar to that one, so anything past the first one is completely irrelevant.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I am about to conduct the exact same experiment myself, I will respond again with my findings to see if they compare at all.</p>

<p>I will be leaving Facebook open on my phone to the side while I talk about a search item (as with the video I&#39;m not going to type or say it yet) once I have done a control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I&#39;ve just done my experiment.</p>

<p>I wanted to try using both Edge browser and Chrome, to see if being logged into my Google account had an effect.</p>

<hr/>

<p>My keyword was &quot;Cat food&quot;. I do not own a cat, I have never searched for cat food before.</p>

<p>In my control I browsed the fark.com website that the video creator used, and clicked random links as he did. I received 3 main types of ads: gambling ads, insurance ads, and ads for mobile games. I did not see a single pet advert, or anything that referenced cats.</p>

<p>I then started talking about cat food in a similar manner to the guy in the video, saying things like &quot;We really need to pick up some cat food, could you get some at the shop&quot; and referencing individual brands. I did this with the phone locked, unlocked, and with the Facebook app open.</p>

<p>I then opened a new instance of Edge, went to fark.com again, and observed. I still received no pet ads or anything referencing cats. The only &quot;new&quot; ad I received was an advert for hearing aids.</p>

<p>I repeated the entire experiment in Google Chrome, using a different keyword (in this case it was women&#39;s razors). Once again I saw no increase in ads of that type, nor did I notice a significant change in the ads that were being served to me.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say that either the OP of the video was having his mic analysed through YouTube streaming, or he intentionally messed with the results to get views.</p>

<p>I recorded my screen during the experiment, but not my voice. If you desperately need to I can post the video but it won&#39;t prove anything, just like the above video also proves jack shit.</p>

<p>To start, and this is something you&#39;ll probably recognize, but The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is when you become aware of a new idea and then it suddenly seems to be in your life a lot more. Maybe you learn of an obscure composer and then notice a concert for him in town this week. Or you watch the Food Network and then go to a restaurant and notice a new dish you&#39;d just learned about.</p>

<p>Ok, here&#39;s where data science kicks in. Google has been working on learning what kinds of ads you&#39;re exposed to in real life, as well as online, so that they can better preform on digital.</p>

<p>2007: <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2007/06/google-radio-and-tv-personalization-ratings-and-advertising-patent-applications/">http://www.seobythesea.com/2007/06/google-radio-and-tv-personalization-ratings-and-advertising-patent-applications/</a></p>

<p>2016: <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2016/01/google-cross-device-tracking-and-audio-watermarks/">http://www.seobythesea.com/2016/01/google-cross-device-tracking-and-audio-watermarks/</a></p>

<p>So let&#39;s say you&#39;re in the car listening to radio, or maybe watching TV. The commercials start and you zone out. Your subconscious mind is listening. Then, later, you&#39;re hungry. You tell your friend you could go for a sandwich from that new sub place down the street. Little did you know, you heard an advertisement for it earlier. And not only that, but Google heard the advertisement earlier too. And it knows you usually eat lunch at 12pm because of your <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">Google Location History</a>. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, that sub shop has a marketing agency running an ad campaign online and offline. They probably use a product like <a href="https://www.adroll.com/">Adroll</a> to <a href="https://www.adhesion.co.nz/blog/google-remarketing-how-it-works/">remarket</a> things to you. They can ask Adroll and Google to use combined data to run ads not only on Google&#39;s platform, but also using Facebook&#39;s data and Facebook&#39;s platform, along with many others.</p>

<p>So now you&#39;re creeped out... it really feels like something heard you. And it did... kind of? It just heard what was happening around you.</p>

<p>And finally, you probably don&#39;t remember the 100 other times Google showed you an ad for a place that you hadn&#39;t otherwise mentioned or heard of in the same day. So it all just seems sketchy. Really, it&#39;s just patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Digital marketing person here! I think Facebook does a lot of shady stuff, but microphone-assisted data collection isn&#39;t one of them, not by Facebook or by their ad partners. The way that ads are served in the platform doesn&#39;t allow anyone to siphon off data recorded by microphone, either officially or illicitly. Also, even if it could be reliably collected, the value of that data is surprisingly limited, natural language recognition is still not where it would need to be for this to build reliable targeting pools. Honestly, Facebook has more than enough data on you without recording you!</p>

<p>I say this because I want people to focus on the dodgy stuff that Facebook definitely is already doing, rather than inventing things that they&#39;re 99% likely not to be doing. It&#39;s a waste of energy.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to prove <em>how</em> this technically works in detail. Just try to scientifically prove that it actually happens. </p>

<p>Take four identical phones, create a fresh identical Facebook accounts for each and use them under the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mic permission granted, conversations with certain keywords.</li>
<li>Mic permission granted,  <strong>no</strong> conversations with certain keywords.</li>
<li><strong>No</strong> mic permission granted, conversations with certain keywords.</li>
<li><strong>No</strong> mic permission granted, <strong>no</strong> conversations with certain keywords.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there are multiple times significant differences in advertising and the Facebook stream of either (1) or (1) and (3) show specific ads matching the keywords of the conversations you&#39;ve successfully proven that Facebook most likely indeed listens to your conversations. Precisely document your test setup and analysis, so everyone can repeat it and independently confirm your findings.¹</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty easy setup that almost entirely eliminates other variables and doesn&#39;t even require a ton of resources.</p>

<p>¹Pro tip: Before you publish your study and uncover Facebook&#39;s biggest scandal to date, make sure you short Facebook stocks. As soon as this story goes around the world you can watch stock prices plummet while you make a ton of money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because he definitely thought of this completely out of nowhere and had never searched anything related before either.</p>

<p>Facebook is bad, I fully agree. But to the best of my knowledge they have never outright lied about what they do. And why would they? People are perfectly happy to let Facebook keep logs of their calls, or at least not read deeply enough into user agreements to prevent it. They would still install the app if it was honest about listening to them. So why on earth would Facebook lie, breaking multiple laws, just to garner a small amount of data of questionable quality <em>without</em> users&#39; consent instead of <em>with</em> users&#39; (implicit) consent? </p>

When you see two cookies have the same IP address and you know that the IP doesn’t have many cookies that get run through it (like you can tell it isn’t a business or library based on different cookie frequency), then you can tell it is a personal residence. Then you can assume your preferences or discussions could revolve around what was being searched at that time. Isolating that case is trivial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, I don&#39;t think people realize how expensive both memory and processing-wise voice recognition is. The products that parse voice almost exclusively are hardwired to recognize one single phrase, then the rest of the voice is sent to massive server farms because it is so computationally expensive to parse.</p>

<p>On top of that, all the other metadata about you is super cheap and extensive. People have no idea how much is known about them from metadata. So not only is voice expensive to work with, in most cases it&#39;s not needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something to draw your pickle out.</p>

<p>The line noise of every power plant is recorded. A perfect 50/60 Hz isn&#39;t too easy to maintain, so powerplants record their frequency. This allows them to ensure they keep time, by either raising or lowering their frequency to average out a day, or a week, or a month to the ideal 50/60Hz.</p>

<p>This variable frequency manifests itself in our daily lives. Such that a video recording, for example, can be dated and located precisely.</p>

<p>If you record a video and your A/C unit motor can be heard in the background, that data can be dated and matched to these recordings the powerplants keep. </p>

<p>the above also implies that he wasn&#39;t served dog food ads in the initial two days of taking the dog home. so even if he logged in his mother&#39;s wifi, there&#39;s no chance it automatically serves him dog food ads based on that alone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the wifi aspect is really overblown, there&#39;s no way you get the exact same ads as the wifi owner simply by just being connected. too many scenarios where people under a shared connection don&#39;t necessarily have to have the same interests e.g. public wifi, school wifi, one off connections, etc. since the ads are always so accurately tailored to the specific individual&#39;s scenario, there has to be a combination of other factors at play as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. If people said, oh freakiest thing, I was using Messenger the other day and we were chatting about my dog, and I got pet food ads, you could educate them on what exactly they&#39;re trading for these free services.</p>

<p>But people already know. The cat&#39;s out of the bag, the uproar never came, so now it&#39;s moved onto &quot;I&#39;m being fucked, I&#39;m being tricked and I&#39;m being lied to.&quot; when the sad fact is, they chose this all this. No one pulled the wool over their eyes in the same way Coca Cola doesn&#39;t pull the wool over your eyes when they don&#39;t call their drink mostly &quot;sugar and carbonation&quot;.</p>

<p>So people get angry, maybe a little guilty. They feel hard done by and wanna be vindicated, &quot;oh we all know that Facebook was selling our data for ads, who&#39;d have been silly enough to not expect that?! If i products free they&#39;ve gotta make money somehow! I just am not okay with being tricked!&quot; </p>

I can see how the microphone would be the first thing that pops into peoples mind but, they spent 10 seconds on that thought. You on the other hand, took probably a minute or two and came up with several more ways that the data could have been collected through. If then a professional team of 10 programmers and software designers would sit down for a week I bet they would have something that is uncomprehensable for the average user.

<p>But. People are sucked into the system. Instead of having a unified people. They have created political teams for us to choose. Then we fight against ourselves. We blame the two political parties instead of the government. </p>

<p>I got news for you people. Republicans and Democrats are sucking milk from the same titty. They&#39;re on the same side. There is some entity above them controling what each party does. They each blame the opposing party for giant fuck ups that have occurred which perpetuates us fighting each other.</p>

<p>Abortion, civil rights issues, tax bills, pornstar allegations, etc. All are distractions used to hide the fact that they are taking away our freedoms one step at a time. And people are so dependent on the system that they are a slave to it. They will fight for it, even if it goes against their own civil liberties.</p>

<p>The very next day, I start seeing ads on my phone for Dasuquin. I checked the backlog of texts between myself and my mom and we never mentioned it. I know we never talked about it over the phone, just that one time. </p>

<p>Now I keep music playing all day long and I leave my phone right next to the speakers. If I&#39;m visiting somebody, I leave my phone in my car. If advertisers are doing it, so is the NSA and god only knows who else.</p>

<p>That needs to be driven home more: it would be utterly trivial to prove they were spying on us.</p>

<p>You could look at an app&#39;s processor time, use of hardware, network traffic, etc to see that something was happening when there shouldn&#39;t be. You could run controlled experiments to try to elicit certain ads by repeating words around the phone over and over.</p>

<p>The fact that nobody has found actual proof really means that there is no eavesdropping going on. There is however a lot of confirmation bias and misunderstanding of current technology&#39;s abilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily true. Sometimes an APP can chew up your processes more than seem normal for no apparent reason except for a bug or a problem that needs to be addressed on the back end. Also, Facebook and messenger already use a ton of RAM as it is. There&#39;s a reason deleting Facebook greatly improves battery life on mobile devices. It might be too much to run the mic constantly but the mic might be programmed to become active under certain conditions, record and translate what it can gather (like Alexa or other voice services) and then read that input for keywords. If there are ads that match those keywords they could be called upon to display. The data could also be stored. I&#39;m not an expert but I can see in a rudimentary way how it could work. With the brains, skills, and money at Facebook... Yeah they could make it work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. I&#39;m about as far away as possible from being a conspiracy theory nutter but I am 100% sure that Facebook listens and serves up ads.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had the TV on in the background and Facebook has miraculously brought up relevant ads. I&#39;ve had conversations with people within earshot of my phone and later on it&#39;s shown relevant ads.</p>

<p>But the most damning evidence? I was sent to a PR event for my work, and was discussing PR and promotions with people and afterwards Facebook was showing ads for PR and promotion agencies.</p>

<p>Facebook doesn&#39;t listen? Bull-fucking-shit.</p>

You can probably squeeze it to a few hundred and still be able to recognize key words reasonably well.</p>

I hardly ever talk about work when Im at home or out with friends, especially try hard not to open any social media apps then either.

<p>The amount of data for 1 person streaming voip is about 1 gig a day, which is not a lot of data, but when you think about the fact that they have 2.2 billion users (214 million just in the US) it&#39;s just too much data, even for facebook.

    <div class="md"><p>Im not talking sorting and analysing it, just the sheer size of the amount of data transferred.</p>

<p>Ignoring the data size fact, constantly listening would kill your phone&#39;s battery, and it&#39;s easy to show how much battery you use with FB installed vs not having the app installed and realistically i only saved about 3% battery for a full day of usage. Plus the constantly running app would be a red flag, but on a tooted phone with a real process manager shows FB sends small packets of location and app usage about 6 times a day, the packets are to small to contain voice data even when converted to text.</p>

<p>I hate FB just as much as the next guy, but constant listening is not fesable, unless maybe if you are an important person... I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to have the option to always on.</p>

nothing about it, I do know everything we know about how our phones are working are programmed features.</p>

<p>The component that tells you when an App is using data is a program.  It has inputs, and based upon those inputs, it makes a calculation and provides an output.  You, Mr. Manager, come to me and say &quot;Mr. Programmer, Mr. CEO wants this app to run silently so that it does not show up within the data usage sum.&quot;</p>

<p>And the I, Mr. Programmer along with a hundred other programmers or a thousand programmer, figure out how to make the app run without showing any usage metrics.  Once we figure it out, we make the code a short block and it gets copy pasta across the company code whenever they want a silent app.</p>

<p>You think this is impossible because it sounds outlandish, and yet, its just programming.  Rethink how your basic computing electronics work, rethink what those numbers are telling you.  We&#39;ve had hidden files and hidden processes with us since Windows 3.1, this is not a new idea.</p>

I hadn&#39;t thought about this show since I was around 12 or 13. Next day FB served me an ad for the new Captain Tsubasa video game app! I&#39;ve never searched this game, series ever. I&#39;m not even into video games anymore. There is no other explanation for this ad appearing. </p>

Anyways, next morning, I try to search her on FB, she had a very generic name like Mary so my hopes weren&#39;t very high, but here she was, first in the search results despite not living in the city, having no common friends or anything that linked us other than having talked to each other in real life the day before...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from her giving you a false number being a possiblity...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had FB suggest a friend I hadn&#39;t seen in ~15 years, had zero contact with over anything resembling facebook, no shared friends / family.</p>

<p>Closest digital contact we&#39;d ever had was MSN messenger waay back, circa 1999, and that fed into XBOX live accounts, which was no surprise both being Microsoft...</p>

<p>But to make the leap to Facebook seems a bit sketchy.  No way they could have known without harvesting data from MS or MS having shared it.</p>

<p>When my girlfriend got pregnant, we avoided telling anyone pubically for a few weeks.  Maybe she had messaged a few of her friends but I only ever spoke to her about it via messenger ( like when I&#39;m in work) suddenly the adverts for weddings and engagement rings where everywhere.  And this isn&#39;t just in Facebook so don&#39;t tell me they aint listening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if the app listens or not.  What I do know is that my battery discharges a lot faster when I use the facebook app vs just looking at facebook in chrome on my mobile with the app uninstalled.  Also, if the app is open in the background it burns up the battery as well.  It could be nothing but it give me the impression that a lot of processes are running other than what is needed to display my facebook wall.</p>

<p>WE DO NOT. SENATOR, LET ME BE CLEAR ON THIS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY THEORY GET KIDS PASSED AROUND THAT WE LISTEN TO WHAT IS GOING ON ON YOUR MICROPHONE AND USE THAT. WE DO NOT DO THAT. WE DO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TAKE VIDEOS ON THEIR DEVICES AND SHARE THOSE. <strong><em>VIDEOS ALSO HAVE AUDIO.

<p>Just what Facebook means as <em>&#39;use it to make the service better&#39;</em> is up for speculation... guess it&#39;s ads, as he claimed time and again its&#39; users love them.</p>

Google and Facebook, if you have an Android phone with Facebook installed, listen and read every single thing.  Emails, messages, triggered ads from your mic - everything.

    <div class="md"><p>I hope I can explain this properly. Ask questions if I don’t.</p>

<p>Me and three friends wanted food. We didn’t want to drive. The places we wanted food didn’t deliver. We were searching Google for a third-party solution.</p>

<p>We couldn’t find the business we wanted because it had gone out of business. And so we were searching things like does Uber deliver food. Can you get a taxi to get you beer and pizza. Things of that nature. What is the business that used to deliver food? Etc etc</p>

<p>So as this is happening a friend of mine on Facebook messenger messages me and says hey do you know about XXX business? I wanted you to know because I thought you’d like it. They do delivery of any place you want.</p>

<p>The girl has never pitched a product to me in her life. I am mediately thought she had been hacked or something. She lives Away and we don’t communicate much.</p>

<p>And I kept thinking what in the heck. How could they even do this. Did something on her screen flash about me and this business at the same time enough to connect in her brain to reach out to me?</p>

<p>And I’ve often found that certain situations bring up Spanish ads. I’m not sure what combination of information. It’s more than just a mic though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) yes it has</p>

<p>2) the only 100% proof scientific evidence would involve decrypting and intercepting the data. extremely difficult. it is way too weird that you can talk about things and see ads for them within hours.  IMO not a coincidence when you&#39;ve never searched for them.</p>

<p>3) whats your point?  there are many undiscovered massive security flaws on these devices.  The NSA might even call those &quot;features&quot; if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>4) That is incorrect, certain types of apps can be active in the background, also, I don&#39;t see why it would be weird to think that Apple doesn&#39;t know?  Pay them enough money to look the other way and I don&#39;t think they&#39;d care.... also, we didn&#39;t say anything about &quot;recording&quot;... just listening and analyzing and extracting metadata.</p>

<p>5) Again, using the mic and storing the resources would take very little power.  The mic is a system service, the only thing the app would really be doing is updating a hash set of keywords for later submission.... my assumption is that they are probably accessing it outside of normal OS features, probably with custom C or assembly code.  If random children continuously are rooting and finding ways to unlock their phones, I&#39;m pretty sure massive companies would be capable of finding exploits too.</p>

Also, if all your friends are searching for something online, you may get served ads because of your profile similarity - this is called a look alike audience. There is no conspiracy, just statistics on online advertising.</p>

What you’re seeing here with Facebook is theatre. People have no idea of the terrifying depths of data profiling and behaviour prediction that is happening. This data is being shared with 3 letter agencies freely they are using highly advanced algorithms to profile you. Yes you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as my highest belief goes, objective and logical perspective. The reason to why I am questioning your statement and demand evidence is because many other just took what you presented and accepted it as facts. </p>

<p>Now obv this is reddit and people should be aware of checking their sources but conspiracy believers  are created due to lack of evidence. They are satisfied with what is presented. I, myself, do not want to leave any &quot;ifs&quot; unsolved. In this case it might have been the jailbreak that cause the app to act up the way it did. We dont know, we can assume but we dont know. Assumptions are very handy whenever the result is very little affected by them. But in this case it is determining true or false.</p>

<p>Am still curious and intrigued by the idea of them using the notifications and &quot;like-data&quot; to tap the microphone, it is  genius but scary. If you get any screenshots or clips, I would love to see it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... talking about Greyhound bus tickets to a customer, which I haven&#39;t used in years and never talked about outside of this one conversation, then having ads for bus tickets on a device not even connected to the one with the microphone, and only having Facebook as the common connection between the two doesn&#39;t prove this all to you?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how you <em>don&#39;t</em> see the connection. They&#39;re listening to everything your phone is near. Plain and simple.</p>

<p><sup>Also, I am aware it&#39;s lo and behold but there&#39;s a thing called autocorrect which gets more wrong than right.</sup></p>
