         Under the ‘Kentler Experiment’ of the 1970s, Berlin welfare authorities handed over homeless teenagers to known paedophiles. In most cases they were asked to care for 13 - 15-year-old drug addicts and prostitutes. “It is simply unimaginable that something like this happened with state oversight.”

         Members of a U.N. peacekeeping mission engaged in "transactional sex" with more than 225 Haitian women in exchange for food and medication, a sign that sexual exploitation remains significantly underreported in such missions. About a third of alleged sexual abuse involves minors under 18.

         A new report commissioned by the Colombian government and FARC rebels has concluded U.S. soldiers and military contractors sexually abused at least 54 children in Colombia between 2003 and 2007. The investigator cites one case where 53 girls in the town of Melgar were targeted by contractors who filmed the abuse and sold the films as pornography. In another case, a 12-year-old girl was allegedly drugged and raped by a U.S. Army sergeant and a contractor. Under immunity agreements, none of the alleged abusers were ever punished. The media group FAIR notes the story has received no coverage in the U.S. corporate media. A number of U.S. outlets have reported on a new Justice Department probe which concludes U.S. drug enforcement agents in Colombia participated in "sex parties" with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartels.

        Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.

       During the first days of the harassment campaign against Comet Ping Ping, their Facebook page was flooded with people calling them pedophiles. Most of the accounts were German and random Balkan countries. Thought that was fishy as fuck.

       It got a lot of bad attention though. Sure some people didn't care about it until a democrat and HRC was involved but still it was a lot of bad attention because it's a weak accusation with no victims and not a single missing children's report that said "last seen at comet ping pong".
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the political slander, namely the fake food code word list, a lot of people lost credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Seaman is a good example. I remember 6 months into the "pizzagate" he was saying he has sources that Podesta is going to jail. He's lost credibility now.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Ben Swann everything by the man is brilliant except for the pizzagate video. Where he talks about the Besta Pizza logo and just jumps over to Comet Ping Pong randomly. That discrepancy is why he went to anchor and now is slinging dash digital cash now.

       Hard to measure the effect of the name.  I'm sure is mostly subjective, but you provide some good examples.  I know the media sure felt the need to address it, confront it, and stamp it down when it was going viral online around the time of that election.  Reddit even had to ban the subreddit by the same name.

       Riding the coat tails of deflategate did it no justice. These movements are beggining to be looked at as a joke. Anything with the -gate suffix is predestined to not be taken seriously.

       I know I will sound like some conspiracy nut, but this is truly the act of our governments own psyop program. They basically take a topic (like pizzagate) and they essentially create a lot of false media, fake accounts, fake social media posts, etc that all sound fucking insane or just aaaaaaalmost true. This massive disinformation tactic helps to make people sound crazy when bringing up a topic. The term, "conspiracy theroist" used to be a normal field of journalism. Over time the word has been muddied so that you now sound like some tin foil hat aliens guy who is just insane.

       Really, the secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. Used in a psyop, to discredit who? r/pizzagate ? Talk about committing. No way the whole thing is promoted by a foreign power, say Russia or China. No is the U.S of A. that is attacking a Presidential candidate before an election. Right that makes sense.

       It can both be a disinfo program and have true points at the same time. The tell is in how so pro-trump it all is, and how it is designed to get anti-establishmentarians on the right to trust the government.

       To be fair, Alefantis is a Rothschild. So connecting him to anyone isnt a stretch. Then you consider the Podesta brothers and their connections, suddenly hillarys name is rght there. Not that she has any involvement. But try hard? Seems very easy.

       I think a good takeaway would be the comments sections of the outlet. Alex Jones generally gets pretty positive feedback. People enjoy what he does, know it's pretty tongue in cheek, and often want to support him more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media Matters comment section is a nasty, divisive place. It's readership appears to have contempt for large chunks of the country, disdain for people who vote differently. Based on the writing from the outlet, it's pretty easy to understand why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people know Alex Jones is a wacky guy, and listen to him through a certain lens. MMFA, however, is a massively influential organization, in bed with the Clinton machine, and doing it's best to create a right in the country. I think the founder can take a conspiracy theory, for as much shit as he's flung at the fan.

       Exactly. Pizzagate became big news because people actually cared about smearing a politician they didn't like. If they actually gave a shit about the children hurt by pedophile rings, the real things would be much more covered and addressed than they are.

       pizzagaters do care about the children. Did you hear about the guy that chased the cosmic pinball guy down and berated him in the streets?

       the bigger issue is we keep hearing about these pedo rings but no one is doing anything about it - at least that is what it seems like on the surface.

       You say you care about the children, and then you go on to laud Trump regarding the situation. Trump who, like the Clintons, is friends with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile that Trump himself publicly acknowledged likes young girls. Trump, who was accused of raping a young girl at those parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yup. Only care about the kids. No politics in Pizzagate at all.

       if you hve real evidence of this shit going on give it to the authorities. they treat this shit seriously. police officers and fbi agents have families and children. but dont bring them a pizza map handkerchief email with red marker circles on it.

       Progress is being made accidentally, because Trump is focusing so hard on empowering ICE to catch illegals and one of their main jobs is to catch human trafficking rings.

       While  his pro ICE stance could potentially be helpful (not including the 1500 kids that have gone missing while in ICE custody). I know for absolute fact that the greatest progress made against trafficking pre-dates him. Many people all over the world were involved in the bigger victories.He doesn't get credit for those. There is NOTHING accidental in the gains either-some were wins after 30 years of concerted effort, to give you an idea.

       No matter what your beliefs are on pizzagate, one thing is for certain. The believers AND the skeptics of pizzagate almost always ignore all of this information and more. Why is that? I used to think "limited hangout" was a stupid concept, but here I am entertaining the possibility.

       I don’t think Pizzagate is disinfo, but I appreciate your post. There is a Guns and Butter podcast episode featuring Lori Handrahan who has been researching child trafficking for 30 years which is well worth listening to as well. She doesn’t make any speculations into Pizzagate, all of her research has evidence in the form of official documents from lawsuits and whatnot to back it up and it is shocking to say the least.

       . Also she was on an episode of The Higherside Chats with Greg Carlwood but it is only available to Plus members who pay $5 a month.

       You do know that falsely accusing someone of hosting child pornography on their website is a jailable offense, right? He could literally go to prison for forging these documents as you claim he is doing. Yet I don't see James Alefantis coming at him with a lawsuit for defamation.

       If you paid careful attention, you would notice that his assertions rely on a 3rd party anonymous "hacker". All Titus would have to do in a lawsuit is claim he
       <em>
        believed
       </em>
       this "hacker". A defamation lawsuit requires the defendant to
       <em>
        knowingly
       </em>
       spread a false lie. It's a form of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">
        plausible deniability
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the emails go, you would also notice he skips a lot of emails in his conversations with the detective (after getting combative, from what I could tell). Here's another email you might find interesting:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeRadioRevolu/status/928755776985948160">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, let's assume the "hacker" really did find CP. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of sexual abuse support organizations. It's not like the Metro PD or the FBI are the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       groups out there. Certainly, there must be other police departments or the press. Some idealistic tech worker or journalist willing to back up his claims with their reputation. Yet, the "hacker" can't get a
       <em>
        single
       </em>
       one to vouch for them. It should be clear that this "hacker" is a hoax.

       There is really no actual evidence. Have some critical sense when you deal with sources. You guys claim to be sceptical, but I guess that only applies to things you disagree with.

       Sorry i went to sleep. Not surprised you thought it was me that downvoted you because I would have any way. The holes in your logic are so glaring that you must deliberately chose not to see them. You do know child pornography itself is an arrestable offense right? By your own logic the fact Alefantis has not been arrested is proof there is no pizzagate.

       No it’s not bullshit, Marcus Stevens from the DC police department confirmed receipt via his e-mail address. If you think Titus Frost would throw away his credibility in the truther movement in order to fake a child pornography charge on Comet Ping Pong when there is already so much other smoke surrounding James Alefantis you are out of your mind.

       I wonder if the people who are downvoting me realize that there are very real, serious charges that can be made against someone who falsely accuses someone else of hosting child pornography on their website. The fact that Dean Fougere (aka Titus Frost) has not already been taken to court by James Alefantis for defamation  despite this video being up for well over a year is very telling.

       I think the people who are downvoting you aren't people. This entire thread went from your original comment being upvoted to trashed in a matter of hours. Have to assume backup was called in. I watched the Titus interview with the actual guy that found it and you might also recall that a burglar (very likely assassin) was arrested on his property. This guy wasn't a larper - he seemed very sincere and afraid. His real name was attached to the police reports and he now sleeps with a gun... crazy shit. If it was a larp why would he put himself in the crosshairs of the FBI and potentially get put away for CP? If this was anonymous, sure I could buy it, but this dude put himself out there and nothing came of it. The fact that he wasn't charged with anything is proof that the evidence held water IMO.

       I think Pizzagate is partly true, partly disinfo. The circumstantial evidence that was very concerning (eg Alefantis' Instagram photos and comments, creepy Majestic Adore videos, Tony Podesta's art and links to convicted pedo Dennis Hastert, spirit cooking, the symbols appearing at several businesses, Haiti, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But that all got swept under the rug with an astroturfed story about Hillary Clinton trafficking kids through a nonexistent basement, pushing a narrative that there was no evidence. (Circumstantial evidence is evidence.) It's pretty obvious that was a cover-up.

       I don't think a major tenet of pizzagate is that Hillary herself was trafficking children in the basement of Comet Pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's where disinformers took it to make it sound crazy. Was Hillary involved? Possibly, in one way or another. Did something happen in that basement? I think so. Did Hillary Clinton have a storefront in that basement, selling kids to elite passers by? Don't be ridiculous.

       Yes, that's very close to what I was trying to say, and it's a common disinfo tactic. Take something that's real, extract the most absurd and incorrect parts, act like that's what conspiracists think, profit.

       It's remarkable how many folks consistently show up to paint the story  as nonsense and claim it's been debunked. Wonder who they are and what their motive is to stop people from asking honest questions about very real and disturbing evidence, you know?

       You like asking questions but you don’t like getting answers you don’t agree with, which is maybe what makes you seem paranoid about all these “other people” (that downvote you). Also, I disagree with your definition of evidence.

       Genunie question. How did the basement get confirmed as nonexistent, Does the basement not exist? I thought there was a post where Jaime le enfants referenced it, wasnt there also some chan anon who pulled the plans from some cityhall type place and confirm them? After which the city stopped people acessing them?

       Yes but the Clinton basement angle was what the media went with to discredit the entire story. They kept telling people that was what Pizzagate was all about and because they could prove Hillary had never been to CPP everyone accepted it as being nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people on this thread are accusing PG researchers of ignoring real cases of child abuse in their quest to see Hillary Clinton arrested, that is not the case at all.

Hmm i dont agree with that. Madeline Mcann, The elites known as Podestas have some f*cked up taste in "complicated" art. The brothers likeness was purposfully hidden by the media for 5 years, the p.i. who commisioned it from witnesses was found "suicided". At the time madeline went missing the Podestas were visiting a known elite peados house, just around the corner!,  incidently the owner/peado of the house invited the Mcanns for dinner days after their daughter went missing. That case also had MI6 sniffing about from the start, Nothing about that seems strange to you? Im sure its all nothing.

       Those are called suspicions, not evidence. And many of them were only creepy if you intentionally tried to view them through a lens of creepiness. (Like the one with the toddler's arms taped to a table - that is a joke about how toddlers are destructive and impossible to control.) I won't deny that some of them were pretty weird, but weird people are not automatically criminals.

      <p>
       Not similar enough or unique enough to be distinguishable from complete coincidence. This is almost as dumb as the code words thing, although at least it wasn't fabricated from whole cloth. But regardless, just because at some point a pedophile used a spiral shape as a code symbol does not mean every spiral shape in the world is an indication of pedophilia.

       Pizzagate is a word. And it was also just a bunch of people doing research pedophilic rings in politics/elite as such pizzagate includes this. Going whether the leads take them. No one had yet made any formal accusations or connected all the leads. The media tells you pizzagate = children trapped in a dungeon underneath a pizza shop. - that's the disinfo.

       It's a psychological hang-up not dissimilar to 9/11 where people simply can't face the possibility that their own government could have done such a thing to them, only with pedophilia they can't bring themselves to believe that these crimes against children are as commonplace and widespread as they actually are or just how many of these perverted monsters there actually are at all levels of society working together to procure their victims and covering-up for one another.

       At present approximately 800,000 children are missing in the US with those who have been missing for over seven years being automatically declared dead and removed from that total while those that have gone missing this year get added. So those numbers fall short on giving anything like a complete picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservative estimates place the number that go missing and that will never to be heard from again at about 200,000 each and every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's some pretty hard evidence and some pretty staggering numbers when you stop to think about it.

       Because it was more than comet pingpong, otherwise it's be pingponggate or something. One of the earliest indicators were from FBI documents on boys love imagery. Which Comet's logo had before it was found out and changed.

       no, and see, this is why i think its fake. because there was altered images of fbi documents going around, with pizzagate/hacked email language and symbols ADDED, being used as evidence for pizzagate. adding words found in the emails and GIVING them evil coded meanings
      </p>
      <p>
       now why make up fake shit like that if you have real evidence? build your shitty theory on a facade foundation, dont be surprised when nobody buys it

       i was there at the start.  i do not recall one person making a post or even a comment about HRC doing satanic rituals actually IN the restaurant. so if it were a huge group of people saying it (enough to make it on the news) i would remember.  we all would remember.  it's only the shills that pretend it happened.

       Three days before they were banned. They linked a bunch off zombie twitter accounts, that hosted CP ( I did not click, the headline claimed this ). The thread claimed it proved something, I forget what. To me it was clear the whole thing was advertising.

       I believe pizzagate
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of all these storys, ive grown up in care hearing storys from numerous care staff of elite/rich/powerfull peado rings so im well aware that it is a very real phenomena, and my ears now prick up on every peado story for years, alot of the real stuff like OP mentioned is buried in the noise of shit known as "pizzagate", the problem is that even the most credible storys still all have unbelievable aspects because the scale is hard for people to imagine. But in my experience "pizzagate" wouldnt have happened at all if "they" didnt want it to and the "noise" is kind of a marker for somthing being hidden. Was pizzagate the noise to hide pedogate? Maybe as a cover for Maddeline Mcann? It happened around the time the press embargo was lifted on the podestas photofit and the P.I. who commisioned it was killed, it was slotted into the pizzagate scene quite whole, thats my suspicion. The fact is that the foxes are running the hen house, foxes who have their own planes, trucks, connections, houses built with secret rooms etc and access to information that keeps them a step a head, The foxes built the very system that they use for their sick ends and almost always presented in the name of somthing holy or good, a form of camoflauge which also makes it harder to discern what exactly is going on.

       I think Pizzagate was projection, a distraction, and a way to sow division.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the current administration is ramping
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       the government's child sex trafficking operations through the separation of immigrant children from the parents. I think Pizzagate and Q are misdirection. Q is convincing the very people who might catch on to what's going on, conspiracy theorists, that there's "nothing to see here, folks, those over there are the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       pedos, just ignore this administration's horrific treatment of immigrant children and setting up of the perfect circumstances for trafficking. Nope, it's
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       being taken care of."

       If any so called christians actually cared about children they would have destroyed the catholic church a dozen times over after the first 100 or so instances. There really are sex trafficking crimes being commited by cops, politicians and church leaders right now. But some BS story about liberal elites and deep state underground shillary nonsense and you discredit ACTUAL problems. Your wingnut polarized yarnspinning is worse than apathy its misinformation to the point of overload.

       I still remember when I was 17 and how desperately want to get laid. what am I supposed to do if I'm not allowed to?
      </p>
      <p>
       should I go screw a goat instead? or mutilate a cat? do you realize how frustrating that is? this is one way they fuck up people mentally.
      </p>
      <p>
       are people becoming more and more autistic each day because all of the chemicals they put in industrial food? or is it because of the vaccines?

       How am I trolling? I’m just telling you why they’re called minors. Like you can be 18 and get a MIP (minor in possession) charge for having alcohol, because you’re too young for that activity. Same thing applies to sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, some states (like mine) have laws that say 14-17 year olds can have sex with each other, just not anyone over or under those ages. And Romeo and Juliet laws usually apply to fringe cases where someone has an earlier birthday than their girlfriend/boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you’re implying people are becoming autistic because they can’t have sex? You seem very oddly high strung about this issue, for someone who apparently doesn’t think fucking 14 year olds is okay.

       I was desperate to get laid as a teen, and being gay made it very difficult. When I was 16 I lost my virginity to someone in their 30s. I regretted it. Please don't speak on the behalf of all children. Just because you feel like you knew what you wanted does not 1.) Mean that you did in fact know, and 2.) Know what's best for all people.

       I'm not promoting adultery here. I'm simply stating facts and my opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's about the LGBT conspiracy. the LGBT crowd are manipulated. it has a real close tie to the entertainment industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no biz like the show biz. since this is how you brainwash the sheeple. and the show biz is dominated by LGBT folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       they're designers, most if not all screen directors are gay. they work in makeup, wardrobe, hairstyling etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       so when someone holds up a sign that says: god hate fags, you have to ask who's controlling the church in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       don't forget those highly hazardous and bizarre leather pride parades. they're awful and disgusting and make parents worry about their children's well being.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes there's a conspiracy to oppress LGBT minority so they have nowhere else to go other than to pursue a career in showbiz.

       A minor is someone who has not reached the age of majoriity, which varies depending on the locale, but is typically much closer to 18 and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       13 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US(among many other territories) age of majority is the age at which a society confers full legal rights of adult citizenship, including self determination and equal protection under the law, upon members of society. Buy a gun, vote, legally consent, wed, buy tobacco, be subject to government sanctioned and imposed execution, buy a scratcher, join the armed forces as a government sanctioned enforcer and killer, etc...

       You are confused about terms and definitions.  A "minor" is a legal term meaning someone is too young to vote, purchase alcohol, join the armed forces or have sex with someone who is legally an "adult".  A person who has not reached puberty is prepubescent which is a biological term, not a legal term.  Just because someone has reached puberty does not mean they are not legally a minor.  In other words, keep your hands off a 14 year old if you are over 18 and want to stay out of prison.

       Also note that this can be all different ages. In the US you can vote at 18, but can't drink until 21 and for sex it depends on the state. So definition can actually change depending on context.

       there are real pedophiles out there and all you care are 17 year olds?
      </p>

       read about marry bell's case. she's a girl who was sold by her prostitute mother as a toddler to pedophile men.
      </p>
      <p>
       she later killed two babies. this case alone in the early 1900 gives you a picture how common pedophilia really is.

       and I mean real pedophilia like fucking babies and not screwing 15 year olds.

       I think he was insinuating that a lot of pizzagaters are only concerned with pedos when it serves their partisan agenda. When there's an instance where it reflects back on "their side" they ignore it. Someone frothing at the mouth about pizzagate should be equally furious if it turned out that someone like our president was involved or supported a pedophile, but they aren't. If anything, the whole pizzagate frenzy turns people off of a lot of this stuff. It's easier to disregard real conspiracies involving pedophilia because it gets lumped into partisan bullshit. I don't think pizzagate is the only conspiracy doing that either, the conspiracy world is full of more disinfo than ever and it seems to only be getting worse.

       I could be considered a “pizzagater”, in the sense that I have spent the past year doing exhaustive research on the case. However, because of my own experiences as a child abused by a ring in the late 80s and early 90s, I know that political allegiance is irrelevant in these groups. Republican or democrat, labour or conservative, if you desire to abuse other human beings, you’ll do it. Too much conjecture with pizzagate for it to be used to build a case but there is documented evidence to suggest that 1: politicians and known associates were communicating in a coded language and 2: a “family restaurant” in DC is not only hosting highly questionable performances on the premises, is owned by a man deeply connected to the Washington political elite, a man who’s social media presence was unsettling. I, like many others, wanted a thorough investigation by DC police and did not just assume that Hillary was running a child trafficking ring.

       . The link contains as good a piece of work I’ve ever encountered researching a global pedophile ring, in each locale seemingly protected by the highest bodies. The fact it’s dated 5 years ago and we’re still collectively stunned by revelations in 2018, speaks volumes on just how work has gone into concealing this evil.

       That's the most insane shit I've read. I really never looked into this even though some posts are on here. That post this guy did is amazing proof and detail. Why aren't more of these Kids that went through this speaking out? I know some are killed and he said a few were even jailed. But their has to be a bunch more. In my 20's I was backpacking Europe and went to Germany. It was late and I wanted a beer and there was only one bar that I found. I went inside and sat at the bar and didn't really see anything strange. The lady asked what are you doing here? I started to ramble about my trip and she stopped me. She said this bar is for men to sleep with little boys. I was confused and looked around. There was plenty of old men but no kids. Then I see some young kid maybe 15 come down these stairs and go up with a man. I've never been so sick and left. It's been 20 years and I'll never forget it. Quite honestly I don't understand what is going on. Why is this so widespread with links to devil worship and high level people. Wiki says this pedophile is a mental illness. But clearly these people are organized and bright people given their positions. I'm lost...what the fuck is going on.

       . The Satanic &amp; Devil Worship stuff is to make it abhorrent and incomprehensible as possible to the regular person. It’s like Training Day- the dirty cops  cant trust Ethan Hawkes character after he doesn’t take the bribe. He’s in a situation where he’s routinely witnessing them doing crooked activities without partaking himself - what’s to say he doesn’t sing one day? Or grow a conscience and tell the “normies” how badly they’re  being screwed and fucks the whole scam up for everyone? But if all participants are engaged in behaviour so depraved they’d be universally condemned, they’re safe to operate without the fear of any future reprisals.

       The Chans ignore exactly the place where ordinary people help: in their everyday life.  Assaults and molestation happen in our daily lives in families and with trusted members of the community.  Focusing on the stuff that got invented for political purposes, which pizzagate was, really keeps the cycle going as no one cares about boring old cousin Jimmy molesting his sister.

       It's not insane at all actually when one realizes that the people predominately responsible for rampant pedophilia on the planet also happen to own the MSM and control what the vast majority of the population sees and hears.

       4 chan did get that one guy busted. He went on a sex tour. Came back, released his video of 4 chan. He blurred his face, he just spun the dial. 4 chaners opened it up in photoshop, loaded the blur tool. Spun it back, one frame at a time. I believe he is still in jail. A good day for the chan.

       Good post. However I stand by my view that Pizzagate/Comet Ping Pong should be investigated. The term "Fake News" was created by the MSM to cover up Pizzagate. Look up the Google Analytics. I believe the Comet Ping Pong shooting was a false flag. Hours before the shooting, the street cameras were turned. Shooter Edgar Welch has an acting portfolio. Prior to the shooting, Welch had accidentally run over a young boy with his car. I believe his father has ties to Haiti. I know for sure Edgar has ties to Haiti. Also Edgar Welch fired a single shot directly into Comet Ping Pong's computer tower. All of this is very suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really appreciate your post, but someone with so much knowledge about elite pedophilia should recognize that the Pizzagate scandal checks all of the boxes of a massive coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not dismiss Pizzagate.

       Preach, facts not to be forgotten. The shooter was definitely a false flag. Screaming about children and then shooting what, a computer? What'd he shoot? Get out of here, "Shooter" actor on IMDB.

       The pizza shop shooter fired 1 bullet, and it hit the hard drive of the computer in the shop
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all street surveillance cameras were turned away from the store front before it happened.

       The establishment response to Pizzagate has always been one of the most eye opening aspects of the ordeal in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete lack of investigation, heavy handed censorship campaign, and instant overnight 'debunking' by msm sources raised just as much suspicion as the original podesta emails themselves.

       I happen to think it was a FF
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       that PG is a bullshit psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fingerprint is one action that produces multiple outcomes, all of which serve the larger strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hardcore reinforces the PG narrative for those that already believe it, and recruits more from the alternative hypothesizing community by being an obvious FF. Selling the PG narrative to the population that it is designed to appeal to is to the benefit of the real elite child abusers for reasons I explain in another comment on this post. PG is both a smokescreen and a well-poisoning tactic, essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the majority that swallows the narrative without question, it exploits the fear of rogue gunmen the media has nurtured. Traumatic conditioning which connects "fake news"(unauthorized narratives) to this reserve of mortal terror. A great many will then defend official narratives as if their lives depend upon them being true.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the continued effort to convince the population to disarm itself.

       Congresswoman or not, Cynthia McKinney is as Looney as a moonbat. Nothing that woman has ever said or done we can offset her acute ignorance and general stupidity. She represented one of the poorest areas around Atlanta. You could throw s jacket attend a pile of turnips and put a hat on it, and they would vote it into office if you said it was her. 
 Her constituents would vote

       If this is what looney moonbat behaviour looks like then consider me a kook. We need more politicians speaking truth to power like this. Let’s get answers. Defend your seekers people. Go Cynthia.

       I go where the evidence takes me. A selection of claims McKinney has endorsed is that the US military shot and killed 5000 prisoners during Katrina and dumped their bodies, a multitude of 9/11 conspiracy theories (unsurprisingly), and that Jeb Bush was running a drug ring out of Columbia while he was governor of Florida. Conspiracy theories concerning famous assassinations endorsed by McKinney include believing that James Earl Ray did not kill Martin Luther King Jr., that Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill JFK, that Sirhan Sirhan did not kill Robert F. Kennedy, and – particularly vehemently – that Biggie did not kill Tupac.  You can that sane? She tried to beat the shit out of a Capital policeman.

       I'd say these are great places to start showing people what's going on, but I think I'm done. Even my dad is tied of hearing me talk about pedo rings. I think most people don't want to know, and I can barely blame them.

       A friend and I talk about this all the time. If there was ever a thing to discourage one of us from continuously attempting to share even a small fraction of this information with people, it is the way they have people conditioned to treat the concept of elite sex trafficking/child abuse as if it were as impossible as impossible can be.

       Honestly, I try to be pretty skeptical myself. But there are some crazy things that are so well documented as to move from "theory" into the realm of fact. After studying well documented "conspiracy facts" throughout history, you can't help but notice strong similarities with things happening now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems a bit naive to think after doing scandalous things throughout history, they powers that be would suddenly put our best interests first.

       Also, Monica Petersen, who died in Haiti under suspicious circumstances while working for the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver. There are claims she was in Haiti to investigate links between trafficking and the Clinton Foundation, and at least one friend of hers claims she was murdered.

       Regarding Aquino, this is from one of u/LawOfAttraction33's phenomenal [archived posts] from 2013. (

      </p>

       Unfortunately, the next step in this expose takes us to truly bizarre and disturbing places. A particularly disturbing child abuse case involving a military day care center came to light in 1987. Allegations of abuse involving 60 children, some infants, surfaced at the Presidio military base in San Francisco. I would like to point out that this article claims that child abuse allegations had surfaced at more than 30(!!!) military day care centers across the country in the previous 3(!!!!) years before its publishing, including some of the most esteemed bases such as West Point and Fort Dix. It would be impossible to lay out the cases for each one here, but I would like to share this quote from the San Jose Mercury News: “Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed. “ At the Presidio, at least 4 children were found to have chlamydia, and up to 60 had shown clear signs of abuse. The most important exposes into the Presidio case were written by Linda Goldston of the San Jose Mercury News. In an article titled 44, “Abuse Case at Presidio Quietly Closed By U.S.”, the events are told in chilling detail. The first victims to come forward were aged 3 and 4. Interestingly, the Presidio child care center was not closed until over a year after these allegations came to light. Initially charges were only brought against one man, Gary Hambright, a civilian employee. Later, however, it was revealed that police were investigating a man named Michael Aquino, a Lt. Col. Aquino was the founder of a satanic church known as The Temple of Set. Army documents showed that children were often taken on unannounced trips outside the center, and many children could accurately describe Aquinos house. The search of Aquinos house got investigators thousands of videos and photographs, and what appeared to be a soundproof room, but charged were never brought against him.

       I'd add John DeCamp to that list. The former Green Beret former Congressman has done more than most on this front. The Franklin Cover-Up is an amazing read detailing his case against creeps in Nebraska on behalf of victims.

       There is no evidence of widespread pedorings. There are obviously pedocommunites. The FBI busts them on the reg.

       Interesting to me how out of all the credible sources here none of them mention "Satanists" and most likely all of the perpetrators are religious or "moral" men in positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the mainstream narrative is somehow one of illicit, deviant, evil, underground fetish groups, when it actually appears they are regular, commonplace law abiding citizens doing the most heinous atrocities.

       Its Because These Stories Themselves arent the endgame. Sensational stories are weaponized for specific political ends. And once the story no longer works its intended audience its discarded.

       I thought this too, pedo rings are the main issue but the satanic cults engaging in them using trauma/DID based mind control I'd thought would be part of it, maybe that's just a bit further down a dark hole than OP went, as silly as that sounds.
Probably because satanic cults and pedo rings still sounds just a bit too surreal, at least compared with your garden variety ring run by Catholic priests.

       Exactly.  Listen to Sword and scale podcast they have several episodes on real Pedo rings in the government no less.  But they never come up in these discussions.  That is the easiest way to tell Pizzagate is a sham for partisan reasons.  If they really cared they would drudge up true shit.

       The episode about the rising black GOP member who took the fall for this massive ring, even though one of the young men told police that President George Bush Sr. was seen at one of these parties was pretty harrowing. The cops just treated the victim like some kind of nut job.

       Pizzagate is retarded. They're talking in code and nobody has any idea what it means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. Let's say that you're a child molester operating a sex ring and you want to speak in code for security. Would you be using the type of shit they were using? If regular ass people at home can decipher your code so easily, I think it's fair to assume that these people weren't talking about what all the armchair forensic investigators think they were.

       It has nothing to do with security. CP as an abbreviation for child porn has been used online for decades. It's more likely an inside joke that grew out of abusers dismissing accusations by insisting CP stands for something else, like cheese pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       All groups, societies etc have inside jokes, labels, tags, phrases. I see no reason why paedophile groups wouldn't be the same. They're not trying to be James Bond.

       Oddly enough that was part of his power-
       <em>

       knew him, and he knew just enough about

       Sorry mate. No hate. I understand.... it’s fucked. But I’m in Adelaide, Australia. We just had the Arch bishop of our state arrested for covering up for his Pedo mates. And still ppl think this is a one off case and not a systemic problem that is institutionalised within the church. And that’s just one institution. It’s a horrible thing to face. But we as a society need to stand up. Otherwise were no better and we are responsible for covering it up, just like the no Pedo factory that is the Church.

       People always think it's a one off because it's too horrible to think that this shit is pervasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's taboo to even talk about it. People think
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       the paedophile "Omg why are you even interested in this?".
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that we need to do something as a society but I'm at loss as to what. We keep bickering about what specific way kids are trafficked on this sub and it's bullshit because our energies could be focussed on shining a light on this issue. Again, I am at a loss as to how we can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways for what it's worth, I'm also from straya. Getting this Adelaide cunt is good, but Pell is the Ace that we are hoping for.

       Totally minor portion of your post but while I'm hugely critical of Kevin Spacey for his actions, I don't feel like he tried to come out as gay as a way to cover it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It felt more like he had no choice but to come out, and that too many stupid people (and reporting outlets) made their stories about that rather than about his sexual abuse allegations. But I'm not sure how he could have navigated that situation without outing himself, other than by pulling a blatant lie and denying everything. But he couldn't exactly say "oh yeah that kids claims are believable I probably did come on to him but don't remember it" and still maintain being closeted.

       pizzagate is taking the spotlight? seriously?

      <p>
       I'm in the impression that not even pizzagate is heard by the population.

       I hate to be
       <em>
        that guy
       </em>
       , but some of these stories don't involve pedophilia. 12+ is considered hebephilia, and some where in the teens you need to draw the line for ephobopilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the
       <em>
        victim
       </em>
       is under the age of consent doesn't mean it is pedophilia. There are distinct different age groups and people must acknowledge that.

       It rounds up the more credulous of the population and funnels then down a rabbithole that goes nowhere. At the same time, it taints the huge amount of good, verifiable info out there about organized elite pedophilia, so that people reflexively reject it as the same baseless crazy bullshit.

       Stuff like this loses a lot of steam as soon as hacky, hyper partisan, bad actors take up the cause and try to spotlight it for their own self gain and the popularity/tube viewers/clicks that come with it. Ecspecially around an election, and accusing a presidential candidate directly, average people become extremely skeptical and are very quick to dismiss it out of hand or do the exact opposite, accept and loudly accuse, with out researching the legitimacy of the evidence. 
Right now, if there is something that looks legit, the worst thing that you can hear is that Alex Jones is championing the cause. He is a giant snake oil salesman, bad actor.

       Pizzagste is real and they went to a extreme level to cover it up im 100% certain. The literally created the term fake news and FF the place. Its like JFK all over again. Also look how they forced it off reddit and into less mainstream subs because it was too volatile or
       <em>
        revealing
       </em>
       we had shit loads of evidense. If you cant see thriugh the bullshit enough to see pizzagate is and was resl then I really dont know what to say anymore. PIZZAGATE IS REAL IMO

       I don't know that anyone is denying that child prostitution exists...or that there are human trafficking cartels.  I haven't met a single person who denies that exists.  The issue is, when certain high profile personalities jump up and down and swear that there is a place that caters to one type of politician in particular or one party in particular, with obvious disinformation, they are undermining the credibility of any other large scale, hard to fathom but probable cartels.  Makes me think that the person providing the disinformation might be doing it for a specific reason....but that's my conspiracy.

       One thing that is a fact, that is undisputed by anyone was the Republican Speaker of the House before Ryan, Boehner and Pelosi, Danny Hastert, was preying on the teenage boy pages of the House. You would think that the guy who was once 2nd in line to the Presidency being a pedophile would have been bigger news.

       That happened to Brown children, the "pizzagate" crowd couldn't care less. I honestly don't think they even care about the kids involved in this, if they couldn't use it to blame/accuse their enemies they wouldn't be interested in this either.

       Because they're the same people who have spent the last three years chanting "Build that wall," demanding that illegals be deported. I'm sure they're glad to hear that there are currently fewer illegal immigrant children to take their shitty jobs from them now.

       Laura Sislby was the only person the Clinton's didn't get released. She served time in jail in Haiti.
      </p>
      <p>
       This rumour began with a PleadingtheYiff post on The_Donald
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Written by user “PleadingtheYiff,” the post attempts to link the Clinton campaign to Laura Silsby, an Idaho missionary who served a six-month prison sentence in Haiti after the organization she founded, New Life Children’s Refuge, attempted to transport 33 Haitian children to the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
       </p>
       <p>
        The user’s primary proof of links between the Clintons and Silsby: “Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman’s organization.” The post provides no email sent from Clinton to Abedin regarding the incident.
       </p>
       <p>
        The theory then includes a major error.
       </p>
       <p>
        “One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook,” PleadingtheYiff writes, then links to a website called “AboveTopSecret.com.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Silsby wasn’t freed and instead remained incarcerated in Haiti, where she faced trial and was found guilty. The nine other missionaries jailed alongside her were freed.

       Nope, because the actual pedophile rings that got busted around the same time as the Pizzagate shit was going on go zero fucking attention.

       The Podesta e-mails piqued my interest, but it was researching and finding out on my own the sheer number of investigations there
       <strong>
        aren't
       </strong>
       that convinced me of the broader pedogate. All of these separate incidents are treated as thought they happen in a vacuum.  And, often, there's wayyyy more people implicated than are even considered "of interest".  For example, the testimony of the kids involved in the Boystown/King/Franklin events indicated over 400 different "jons".  But nobody was prosecuted except King.  DynCorp got kid-glove treatment as well and are still getting govt contracts.  And that whole Finders thing... creepy AF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much all of the major pedo scandals are similiarly treated.

       Sure, but why leave pizzagate aside?  Appeasing the masses with masses of pedos does not mean pizzagate is less of an issue, on the contrary. It makes its probability much greater.

       Look into this. The U.S government is not able to find over a thousand immigrant children that were forcibly taken from their families as they attempted to cross the border.

      </p>
      <p>
       The article also mentions how some of these children were given away to human traffickers. Regardless of your stance on immigration and border security, this is unacceptable.

       If you really think about Pizzagate, all the original evidence, the codes, the people it points to, etc..: Democrats. Now we can decide this means that the Democrats are doing something dirty, and the Republicans don't care despite probably having better evidence than us, or ... Pizzagate becomes a distraction from actual pedo-rings that cross party boundaries (hell, cross international boundaries).

       This is a great question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not entirely sure whether or not a hormone would cause this, but rather genetics. Please note that is theoretical and I am in no way trying to say this is absolutely what causes it. However, I am saying what I have read prior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back before people could travel wherever they had the means to, people would generally stay in the same area their entire lives. Which would create region specific gene pools. In the regions where the average age of death was lower, it would only make sense for males that were attracted to younger females to survive over the males that were attracted to older. That would explain hebephilia, the attraction to early and mid stages of puberty. It is theorized that pedophilia is a disorder in hebephilic men, causing them to be attracted to females younger than needed. But what makes the jump between hebephilia and pedophilia? I have no idea. It might be intelligence or the way they think, but I'm just shooting in the dark here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps your understanding of it. Sorry if it is a little hard to grasp, I feel like I kept jumping from point to point without much explanation in between.

       This post blows the lid off of Western civilization as a whole. Like this is what it all comes down to. Sick bastards at the head of the supposed most civilized time of humanity. Absolutely not true. It truly saddens my heart that there is no way to mass expose this because it is the highest powers that be that are running these rings. History will be harsh on the West and we will have all been considered to live in a time of absolute barbarism...Truly sickening times.

       I guess it’s quite hard to orchestrate. Then again, that’s no excuse. Rebel groups have risen and overtaken throughout human history - they still do. With our technology and society, where we’re not shivering in caves, you’d think we’d be even better.

       This world is so insane that this is going on right under our noses yet no one ever seems to face justice for it. I'm glad my faith is strong otherwise I couldn't cope. Proverbs 2v22 reassures us that the wicked will be removed. They won't always escape justice.

       Nancy Schaefer served in the Georgia state senate  from 2004 to 2008. After 4 years of investigation she published a report titled, The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services. Her investigation showed that many sex trafficking victims start in America's foster care system.  Both Nancy and her husband were shot dead in their home in Turnerville Georgia  in 2010.

       He was the speaker of the house (also the longest serving speaker) little more than a decade ago, he admits it. How much more evidence do you need fellow internet stranger? The reason he was sent to prison was because the multiple million dollar withdrawals he made to pay off his victims, not because he was a "serial child molester", as the judge put it.

       Years ago Tom Lykos had a caller that was an 18 year old boy. He said his parents were influential in Hollywood and would have parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The part that got me was the transactional sex with minors he described. He said that around 15/16 years old he was having sex with men with the expectation that a gift would arrive the following week.
      </p>
      <p>
       This transaction was unspoken. The child would simply wakeup with a brand new Mercedes in the drive with their name on it, or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       He implied that the parents knew and contrary to what the common perception is, it isn't the parents spoiling their children with these outrageous purchases but instead they are understood payments for sex.

       No one laughs at 'pizzagate' because we think pedos, even organized ones, don't exist.  We laugh because the types of people who hang out in places like this think they're ginna crack the case wide open.

       Why not? Many things have been found out by 'internet people'. People also have a lot of data at their hands and time. So why not?

       how does an average citizen participate in stopping these rings? this shit makes my blood boil, no child should ever experience this. Do we storm epstein's island? do we uproot the clinton foundation's hq? I'm so angry with the things that have been going on in plain sight for too long. It's time we do something about it.

       Are people still even taking about Pizzagate? I haven’t heard shit about it recently.

       I’m more concerned about to sexual assault in Hollywood, right when all of the pedophilia stories started to surface.

      <p>
       Don’t get me wrong, it’s definitely a problem, but it seems like our attention was shifted to something less ominous that was finally being disclosed.

       Great compilation by the way, if you ask me, this is the number one thing that needs to be fully disclosed to the public.

       It is the one deal-breaker in civilized society.   Makes you wonder why so much coordinated effort goes into keeping things secret.  Taking this all into scope, there are a lot more “suicides” and “murder suicides” that seem suspect.   This stuff is VERY real, and occurs more often than you can stomach.

       They're one and the same. Don't forget that Pizzagate is just Pedo's that are connected to the Clinton's and the DNC by the Podesta's. THey're going to fall just like the rest of these. If Pizzagate has taught investigator's anything, it's that they can't be open about the investigation due to the players involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when they all were "shocked and surprised" by Weinstein. These people are White Collar Criminal Trash, and they're connected; they knew, they're all going down.

       The Dutroux Scandal is also a story I recommend to everybody wanting to read more about regarding pedophile rings. It's extremely disturbing, CW graphic descriptions of child sexual abuse and murder but it completely blew my mind and opened up an entire, decrepit world I knew nothing about. Once I get home I can get the link of the huge article that includes court records of the horrific abuse endured by the victims (it's super hard to find on Google, which is weird in itself.)

       I've long thought the accusers in Pizzagate were projecting. They know what to say to make things believable, because they're the ones doing it. Pizzagate is real, but it has nothing to do with Clinton or Comet pizza.

       That is because the
       <em>
        status of actors has never changed, people simply assumed that it did
       </em>
       .  Most everyone knows from history that in the past actors and actresses where considered a disreputable occupation; essentially prostitutes for wealthy patrons of the theatre.  This is true of Victorian England, The Roman Republic/Empire, Medieval France, Biblical times, etc and on into most other ancient cultures.  Only when theatre was entwined with religion (as in Ancient Greece) was this
       <em>
        perhaps
       </em>
       not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the system has never changed, no one ever proclaimed that it changed, everyone just
       <em>
        assumed
       </em>
       that it changed or overlooked the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Open secret” could be better said as “grand tradition” here.

       I think everyone kind of is. I once cried to my mother as a child “why do you watch all these violent movies about people suffering from sexual assault and poverty and all? Can’t you at least help them as well?” to which she replied “It’s true, but I guess it’s not something we can do. This sheds light about such issues.” (or something like that)

       The Chans ignore exactly the place where ordinary people help: in their everyday life.  Assaults and molestation happen in our daily lives in families and with trusted members of the community.  Focusing on the stuff that got invented for political purposes, which pizzagate was, really keeps the cycle going as no one cares about boring old cousin Jimmy molesting his sister.

       I don’t think Pizzagate is disinfo, but I appreciate your post. There is a Guns and Butter podcast episode featuring Lori Handrahan who has been researching child trafficking for 30 years which is well worth listening to as well. She doesn’t make any speculations into Pizzagate, all of her research has evidence in the form of official documents from lawsuits and whatnot to back it up and it is shocking to say the least.

       Exactly.  Listen to Sword and scale podcast they have several episodes on real Pedo rings in the government no less.  But they never come up in these discussions.  That is the easiest way to tell Pizzagate is a sham for partisan reasons.  If they really cared they would drudge up true shit.

       It's a psychological hang-up not dissimilar to 9/11 where people simply can't face the possibility that their own government could have done such a thing to them, only with pedophilia they can't bring themselves to believe that these crimes against children are as commonplace and widespread as they actually are or just how many of these perverted monsters there actually are at all levels of society working together to procure their victims and covering-up for one another.

       I thought this too, pedo rings are the main issue but the satanic cults engaging in them using trauma/DID based mind control I'd thought would be part of it, maybe that's just a bit further down a dark hole than OP went, as silly as that sounds.
Probably because satanic cults and pedo rings still sounds just a bit too surreal, at least compared with your garden variety ring run by Catholic priests.

       are you deliberately trying to get on my nerves? some type of passive aggressive and subtle troll shill tactics to get people banned?

      <p>
       and still no. 17 is not a minor. they're just young adults. insert a "well that is an astronomical difference" meme here!
      </p>
      <p>
       I still remember when I was 17 and how desperately want to get laid. what am I supposed to do if I'm not allowed to?

       should I go screw a goat instead? or mutilate a cat? do you realize how frustrating that is? this is one way they fuck up people mentally.

       I believe pizzagate
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of all these storys, ive grown up in care hearing storys from numerous care staff of elite/rich/powerfull peado rings so im well aware that it is a very real phenomena, and my ears now prick up on every peado story for years, alot of the real stuff like OP mentioned is buried in the noise of shit known as "pizzagate", the problem is that even the most credible storys still all have unbelievable aspects because the scale is hard for people to imagine. But in my experience "pizzagate" wouldnt have happened at all if "they" didnt want it to and the "noise" is kind of a marker for somthing being hidden. Was pizzagate the noise to hide pedogate? Maybe as a cover for Maddeline Mcann? It happened around the time the press embargo was lifted on the podestas photofit and the P.I. who commisioned it was killed, it was slotted into the pizzagate scene quite whole, thats my suspicion. The fact is that the foxes are running the hen house, foxes who have their own planes, trucks, connections, houses built with secret rooms etc and access to information that keeps them a step a head, The foxes built the very system that they use for their sick ends and almost always presented in the name of somthing holy or good, a form of camoflauge which also makes it harder to discern what exactly is going on.

       . The link contains as good a piece of work I’ve ever encountered researching a global pedophile ring, in each locale seemingly protected by the highest bodies. The fact it’s dated 5 years ago and we’re still collectively stunned by revelations in 2018, speaks volumes on just how work has gone into concealing this evil.

       I think Pizzagate was projection, a distraction, and a way to sow division.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the current administration is ramping
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       the government's child sex trafficking operations through the separation of immigrant children from the parents. I think Pizzagate and Q are misdirection. Q is convincing the very people who might catch on to what's going on, conspiracy theorists, that there's "nothing to see here, folks, those over there are the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       pedos, just ignore this administration's horrific treatment of immigrant children and setting up of the perfect circumstances for trafficking. Nope, it's
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       being taken care of."
