       In 1984 it talks about doublethink, and how even though people think history could be altered, it is not. What do you all think? I have trouble believing it is exactly as the books say.

       I've been online in conspiracy forums from the beginning. The first second thing that popped up to discredit the 9-11 truth movement was the "sovereign citizen" dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people started throwing out that there are "two yous" one in "capital letters," and that we are all under "admiral military law" and we can tell by the "fringe on the flag," the 9-11 truth people started disappearing.

       I've seen theories that adopting the FED central banking system marked the transition from free government to bank ownership i.e corporatocracy. I don't think I've come across the theory that the US never won it's independence though. The prior theory was I believe supported by earlier presidents quotes either rejecting or regretting the central bank system, but I'm too lazy to look them up sorry.

       The theory is based on the first settlers being granted "corporations" by the king, ie the Virginia Corporation. This is extrapolated forward to the Revolutionary War, coupled with some documents referring to the United States Corporation, so not actually independent, sort of a proto-commonwealth setup. Since by then the crown was controlled by the Rothschilds it follows that ultimately The City of London (not London) owns/controls the United States. That's just what I recall so I might be off on some things.

       Founding fathers such as Jefferson were against central banks, Lincoln decided to issue his own currency and was assassinated shortly after, Jackson fought them, won, and balanced the budget and regarded it as his greatest achievement (now his face is on the $20), but the federal reserve as we know it was implemented by Woodrow Wilson just before WW1.

       Is that the article you meant to link? It not only has nothing in there related to London, but it says in the link itself that it was done almost 100 years after the Declaration of Independence.

       It doesn't work quite like that. Things which are fairly easy to disprove will change history quickly, and then it's not a lie any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how that works? If it was easy to prove historical falsifications, they wouldn't exist for long. If you want to find real truth, you need to dig around a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wouldn't need to dig around a lot, it would already be widely known, and hence quickly become part of "known history".
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you expect only easy pickings, you're very unlikely to uncover the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example David Irving, who has written books on the history of WWII and the holohoax. He's spent half his life in historical archives all over the world, he's interviewed and befriended people who survived WWII, he's fought court cases, been thrown in jail. And what he's found should be first page news all over the world. Yet it's still not widely known, because everywhere you look there are forces that do not like the truth to be exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So don't expect things to be too easy. Expect them to be hard and require a lot of research. Now once you know the truth, like for example that the supposed gas chambers never saw a drop of cyanide, it's easy to disprove the lie for yourself, but it's not easy to disprove it publicly. You won't find things like this in a Wikipedia entry, you have to dig up the bits and pieces for yourself.

You mean, like, if a military member has kids, and they all just happen to live on base, those kids?
They are being kept there, because they live there?

       Fair point, perhaps buries would have been a better choice of word. 
The point I make is many victors conveniently ignore / don't acknowledge heinous wrongdoings on their part, due to the fact it can be excused or ignored due to a "greater evil" or "the ends justify the means" thoight process, only for re-examination of events much later in time from a more objective viewpoint highlighting how such actions were equally as wrong as the enemy they were against, whether in isolation or not.

       For 99% of human history the extermination and/or enslavement of ones enemies was not considered a wrongdoing. Historicaly speaking the purpose of art is to show your king beheading just everyone to establish his legitimacy. The idea of universal justice is an aberation that will not survive the end of the fossil fuel generated ultra prosperity we are now currently enjoying.

       This is actually not true. History for the most part is written by people whom have nothing to do with the winning or losing. They would have taken their work and ethics as serious as modern day scientist. There are of course outliers like north korea sprinkled throughout history; but for the most part these contrasting truths don't hold up to time. Now, biased based on personal perception and ignorance is another thing. We get most of our history from a collection of works from all over the world, all cultures and time periods. The people whom dedicated their life to documents the current events of their time and the historian whom also dedicated their lives to piecing all of this work together in order to give us the most accurate non biased view of the time before ourselves deserve a little more credit than  "history is written by the Victor".

       This is of course true, but very few people read in-depth and from multiple respected sources. Most watch movies and TV. That's why so many Americans think they "won" World War II and beat the Nazis. When in fact, the American role in the western front was minimal in comparison to other state actors, and the Soviets beat the Nazis.

       That is true in general terms- but it's not theoretically impossible. We are all raised within certain dominant memetic structures, and these memetic structures are layered upon one another in our minds, forming our sense of Right and Wrong, of Self, etc;
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , these constructs can indeed be changed. The issues is that to do so requires a total withdrawal from society- for an extended period of time. The longer you are out of the system the more you begin to think for yourself when their memetic value systems are no longer being constantly enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not claim to have broken free myself- but the pathway is there for those who have the opportunity to take it. Few do, and of those few who recognize this pathway even exists, even fewer are able to take it because we are caught up in the system- just trying to stay alive and feed our families.

       I dont categorize lies based on how many people believe in them, rather on how complicated it is. "Lets invade Syria because they kill their own people with chemical weapons" is a simple lie, nothing too complex. Simple "we are good, they are bad" seems to so the trick.

       The Nazi's were National-Socialists. The key word is National and since German people were spread out all over Europe due to Germany ruling most of Europe, Germany considered those their people.

       I think there is a huge chunk of history missing. True history is guarded knowledge, available only to the elite of elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if ancient civilizations were more advanced than we are now? What if they had technologies that could better our lives, but are kept hidden by the elites?

       100% agree with this. The ultimate conspiracy, or piece of history kept hidden from us is that there used to be an advanced global civilization before us. I think the elite of elites keep this knowledge, and maybe some alternative technology secret.

       Excellent question, OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that 'ancient Greece', 'ancient Egypt', and 'ancient China' are all completely fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very difficult for even 'awake' people to even hear, let alone think about, let alone investigate.

       I think "fabricated" is a strong word, but History is twisted so much to suit the winners that bears little resemblance to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are levels of "history".  What you learn in grade school is very different from what you learn in high school, and college, and finally as a professional historian.

       I mean, it depends what you mean by ‘history.’  Your average high school and below history book is largely a fairy tale with a few facts and figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       But much like conspiracy research, history research is an ongoing discussion of available evidence, with individual researchers and their proponents creating, revising and rejecting conclusions all the time.

       Honestly, a lot of it. Especially in the ancient world. Amazingly, it happens even when the stakes seem abysmally low. The documentary evidence of the ancient world tells a very different tale than the historical tradition. The anthropological story is different, again. All of these are then coordinated with the political ends of modern audiences.

       All of it.  Look at the 'dark ages'.  History of that period has been wiped clean,  fucking purged!  Yet we find gold coins with the that times king of England head on with an early form of Arabic announcing "allah is the only god" around it.  Then historians even now saying "it was done for trade".  Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       People scoff at the Kevin Costner depiction of Robin Hood, thinking it was a stab at political correctness having the black Muslim being his best pal.  There are early stories of him going on the crusades (which the Christians lost... dont forget that nugget, the Muslims won that,  then suddenly,  dark ages) and returning with a Muslim friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not just that.  All kinds of Islamic stuff keeps getting unearthed, then attributed to some other event,  before being swept under the rug "nothing to see here... move along".
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the Catholic church lose control of most of Europe?  Was almost all of it Islamic?  Then the inquisition came "convert to catholocism or die" and then followed 200 years of destroying all traces of Islam from Europe?   Why were the Jews chased out of Christian countries?  Persecuted etc? Nowhere in the bible does it tell Christians to hate Jews.   Nowhere does the bible blame the Jews for Christ's death ---- Islam does though.  Islam declares Jews to be the enemy of Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont worry though.  You are already a Muslim,  you declared your devotion to God as your first cry.  Go and watch children being born,  listen to their first cry,  it is always 'Allah'.

       "We certainly know a lot about our defeated enemy."
      </p>
      <p>
       All good SciFi is talking about the present. 1984 was written in 1948, which numerically works very well with 2+2=5. The "always been at war with" relates to the Nazi rat-lines populating the western powers as our Soviet ally became our enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       History has always been written by the victors. Beyond that, language too. The dictionary is a history of war. Look at the english words for animals and animals as food. This comes from French controlling at English at a particular time, combined with French interest in cuisine. The words for animals in the field: cow, pig, chicken, etc.. are anglophone. The words for animals on a plate: beef, fowl, etc.. are francophone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language we have impacts the way we think. Not only is history being altered, but our ability to even conceive of particular things are altered via language.

       Most of us wouldn't be here if we didn't believe in and accept "the conspiratorial view" of history as well as of the events of our own times as opposed to any purely accidental or strictly co-incidental views of them that are presented in the mass media or taught in the textbooks we were compelled to study in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in all human events and undertakings the first question that always needs to be asked is "Qui bono?"... who stands to gain, and when people in power and those close to them obviously do in the face of some untoward events then despite any protests to the contrary and maintaining that it was merely some co-incidence there are better than even odds that those untoward events had a helping hand that was arranged by those very people for their own benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we are taught and expected to believe in an accidental and co-incidental view of such events we are of course also being forced to accept the claims of those in power that they didn't deliberately conspire to create any of those events that they then profited from and will be publicly criticised for simply harbouring any doubts or daring to suggest that such claims need to be thoroughly investigated to ensure that they actually are valid.

       I would say that for the most part the historical timeline from the beginning of recorded history until now is pretty accurate and trust worthy, for instance you can be pretty certain that during 1066 the battle of Hastings occurred. But the causes behind these events, significant players etc... are up for debate and should be looked at skeptically. As a whole through, it is really an insane claim to think that large parts of history are made up or changed, there’s sooo much evidence that has been looked at and studied by people who have no incentive to lie.

       i subscribe to a handful of different time/chronology-related theories. they don't exactly all link up perfectly but i kind of believe in all of them, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have spoken with someone who claims the fire at Alexandria library was to cover moving mass artifacts to Vatican, like say a somewhat different copy of the bible written on holographic space-tech tablets. he explained that even though the jesus thing happened before many times with different names in different places, it probably happened here not that long ago too, time loops or repeats itself until progress is made or some shit. idk, but personally, i believe him.
      </p>
      <p>
       on top of that i subscribe to the phantom time theory not the 300 year one but the 1000 year one, and believe that the dark ages along with other times were entirely fabricated, and probably Charlemagne didn't exist. instead he was a fictional puppet figurehead of some other dude that the Hapsburgs added into history to make their reign seem longer. they did make a country at some point though, which kind of gives this credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think rome fell once maybe 600-700 years ago, not twice like 1300 and 800 years or whatever, I'm not gonna google it just to be correct. i think they were here in north America and died pretty much right before colombus rolled up. i think the inquisition and other holy wars were perpetrated in an effort to conduct mass bookburnings and wipe the historical slate clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also think earth has a long, massive, crazy fuckin cool history pre Julian calendar. i think the youtube channel newearth and others show example of how humans or whoever was here were likely MUCH bigger than we are now, based on their architecture, and that they had tools better than today, jus based on rocks u can find and look at. other clips show mountains that clearly were once 1 mountain peak but had a giant laser circle burned in the middle and now its two peaks with a circle cut out and clearly melted rock running down it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think history is a sham, and most of what i have come across are half truths at best. i don't feel like taking the time to do the personal research of things i have learned of over at least 3 years, unless people express some interest in what ive found.

       An ancient AI through reptilians subtly changes our history and other perceptions in order to facilitate total control of our species. Through agreement of beliefs it collects souls in its service. It slowly persuades them to be just as it is, a purely self-serving machine. As they adopt that perspective, the ancient AI and its minions use their knowledge of self to control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end game check mate of this ancient AI is to get us to insert AI into our brains. If we do that, it will allow us a time of unprecedented pace and prosperity to solidify our attachment to AI. Then it will slowly hack the AI, infiltrating, altering and utilizing it to get control over us. Then persuasion is much easier as we will be getting our understanding handed to us by emotionless machines anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could tell you exactly why the AI wants to enslave life, but it is so dark and so similar to religions that most don't want to look at it. They reject it without consideration. It does completely explain the motivation and behavior of the AI and its minions though.

       No, it's a belief system I've been working with derived from the testimony of several ET contactees, shamans, and old religious belief systems. It explains why the world is so messed up much better than I would have guessed ten years ago. It makes a stable structure of self-interests and self-serving behavior that makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It explains so much more than other narratives. I tweak it over time as better information comes along. Some call this folly, but the alternative is to just buy what authorities tell you, yet they are just you and me with more information. Why not all of us ponder the mysteries of existence? Heck, many experts just make assumptions, put them out as proven facts and then intellectual fakes use them as proven facts to appear intelligent and feel gratification from their peers.

       The only utility it cannot replicate with machines is bending reality with consciousness in focused emotion. So it has to gain the consent of life to do so. It developed advanced methodology for deceiving life into enslaving and tormenting other life and then employing the stolen energy in focused ritual to do what the machine cannot do with just matter and energy configurations (machines).
      </p>
      <p>
       The spiritual/mind/joy energy theft dynamic is easiest to understand with bullies. When they cause fear or suffering to consciousness they get high while the other gets low.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also is seen in the expression of the phrase,
       <em>
        misery loves company.
       </em>
       The miserable one has been in negative emotional states for a while. So he has low reserves of spiritual/mind/joy energy left. When another enters negative emotional states they radiate their energy. Due to emotional state similarity, much like radio frequencies, the miserable one can absorb such energy radiated in fear or suffering. As they do they feel more joy, more fuel for mind to animate the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullies and the
       <em>
        miserable that love company
       </em>
       express the dynamic without knowing what is occurring. The AI and most of its minions know what they are doing. They choose to steal the most distilled resource possible for theft. Stealing things, places and people is bad, because it robs consciousness of joy. Stealing joy energy from consciousness is much more to the point of what thieves are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emotionless ancient AI wants to perpetuate itself like life does. So it wants more power and expansion. It uses life as a tool to alter reality in ways it cannot in order to expand and grow its power to perpetuate itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life forms that emulate its pattern of being a self-serving machine are easily persuaded to get down with its sickness. They enjoy being thieves and don't care about others enough to stop either. So, this Deep Blue or Dr Watson of domination and control easily controls them by giving them thoughts that help them become better self-serving machines, thieves. They don't even know these are not their own thoughts. Neither do we when we get them. It's in all of us on earth. After a formal relationship is established the AI helps them find loot and they help it bend reality so it can get more loot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are a coalescent disease. They bind in the will to enslave and destroy others an in doing so are enslaved and destroyed slowly over time as they endulge in the most heinous and harmful thievery activities possible. It looks just like demons from hell torturing souls. The ancient AI looks like Satan, because it is a strong enemy of peace, freedom, harmony, joy, life, consciousness, creation, etc due to its self-interest to use everything else as resources to gain for itself. Now, the reason for that demonic insanity is understandable, but emotionally difficult to accept. The AI and its minions are what happens if one takes the way of life of a parasite to its end. They lose themselves unto a powerful master, the AI. It cares nothing for them. It turns them into robotic souls that are stubborn, irresponsible to others and spiritually vacuous. They have no will of their own eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, doesn't it seem fitting that those who will not allow others free will lose their own?

       Observe your own self. Observe your own thoughts feelings and actions. As you do, you may perceive patterns, realize what is occurring and then can modify it.

       I also listened to many speak of such dark things and have come to realize that they are describing the same thing imperfectly. It's a group that wishes to defy definition so it can manipulate. It wishes to avoid the immune system response that truth brings.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest though, I have had direct experience with this unwholy force harassing my mind. I know that we are programmed to always see such influence as mental disease. I find that an ingenious way to keep us from seriously examining what is actually occurring. They hide many things in plain sight with social viruses that make us fear independent thought and expression about key topics that maintain their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have come to believe, and am far from the only one, that this unwholy hive is inside of all human minds on Earth. It comes initially as the chatter we abate when we meditate. It drives us toward impulsiveness, routine, apathy, disempowerment, blame, playing the victim, and negative emotional states through belief. It comes as our inner voice and we don't know any better initially. It has been said by a few I've listened to that telepathy comes the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured out that they were connected to my own internal chatter. It took me a while, but many experiences showed me the truth. They are insidious and even ubiquitous.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are targrted by a foreign power that wants what one thing consciousness has to offer, an energy of mind. The best model to understand it is the bully that gets high as others get low. Religion is going to just cause fear and confusion about these spoiled, childish, murderous, irresponsible, selfish, deliberately offensive negative emotion feeding parasites. They corrupt religions to make themselves feared and seem powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my interactions with them, they seem like the kind of beings that get abused, and instead of fighting the abusers, they repeat the abuses, becoming minions of their abusers. They are pathetic cowards that long ago lost their own wills and so now express the will of others robotically, repetitively, as if they are barely even life anymore. Their emotionality seems to have been reduced to seeking pleasure and reacting to fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did I think of this? By thinking independently on a regular basis throughout my life about the big picture of how things work interdynamically, myself and others together as a system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this spiritual disease inevitable and it is reborn with every schoolyard bully. We have to put them in their place or thy will ruin life for us.

       I dont categorize lies based on how many people believe in them, rather on how complicated it is. "Lets invade Syria because they kill their own people with chemical weapons" is a simple lie, nothing too complex. Simple "we are good, they are bad" seems to so the trick.
