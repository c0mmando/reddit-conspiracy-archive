       I’m a very private person and not at all interested in public attention. But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was present for everything that transpired in our house before, during, and after the alleged event. Now that the public hysteria of earlier this year has died down a little and I have some hope that the truth can get a fair hearing, I want to share my story.
      </p>

      <p>
       <strong>
        Excerpts:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         On the surface, it was not unlike his previous visits to our country home. But my mother had put all of us on notice not to let him out of our sight. She was understandably furious: seven months earlier she had learned that he was in an intimate relationship with my 21-year-old sister Soon-Yi, after discovering Polaroids of her in Woody’s apartment. For months now, she had been drilling it into our heads like a mantra: Woody was “evil,” “a monster,” “the devil,” and Soon-Yi was “dead to us.” This was the constant refrain, whether or not Woody was around. (So often did she repeat it that Satchel would announce to one of our nannies, “My sister is fucking my father.” He had just turned four.) My mother was our only source of information about Woody – and she was extremely convincing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even people who doubt Dylan’s claims of assault, often cling to Woody’s relationship with Soon-Yi as justification for their skepticism about him. The public attacks on Soon-Yi by complete strangers still stagger me, as does the general misinformation that so many people consider fact. She is not Woody’s daughter (adopted, step, or otherwise), nor is she developmentally challenged. (She got a master’s degree in special education from Columbia University!)
         <strong>
          <em>
           And the claim that they started dating while she was underage is totally false.
          </em>
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         My mother, of course, had her own darkness. She married 50-year-old Frank Sinatra when she was only 21. After they divorced, she moved in to live with her close friend Dory Previn and her husband André. When my mother became pregnant by André, the Previns’ marriage broke up, leading to Dory’s institutionalization. It was never spoken of in our home, of course, and not even known to me until a few years ago. But, as I look at it – as a licensed therapist as well as an eyewitness – it’s easy to see the seeds of dysfunction that would flourish within our own home.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I’m sure my mother had good intentions in adopting children with disabilities from the direst of circumstances, but the reality inside our walls was very different.
         <strong>
          It pains me to recall instances in which I witnessed siblings, some blind or physically disabled, dragged down a flight of stairs to be thrown into a bedroom or a closet, then having the door locked from the outside. She even shut my brother Thaddeus, paraplegic from polio, in an outdoor shed overnight as punishment for a minor transgression.
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When Soon-Yi was young, Mia once threw a large porcelain centerpiece at her head. Luckily it missed, but the shattered pieces hit her legs. Years later, Mia beat her with a telephone receiver. Soon-Yi’s made it clear that her desire was simply to be left alone, which increasingly became the case. Even if her relationship with Woody was unconventional, it allowed her to escape. Others weren’t so lucky.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Most media sources claim my sister Tam died of “heart failure” at the age of 21. In fact, Tam struggled with depression for much of her life, a situation exacerbated by my mother refusing to get her help, insisting that Tam was just “moody.” One afternoon in 2000, after one final fight with Mia, which ended with my mother leaving the house,
         <strong>
          Tam committed suicide by overdosing on pills.
         </strong>
         My mother would tell others that the drug overdose was accidental, saying that Tam, who was blind, didn’t know which pills she was taking. But Tam had both an ironclad memory and sense of spatial recognition. And, of course, blindness didn’t impair her ability to count.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Just two years ago, Thaddeus also committed suicide by shooting himself in his car, less than 10 minutes from my mother’s house.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         For all of us, life under my mother’s roof was impossible if you didn’t do exactly what you were told, no matter how questionable the demand.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That was the start of her coaching, drilling, scripting, and rehearsing – in essence, brainwashing. I became anxious and fearful. Once, when I was given a new pair of jeans, I thought they would look cool if I cut off a couple of the belt loops. When Mia saw what I had done, she spanked me repeatedly and had me remove all my clothing, saying, “You’re not deserving of any clothes” and making me stand naked in the corner of her room, in front of my older siblings who had just returned from dinner with their father André. (After I spoke to People magazine in 2014 about how I was treated, Dylan called it a “betrayal” and said that I was “dead to” her. She later publicly dismissed my recollections of my childhood as “irrelevant.”

       Since you've read the court papers, why don't you tell us? Because it looks like every word out of Mia Farrow's mouth is a lie, and since he got together with Soo-Yin after she was 21 ... What else is there left to question? Did he do something else unrelated to this particular scenario?

       As if 21 year olds aren't prostituting themselves to rich old men every single day. Is that really the best you could come up with? LMFAO how pathetic.

       You sound lost, honey. This isn't a blog post from Woody Allen, this is a blog post from someone who was there and witnessed the construction of the baseless allegations against him. So yes, it's impossible that he's lying because his word is just as good if not better than Mia and Dylan Farrow's and he doesn't have a motive against the accused.

       Why do millions of other people who hate their parents keep their name? More importantly, what does choosing not to change his name have to do with this case? Talk about jumping off-tangent. It's pretty telling that you have no defense whatsoever when you have to try and deflect with an unrelated tangent.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Dylan and Mia, considering they are the ones who accused Woody of pedophilia, and since they are the plaintiffs in this case, any testimony that damages their credibility of telling the truth is extremely important and warrants further investigation. I find it funny that you use the words "no questions asked" when actually Dylan and Mia have been lying for over 20 years with no questions asked in the first place.

       lol, you think its fine that the girl he raised from a little kid turns 21 and just gets horny for Woodys old sexy ass huh? you know you come across defending this sick old fuck on the argument "the kid said its not true, poor innocent Woody"??? ...your ridiculous and think your truth hunting but your making bullshit excuses for a weird old man who banged his "daughter" as soon as she was legal enough for him to not rot in jail.

       How could Woody Allen have raised her when he hadn't  even met her until she was 20 years old? Did you even bother reading the letter? Also how is 21 "as soon as she was legal enough"? Legal = 18, retard? Also, how can she be his daughter when she was adopted by a woman he wasn't married to?

       what are you talking about? Mia and Woody we're together during the 80s, when SoonYi was literally barely a teenager (born in 1970), and they split in 92. of course he met her before she was 20 and of course he raised her because... do i need to spell it out for you?

       I have a better idea, dumbass. Instead of wasting both our times with your stupid blind assumptions, why don't we let
       <strong>
        him
       </strong>
       spell it out for
       <strong>
        YOU
       </strong>
       instead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. How could you get involved with someone who was almost a daughter?
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
       <strong>
        I am not Soon-Yi's father or stepfather. I've never even lived with Mia.
       </strong>
       I've never in my entire life slept at Mia's apartment, and I never even used to go over there until my children came along seven years ago. I never had any family dinners over there.
       <strong>
        I was not a father to her adopted kids in any sense of the word.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. But wasn't it breaking many bonds of trust to become involved with your lover's daughter?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. There's no downside to it. The only thing unusual is that she's Mia's daughter.
       <strong>
        But she's an adopted daughter and a grown woman.
       </strong>
       I could have met her at a party or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. Were you still romantically involved with Mia when you became interested in Soon-Yi?
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
       <strong>
        My relationship with Mia was simply a cordial one in the past four years,
       </strong>
       a dinner maybe once a week together.
       <strong>
        Our romantic relationship tapered off
       </strong>
       after the birth of Satchel, tapered off quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. What was your relationship with Soon-Yi when you first started going over there to visit your children?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. I never had a single extended conversation with her. As a matter of fact, I don't even think she liked me too much. The last thing I was interested in was the whole parcel of Mia's children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. Why did you want to have children with Mia?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. I didn't. She adopted Dylan, I didn't. But a month after she was there, I found myself bonding with her. She was just the greatest little girl. Suddenly I got tuned into the joys of parenthood.
       <strong>
        When Mia said it would be nice if she had someone else, I think I'll adopt another child
       </strong>
       , I said great. And coincidentally she got pregnant shortly after that. I was delighted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. But then what happened to your relationship?
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
       <strong>
        The relationship was starting to wane anyhow.
       </strong>
       Dylan's arrival sort of resuscitated it for a while; we had something in common, co-parenting the kids.
       <strong>
        But when Satchel came along, it drifted down to a polite and cordial end.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. But didn't you become a father surrogate to the children she had adopted with Andre Previn?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. I was not involved with the other kids.
       <strong>
        They had their own father.
       </strong>
       I didn't spend much time with them, particularly the girls. I spent absolutely zero time with any of them. This was not some type of family unit in any remote way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q. Soon-Yi never treated you as a father figure?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. Not remotely. She never said two words to me. For years I thought Soon-Yi was studying to be a nun. She was going to Sacred Heart, so I thought, well, I had no idea what she was doing. I was only interested in my own kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,160439,00.html">
        http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,160439,00.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Aronson denies that Allen was a father figure to Soon-Yi. "Andre Previn was her father," she says
       </strong>
       . "He supported her; he visited her; they saw him on vacations." She also disputes the image of Farrow as an Earth-Mother Teresa. Early this year, Aronson says, Mia journeyed to Vietnam to adopt a boy, and she "dragged Satchel along -- he wasn't even four -- exposing him to illnesses and disease." The adoptee was using a wheelchair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allen's argument goes like this:
       <strong>
        Once upon a time, he and Mia were together, adopted kids, had one. When they stopped having sex, it was as if they were divorced
       </strong>
       (except they never got married) but retained joint custody of the children.
       <strong>
        He was surely divorced emotionally;
       </strong>
       he could see no betrayal of Mia by turning to Soon-Yi. Perhaps Mia was still in love with him, assuming she had any love left over. But if Farrow's love turned to total obsession -- the woman-scorned syndrome, which could provoke fantasies of child abuse --
       <strong>
        Allen's had long since become total detachment.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       At 21, Soon- Yi's present age, Mia married a famous entertainer in his 50s: Sinatra. After the divorce she was befriended by songwriter Dory Previn;
       <strong>
        she had an affair with Previn's husband Andre and became pregnant. They married, had three biological children and adopted three more. Soon-Yi was one of them.
       </strong>

       lol, the whole thing basically talks about how he's known her ever since she was a little girl. so don't go on saying shit like "he only met her when she was 20" because you obviously have no clue what you're talking about and had to fish for this, that actually proves your point wrong lmao. learn to be nicer.

       Do you have some sort of reading comprehension problem? There's literally an entire section where he says he never even exchanged 2 words with Soon-Yi for years because he thought she hated him and he was only there for his own child Satchel, while Mia and Andre parented their own adopted children. Stop being retarded and learn to read already.

       How is he a predator? Is he a pedophile for having sex with a 21 year old grown adult? Is he committing incest by having a relationship with a woman who was adopted by someone he is not related or married to? Is he a rapist for engaging in a fully consensual relationship which

       sweetheart, it's not just mia's word. Dylan was hospitalised. there were investigations. doctors involved. courts. here you go, in case you didn't click the link someone posted before that i'm pretty sure you ignored:

        https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "5. In his 33-page decision, Judge Wilk found that Mr. Allen’s behavior toward Dylan was “grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.” The judge also recounts Farrow’s misgivings regarding Allen’s behavior toward Dylan from the time she was between two and three years old. According to the judge’s decision, Farrow told Allen, “You look at her [Dylan] in a sexual way. You fondled her . . . You don’t give her any breathing room. You look at her when she’s naked.”"
      </p>
      <p>
       but who cares, because you know more about justice than a judge right?
      </p>
      <p>
       "6. Dylan’s claim of abuse was consistent with the testimony of three adults who were present that day. On the day of the alleged assault, a babysitter of a friend told police and gave sworn testimony that Allen and Dylan went missing for 15 or 20 minutes, while she was at the house. Another babysitter told police and also swore in court that on that same day, she saw Allen with his head on Dylan’s lap facing her body, while Dylan sat on a couch “staring vacantly in the direction of a television set.” A French tutor for the family told police and testified that that day she found Dylan was not wearing underpants under her sundress. The first babysitter also testified she did not tell Farrow that Allen and Dylan had gone missing until after Dylan made her statements. These sworn accounts contradict Moses Farrow’s recollection of that day in People magazine."
      </p>
      <p>
       but what does it matter because all of these people would lie in court just to push Mia agenda against him, right?

       All of which failed to convict him of anything because it was all based on hearsay, finger pointing and circumstance. Literally zero "pure hard evidence" as you like to call it. $20 bucks says those bruises came from Mia after she tried to throw a porcelain vase at another one of her child's head like she did to Soon-Yi, or after she failed to convince yet another one of her child to overdose on pills or shoot their brains out because committing suicide than living with her anymore. Out of the two of them, the only person who has shown violent tendencies and physical assault in Mia fucking Farrow.

       "Allen and Dylan went missing for 15 or 20 minutes, while she was at the house. Another babysitter told police and also swore in court that on that same day, she saw Allen with his head on Dylan’s lap facing her body, while Dylan sat on a couch “staring vacantly in the direction of a television set.” A French tutor for the family told police and testified that that day she found Dylan was not wearing underpants under her sundress."

       So, again, you're quoting lies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow.me.to use Moses's own recollection then:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That was the start of her coaching, drilling, scripting, and rehearsing – in essence, brainwashing. After I spoke to People magazine in 2014 about how I was treated, Dylan called it a “betrayal” and said that I was “dead to” her. She later publicly dismissed my recollections of my childhood as “irrelevant.” This from a woman who now styles herself an “advocate for abuse victims.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So basically Mother Of The Year over here spent decades of her children's lives teaching them to lie about rape so that they would be prepared to tell everyone Woody Allen is a pedophile because it's part of the script that she taught them, until 2 of her children chose to commit suicide instead living with the lies she taught them?

       believe what you want to believe i really don't care. your mind is obviously set- plus i'm sure you're devastated that the conspiracy "you solved" is only solved because you choose to look at it from a certain perspective. one person can lie but the other can't. even though people went to court. and were under oath.  done! deuces. :*

       I could say the same thing about you. Isn't it a bit sad and pathetic how you refuse to believe a person who explains in grotesque detail how his mother abused the living shit out of him and all his siblings because you refuse to admit a woman can be an evil monster?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which part of the "female impropriety" would you like me to be "all over" per see? Is it the part where she attacks her underage son and sexually assaults him by stripping him naked in public for her own perverted joy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it's the part where she threw a porcelain vase at her daughter's head and told her she was "dead to her"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it's the part where she taught her four year old toddler to say "My sister is fucking my father" because she spent day after day repeating that filth in front of a her children as an experiment in what Moses refers to as
       <strong>
        <em>
         brainwashing
        </em>
       </strong>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about the part where her blind daughter could no longer handle her abuse and promptly committed suicide because it was better than living with Mia Farrow for one more day?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it the part where her son walked out of the house, got into the car, and shot himself in the head after a conversation with her?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which disgusting act of torture would you like me to get "all over" first? And yet, you think an animal like this fucking freak wouldn't lie about rape because of her insane jealousy? Get real here.

       You can, as soon as you explain how he's a pedo for having a relationship with a

       .

       What's your insinuation here exactly? That trainwrecks like Mia Farrow are drawn to pedophiles by law of attraction? Or that anybody who wastes their time trying to establish a relationship with trainwrecks like Mia Farrow should be considered pedophiles because he should be aiming for better than Mia Farrow if he wasn't a pedophile? Both implications in your statement are equally amusing.

       The only time you are wasting is thinking that your wrath is effective...I merely said if we are to believe his blog and the things he said about his mother then are we not to explore the possibility that the company she keeps/kept might be just as fucked up as she supposedly is....but sure make this about the male "victim" it plays well with your going thy own path persona and justifies your continued direction right? As far as his relationship with a 21yo  do I really need to point out that you might be on someones creeper radar when you played a FATHER FIGURE (lets not argue the silly semantics of he did or didnt adopt her he was the fatherly role until that label became even creepy by his standards) so though the age may make it technically legal it still doesnt bode well with OTHER ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM. But you know why listen to the actual victim when you can just victim shame with a side of marrying your once daughter figure and then a cherry on top of being friends with one of the biggest pedos in NYC Epstein. I vote creeper.

       And your proof of this came from where exactly? The deep crevices of your asshole? You are literally making assumptions about the psychological state of someone you have never met and know nothing about and trying to pass that off as "evidence", and yet I'm the one inventing victims? Why don't you try growing a goddamn brain instead of trying to psychoanalyze others like you're WebMD? LMAO at this pathetic attempt to deflect reality.

       Shoulda woulda coulda. His legacy doesn't matter to me, but truth does. Now that I know I've been lied to about what he did, I'll be sure to spread it around. And if anybody tries to shame me for sticking up for Woody Allen, I'll just ask what evidence they have that counters Moses's confession. Based on the responses on this thread, none. But it will be hella funny watching their brains go into convulsions trying to figure out why they know Woody Allen MUST be a pedophile even though none of them can provide any proof.

       well...reality...you don't know if the kid is lying, being put up to it, or has a particular agenda...its all he/said she/said crap....you don't know the "actual truth"...and my point, you aren't going to change decades of a reputation, though goodluck....and even if she was 21, he was an old fuck who helped RAISE her, her father figure....the kid even states it not surprising since she was looking for an escape from Mia...so fucking Woody is the answer???  he was most likely grooming her.. but i see where your moral compass stands with that... this worlds full of sick fucks,gullible idiots,selfish assholes and keyboard warriors......enjoy your truth hunt.

       What do you mean about "this" and "that accusation"? According to the blog post by Moses Farrow, the tweet from Dylan Farrow is fake? The tweet that came after the blog post is fake?

       Well let's see, do his dead brother &amp; sister count? Does the fact that his mother lied about his sisters death in order to avoid admitting she drove her blind child to commit suicide count? Because since all of this is based on hearsay, not evidence, testimony that casts the plaintiff's ability to tell the truth, especially under oath, would be major evidence that cripples her accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're obviously unfamiliar with how the law works, so let me make this as simple for you as I possibly can: Moses doesn't have to provide evidence. He is not the plaintiff or the defendant or their counsel. He is a witness. The only thing he would have to provide in court is testimony, which is effectively what this confession stands for.

       You're obiously unfamiliar with how the law works. A blog post isn't a testimony, and you know, you need a judge/a jury to decide if something is true. It's not "oh he says that, it must be true, let's not hear what the accuser has to say about it".

       Learn how to read and comprehend basic English please. I never said this blog post is testimony, what I said was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The only thing
        <strong>
         <em>
          he would have to provide in court
         </em>
        </strong>
        is testimony,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As in, if he ever went to court or was allowed to provide testimony WHILE this case was on trial, which is obviously impossible as he was just a young child back then, he wouldn't be required to provide evidence, he would be required to provide testimony of what he witnessed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe your last sentence is perfectly applicable to your attempt at defending Mia and Dylan. If you recall, we DID hear what the accuser had to say about it and it went unquestioned even though now it turns out they were both probably lying to cover up the horrific abuse they perpetrated.
