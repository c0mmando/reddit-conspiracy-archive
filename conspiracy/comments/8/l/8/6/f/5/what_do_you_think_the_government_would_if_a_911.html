<p>All hoaxes.</p>

<p>The only truth is that the whole thing is theatre.</p>

<p>The world is a stage.</p>

<p>Somehow, people think that going to one of the major sets of the grand play (the White House) and complaining about another part of the play (9/11) will make the actors break character.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where to begin?</p>

<p>The book 1984 is a good start. Most people are &#39;too busy&#39; to read books these days, which is another way of saying that thry are too stupid.</p>

<p>In 1984, Orwell explores how history is a lie, war is a hoax, and even dinosaurs are a fabrication.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t hear people mention these things, because, as I said, people do not read books any more. But it is all in there, in a book written 70 years ago.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHWFkZDSHF0">a very brief example</a> with proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government would do nothing to feckless demonstration in front of a building. At best, I think they&#39;d just arrest everyone and nothing would really happen. Kind of like the &quot;Democracy Spring&quot; protests back in 2016. They arrested hundreds of people for peaceful demonstration outside the Capital Building. It was touted as <a href="https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/16/democracy-spring-thousands-to-participate-in-large/">&quot;the largest civil disobedience action of the century&quot;</a>, thousands participated, hundreds were arrested. And nothing really happened. </p>

<p>Also, the media could ignore it even if it&#39;s ridiculously massive. You shouldn&#39;t expect that you can necessarily force the corporate media to cover a political movement just by being popular. I bet you never heard from the corporate media about those Democracy Spring protests I mentioned before, right? Might have something to do with them protesting against the Citizens United case that affirmed the idea that spending money is constitutionally protected speech. I think I heard about it from TYT or maybe Democracy Now, but I&#39;m sure that so-called &quot;mainstream&quot; media didn&#39;t give it the attention it deserved. I mean, it&#39;s not like hundreds of protestors are arrested in DC every day or something, that was kind of a big deal. </p>
