       protests do nothing.  it's been 17 fucking years and NOTHING has happened.  the only way is to create a safe way for the actual humans who had a role in the planned destruction of those buildings to spill their guts without being harmed by the government.

       I would settle for one Pentagon clean-up crew member who could prove no plane hit there (or better yet tge gas station video released from across the street). If no plane = missile attack than the narrative crumbles immediately.

       The conspiracy is approaching 17 years of age. These "events" age like fine wine to the perpetrators. Once it becomes old enough Hollywood hacks will make money off of explaining the truth in a way that changes nothing. JFK comes to mind. Nazis secretly escaping Germany comes to mind. Operation Northwoods comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for 9/11 truth to break through, we need a new revelation that is beyond obvious and undeniable.

       Somehow, people think that going to one of the major sets of the grand play (the White House) and complaining about another part of the play (9/11) will make the actors break character.

       The book 1984 is a good start. Most people are 'too busy' to read books these days, which is another way of saying that thry are too stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1984, Orwell explores how history is a lie, war is a hoax, and even dinosaurs are a fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't hear people mention these things, because, as I said, people do not read books any more. But it is all in there, in a book written 70 years ago.

       As usually they're waiting for everyone involved to either grow old and die before anyone can hold their feet to the fire. In the meantime they'll cash in on another book deal, and push us further and further deeper into a false reality based on lie after lie. And then they wonder why nothing makes sense, and everyone is depressed on on opiods, and the collective IQ drops and we start arguing about You're Fired's tweets over a pornstar.

       Like everything the government uses time to dissolve problems. They do it with everything. Time is on their side they just wait it out. The masses will forget and move on and not care anymore or if the masses do remember by then it’s “oh well it was probably for the better.” The masses will not protest.

       The government would do nothing to feckless demonstration in front of a building. At best, I think they'd just arrest everyone and nothing would really happen. Kind of like the "Democracy Spring" protests back in 2016. They arrested hundreds of people for peaceful demonstration outside the Capital Building. It was touted as
       <a href="https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/16/democracy-spring-thousands-to-participate-in-large/">
        "the largest civil disobedience action of the century"
       </a>
       , thousands participated, hundreds were arrested. And nothing really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the media could ignore it even if it's ridiculously massive. You shouldn't expect that you can necessarily force the corporate media to cover a political movement just by being popular. I bet you never heard from the corporate media about those Democracy Spring protests I mentioned before, right? Might have something to do with them protesting against the Citizens United case that affirmed the idea that spending money is constitutionally protected speech. I think I heard about it from TYT or maybe Democracy Now, but I'm sure that so-called "mainstream" media didn't give it the attention it deserved. I mean, it's not like hundreds of protestors are arrested in DC every day or something, that was kind of a big deal.

       I am not sure they would care. It is completlyvpossible tha the goverments hands are not dirty. That they took no part in the terror attacks, rather they were ochestrated by people with similar interests as Bush and they knew this wouod prompt a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would focus on who the hell did thw attack. The US goverment has all but admitted thatbit was the saudis. Not afganastan or iraq.

       They might try to prevent the location, but honestly they wouldn't give a shit.  If a million people marched to the White House to demand an investigation, it might get some coverage, but at best you'd get a dismissive comment from president (who will do nothing for 9/11 truth as he is too tight with Israel).
      </p>
      <p>
       Movement needs to get a ton of $$$, promote new candidates to run for office at the same time--all of whom support opening up the investigation.  Infiltrate the government the same way the perpetrators of 9/11 did.
