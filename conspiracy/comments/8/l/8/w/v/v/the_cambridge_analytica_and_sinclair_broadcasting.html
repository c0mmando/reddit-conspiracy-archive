       Because the admins probably realized they overdid it with the vote brigading and the gilding that the posts became super obvious examples of vote manipulation and they had to get rid of them.

       That’s my guess, because you’re right. Those posts were some of the most upvoted I’ve ever seen.

       For sure, that Sinclair video had something like 50k votes in 2 hours on a Sunday morning.  It was so blatantly obvious, but at the sametime I didnt really mind because it's an honest issue no one wants to discuss... It's been funny how groups like Think Progress who never brought up media consolidation before, all of a sudden see the light when they can smear Trump... It's like Trump lifted the blinders for them.

       Or like how now because Trump supports Israel, it's become ok for the MSM to bash Israel because grrrr Trump.

       The thing that infuriates me, is that while he has certainly lifted the blinders for some, most just have selective blinders for when it's people or ideas that they disagree with.

       The reason people see you that way is because it's possibly the worst way you can react. Instead of defending the problem or standing out against the problem, you recognize that there is a problem, and your reaction is to 1) act smug (why do you care, your side does it too) and 2) insist that the problem shouldn't be changed (if this was a problem you would have done it when it was "your turn"). When people point out a problem that you want changed, even if they're only recognizing one side, your reaction should not immediately be to suppress them from being interested and keep the status quo.

       It was getting brigaded in every subreddit. It was almost as if the admins gave permission for that character assassination hit job. Not that I'm defending Sinclair, dude is a POS, but like Weinstein it was pretty obvious that he overstepped his bounds and was being taken down a notch by the powers that be.

       The Analytics Media Group "scandal" never made much news either.  Apparently, when you support Obama/Democrats, it's not a problem.  Only when you support Trump/Republicans.  The two instances are essentially exactly the same - the same FB data accessed in exactly the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say that if you say it three times, the media is forced to cover it:  Analytics Media Group, Analytics Media Group, Analytics Media Group.

       Where are the racism, minority scapegoating, sexism, conspiracy theories, and attacks on American institutions? And surely you understand the history of how that bill was finally able to pass, with massive concessions to and obstructionist efforts from Congressional Republicans. Of course the thing that comes out after two years of hashing out details with an adversarial Congress (remember when the Senate majority leader said his number one goal was to make Obama a one-term president?) is going to be different than the original vision.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we can do is criticize Obama for the things he actually did wrong, like drone strikes, bank bailout, not closing gitmo, and getting invovled in Syria. What we can't do (and what is ultimately nothing more than a revisionist propaganda tactic) is try to say that all the wrong things Trumps is doing, Obama actually did and did to a worse degree. Trump criticism isn't off limits, unless you're an authoritarian bootlicker.

       The racism is subtle until you see it.    Then when you see it, shit gets ugly and you see it everywhere.  A good place to start is in the left-wing reactions to Kanye and Candace Owens.  If you agree that Kanye and Candace are some sort of "Uncle Tom" then guess what you are part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that black people need to vote a certain way because of their skin color is wildly racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minority scapegoating is also subtle.  Best starting point is to consider the default assumption that blacks are the ones deserving goverment support and by default are the ones penalized under drug laws.  Drug laws supported by both sides, but certainly including Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sexism...many approaches to this one.  Misandry is of course sexism, but we have a few examples of liberal journalists saying that women assaulted by Democratic icons such as Harvey Weinstein should stay silent in order not to damage the Democratic party.  That's pretty ugly sexism if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories...muh Russia should suffice here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacks on institutions...depends how you define institutions.  Consider that Christian churches are institutions.  Now consider the question again.

       A lot of grasping at straws and straw-manning in this comment. I'm not going to address everything that's wrong in your comment, because each incorrect point needs an essay all to itself to fully refute. So here a few of the bigger ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think Kaye is an "Uncle Tom." I personally don't use that pejorative to describe anyone, actually. I don't agree with Kanye's politics, but then, I also don't lend much credence to the political positions of random celebrities, outside of how they express it in their art. And, I don't think T_D or any conservative talking heads would give a flying shit about Kanye if he weren't vocally supportive of Trump. In fact, if he were rapping about themes like Donald Glover or Kendrick Lamar, T_D and conservative talking heads would probably treat him with as much racism and dismissal as has met Donald Glover's "This Is America."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not untrue to say that there is racism in the Democrat party, especially among the white, wealthy elites. But it's a different kind of racism than the Trump campaign and voters espouse. If you're going to call out the racism in the Dem party, be intellectually honest and call it out in the Republicans, too. I really don't understand this insistence among T-D types that racism only actually exists on the Democratic side of American politics. It's sort of the same tactic used for almost any issue, whataboutism and redirection. No introspection, no self awareness.

       I really don't think there's any comparison here. The Democrat party, a large majority of it anyway,has swiftly and aggressively exiled and disavowed its politicians and supporters when they are accused of these things. Meanwhile, of course, the President of the US has multiple persistent accusations against him and even open court cases related to sexual abuse or sexual-related charges. And people like Roy Moore are still in the public eye and are almost winning public elections despite their accusations. You can't, in good faith or with any bit of intellectual honesty, argue that the way that the Democrat party and the Republican party have handled sexual assault charges are even the slightest bit similar.

       He bailed out the banks, essentially letting them off the hook for causing the financial crisis. And healthcare companies are making out rich off the affordable care act because now you are required by law to give them money. In fact, some of the biggest healthcare companies were intricately involved in crafting the bill in the first place. If anything, Obama helped all of those institutions. And besides, banks and healthcare companies are more capitalist institutions than American institutions, anyway.

       Exactly. Our points are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       He pumped the corporations to a level where they're destroying themselves from within. When the government dumps unearned capital into the companies they are no longer institutions of the American people, but rather institutions of the "capitalist" ruling. Although a majority of the wealth was due to government intervention so I wouldn't necessarily call it capitalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless they are beholden to the government, not the people. When they rely on the government for funding and not the people, they no longer feel the need to act in the interest of the people. It's pretty common throughout history and to me should be obvious. Corporate bailouts and subsidies are almost never good for the people.

       yeah because that's the majority, the news, the universities, the city centers, most work places, reddit, FB, Twitter, etc. The propaganda brainwashing is thick, so someone has to step and remind the hive mind that they've been tricked

      <p>
       Maybe you should ask me why instead of assume?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you asked me "why" then I would tell you this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/qn77m87po9r01.jpg">
        My take on Trump
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been a Democrat before, grew up around them, but won the Presidency as a GOP. But I don't see him as either. I simply see the guy as a businessman who plays both sides of the ball in order to make things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, that image you saw, I think the same may have happened with Obama too. I thought he was a smart and intelligent changer, but nothing changed once he got into the Whitehouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because the scenario is this: Say you were running for Prez and ran on all the stuff we here LOVE, dismantle FED, break up the monopolies, go after the 1%, kick AIPAC/Israel out, and so forth right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well lets say you win, you walk into the Whitehouse on your first day, and all those guys in the image walk into the room and point their guns at you (symbolic), and what do you do? lol
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to tell Zionists to fuck off and kick them out, they can collapse the U.S. because of Bankster ownership, so you can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to pull out of the Saudi Arabian Petro Dollar and tell the Saudis to fuck off, you can't because they own a shit ton of our debt and they can collapse the US Dollar/Economy by no longer using the petro dollar for buying/selling oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to tell the Globalists to Fuck off? You can't because they will create dossiers, they will bring out women to say you did stuff to them, or they will just outright JFK you if you dont play by the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to get the pedophilia and rapes out of Hollywood? They will just get their top stars to turn everyone against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly Trump not signing the Paris Agreement while everyone else in the world did and while the world was looking at him, a globalist agreement designed to steal more money from the U.S., that was the biggest fuck you to the controllers and operators who run the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus we have already signed and funded something previously so why do 2:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Climate_Fund
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this he said "fuck off" to the T.P.P. and we may reach 4% gdp this year which is fucking unheard of in the Economic sector analysts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can hope the best for the guy in charge, and hope that he makes moves to get us closer to dismantling the FED, globalism, Hollywood, etc, but that doesn't mean you are GOP or DNC fuccboi

       Bullshit. If you have Analytics Media Group CEO caught on tape about using dirty tactics to set up political opponents to create fake news they can then propagate on the Internet, then link it. Watch the damn series and learn what Cambridge Analytica actually do, which is more dirty than just using Facebook to microtarget voters, instead of parroting this stupid talking point like a useful idiot.

       The Obama sent spy into Trump's campaign will certainly ruin his false legacy, but at the end of the day, I think the shadow gov 7th floor fuckers will just snipe him anyway, so they can return to the Manchurian liberal takeover.

       If they were just “not anti-Trump”, nobody would know what their political affiliation was. When they start pushing impotent “conspiracy theories” like Q and other half baked t_d bullshit, it becomes very obvious.

       I mean, I agree that the post title is
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       incorrect, the media worked very hard to give off the idea that it could only be found in Russia. "Blatantly false" typically doesn't refer to semantic arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you disagree with the fact that the media pushed the idea that it could ONLY be Russia
       <em>
        very hard
       </em>
       in the immediate aftermath of that assassination? They wanted to blame Russia reeeeeally badly, and were willing to intentionally mislead the public in order to do so. The fact that May never
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       used the word "only" does not count as grounds for removal of that article IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can certainly see your argument for why it should. That being said, in no way is that proof of said mod being a "creepy Trump mod". In fact, you just gave a perfect example of users (such as yourself), unfairly accusing ANYONE who dares to go against whatever the MSM narrative is that day, as somehow automatically "pro-Trump".

       Again, anyone who isn't a rabid anti-Trumper like yourself, is automatically assumed to be a "right wing" Trump supporter. Defending against any of the nonsensical bull shit that gets thrown around here so frequently, doesn't mean pro-Trump.

       Lol Q is the definition of a conspiracy theory. Discussing it in a sub for conspiracy theories should surprise absolutely nobody. Whether it's true or not is irrelevant. The fact that so many people (like you) try to gatekeep that topic so hard, only lends more credibility to the theory.

       People in your conclave were upvoted for suggesting that mods implement The_Donald type rules. Posts that make Trump look bad are placed into contest mode, but that never happens for threads that make someone on the Left look bad.

       Absolutely. But some people think it's only a shilled thread when it makes Trump look bad. If it makes the Left look bad it's organic, when it makes Trump look bad it can only be shills and brigaded to the front page, no real conspiracy users would upvote it.

       I'm just not buying the main stream media's narrative that only one side did these things and benefited from these actions. Instead, I realize these problems were obviously rampart systematic problems in both industries (data analytic and news broadcasting). Both sides - all sides and everywhere in between - use these same techniques.

       Ok so show me the Sinclair Broadcasting of the left...and not the, "We should be nice to each other left," but the real fucking left who think that the means of production should be in the workers hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear all the time how CNN and MSNBC are these bastions of left-wing thought but that is pure bullshit; sure they are not warhawks and they are fairly inclusive regarding social issues but they are still ginormous globalist corporations who are
       <strong>
        never going to air
       </strong>
       pieces that push laborers for more power or talk about how bad wealth inequality really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the unfortunate reality is that
       <em>
        both parties
       </em>
       are center-right and right wing parties when it comes to economics and when push comes to shove we've had three Presidents work with foreign powers prior to their election...what do they have in common?

       This is actually correct, I don't know why you're getting downvoted. The Sinclair video was hilarious and kind of sad, but it's clear that Leftist media has been targeting Sinclair for years now (See: John Oliver's video on Sinclair). It's literally a civil war between the "Big 4" networks and they don't want another group getting a piece of the pie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cambridge Analytica is similar. The scandal was manufactured in a London boardroom almost the second that the Russian scandal was deemed to hold no water. Without missing a beat, we now know it wasn't the Russians, but muh evil Facebook that was involved. Forget that Soros warned Facebook was "going down" a month earlier, or that Wellcome Foundation LTD, an EMPLOYER of Channel 4's head anchor John Snow, sold off thousands of stock in the lead up to the scandal.

       I honestly don't get how people are so convinced that the russian investigation has been shown to be nothing. First and foremost,
       <em>
        it is still going on,
       </em>
       but also importantly it has led to 20+ indictments, multiple guilty pleas and jail time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will it pan out to be nothing more than this? Maybe, but it seems like you are spouting some talking point if you believe that it has already been "deemed to hold no water" when the bucket clearly already has water in it and we aren't even done potentially filling it yet.

       There is no left wing U.S. mainstream media.
It's all corporate extreme right NEOliberal bullshit. CNN/Fox News just play SJW vs alt right divide and conquer identity politics. That's all.
Hence all the media were against Bernie, who was almost American centrist.

      <p>
       I honestly don't get how people are so convinced that the russian investigation has been shown to be nothing. First and foremost,
       <em>
        it is still going on,
       </em>
       but also importantly it has led to 20+ indictments, multiple guilty pleas and jail time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will it pan out to be nothing more than this? Maybe, but it seems like you are spouting some talking point if you believe that it has already been "deemed to hold no water" when the bucket clearly already has water in it and we aren't even done potentially filling it yet.

       The racism is subtle until you see it.    Then when you see it, shit gets ugly and you see it everywhere.  A good place to start is in the left-wing reactions to Kanye and Candace Owens.  If you agree that Kanye and Candace are some sort of "Uncle Tom" then guess what you are part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that black people need to vote a certain way because of their skin color is wildly racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minority scapegoating is also subtle.  Best starting point is to consider the default assumption that blacks are the ones deserving goverment support and by default are the ones penalized under drug laws.  Drug laws supported by both sides, but certainly including Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sexism...many approaches to this one.  Misandry is of course sexism, but we have a few examples of liberal journalists saying that women assaulted by Democratic icons such as Harvey Weinstein should stay silent in order not to damage the Democratic party.  That's pretty ugly sexism if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories...muh Russia should suffice here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacks on institutions...depends how you define institutions.  Consider that Christian churches are institutions.  Now consider the question again.

       I'm sure you'll disagree with everything I said and yes I post on T_D in case anyone was wondering.
