    <div class="md"><p>There are currently a few testing companies that respect your right to maintain genomic privacy and will not use your data for their own interests like 23andMe does. One of Encrypgen&#39;s partners is Codigo46 which is Mexico&#39;s equivalent of 23andMe but they do not practice the selling of your data.
Your entire genomic data set isn&#39;t actually going to be stored on their blockchain, the Gene-chain. The transactions of your data, meta-data connecting your genomic data to you, and possibly a portion of your genomic data will be on the blockchain. If they attempted to put the gigabytes of data that your genome would take up on a blockchain it wouldn&#39;t be able to scale past a few people&#39;s genomes due to the size.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but when the company&#39;s found and CEO was one of the major opponents to companies patenting people&#39;s genomic data and an ethicist that fights for people&#39;s right to own and control their data it is far easier to trust their intentions. The thesis of the project is to give individuals control over their genomic data and security is at the core of the development. I am not a software developer, so my ability to comprehend the nuance of the project&#39;s functionality is limited, but I have had conversations with the CEO himself and he assured us that the program is being setup to make it nearly impossible for someone&#39;s genomic data to be stolen and traced back to the individual.</p>

<p>You can go to the company&#39;s official discord and talk to the CEO himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is currently impossible to have a fully decentralized blockchain network that allows individuals to store and transfer something as data extensive as their personal genomic data. This is as good as it gets as far as creating a genomic data network that is secure and gives people control over their data. If you cannot put an ounce of trust in an institution such as Encrypgen then you probably shouldn&#39;t even sequence your genome. For those that need to or desire to sequence their genome and need to be able to transfer that data to their doctor or sell access to third party researchers then this is the most secure and private means to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genomic data is nearly impossible to keep private.  We&#39;re shedding dna all of the time and if you were on someone&#39;s radar they could trivially collect a sample and test it themselves.  It might only be a matter of time before employers willingly pay to test their employees (tacked on as part of a drug test) so they can make decisions based on that data.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be too paranoid because perfect security is impossible.  Some trust at some point is okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That happened over a year ago, I heard about it 1.5 years back, and it was kept internal to them.  The more interesting aspect of 23 and Me is that they are using the data from the individuals to create new drugs.  So, you are paying them money to give them your genetic information, and submit your health and your families background, that they are using to make a profitable drug.  They&#39;re already in animal studies with these drugs.
