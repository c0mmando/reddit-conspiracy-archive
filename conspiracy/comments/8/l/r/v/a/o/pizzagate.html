        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many users here seem to laugh and dismiss the pizzagate conspiracy theory for reasons unknown.   I’ve never seen so many people vehemently state there is nothing to pizzagate.   Pizzagate goes a little further than the emails (a lot further) and the rabbit hole connections are endless!  So why are people on here so awful and adamant it’s not real? </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub!  We should be allowed to discuss theories without being ridiculed and downvoted to oblivion.   Child sex trafficking is nothing new, and satanic rituals the same, so why is Washington DC etc exempt? </p>

<p>I just don’t understand why people are so nasty about it.  It’s not just a case of pizza = kid.   It’s a bit more complex.  When it started 2 years ago, users were finding out a LOT of shit, and we were having great discussions.   Then the subreddit was shut down, and after that, any mention of PG is met with condemnation. </p>

<p>Despite what you may or may not believe, it is an interesting conspiracy theory because it links so many nations, people and governments.  </p>

<p>I hardly think it’s fair that people can’t talk about it on here without being blasted.   </p>

<p>Just my thoughts...</p>

<p>Peace </p>

<p>King, serving a 15-year sentence for his role in the theft of $40 million from Franklin, an Omaha, Neb., credit union, was ordered by Judge Urbom to pay Bonacci $800,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $200,000 in punitive damages.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speculation is always just that. We have endured 18mo of supersaturated dialogue about Russian collusion that’s yielded a running tally of bupkis. However, mention PG &amp; you’re shouted down by mostly inarticulate virtue signaling. So where are all the sane, conscientious, next gen of leaders among us? Without assurance of real debate, and the public shaming that happens to those who try, why would any stick out their head?</p>

<p>So why does the lion-share of public discourse sound like a nonchalant inquisition? Is the systematic dismantling of opposing views related? The same thing? Do I hear an echo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its a rabbit hole that never ends. The UK has the same. Theresa May was in charge of the investigation into over 90 MPs in parliament accused of paedophilia. While she was in charge they lost loads of files over and over again until she became prime minister. Then the files got deleted entirely and they closed all the cases to save the victims the pain of giving their statements again. So caring. And it&#39;s the same in every other country too. </p>

<p>A common tactic the shills use is to act as if pizzagate MUST be tied to a pizza shop in DC with solid proof or the entire thing is fiction. like comet n besta are somehow the makers or breakers of the entire theory. They&#39;re a tiny part of it. It&#39;s about elites abusing kids in the sickest ways imaginable. Yet, if you cant prove it happens in this one building then it doesnt happen at all. </p>

<p>Even Elsagate ties to pizzagate in a way. Some producers of the content were bankers, some content contains learned helplessness programming too, the colours cause anxiety in children, etc, etc. Pretty much MKUltra for kids. Not that TV is any different.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a hard subject to bring up and try to show people. There&#39;s no easy way to put it all is there? Maybe just &quot;try debunk pizzagate&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Telford too and for decades, so, potentially thousands of children abused and covered up in the name of political correctness. But it is global, there&#39;s no point in me listing all the places as i&#39;m sure you already know. </p>

<p>The good news is people are waking up pretty rapidly. Look at how they had to close the pizzagate sub down entirely. </p>

<p>I was on twitter once reading a podesta post that everyone filled with pizzagate material and he started replying to it all. he actually said Pizzagate is debunked, and when questioned further he said &quot;It is debunked because I said it is&quot;. The arrogance of that sentence still really bugs me and I wasn&#39;t even involved in the conversation. Such a horrible man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it’s all part of the elites plan to bring in tens of thousands of migrants to this little island and slowly let our culture die out.  We as a people will be a minority in the next 20 years due to the birthrate of Muslims here.  Their whole agenda is to destroy western civilisation.  So yes Freemasons protect Muslims.  But I think with regards to the pedo grooming gangs, it was covered up because it wasn’t just Muslims raping these little girls.  It was white people, prominent politicians etc etc.  That’s the only reason I can think of. </p>

<p>Yes, when I’m home I will msg you over some links.  His videos are super interesting.  </p>

<p>And I know, so many charities are involved.   I’m really suspicious of anyone who chooses to work with children or donate to a children’s charity.  Any foundations set up for kids should be kept an eye on.  It’s disturbing to think what goes on behind the scenes.   I hate the fatherhood video it disturbed me a lot.  But after that I sort of went numb to it all.  Things surprise me but I’m never shocked.  It’s disturbing but I’ve sort of become used to reading shit about torture and death.  It’s fucked. </p>

<p>Now ... Don&#39;t get me wrong - if that was a pedophile ring, sure, something has to be done.</p>

<p>Many users here seem to laugh and dismiss the pizzagate conspiracy theory for reasons unknown.</p>

<p>I was open to the idea for a while.  Lots of people have been looking into it for a very long time now, and no one has come up with anything solid.  Hell, a guy even broke into one of the pizza parlors in question with a gun to investigate and came up with nothing.  At this point it seems like wishful(?) thinking to still believe this one is likely.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. It does sound mental. Whenever I tell anyone about it and hear myself talking it does sound insane....sacrifices, using children and babies, animals....mind control....it doesn’t even sound real but it is.  I can never view the world the same again.  My eyes have been opened probably more than they should’ve been lol </p>
