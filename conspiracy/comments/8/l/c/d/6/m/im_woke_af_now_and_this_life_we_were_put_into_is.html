       I’m open minded so I’m wondering what other “woke” people do to escape this “slavery.” I don’t mind working don’t get me wrong, but curious as to how people work around this “work everyday and don’t live an actual life.” Should one move to the country side and live a simpler life, or...

       Dude take your time with it all. You can't get angry with it all just take a step at a time and help the fuckers who help you. Be nice to people who have manners and empathy for the needy and just try to live a good life. One at a time everyone can be helped.

       You just described how i still feel sometimes.  Just remember despite it all they can never take the fresh air &amp; sunshine away from you.  Despite all this fucked up shit also remember is you live in the developed world you are currently living in one of the safest/best times in the history of humanity.  Shit really started to go crazy in the 1850’s w/ the robber barrons.  That wasnt that long ago &amp; we are still trying to figure out how to make it better.  It is a constant work in progress.  The internet needs to remain free which is why liberals trying to control acceptable speech on reddit/facebook/twitter/etc is so dangerous.  When i was born this convo you &amp; i are having wasnt possible b/c the internet didnt exist.  Every time you think things are worse dont forget to appreciate all the things in your life that make it easier like central air/heat.  When i see ilthe homeless i do feel sad but life isnt easy for me either but i get my ass up every day to go to work &amp; it fucking blows but i do it.  Dont beat yourself up over things way outside of your control.  Do the best you can every day &amp; just know you are human so you will still have moments where you are not proud of youself.  Life for me is a gift &amp; a curse.  Enjoy as much of it as you can!

       Really? How so? I feel like Syria would be better off with a secular leader (like Assad) who wasn't in the middle of being overthrown over an oil pipeline. I also think that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       they'd be better off if all the jihadi rebels were dead, but it's none of my business.

       Well the perfect liberal utopia is impossible in my lifetime which why liberalism is a complete waste of time.  If it is possible it will take something like this but we aint close to it on a global level realistically in my lifetime but i would live to see it.  Impossible w/ men like Assad -

       My gawd I think the same as you. I’m a senior in college and have basically only stuck around this long to have a degree at the end instead of student debt with nothing to show for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want to work full time and wait until I’m 65 to start living. Money is cool, but working your life away to get it is pointless. I’ve started selling/giving away all of my useless possessions, which is about 90% of my home. Minimalism is the only way I know to escape this shitty rat race

       I’m with you on that, I’m thinking of maybe picking up a trade so I can start to be self-reliant and save more money that way so it’ll be quicker for me to break out of this matrix. I currently live on the east coast but thinking of living a much simpler life on a ranch lmao. Literally I wanted to run a huge business but after I woke up from this illusion, I just want some farm land and live a much simpler life.

       A ranch sounds nice. I live in and have grown up in Idaho  and you can live a simple life here. People work themselves to death and really don’t seem to have a purpose or a “life”. They’re zombies who aren’t woke AF yet like we are

       Not only is it Possible, it's ridiculously EASY.  We, collectively, could change it all Tomorrow Morning.  We all just have to agree to change it.  It is easier than you think.  The first step is the toughest, and it's the stage the world is in:  Convincing others things don't have to be this way.

       This is not unfair or untrue, but it provides nothing actionable for a person to run with in order to make a real difference in their own lives. It's much much easier and much faster to change yourself than to change the entire world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is constantly changing. It seems as if the rules to build a successful life have changed over night, but I submit that they have not changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some actionable rules that I have endeavored to follow and found useful in my day to day life:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        get others to pay for your education or training
       </li>
       <li>
        get others to pay for your assets and housing
       </li>
       <li>
        be an owner of something, not just an employee
       </li>
       <li>
        supply a demand; create value in everything you do
       </li>
       <li>
        use tactics, business/employees or machines to magnify the value you offer
       </li>
       <li>
        make more than you spend
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If we break this down into some examples of how an individual might apply these rules:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        take only jobs that supply training, or take education for which you can get scholarships
       </li>
       <li>
        if you want a car, take a job that supplies a car. if you want housing, rent a house, split it into rooms, and sub rent each room, while you live in the basement for free
       </li>
       <li>
        it has never been easier to start a small side hustle or online business
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       and so on. Find ways to specialize in order to make money, but also find ways to diversify and make multiple income streams.
      </p>
      <p>
       This advise is not so much on escaping the matrix, which I'm not sure is truly possible, as it is to use the matrix to live your life in a way that is important to you personally. I do not believe that employing other people is slavery; nor is buying rental property and renting it out; but if you believe that these sorts of things are somehow morally wrong, then perhaps you prefer to be a contractor instead of an employee. Then, start a business that uses primarily machines: a company which sells things through vending machines, perhaps, or a laundromat or automated car wash, or write software or books to create something of value which can be sold over and over again; if you must hire people, hire them as contractors (free men who are masters of their own destiny) and not employees, and so on. Use the matrix, to remove the matrix from your own life and free yourself, because a slave is not qualified to free anyone. There are compromises that must be made; the details are what makes life interesting.

       Unless you want a diploma to prove to someone that you went to school, or you want to get particularly deep into a specialization, you don't necessarily need to pay large amounts of money to get access to most of the things you need to know to be successful. Sometimes it's useful to pay for access to certain things, but you don't have to go for the full degree.

       Nah the problem is that most people don't really give a fuck and still have to wake up for their 9-5 in the morning. Most people are content with how things are. That's just the way it is. Americans wanna get up, drink coffee, go to work, sit in traffic, come home to a meal and the kids and repeat the next day. As long as food is on the table, roof over their heads, kids are doing okay they are all set in the world. That's the problem here. Most people just don't care. Which I think is horrifically sad.

       It's very situational. College is a waste if you have to pay for it fully, if you get scholarships or assistance, then it's not bad. But it's a system to put you in debt so you are forced to work, it's scary and sickening that's how it is. Nowadays a degree doesn't even guarantee you a job at all. It's pretty messed up, I've talked to people who went through law school and have over 100k in debt and can't get a job that even pays 60k a year, that's a horrible position to be in, it's all ass backwards. You are definitely on the right path mentally but you need to decide what type of life you want to live.  Don't blame others for getting sucked into a lifestyle or path because they can't see the big picture, we are mentally conditioned to follow a certain way.

       I completely agree with you, I’m not mad at the sheep just more frustrated that they don’t see the bigger picture of what’s happening. As for me I’m trying to escape this illusion myself and create an actual life to live rather than working in a cubicle 9 to 5 , rinse repeat, till I’m 65-69. I’m just seeing what others have done to escape this matrix we were put in and see if it can help me mentally process what kind of life I want to live.

       You don't need to do that. Save your money instead of wasting it on dumb material consumption. If you save and invest you can retire in 10 years. Read

       Meaning like a Zionist place for one ethnicity? I could see that, with the past aryan nation influence and all. There are a lot of Spanish people here though and there generally aren’t problems.  It’d be cool if we could just get past the differences of race though and respect people for their character

       Bro I hear you. Personally, I was brainwashed long enough that I worked hard in college and all that so I have a well-paying job. I don't think I could have done it knowing what I know now. But right now, I am investing in property/gold/stocks etc. and spending as little as possible. I have one property that is in beautiful country basically in the middle of nowhere and I plan on more or less retiring when I'm ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its so hard to be a wage slave, and it sucks to pay mortgages, income and property tax, making me a debt slave. Its tough to deal with, but I think the key is to consume as little as possible and do what you have to do to set yourself up in the future to be independent.

       Anyone who views a spouse and family as a chain is not married, or a miserable person who disrespects their spouse.

      <p>
       It is a myth that your spouse is a shackle.  Find someone who shares common goals, help each other succeed.  Whether or not you realize it, you are perpetuating a myth that unions are a bad thing.  Divided we fail.

       The truth is that family is a MASSIVE expense.

       I agree. Looking to a lover, friend, or family to dictate "good and bad" behavior or
       <em>
        grant
       </em>
       you something resembling purpose is not a strong source of sanctity for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not fair to them, as free thinking individuals with their own thoughts and emotions but (mostly) it isn't even in their hands to pass over to you in any kind of meaningful way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no one's mentioning validation. What I said was that we find a deep meaning and purpose in sharing ourselves and having others do the same, and almost everything else in life doesn't really add up to shit.

       That's awesome that you have a great marriage and wife (that must be why you spend so much time on reddit) but that only happens in 10% of marriages.

       Most of what you said is untrue, at least for lots of people. I'm a more successful and happier person because have someone to push me when I feel like giving up. Someone who knows my weaknesses and is able to use her strengths to help me. Someone who is a teammate.

       you have no children or land or a hot wife. You are the loser. Send me a photo and prove me wrong. Why do I feel as if I already know what you look like? Probably balding. If you think of family as an expense you're fucked in the head. But if it comforts you to say edgy shit because you'll always be alone and leave nothing behind, sure. Go ahead cuck. What you described is your mothers relationship to your father which explains why you are the way you are. Do you need a hug? Leave me out of the suicide note please.

       People who regret it are the one who thought building a empathetic human is easy. I have days of regretting having kids, but they are a stark minority. Having kids isn’t for everyone. Those who are allergic to commitment get a pet. Self interest is probably why there is an influx of sad people and their pretend service animals.

       Parenting, done properly, is making humanity move forward to a more loving world. Bad parenting gives us basically what we have.

       Use that critical thinking and rationale towards positivity buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can do a lot of good just by waking people up around your inner circle by asking questions and snapping them out of that blurred routine they go through 24/7. It's not their fault, society is basically manufactured in a way where people grow up now interacting with their phone then people face to face.
      </p>
      <p>
       But also don't skip out on shit you enjoy cause you're 'woke' its still a life that has a shit ton of promise and fun if you use that critical thinking towards things other then just the terrible shit in the world. None of us can fix it by ourselves but together the more people that become aware to what's going on can start to tip the scale.

       You won't escape the matrix by moving to the country.  Thats just another matrix thought.

       You should realize that we are being controlled mentally.  Negative thoughts are put in our heads by spirit and its our job to overcome them, to disown negativity and embrace positive thoughts and actions that encourage us into positive behaviours.  The matrix is the physical world.

       Its all mental slavery. Its what we are made to believe and it is what has achieved our world today. Its up to you to wake up and change YOUR life. There are millions of people out there living the life they want (financial freedom), so your claim of "work everyday and don't live an actual life" is false. The system isn't stopping you, you are.

       I went to college and a year woke the F up to it being a scam and how much debt I would be in, got out of there, got into the trades where you are actually paid while you're learning (Welding), and then busted my ass for 3 years on a job where I grinded super long hours 7/12's, then quit, bought an investment property all cash that brings in rental income, had a family member manage it that I could trust while I took off for a year to India, Tibet, Japan, Europe (Poland, Germany, Norway) lived as a monk in a few monasteries for a few months, a Yoga Ashram in India, and had some Ayahuasca  sessions in Chile.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, I was "good" and no longer needed to see, to travel, to seek. There were permanent spiritual changes and now all is well. Now, the simplest thing like going for walk, happens while in Oneness and is fascinating. And I do seasonal work, I'll work for 6-8 months on, and then take 6-4 months off and travel, or rent a cabin, or etc.

       yeah sure. Also for context though, I bought just as the 2008 recession and real estate collapse was starting to clear up. This was like 2012-13 when the market was starting to get better but you could still find killer deals.

       The whole landscape since then has changed. What I would recommend at the very least, is a duplex/2-flat at the very least, so you can stay in one, rent the other, and if you get one with a garage, you can DIY yourself a 1 bedroom apt above the garage as your paychecks come in little by little, so eventually you can move in there while having the duplex rented out

        Money doesn’t buy happiness.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To a certain extend, it does, trust me.
Money doesn't create happiness from the void, but it will rub out 95% of the problems in your life, making you way clean to reach your goals, and happiness with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, the best thing you could do to get "rid of the system" is becoming multimillionaire... aka having an amount of money that generates enough money by itself to not be concerned by your everyday needs anymore and be able to focus on what really matters to you.

       I’d have to disagree on money buys happiness. My sisters best friend dad had probably around 20 M’s in the bank account, he took his own life with a gun to the temple as soon as he got off the train from work. R.I.P

       I obviously don't have the source under hand but I'm backed up with scientific data.

      <p>
       It actually have been studied several times that perceived hapiness is greater the greater your income are, up to the point where all your
       <em>
        basic
       </em>
       (not always so basic in our countries nowadays) needs are fullfilled. It's around 3 or 4k for us. After that, it starts to plateau really really quickly, meaning more money than that doesn't help with hapiness anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, money doesn't buy hapiness if you want, but it buys at least serenity.

       The first and and most important escape is the inner one. Once you can "escape" the matrix internally, the external escape will follow - your actions will become inspired by the internal freedom, peace and wisdom you have gained.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the inner escape is fundamentally not even an escape. It is discovering of the inherent freedom, peace, love and deep wisdom that is beyond all the mental fog that you yourself and society at large have imposed on you. It is discovering so much more than that as well, including an intuition that is natural to you and can guide you through life, your deepest nature beyond the body/mind machination....etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditate, introspect, be present and look within, embrace the thoughts, emotions, sensations that come up, let them go.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound simple, and it is, but it is not always easy. Simply because it may take quite the desire for freedom and the discipline to remain engaged in such introspection and inner integration.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can escape the matrix in many ways, but the fundamental escape for me is and always will be of a spiritual nature (and do not mistake spirituality with religion, they may have their similarities at times, but most of religion is hopelessly corrupt and the teachings of its founders, like Jesus or the Buddha, have become distorted beyond belief throughout the millennia since their passing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply my perspective of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately you should not believe a word I say, but instead try it for yourself if you are curious about this path.

       I think you're both correct. Revolution isn't the anwer as whatever regime change occurs would trigger a power vacuum that will further enable the current traitors in power to enter a state of complete totalitarian domination. But the atrocities committed by the TPTB are so unfathomably heinous that to simply accept it as the state of the world is defeat; it's also a vast over-simplification. Without rapid improvement, there will come a time when the conditions of born-free humans are so despicably awful that the less insufferable, and more principled, option is [violent] revolution and war in the streets of the First World. The PTB are working much faster than most people realize, and much more diligently.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I, and many other people, want is a non-violent restoration of the Constitution and the restablishment and upholding of the Bill of Rights for
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       citizens. And if violent revolution ever were to break out in the US, however unfortunate that would be, I would certainly hope that it would be for restoration of the Constitution of this great Republic.

       I think it's a waste. I used to have my dreams of this world becoming a better place. I'm through believing such nonsense. Freedom from this place is where it's at imo. And no, I'm not suicidal. I think the system is rigged truly from start to finish and I don't think death without the knowledge of being able to go after the monsters that's done this to us* will get you anywhere but being sent back here.

       *Reincarnation isn't beautiful. I practically want to fall out of my chair if I see somebody talking about the beauty of existing forever. No fucking way. We got screwed big time. Don't expect me to believe tripe about we're here to learn lessons, it's a school, you're paying back karmic debt, etc. Just more bullshit to be bogged down imo.

       After one of my friends who is a money manager told me he started to tell people NOT TO GO TO COLLEGE, I got off the corporate ladder. He said that because the return is one of the worst things you can invest in. Not everyone is the same but a lot of people getting Lib Arts degrees and shit like that will be broke for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I went 100% commission based sales. If you want to escape the rat race/slavery stuff, be a decent person and work for yourself.

       I do extremely well in Real Estate. My 2 brothers are doing well in sales too. One in logistics, one is in upper mgmt at a privately owned ATT cell carrier. 2 of us didn't finish college, 1 did. All 3 of us are making over 6 figures and are living in the south, not Cali or NY so we live very well. Having/not having a degree doesn't matter when you are tasked with making your own money. It is up to you to kill something to eat.

       Arrogant ignorance is your own worst enemy. Yes it is all fucked. Take solace that there is some order to the chaos and that the global cabal in charge of world building know that old timey ideas, grandfathered laws, and broken systems dont work. Just realise that it takes time to enact change and that regolutions as they happened in late 1800s and early 1900s around the world cannot happen again. So the wars that were around that culled the population, that old population of humans who were not raised in the modern industrialised world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adult humans are hard to change, scinece is there. But with our modern world we are chaning all this and hopefully enough of the population is smart enough now to vote for the right ideals in majoroty of the powerful nations. Agenda 21, recently descovered that my ideas on whats hapoening around the world are actuallly a part of this huge document from early 2000s. Seriously, its wierd knowing im not just going crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a breath and educate yourself. Take time to learn meditation, self control, your passions and hobbies in life.  The whole system is moving away from current financial debt enslavement anyway, it doesnt work, we know this, so many people dont have retirenment funds if we as societies around the wolrd dont change there will be an uprising against the 1%. And they know this. They are trying hard to change gun laws in america, because this is going to be huge shift in whats going to happen. World is so big, and has so many different governing ways, financial systems, social systems some work some dont, its all an experiment. World has been running experiments on humanity since industrialisation in 1900s. Because it is this automation of technology that allowed us to do things we never could before in history of humanity. Last 100 years have seen most progress than humanity has ever seen in the 100000 some years as modern human species been around.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next revolution is here people, automation, globalisation of some sort is coming. Just not the one hollywood has been selling us. Its going to happen, because automated world is more efficient and stresmlines just as industriliased world was compaired to the fudal europian factory guilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But right now we still have very diverse population numbers. Progressives, liberals, labour, conservatives are all political terms, but in laimen terms it just means thise who want things to remain as they were and those who are ready to imbrace change. Because lets face it, we are humans, independant autonomous, we do what we want, and we are not supporting of the system we are in we will rebel in some way, causing a destruction of society. Ancient world is full of fallen empires and collapsed civilisations. We have learnt from history enough to know that to keep moving forward as a species we need change, and change is needed when systems no longer work for the majoroty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current capitalised western world that dominates modern living has come to an end. Many will fight it conservation of their old system and ideals. But change will happen regardless, as majoroty of the world, even US the most anti socialist vocalists, are having socialists movements and socialists running for gov positions. Its hapoening. Things will change just as they did 100years ago for our industrial revolution. So will things change for the automated world revolution thats coming within our lifetimes.

       Take small steps everyday.  Don't get bogged down into this slavery mindset.  Help others as you are able.  Enjoy the moment and spread positivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If moving to the countryside is what it takes for you to get your mind right, take baby steps in that direction as you are able.    Stuck in an apartment? Get a houseplant, and some herbs growing in your window.  You may not be able to change your surroundings imediately, but you can change your mindset.

       Every path seems pretty fucked honestly.  I see people in debt from law school or medical school that make barely enough to live on their own, meanwhile there are some twitch streamers doing what they love making 6 figures a fucking MONTH dude.  No boss, no shitty coworkers, no corporate ladder bs...nothing but yourself.    Thats the dream.

       College isn't necessarily a scam. You have to major in something that can make you money though. On average, college grads earn $500K more over the course of their lives, even factoring in student loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an engineering degree, I make good money and work 9-5 with 4 weeks of vacation time plus holidays. The issue is people who go to college, don't network, major in something useless, and don't get any internships.

       Nice!!! Electrical is top of my list and I've always been fascinated by electricity.  Now for me I've been debating on going for an apprenticeship, or go to school for electrical engineer. Some things to think about! If you have anything to add about the industry please tell if not thank you anyways!! Best wishes for you friend!

       Industry is pretty varied, there are lots of jobs. EE is a huge field, there is lots to be interested in. I recommend learning to code and/or getting one of those electronics kits! And study math, you will need lots of math.

       no but you can choose to understand that we do live in this matrix and do your part to create change on a smaller level and realize that there is no such thing as Utopia. Life is pretty damn good. as for homeless people, it's just simple darwinism that translates into society, where the weak don't survive. not to shit on homeless people.

       I disagree only partly, I had a dope ass teacher in high school who used an honors English class to facilitate his operation to educate his students on the real world. Quotes like “Nothing that is so, is so.” And “History is a series of lies agreed upon.” He was basically Morpheus to all his students, he would show us how deep the rabbit hole was, and gave us the tools to stay “woke” as you put it. He was a soldier on the front lines of the battle for our minds.

       The modern "chains" in slavery is materialism and societal pressures. The "keeping up with the joneses". The sense of embarrassment at having a cheap phone or clothes. The fact that the first thing people ask at each other at parties is "what do you do?" and that means job. If you don't have a job, they suddenly don't want to talk to you anymore.

       The cycle of the week always brings you back. Time is a delusion used to control you. Your mind is colonized so you can't even imagine a real option. In order to break free I invented my own time and clocks to keep it. I use my own calendar with no weeks. I even count differently, using a different Base. The matrix is the ritual of the week. It trains the mind.

       I'm assuming that you're talking mostly about how to survive and make money in a predominantly money driven society.  Each country has it's own challenges; however, after living in several different countries, I have found that some places are easier to live and make ends meet than others.  Taxation makes life harder than it needs to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, shadow economies exist all over the world.  Most of them are legal and don't hurt other people.  Find yourself a business that deals mostly in cash.  You'll be thankful you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just leave a couple of examples to think about:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Plant nursery - the IRS doesn't know how many plants die off, or how many can be grown from other plants.  It's mostly a cash business.  It's a business that's hard to track and cash is still pretty anonymous (as long as you don't use banks - another discussion)
       </li>
       <li>
        Fish (i.e. Koi farm) - same reasons as above.
       </li>
       <li>
        Restaurants (not recommended) - depending on the style of restaurant, can be heavily cash driven.  Many downsides to the restaurant business, high overhead costs, high labor costs, high food costs.
       </li>
      </ul>

       Clean your God damn room.  Build some competence and then look outward.   You shouldn't contemplate challenging structures like colleges and the monetary system until you have yourself very well put together.

       College is a business and only necessary for certain jobs unless you put the time in on your own to be exceptional.

       Monetary system is the best thing so far and has solved a lot of problems albeit created some but arguably not as bad but still bad.

       People are greedy. But that’s rather cynical to just end there. People are selfish and so are you and me.

       Homeless people are either lazy or have mental issues and need help. Their is work to be done and low skill jobs with high turnover rate are hiring constantly. I guarantee it.

       I had a lot of the same thoughts at one point. Pretty self destructive and self loathing. Didn’t seem like it at the time. Take on challenges that you can change. Your career, relationships, education... it took me a couple years to figure out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re definitely not wrong that bullshit is going on. Keep investigating and be more positive, it’s helpful and kind of necessary. But things really aren’t as deep and complex as their made out to be. It’s honestly in plain sight and I can give examples for each point I made.

       I am so fucking unhappy with existing. I feel like I'm in prison. And let me clear and say this is NOT my depression talking. This is common sense showing just how deeply the odds are stacked against us. I'm thankful for who and what I've got in my life, got very few hobbies I enjoy doing anymore. The rest of this shit is such a waste. It's completely pointless. Nothing but a fucking drain every single day.

       Campus's famous quote from the rebel should help you. You can look it up but it is something like - when you realize you live in an unjust society, the only effective way to rebel against it is to live your life so free that your very existence is an act of revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Terrence Mckenna's advice is useful - always remember CULTURE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. In many instances (but not always) if you do the opposite of what mainstream culture dictates you should do, it will lead to a happy result.

       I'm fixin' to walk/pedal out of here.  Staying in this society means contributing to the misery of others.  Every dollar re-inforces the system.  My lack of hunting skills is the only thing that's kept me from walking into the Oregon wilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       After my last job, I was like, "Why am I doing this only to have enough for food and shelter? If I'm going to just
       <strong>
        exist
       </strong>
       instead of live, screw it, there's simpler ways to do that."  In reality, its not the money one needs, its the resources.  So, I've got my bicycle, camping gear/tools and a map of BLM land.  I've got xp with cold weather camping, long bike trips, hikes and being uncomfortable.  But I've almost always bought &amp; packed in food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I love my 1/2-3/4lb triple bacon cheeseburgers, but I've also become wayyy to aware of how terribly cruel our meat production is.  Typing this, I've gone all Pavlov's dog thinking about walking down to the diner, BUT its also impossible to ignore what goes into getting that burger to me.  It seems killing locally would just be better for everyone all the way around.  So last week I started learning how to set snares for small game.
      </p>
      <p>
       My savings run out in ~6-8 weeks.  Unless some really awesome opportunity drops in my lap, being a "productive member of society" isn't really worth it.  Why not give the hunter/gatherer/cyclist lifestyle a shot?  Seems a heckuvalot more honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Won't often be comfortable but...  What we're doing isn't right but we've gotten inured to it.  How many are reading this on an Apple product?  The tech
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       pretty cool, but how many factory girls in China are ready to jump off a building because of the working conditions making that tech?  My country lied itself into a war
       <del>
        for oil that's killed over 1mil Iraquis
       </del>
       FOR FREEDUMMMM.  There's example after example after example of stuff that's done "for a stable, prosperous society" that I'm not really cool with.  Every bit of commerce seems to contribute to stuff most of us would not let happen if it was right in front of us.  And even the stuff that is right in front of us... I've been management and had to make dickhead decisions for the company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Screw. This.  I dunno if it'll work, but I'm ready to at least try trading society's "stability" for a clearer conscience.  Does anyone here really feel free?  How many constraints does everyone have on their time that aren't of any benefit to you or those you care about? I'll put up with mosquitoes for actual freedom.  Or something more free than whatever "this" is.

       Focus on something that gives you purpose and recognize that there is nothing we can do to avoid the suffering and unfairness that is inherent to being human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alleviate suffering where you realistically can. Buy some cheap tupperware, get a slow cooker for less than 50 bucks, make something hot and tasty, throw it in a backpack, and spend a Saturday handing it out to homeless people. Maybe throw in some toiletries and some clean socks. Deodorant and moist wipes are great during the summer. A cheap but warm jacket, pair of gloves, and hat are great in the winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donate your time to something meaningful. Join a Big Brother-esque program. Give someone less fortunate the chance to learn from someone who has it better y pure chance. Instill this attitude into them. If it takes hold, maybe they can attain something higher than they realized is possible, pass it along to others, and continue a ripple effect that begun with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn a practical hobby. Something like woodworking, carving, sewing, knitting, cooking, etc. Something that gives you a creative outlet, and if you're good enough, a way to monetize your skill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a topic and commit yourself to becoming as much of an expert as you can on it. Let it completely take over your thoughts during the day. Be the person who impresses people by speaking candidly during a discussion over lunch in addition to the one who people can't stand drinking with because they'll start talking about how Y-person influenced X-topic more than people seem to realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting through this life is hard, but it's easier for us than any single person who has lived before us. It doesn't require ignoring the shit that comes with it, but it's unnecessarily more difficult to when you allow yourself to hone in on the negatives. Acknowledging is reasonable. Dwelling on things you can't change is not. It is toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a job that most would consider soul-crushing. It's your typical cube excel file bullshit. It's not what I would call fun.  I get to code a bit which I enjoy, but it's typically to automate the boring shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I enjoy the Hell out of it. I do good at everything I do, or at the very least, am proud of the effort I put in. I enjoy knowing that I'm seen as someone who is valuable to the overall goal of bringing success to the company. I enjoy knowing that I can get better at what I do and move up the ladder. On bad days I take note of what was bad, think about whether or not there was a way to avoid it, and keep it in mind for the day I start my own company. I take note of industry-specific issues: What software would make this easier for everyone? What policies would make people happier to work while not sacrificing productivity? Etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, realize that working on yourself is the most productive thing you can possibly do in this life. Anyone can be an expert at picking apart others. It's incredibly easy to start, quick to master, and addictive to continue. Put that ability into yourself and then do something about it. Out of shape? Start moving. Run, join a gym, do body weight exercises, do *something*. Are you not as socially adept as you'd like to be? *Practice*. Make yourself uncomfortable. Go places that you'll never have to  return to and literally practice being social. When your gut is telling you to not do something that doesn't immediately put you at risk for serious harm or death, you should do it. Make yourself better and be an example that those feeling the way you do at this moment can look to as an example of how to make the best of it in the future.

       For what it's worth, I went from a do-nothing potential-wasting pizza delivery driver who couldn't do as much as a full load of laundry over the course of a week. "Do" really meant "getting them out of the dryer and dumping them on my bed."
      </p>
      <p>
       After a lot of self reflection and intentionally paying attention to my behavior and the way I reacted to things I managed to slowly pull myself out of whatever circle I was stuck in. I still have a Hell of a ways to go, and while life is capable of sending me down even deeper than I was, I'll be god damned if I won't give it everything to keep climbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if this seems shilly as Hell but Jordan Peterson was instrumental for me in regard to adjusting my attitude and striving for something worth living for. When I say there's not a single person who has impacted and improved my adult life more than he has, I mean it. He's far from obscure at this point, but I
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       recommend his lectures and books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sincerely hope that you continue keeping your focus upward. I'll be going to bed in a few minutes, but shoot me a PM if you ever need to chat.

       I recommend the following all of which keep me amazingly free of the matrix:
GET &amp; STAY HEALTHY - critical.
GET OUT OF DEBT - TOP PRIORITY
CANCEL CREDIT CARD
USE CASH for everything possible. Pay in cash, ask to be paid in cash. 
NO CELL PHONE
NO TV
NO ALEXA CREEPY SPY THINGERS in your home
NO Facebook
APPLIANCES - only have appliances that are not connected to the internet. Keep them working and don't swap them out for a "smart" appliance!
FORGET COLLEGE. Instead
LEARN SKILLS / APPRENTICE Pick something that fascinates you &amp; is vital for human survival. I learned to make real bread, created a business I could run out of my home and lived off of that until I retired
BE YOUR OWN BOSS 
HOME SCHOOL YOUR KIDS - to avoid the cultural engineering, indoctrination and so they are clear about what gender they are.
EARN AS LITTLE MONEY AS YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH to avoid taxes
BE FRUGAL / stop mindless spending so you don't have to be a wage slave
GROW YOUR OWN FOOD! This more than anything = FREEDOM
IF POSSIBLE, NO CAR. That's a tough one if you, like me live in a very small rural town. But I'm working out an arrangement to share a car with other households. Having to get a driver's license, purchase insurance, purchase a car, register it and have it inspected really REALLY keeps you tethered to the matrix.

       you create your own reality.  The Mandela effect shows that this universe is merely our own creation.  If you truly believed that people were loving, that you would succeed,  that the government had people within who really cared for others.  Well, perhaps then youd be living in the universe that has Coca~Cola, and eat Kit-Kats, the universe where Queen would end the song with "we are the champions,  of the world".  Or the universe where Moonraker made sense - where the girl Dolly had tooth braces and ended up falling in love with Jaws - in this universe she doesn't have teeth braces,  so the plot has no meaning,  there is no reason for her to fall for jaws...
      </p>

       There are infinite universes and existence between them is fluid.  Every time you blink you swap universes.  Welcome to this one,  I dont know why I'm here either,  but like you i see nothing but tyranny.... It's my fault im here,  i know that.   Change your mind, alter your automatic thoughts and keep blinking,  eventually youll land in a better universe.

       The thing that really improved my life is working in a field where the demand for my skills is very high.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has allowed me to get away with shit that wouldn't be possible in other fields. For six solid years I worked from home. I went nearly three years without meeting my boss.
      </p>
      <p>
       My life isn't as nice as being 100% retired, but I've had entire months where I basically worked about four hours a week.

       Work for yourself. Find what it is you want to contribute and work on it like your life depends on it. If it's something you have a passion for and truly put effort into, you'll be successful. You'll end up surrounded by people who share your passion. Then you'll start to see that the beauty in life is being able to create whatever you want. It's hard work to dig yourself out of the mentality the world thrusts upon you but it's like any other bad habit. You might need a change of scenery. When I woke up, I stopped breaking my back and put all my egg in the music basket. I moved across the country and now I'm planning on moving to an island with by band where we can get a job as a house band for a tourist resort. I might not be rich but ill be living it up on a beach and playing music for the rest of my days and I'm only 31. Make sure to pay it forward. You can do that just by being what it is you think you should be if the world wasn't holding you back. Because the truth is, it's not the world holding us back but it's us holding the world back. The more people that realize this, the sooner we'll break free as a whole.

       Welcome to the real world, Neo.

      <p>
       You can't make a difference on the global scale unless you become a politician or a Supreme Court justice or something. But you can make a difference locally.  Be a decent person, be kind, and awake others around you gently.  They will not want to stir from their comfortable slumber in the Matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing you can do is volunteer to help, with charities and food banks and homeless shelters and so forth. Your idea of moving to the country and living a simple life is a good one.  Do what makes you feel happy and fulfilled, and help others do the same.

       I used to be too woke where being woke would consume my life away. I stopped caring about how evil this world is and just focusing on living my life. Only powerful people can stop this this evilness like pizzagate and so on. I rather focus on making a living so I can start to enjoy my own life again. Maybe take a trip to Asia and never comeback again.

       My answer is intuition. Believe that you are able accomplish whatever it is you're still alive for. The moment you give up, they win. In the same way you haven't noticed the ever so slight flow of air emanating from your nostrils while you read this, the same is true for the war drums beating fervently within your beating heart (the heart of a human being!). You don't have to be a slave. You can do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listening to intuition is a skill. Takes time to develop. At first mine just said go to therapy (I used to think I was too tough for it, fuck that, therapy is awesome). Then it said quit your job, travel! so I visited various off grid communities and met a fuck ton of people who are also woke to creating a world of peace, working there fucking asses off every day. That experince gave me a vision, and since then I've been closer than ever with my intuition and my life just keeps getting better and better. I used to fantasize about killing myself, looking at every stranger like they were a reptile, laughing at my own insanity, a destitute nihilist who bowed to the Babylonian overlords. I'm nothing like that person anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't waste time chasing bottomless rabbit holes. Don't let people tell you the TRUTH. A lot of people will run their mouth telling you every secret of the universe they know, but it won't be worth shit if you don't experience it for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, don't waste your time. Your intuition is speaking to you right now, in this very moment. You know what it is you need to get done, even if its something suoer small. Open those doors, find out what waits for you further in time.

       Just chill, don't let this realization ruin you. You have options. Opt out of the system as much as you can, don't drink the Kool-Aid, don't
       <em>
        preach
       </em>
       because nobody will listen, and
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       the system to your advantage whenever you can.  Live somewhere cheap, preferably way below what you can actually afford. Check out
       <a href="/r/Frugal">

       and mrmoneymustache.com . "Moving to the country" only works if you adopt a "country" lifestyle and it might not be necessary.  There are all kinds of subreddits that will help you do that. What state do you live in, what do you do for a living?  I'm moving to "the country" in a few months, buying a mobile home ("Trailer") on a lot of land to live on while I pay for my daughter to go to school,and then saving money to build a suburban "farmstead" when she is done.

       Yes, it's possible to escape the matrix. Go to r/basicincome and ask over there.

      <p>
       We need a systemic change to cope with all the issues you mention, and I only know of one example that isn't completely ridiculous and it's UBI. But if we don't push for it with a grassroots movement, it's never gonna happen.

       You can go off grid if you want to.  A lot of people have.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a price for that.  The price is all the benefits you get from living in a modern technological society.  The mysterious 'powers that be' have been doing everything possible to make this an unpleasant option starting with creating many generations of really stupid people who have no idea how to get food, clothing, shelter, or entertain themselves outside of purchasing those things from those who produce them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find yourself being one of these people you have a lot of retraining and reconditioning of yourself to do.  I'm in the same boat.  I couldn't start a fire, make a reasonable shelter, hunt, fish, or cultivate a crop.  So I'm locked into getting what I need from a modern, western, technological society.  there are rules I have to follow to remain able to do this.  there are people making the rules that I find pretty morally repulsive but you know what?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a whole lot of other options.  so I do my thing and try to make the best of it.  If you choose to go the tough route and get out I wish you every success.  If not, then make your choice and don't worry about shit you can't do anything about.  you can be woke without being angry and depressed all the time.

       Civil disobedience. Remember you are doing it
       <em>
        for you
       </em>
       , because
       <em>
        it is the right thing to do
       </em>
       , and because you choose to
       <em>
        live in conscience
       </em>
       . Resistance should not be for a “greater good” or “to change the world”. If a critical mass of people choose to live in conscience, then the external reality would change, and that’s to be welcomed. But
       <em>
        morality
       </em>
       should be the individual’s driver, not
       <em>
        utility
       </em>
       .

       Yes, just repent and believe and you will get pulled out of here and everyone who is "woke" will say it was aliens, project blue beam, a new age event, or secret energy weapon annihilation:

       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       This gets you out of here:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Th 4:13  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Th 4:14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Th 4:15  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Th 4:16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Th 4:17  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

       Heed the advice of those who ask for calm. The darkness, including the willing servants that manage us, are advantaged by fear, division, and despair. They are harmed by love, unity around common, wholistic self-interests, and the truth. This is true, because they are a disease causing organism feeding on humanity. Their self-interests are opposed by our individual and collective health thusly.
