       If you sub to
       <a href="/r/CityPorn">
        /r/CityPorn
       </a>
       , you've probably noticed a lot more Chinese, Russian, and North Korean (the only North Korean) cities being featured. So much so, that a lot of people have actually been commenting about it (see
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/comments/8km6zj/morning_moscow_3024x4032/dz92tx8/">
        here
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/comments/8iv8fo/pyongyang_north_korea_at_dawn_3462_x_1956/dyv7p1y/">
        here
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/comments/8iv8fo/pyongyang_north_korea_at_dawn_3462_x_1956/dyv38ha/">
        here
       </a>
       ). It's gotten to the point where people are actually complementing Pyongyang. (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/comments/8iv8fo/pyongyang_north_korea_at_dawn_3462_x_1956/dyv2o1c/">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As is clear with
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , it's pretty well known that casting influence to Western individuals is pretty easy. Couple that with the knowledge that China is looking to expand its soft power and perception abroad. This is also why you may see a lot of 'cool tech' videos on your Facebook. (
       <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-big-bet-soft-power">
        source
       </a>
       , second paragraph)
      </p>
      <p>
       China wants it's image abroad to be positive so that they can be respected in the international community while keeping their hardline authoritarian policies like harvesting human organs from political prisoners to give to the elite. (
       <a href="http://theconversation.com/china-says-it-has-stopped-harvesting-organs-but-evidence-belies-its-claim-72841">
        source
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I called out the patten on a post (
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CityPorn/comments/8kqwnf/chongqing_china_the_vertical_city_1068x1600/dzaljwu/">
        here
       </a>
       ) which I figured would get downvoted to hell. But what is this? I noticed that I also received a fresh ban (
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/atI1jp8.jpg">
        here
       </a>
       )! Why would someone get banned for saying something that could be played off as a nutty conspiracy? What's also interesting is that there is no message about why I was banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's interesting to look at. There are large powers manipulating a lot of Reddit and it has already been demonstrated to be easily gamed through fake accounts and fake upvotes (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxNvUWN3vYk">
        here
       </a>
       ). Anyways, stay woke fam?

       That is obviously not the place to discuss that, that is why you got banned. It's inappropriate to be honest, you should just posted about it in the conspiracy subreddit.

       It's inappropriate to have that opinion and point it out?
      </p>
      <p>
       See, that is the difference in today's world, a small microcosm.  It's like being able to having a say in this democracy and being denied it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, you either play ball and abide by the increasing amount of "rules" as here, corporate rules or you shut up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative being, you just simply ignore comments like the OP has made, let his comment just melt away or you get all Orwellian and rally your followers to boo and chastise OP for having his opinion, which does real damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, in one way society functions by letting everyone have that say, "right" or "wrong" and the other you create factions of people who are not really free at all to be people and have opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever happened to the saying "I disagree with you, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you take that away from people, you actually make it easier for someone else to take it away from you.  Consider your message, does inappropriate mean he shouldn't be allowed to comment because it might hurt feelings?  Even that's shouldn't be the reason to have rules against it.  Creating more safe spaces and such?  It's one of the big reasons we are all going through these issues today.
      </p>

       See, there was someone below you who thought this was interesting.

       Subreddits are fiefdoms and if they have rules you follow them or you find another sub or you make your own.  This isn't some travesty happening all over the world, it's about respecting the forum rules or make your own sub.

       Oh I understand everyone wants to follow the rules......I understand they make people feel comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem arises is when they translate into the real world and are taken advantage of by real minorities who use their special status to shut up certain groups.  IE. SJW's and their intolerance of any other view point.  They apply here and now more than ever, in the "real world".
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your idea that fictional subs and their arbitrary rules must be "respected" is again the same notion that safe spaces need to be created in order to shelter certain delicate peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rules you see here on reddit, the corporation that can impose its framework on all of its users is the same as the corporate idea out in the real world.  It does translate to the world you exist in right now.  Corporate rules in the world where you work surround and guide you, and even here in this small microcosm it can be used to keep you in a tiny little "respectable" box where you don't step out of line, or you aren't allowed to participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What in this world is "respectable" about imposing a corporate rule over all users/people when restriction is nothing to be respected in the first place?  Why does the notion of restriction scare certain groups or in this case.....sub reddits?  You see how r/politics used its harsh restriction of rules to keep people speaking only in a small spectrum of chatter.  The same goes for all the big subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think this is a small thing, it is not.  This translates, this IS the microcosm.  The corporate world is bearing down on the user base/population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, allowing everything to be a soapbox where people can be ignored right off that soapbox removes all need for people to clamor onto a soapbox in the first place.  As soon as you restrict, people start fighting back and rightly so.

       Just looked and only 1 of the top 20 was a city in China, unless you count Hong Kong as well, in which case would make 2/20 for China. No Russian cities. I didn’t count passed 20, but not a good first impression for this post.

       I won't say that what you're stating here couldn't be possible, it's totally feasible but what's really interesting here is how you motivate your suspicions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        they want a positive image abroad
       </em>
       thing is apparently a bad thing from your perspective, but who doesn't ? Also, I don't see why there couldn't be beautiful cities in those countries so the posts aren't out of place at all. Finally, even if there was too much Russian/China/Korean cities it could be a fashion-like epiphenomena and would need further investigations on a longer timespan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I wanted to point out is how your suspicions are actually coming from your culture.
I'm 100% sure you're from the US, just because of the way you're looking at the world around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, I'm an European guy, and from this side of the ocean we're more and more considering that the US like to spit on other countries to keep shining in comparaison.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got no real personnal opinion though, so don't take this as a personnal judgement. I basically think no one can look at those kind of things objectively and that the real truth has a big chance of being in between.

       It's a text post so it doesn't need one. The SS make it so that people don't throw random links to news articles, etc. on here without explaining why it's conspiracy related. In a text post you motivate your post in the text you write.

       They didn't say, "Wow, North Korea is such a wonderful place to live!". There's a difference. The Great pyramids are beautiful and deserve to be admired, but they were probably built by laborers that, while compensated, were probably forced to work, and under hellish conditions in which many died.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a point that China and Russia are shit countries that I would never want to live in, but that has nothing to do with the cities, how beautiful they are/worthy of admiration, and that doesn't say much about the people living in those cities except that they are oppressed and brainwashed by their country, just more than we are in ours. Think of it as a looking glass into the future of America. China's present is America 20 years from now.

       Might be that China and Russia have spent the last 50 years spending money on infrastructure, and they now have some pretty impressive cities as a result.  In the same time period America has wasted its money on wars and corruption, and America is crumbling.

       i guess russia and china play the good cop role in the pr war for the global acceptance of the nwo (america is the bad cop).  commies must be promoted, to help the massess buy into the idea of 'their version of the nwo', seeing their beautiful cities.  it is also an obvious campaign displaying the merits of collectivism, because western individualism and capitalism are meant to be eradicated in the nwo.
