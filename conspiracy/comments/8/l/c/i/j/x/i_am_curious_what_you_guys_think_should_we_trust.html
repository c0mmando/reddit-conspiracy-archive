    <div class="md"><p>Governors and Senators are much less likely to be assassinated than a president. I&#39;d argue there are plenty of decent governors and congresspeople, and even a few excellent ones. In theory, we could have a good president, and Bernie Sanders or Tulsi Gabbard are really good options. But the military-intelligence crowd would at least be considering killing any president that goes against the interests of the industrialists or threatens UFO disclosure, anything like that. Carter was a partial exception, but in the end he didn&#39;t do anything radical, only threatened it. (Cops there are close to a million of. I have friends who are cops.)</p>

but I still think he may be a zionist corporate shill since nothing really has improved. Maybe the deep state is that powerful or Trump was a shill all along. The 3D chess theory is interesting but I don&#39;t really buy it.

    <div class="md"><p>Take it for what it is worth, I have an immense distaste and never trust people who were born into wealth. This is definitely my conspiracy theorist side (hey, its the subreddit for that), but they have always seemed to be the people who are most egotistical and egocentric. The people who go from being poor to wealthy are a mixed bunch, you never know if they are quite as sociopathic, but sometimes they are. In growing up in the midwest, my parents spent a lot of money to get me into private schools. The kids whose parents could send them to those schools without a second thought about price were the worst kind of people, and have continued to be awful humans as they get older.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I don&#39;t trust anything from Donald Trump. In everything you ever see him do in the White House, ask yourself: how does this help Donald Trump. Because I don&#39;t for one minute believe that he is doing things for poor miners in WV, or auto workers in Ohio. In my opinion, he removes regulations on major corporations so that the CEOs of those companies will like him and invite him to things so he can feel important. I believe he probably took assistance and money from the middle east and Russia so he could make more money and possibly become president. And I believe he has continued to help certain countries and businesses to enrich himself, and attempt to make himself more connections. </p>

<p>TL:DR: People who have never known anything but wealth always want more, and will stop at nothing to keep being wealthy. Donald Trump seems to act like every random trust fund baby I have known growing up, so expect that he will act entirely in his own favor</p>

Sanders was essentially neutered and his followers disenfranchised from their votes. It’s nothing but the selling of US policy to highest bidder from special interests, both parties. No, can’t trust either of them. Need a new system or at least, party. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you are coming from. </p>

<p>Take everyone (including me) with a grain of salt. Especially on this sub today. A few data points to consider. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>90%+ of the media is vehemently against every single thing he does or tries to do (OMG now we love MS-13). </p></li>
<li><p>Since the 70&#39;s TPTB have been pushing a carbon tax. Paris was the next big step in that. He killed it.  </p></li>
<li><p>For the entire last 8 years they pushed TPP which was horrendous on so many levels (OMG now we love TPP). He killed it day one. </p></li>
<li><p>Taxes are down, jobs are up (wages are rising) and in response we have seen interest rates go up 3 times in 15 months, when they stayed at zero for nearly 15 years. This is an active move to blame trillions in economic mismanagement (debt... QE) on the next guy. I personally think there is an active move to crash the economy.  </p></li>
<li><p>Turn on NBC, CNN, or Comedy Central any night of the week. The owned mouthpieces have very clear marching orders. </p></li>
<li><p>A &#39;special council&#39; has subverted the will of the electorate. The appointed prosecutor was instrumental in the 911 cover up and knee deep in a number of other scandals that many people never want to see the light of Day.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Trust no one completely. He is an obvious narcissist and literally tweets about what&#39;s on Fox and Friends.  But judge situations for yourself. Not off what mob mentality tell you it&#39;s OK to think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We shouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve long said that if he wasn&#39;t a billionaire when he entered the White House then he will definitely be one when he leaves it.</p>

<p>That man was the least pro-establishment candidate from a major party...at least from what he said. This appealed to millions of Americans who are getting fucked by the status quo.  He got elected because he wasn&#39;t more of the same. It turns out that the GOP is just using him as a lightning rod to perpetuate the policies that reinforce the status quo. And he seems to be a willing accomplice in their efforts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on man. He came from a reality show, has always been a piece of shit in business and has been caught up in so much dirt, already, that how could you trust him? I could care less about his tax returns but the fact that he said he would and then didn&#39;t is exactly who he is. My guess on it is that he didn&#39;t want the world to know he wasn&#39;t a billionaire, because that was a lie as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t trust him. I really hoped him to be while he was running early in the election because I despise Clinton so much. I liked his rhetoric regarding certain topics. I would have voted for Bernie of Jill if I was an American. Then I realized how he manipulated the anger of the middle-class. He is a bigot, racist, sexist etc. His promise on draining the swamp is laughable. Look at his cabinet and you should have your answer. </p>

<p>On a sidenote, most comments in this thread are negative about Trump but in other threads some users are suggesting r/conspiracy has become T_D2. And we all love our new emperor. Where are those Trump fanboys now?</p>

<p>Trump specifically though was a deeply shady bastard way before even running for president.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t trust him in particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acknowledging the fact that Trump is the person who brought the phenomenon of &#39;fake news&#39; to the front, I also would like to proclaim that if there was an election today, there is no other person that I would vote for other than Donald Trump.  Being one of the silent majority, I can assure you there are many more like me. Even though you said not to &quot;deflect by saying Hillary is bad.&quot; The truth is, she would have been worse than Trump. That is what I continue to believe. So his lies are forgivable for that reason alone. Furthermore, he is doing right by me for the issues important to me such as stability and safety abroad and ending the Korean war, tough on immigration, and getting rid of (also known as the opposition against) the disastrous nonsense of Obamacare. Even if the result are not favorable at this point, he hates Obamacare and that is good enough, screw the Democrats for supporting it.</p>
