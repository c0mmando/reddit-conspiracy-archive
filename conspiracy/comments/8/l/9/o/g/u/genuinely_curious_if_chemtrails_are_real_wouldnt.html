       Excellent question.

      <p>
       The most fair and balanced discussion about this topic I have ever heard can be found

       My own opinion is that chemtrail belief is often a form of apophenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, there may well be something going on up there...

       yep.

      <p>
       you would think that someone would have flown up into one of the contrails by now and taken samples for analysis.

      <p>
       But, nope. No one has done it yet.

       Though, now that Ive mentioned it, I wouldnt be surprised if someone created another fakeass astroturf group named something like 911contrailscientists fortruth.com.

       I feel like this is relevant, the Illuminati are just following the game plan laid out in the bible.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        12 I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.
       </p>
       <p>
        13 And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.
[stars do not fall on earth because of earthquake]
       </p>
       <p>
        14 Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up [the influence of Greek mythology], and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.
       </p>
       <p>
        15 And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,

       First, chemtrails may just be real cloud seeding. The US may want some more water. No "bad" chemichals, just dirt dust.
      </p>

       Secondly, they may be spraying where they dont live. Or the people may know how to avoid it, stay inside.

       Its mainly aluminum, they are supposedly using it to deflect infrared radiation. Either way its reflecting light, and aluminum is so light it can stay up there for days, and most likely ends up like cfc's, swept to the north or south pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its most likely being used to combat global warming (as pretty much every geo engineering article is based on this fact).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I have to wonder if they arent hiding something that can only be seen at certain times, maybe by pumping it full of metals they are polarizing the light or something. (just a personal explanation ive been working on)
      </p>
      <p>
       But chemtrails are real, just take some time out of your day to look at contrails, if they break apart and form a haze (like dye in water) they are most likely metal particulates, if it just dissapears (like all contrails have since the 70's) after a few minutes, or a few hours, then it is really just condensation.

       I dont doubt their real. Rather, where did the idea come from, the validity of the concept, and what it could be. When you have a good concept, and good framework, it seems to bolster the truth.

       I know all about operation sea spray, they knew it wouldnt kill/hurt everyone, just the weak ones, or the ones with a genetic disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Ill bet you dollars to donuts that there were no high ranking officials or their familys in the area during testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure there are a very few percentage of people who are prone to be hurt by things, including this, but I dont think the idea behind it is to hurt people, its more than likely if this is happening, the people who are doing it most likely they are doing it for the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the other question i hear, theres no way that many people could be on it. But the truth is, at those altitudes it would only take a few dozen squads across america doing it for "national defense", to get it done, and im pretty sure they already got automated blimps like the harvard study was talking about using, like the object the Chilean Navy declassified and releases of a object encountered in 2014. Shouldnt be that hard to find, you cant tell me that object isnt a drone spraying chemtrails. 
But the elite wouldn't purposely hurt or kill their-selves or their family, unless it could further "the" agenda. Now taking out the weak and sick, is another story.

       Heavy metal toxicity (e.g., aluminum)  is known to cause nueurodegereative effects leading to diseases such as alzheimers and dementia.

       Check out the incidence and mortality statistics for alzheimers and dementia here:

      <p>
       It affects all ages not just seniors and it kills. Spraying isnt the only exposure we have to heavy metal ingestion. But aerosolized particle inhalation is extremely efficient. Those that are orchestrating this are either 1) aware of this potential and don't care, 2) arent aware (unlikely), or 3) embrace the two for one.

       Poor visibility from the bottom. The sky here is either cloudy or white/bluish opaque which makes it also reflective. Think about when a light source shines on a reflective surface. It increases the appearance of the light source itself which I believe is used by solar simulators in orbit.

       I expected him to do so which is why I phrased my question the way I did.  A sample return mission would cost just a few tens of thousands of dollars if chartering a plain.  Much less if using balloons to gather the samples.

       Someone posted a thread a day or two ago asking about Fiji water, if it was any good. They claimed its the bottled water Congress drinks.

       I recall reading a story about nano darts. In essence, invisible darts used to poison people. It was about someone assassinated.  So I wondered if Chem trails dispersed something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't tell ya if theyre real or what or if Chem trails are real or what it is. I imagine if they are spraying something bad, they would have something they take to offset what is sprayed... who knows.

       I don't believe there are any massive global spraying operations designed to poison the public. As OP points out, it would affect everyone. However, the above link shows that it would be feasible to spray selected areas with a chemical that has harmful effects.

       Whether or not they are currently spraying people with experimental and/or harmful chemicals is anyone's guess, but

        it is a historical fact that chemtrails were used on Americans, Canadians, and the Brits.

          A government report provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain's biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979. The 60-page report reveals new information about more than 100 covert experiments. Between 1955 and 1963 planes flew from north-east England to the tip of Cornwall along the south and west coasts, dropping huge amounts of zinc cadmium sulphide on the population. The report also reveals details of the DICE trials in south Dorset between 1971 and 1975. These involved US and UK military scientists spraying into the air massive quantities of serratia marcescens bacteria, with an anthrax simulant and phenol. Between 1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii , which mimics anthrax.

The tests released zinc cadmium sulfide along a 100-to-150-nautical-mile line approximately 5 to 10 nautical miles off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Two of the trials dispersed clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide over large areas of all three U.S. states. The tests affected over 60,000 square miles of populated coastal region in the U.S. southeast. Dew II involved the release of fluorescent particles (zinc cadmium sulfide) and plant spores (Lycopodium) from an aircraft.

Big Itch proved successful, the tests showed that not only could the fleas survive the drop from an airplane but they also soon attached themselves to hosts.

       Whoever is behind it likely has an antidote to whatever is being sprayed, if it is in fact poisonous. They also probably don't spray over wherever they get their food and water. At the moment I believe it's mostly done to make a haze cover the Sun and Moon (for unknown reasons).

       I've seen the cloud machines in action in video and they make huge cumulonimbus clouds. Add in HAARP, and you get weather. I don't think they criss-cross the sky almost every day everywhere for the weather. I've sat out and watched the chemtrailers quickly turn a beautiful blue sky day to an even haze. Not rain clouds, just a nasty gray haze covering the sky and Sun. Watch Sun time lapses and even Moon, you'll see they do this right before the Sun or moon rises, and right before each sets, and sometimes all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either they are poisoning us (they have easier ways to do that), or covering the Sun because of its brightness or something else, imo. Obviously I could be wrong as any of us because no one knows what they are doing.

       Aerosol spraying doesn't mean 'they' plan on wiping humanity out.  I believe there are several different applications (reasons) for spraying among several different sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe it's devious in nature although practically everything man does turns out harmful if not deadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are secret experiments and/or certain companies (military included) that have specific reasons but there's no spokesperson broadcasting it on the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chaff is widely known so we DO have SOME acknowledgment that the military dumps aluminum-coated glass fibers into the atmosphere. And 'we' (minion) also 'know' weather modification is also used. So not sure why there's still argument whether or not this exists. I think the 'kill the population' is a purposefully placed argument by think tanks (like Tavistock) to derail, discredit and deter the general public.

       Imo, they spray the aluminum into the air, it stays there.. then, now bear with me.. they use the same technology used in oil drilling to look for the oil, they send a microwave into the ground to bring back a picture to get a better idea of where to drill.  Now, imagine using that technology to send 1 million microwaves into the atmosphere full of aluminum.  My guess, if any of what I've said is accurate, it would be for weather control.

       What if spraying aluminum chaff is the only thing keeping the alien invasion at bay? And so these unsung heroes secretly blanket the atmosphere day in and day out as humanity's last hope to avoid being annexed to the Annunaki interstellar slave-driven gold mining empire. Maybe their ships are powered by particulate gold and particulate aluminum is a cheap and easy way of defeating their engines.

       Well I'm on board with "chemtrails" having previously been involved in science and military testing and combat, but just not down with a theory that pilots and ground crews of passenger flights are in on a constant spray program. There's quite a difference, and the separation is lacking, to the detriment of the conspiracy field.

       I've heard people say they can take things that counteract the effects ,like taking iodine for radiation poisoning.

       That sounds like pure speculation though.

       This question is going to go down as the light bulb moment for thousands of theorists who are going to insist there is a superior alien race who is in control of chem-trails and is also immune to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will spawn another set of people who question why these superior aliens use inferior methods of delivery, such as our conventional airplanes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This in turn will get some of those initial theorists to come to their senses, while it will push even more further down the rabbit hole to realizations yet unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dissonance caused by the idea superior beings using inferior technology/methods will then spread to realizations of other improbabilities that plague theories such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) Shape-shifting reptilians as political leaders (They shape-shift, but have to run for office like every other political player? Seems like a waste of time!)
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Alien cattle mutilation (They have the tech to fly, abduct, and surgically eviscerate animals, but can't dispose of the carcass?)
      </p>
      <p>
       c) etc etc.

       As one of We the People, I'm asking for full disclosure and web tracking of planned chemtrailing. In the simplest terms, assuming it's weather control, we have a right to know, it's our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because it's blatantly unfair that the traders at the CBOT CME group gets the schedule and makes money in futures trading based on the
       <em>
        results of the spraying.
       </em>
       Either go short, or long, armed with the schedule and purpose, you can take long bets on crops, even short insurance contracts, when another spate of tornados hit Arkansas, or flooding in Texas. These pricks could simultaneously game the federal disaster grants. It's secret, most likely, because rich entitled criminals make it secret.

      <p>
       Geoengineering, bioengineering, world building, terra forming. All these dont just happen because we magically know what works. We need to learn, adapt, do science, and develop the industry to sustain that development. Earth will run out of space, population control isnt viable with smarter human. So space travel and consequently terraforimg planets in the habitabale zone, like mars and moons on jupiter are a viable alternative.

       Chemtrails are real, I have seen them with my own eyes, in austria, in american documentaries regarding cloud seeding (it was a doco in mid 90s discussing el3ctricity and lighting. They induced a cloud by releasing chemicals in the atmosphere from a small plane and formed a strom cloud). There is a rise in atmosphere of silver particles designed to shield earth (parts of it) from sun. There is evidence of cloud seeding to induce rain wnd thats illigal but still happens(because rain induced on one region removes it from another, causing drought).
      </p>
      <p>
       All these things they all contribute to chemtrails. I saw 3 planes flyong low in formation over the ski slopes in austria couple of years ago, behind them were trails, the next day it was snowing. Where as the whole week i was there no snow to the point where so parts of the slopes had patches of grass and hard as fuck snow. These werent high altetude vapur trailes, I used to see them as a child, where the vapour trail only extended so far behind the plane. These were big sprays dissipating into atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the industry to manipulate weather, to control.weather isn
 def there. Remember food only really grows in the warm times of the year, so inducong global warming is benificial to us, as we can grow more food to feed our almost 8billion people. Smaller winters are generally more sought after and everyone like warmer climates more. So industrialisation and chemical westher manipulation has been known, well known in the 1900s. In the last 30 years, there must have been huge efforts from big gov all around the earth to learn all they can. After all, technology and science is still the driving force of world leadership. 3big boys, russia china and US, all have advanced space programs, so there is no doubt they have in their books plans for colonisation, atmosphere control, just general life off planet sort of theretical and practical plans, papers, research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemtrails, are only thought to not exist, because their use is in direct conflict with internstional law, and general ideas of mans power over nature and other people(as mentioned earlier it does and can and has been known to mess with weather of other regions).

       Nothing is ever explained with a singular purpose or cause, either - the elite, whether collaborating or not, aren't going to do something this risky without at least a few payoffs each in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, problem/reaction/solution - how do you get the public to accept geoengineering as a solution? Engineer the appropriate reaction (begging for chemtrails) by implementing the solution ahead of time and claiming it's not actually happening.

       Remember the 3 consecutive hurricanes on US? never in history did that happen. And there they were, one after another hitting same area. Distruction fuels economy(that sacred GPD), as rebuilding requires jobs, manufacturing, production. So there is always more than one reason to do whats considered a sinister action, but that always comes with more benefits than the surface reasoning.

       My speculations on chemtrails is that it's:
1) testing of weather control;
2) testing of some radar cloaking technology i.e. make cities, etc. "invisible" from satellites, radar, etc. 
3) testing of some sort of HAARP beam technology where you create partitions at various levels of the atmosphere to bounce energy to chosen targets;
4) Or literally providing air cover for flybys of advanced technology. 
4) and lastly

       I think it's paired with HAARP and other ELF stations to allow dispersement of the "clouds" into more beneficial patterns for whatever purpose - check Patrick Roddie's youtube channel, he shows plenty of wave-like patterns in satellite pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cloudbusters are commonplace enough that you can find videos of them working (dispersing or creating clouds), but that's just a single beam of negative ions. When there's metal in the clouds and you can shape the beam and oscillate it and create interference patterns with multiple transmitters, that's when shit can get creative.

       I know all about operation sea spray, they knew it wouldnt kill/hurt everyone, just the weak ones, or the ones with a genetic disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Ill bet you dollars to donuts that there were no high ranking officials or their familys in the area during testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure there are a very few percentage of people who are prone to be hurt by things, including this, but I dont think the idea behind it is to hurt people, its more than likely if this is happening, the people who are doing it most likely they are doing it for the greater good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats the other question i hear, theres no way that many people could be on it. But the truth is, at those altitudes it would only take a few dozen squads across america doing it for "national defense", to get it done, and im pretty sure they already got automated blimps like the harvard study was talking about using, like the object the Chilean Navy declassified and releases of a object encountered in 2014. Shouldnt be that hard to find, you cant tell me that object isnt a drone spraying chemtrails. 
But the elite wouldn't purposely hurt or kill their-selves or their family, unless it could further "the" agenda. Now taking out the weak and sick, is another story.

       Wow, that's crazy, the people that did that not only got the state to adopt a less-harmful alternative, but also got away with it...well, hats off to The Breeders, I guess.

       Comments like this are a good indicator of someone who thinks they're a skeptic but won't challenge their own preprogrammed beliefs.
