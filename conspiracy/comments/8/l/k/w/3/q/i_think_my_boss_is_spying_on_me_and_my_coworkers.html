       So starting a week ago my phone has been slow at work. I thought it was just my service being bad but it only happens at work. Yesterday I sent two messages to my SO complaining about my job. First was a complaint about how the temperature is cold because my boss is overweight.
      </p>
      <p>
       He later walks by me and makes a comment "feel the air yet?".
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought that was weird but brushed it off. Maybe he heard me complain to another colleague about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I sent my SO another message saying I wish someone would shoot me and put me out of my misery. That was private, never discussed with anyone except my SO through that text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well this morning my boss made a comment seemingly out of nowhere saying "did you bring your gun?" I said no and walked away but he's obviously telling me he's reading my messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, this is my personal phone. I don't have a company phone. Secondly, I never use the Wi-Fi in the office. Is he really spying on me? I tried looking it up online and it seems that this isn't technically illegal but not legal either.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should I do? What can I do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies in advance if this isn't the right place for this post but I knew if I posted this in ask reddit most people would be like "That's impossible!". Thank you in advance.

       First of all, your boss is spying on you. Period. That's a huge part of what they do, for various reasons. Second, he's probably not tapping your phones, as that is a serious charge. He is most likely equipping the place with sophisticated cameras and microphones. We have cameras at my work that can listen a long distance and zoom in to read a cellphone screen.

       Exactly what I was gonna say. Tell your SO you're going to do some experiments and start making shit up.

       Hopefully OP doesn't go for this advice. Incredible easy to set up a few gaslighting pranks to really mess with this asshole, also really easy to end up with police arresting OP or boss suing him because he can.

       Ha! Just pointing out obvious facts. OP could joke about blackmail and coming next day prepared to get rid of the Boss and that would be quite a laugh at his expense, until Boss fires and sues him for harassment or has law enforcement wait for him next day and ends up getting shot over some

       Let's be clear. If the boss is tapping his phones, the boss will never win a lawsuit. Also, the boss will never admit to it, even if caught. He'd be crazy to do so.

       This is the best advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're a powerless peon VS the unleashed apparatus of inscrutable technical total surveillance, what can you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Diddly squat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is one thing you and any victim of gang stalking can always do to strike back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jam the gears of surveillance with bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wanna watch? Fine. Put on a good show. Give them what they think they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why every morning I have long and detailed text message conversations with my ISIS cell handler. Then I text my Mexican Cartel handler about the new shippments of coke and the names of snitches to whack. Finally I text my pedo cell to coordinate the shipping and caging of lil' Pizzas in preparation of next weeks orgy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course none of it is true. But if I can force TPTB to waste a million dollars in man hours per year paying a closer look on me, only to chase their tails in the end, I have done the best I can to Bleed The Beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a pretty big unexpected consequence of watching everyone: 99% of your efforts will be wasted on false positives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If none of that works for you, you can always murder yoyr boss and hide hus body in the nearest swamp bog.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck!

       This honestly seems like the likelier situation. What is he going to gain by knowing I called him a fat Fuck? On my personal device to my SO no less. I think he just wanted to stroke his ego and throw his power around. I mean, why hint at the person whom your spying on that your spying on them?

       Micromanaging bosses see this as reinvesting profits/capital in order to maximize productivity. In the mind of the boss, they are just doing what's best for the company and the people that are hurt or offended are non-issues.

       That was just speculation. Just cause a phone slows down, doesn't mean it's hacked. Many possibilities.  Truth is though, companies spy on their employees. A lof of bosses have money to spend. Some have private eyes on retainer. I mean, they have thousands to millions of dollars at stake.

       I'm an android user. The jammer is a possibility as he's been threatening on installing one for years but if it is a jammer then it doesn't work well. We still get signal, people still text and make calls on site.

       It's been interesting to see all the different theories. I hadn't thought of a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideas so far in order of likelihood IMO…
- high def cameras
- message app passwords phished / hacked -- or password same as company account password
- stingray-like device intercepting messages

       I guess the SO talking to the boss is another possibility, but seems unlikely. Any other possibilities?

       It's illegal to monitor other people's phones. The boss would be going to jail a long time. I just can't imagine with what else he could do that he would go there, unless he really is super creep

       Definitely spying on you.

      <p>
       I would begin preparing for employment elsewhere, I would also be straightforward and ask about it. Mention that you've sent some messages related to the content of your conversation and would like to know if your phone has been compromised. If he says no or says he isn't spying on you, he's full of shit. You don't randomly ask somebody if they brought their gun.

       You're being spied on through your phone, or your SO talks to your boss.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same exact thing happened to me. Someone put spyware on my phone and was tracking my location, making hidden calls to eavesdrop, reading my text, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what you need to do OP. FORMAT your phone. Wipe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory, this should remove the spyware. After you do this, DO NOT ACCEPT ATTACHMENTS THROUGH TEXT MESSAGES. For example if your SO sends you a sexy pic, don't open it. On most phones it has it so that it automatically downloads attachments on text messages, turn this off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most service providers let other people track you, for example, AT&amp;T's Device Help, and some feature that lets you be part of the family tracking feature. Disable these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buy a cheap phone if you can afford it, and use it for clandestine communication with people you trust. You can buy a cheap throwaway phone at MetroPCS, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your SO talking to your boss? Tell her something about work IN PERSON, away from your phone, and see if he hints at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do suspect your phone has spyware, file a police report.

       Right but I’m saying it’s not out of the question that what he’s experiencing is not necessarily illegal and especially not if he has company phone. You kind of disregarded the entire reply so that you could have some kind of retort but it means absolutely nothing.

       Did you read mine? It doesn’t matter. When we put our companies email on personal devices we can still monitor all their stuff. It’s not like corporations have their own phones that you use. When you put corporate applications on your mobile device you sign away your privacy in favor of protecting company data

       If you’ve not got any company software or use it to get to company data or anything then there’s no way for him to track your phone. Could be coincidental or your wife is sharing your conversations. Most security cams don’t have a strong enough picture to read your texts over your shoulder and unless he somehow made a sim duplicate I don’t see how it’d be possible

       Ok so if his boss has no way of knowing his sim number which delivers his messages  due to him not having mobile management and doesn’t have a clone of his sim to duplicate sms over network and he doesn’t have any company stuff to monitor his device and he isn’t accessing company portals with his device, how do you gather his nobody boss is tracking him?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not discrediting since we don’t have all the info but it would be fairly impossible for someone to just “hack” his messages without having access to his messaging account, without an MDM, and without an illegal sim duplicate
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also very unlikely that his boss created some random app that he downloaded and now gives him access to info on his phone

       That I’m unsure of. But regardless if his phone is being monitored he either installed something that gave that access or used it to access something his manager controls in some way.

       I was busy working as to not add more fuel to the fire. Nothing installed, nothing new on my phone. It's password protected and almost never left unattended. Plus my boss is a 60 something iPhone user with little knowledge on tech. He can't even change the signature in his email, he has me do it. If he is spying I think it has to be something easy to use. Or my manager helped him install cameras and a Mic since my manager is slightly more tech savvy.

       I can think of a dozen ways for you to mess with his head but they would likely end up with you getting fired, shot, arrested or even SWATed. So, just go for the high road. Start looking for a new job, and if you're so inclined, have the resources and time, gather info on the spying done to you and coworkers and prepare a lawsuit. AFAIK it's one thing to monitor network communication passing thru the employer's systems, another to bug their personal phones and monitor them via microphones/cameras without their knowledge.

       I agree with what machinecrafter told you. If this happened to me, I would  buy a new phone and never open or receive personal messages while on the clock in the least. Plenty of employees have been fired over using fb at work.Other suggestions made to you are also good, but those are up to you...

       As a targeted individual in my harassment they've used technology often as a person or car passed me or as I passed a neighbor's door or window, they will play their voice in my head of them saying something about me and it can really sound like the person, they can also play sounds in their heads when they're near you.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also technology to force people to say things. If he says something so weird as 'did you bring your gun with you' don't just say no and ask him what he means by it and try to get to the bottom of it so you can discern better if he's being controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your job as best you can and try to not focus a lot or get emotional about the harassment, btw I been targeted for 10+ years and tortured everyday for about 2 years with remote influencing tech that causes painful sensations in my body in Iran just wanna make people aware this is happening globally, good luck.

       Turability
Th€ phenomenon is tunable in that the characteristic sounds and intansities ofthose
sounds depend on the characteristics ofthe RF energy as delivered. Because the
ftequency ofthe sound heard is dep€ndent on the pulse chamcteristics ofthe RF energy,
it seems possible that this technology could be developed to the point where words could
be hansmitted to be heard like the spoken wod, excepthat it could only bo heard within
a person's head. In one experiment, communication ofthe words from one to ten using
"speech modulated" microwave energy was successfully demonstrated. Microphones next
to the p€rson experiencing the voice could not pick up the sound. Additional develonncnt
ofthis would open up a wide range ofpossibilities.

       This would mean that the human body has a developed a way to receive and understand radio frequencies without the use of any technology whatsoever. Do you see how ridiculous that is?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Guy says that experiments have demonstrated that radiation at 40 microjoules per pulse per square centimeter produces sound at zero decibels, which is just barely in hearing range. To produce sound at 60 decibels, or the sound of normal conversation, requires 40 watts per square centimeter of radiation. ”That would kill you pretty fast,” Guy says.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So even if it was POSSIBLE, there's no way that some random dude is just walking around and they are blasting radio waves directed ONLY at him, without the use of giant equipment. He'd more or less have to be in a soundproof room to even hear what the RF signal is broadcasting towards him.

       You still need energy to "simulate the experience". This energy still follows physical laws. Unless this guy was hooked up to it directly, this energy would need to be huge and concentrated to ONLY affect him. It would be way more damaging than just hearing a voice in your head.

       From what I've read Radio frequency can stimulate bone and nerve tissue around your ear, which vibrates and creates a sound inside your ear. But that vibration is so small that it's barely audible, and wouldn't be able to accurately represent words or a conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were focusing a beam directly at someone, they have to be insanely accurate with their direction to hit the specific spot of their brain to cause this to happen. You understand that's ridiculously difficult? Especially from far enough away to not be detected by the person experiencing it. Ultrasound and MRI is pretty difficult to do even applied directly to the skin.

       Just because they won their case doesnt mean it was actually happening. Weird things happen in court all the time. But to your other points i guess i was wrong. Sorry i was a dick about it. Ill remain skeptical until i do some more research. Again, sorry i was a jerk. Guess i need to be less steadfast in my skepticism and be more open minded.

       Sms is very easy to intercept though quite illegal. There is a way to detect an imsi catcher, google imsi catcher detector. You can put him in a lot of trouble.

       Yeah, theres a Hi def camera around you and hes zooming in and reading your phone. Cover your screen with your hand and keep your phone to your chest. Then Start texting yourself things about how your boss is kinda cute and things, See if he starts hitting on you or something.

       OK so lets just assume he IS spying on OP. OP states that they are using a personal phone, not connected to the office wifi. I assume OP is either Texting or using something like Hangouts, iMessage, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without physical access to the mobile device, how could the boss possibly be spying on that communication? To intercept those messages, he would need malware on the actual device itself, or some rogue cellular base station that the phone is connecting to. So lets be real here, its likely not the latter.
      </p>

       Just trying to look at this from a technical perspective rather than whether or not a boss would spy on their employees.

       Or he could just know OP password for whatever messaging service. If OP has Verizon he could know her Verizon info which would give the boss access to vtext.com which allows you to send and receive texts from a computer using OP phone number.

       Lots of companies spy on employees. Some companies even hire a special team to investigate online shenanigans and report disdain amongst the ranks. I used to employ 40 people and I certainly found it useful to keep one or two key people on side to let me know what was going on.  And I am pretty lose when it comes to that stuff.
      </p>

       I’d just keep your opinions about your boss to evening chat when you get home. In the meantime start sending texts at how wonderful he is and see his attitude change. Just be smart about it we are cleverer than people imagine

       Some of these commenters think that he might be looking at your phone through a high def security camera. You can test this. Go into a private place in the office (bathroom stall, etc) or out in the parking lot and text.  See if he gets it.  If he doesn't, then he is likely using a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not trivial to intercept text messages, unless he is using a Stingray device or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shut off your wifi on the phone entirely and see if anything changes.  This means all of your messages are going directly to the cell tower, not through any other service or device.

       If you are using your personal phone, it is completely illegal for him to tap into it.

       First thing I would do is hard reset the phone back to factory defaults and see if his comments continue.

       Does not matter if it’s on private property. It’s still illegal to record someone’s audio without their consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I recommend you do;
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard wipe your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a serious conversation with your SO about what’s going on. Don’t accuse them of anything, but let them know you believe your private conversations with them are being compromised. If it’s really happening, you are both victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Involve a trusted third party, like maybe one of your parents, and complain about your boss to them via text.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember! Do not use the WiFi.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the behavior continues and you really feel he is watching or spying on you, switch to Signal and contact a lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last resort, email someone at the EFF.

       Not sure what phone you are using but its never taken me 5 hours to factory restore my phone. Plus...so what? If I thought someone installed spyware on my phone id probably destroy it and get a new one, under a new carrier, with a new number...under a different name. But thats me, YMMV.

       I would start sending messages about how creepy your stalker boss is and make several examples of your choosing and intensity that hes "done" and see how that fat smug mfker feels then. Then if he gives you shit you have a history of his abuses and rock his world with it. Just saying hes playing dirty time for a dose of his own medicine.

       I can think of a few possibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Phone compromised with spyware via email
2) Phone replaced by mirror spyphone
3) SO is friends with boss
4) SO is more than friends with boss
5) Boss has HD cameras at your location
6) Stingray device intercepting sms
7) You work at the NSA
7a) You are about to be recruited by the NSA by your boss
7b) You are about to be recruited by the FSB by your boss
7c) Both 7a, b happen at some point in the future in an as of yet undetermined order
8) You work at the CIA
9) Your boss can read your mind
10) You exist in a simulated reality and your boss has admin rights
11) Synchronicity
12) You don't own a phone and are hallucinating the entire event, you don't have a job and your real name is marvin.
13) Your boss being rich is part of the illuminati and simply pays for access to your phone using his secret connections
14) You are being set up as a patsy and your boss is implanting suggestions in your mind
15) The staff canteen has laced their lunchtime baguettes with LSD
16) There is a secret door in an office block somewhere which allows people to inhabit your body for a short period of time before being dumped out of the sky next to a local highway intersection and your boss knows where this door is
17) Your boss is an annunaki descendant who can shapeshift into a lizard and ALSO read your mind
18) Time is running backwards and your boss is unstuck in time
19) Your boss experiences spontaneous human invisibility
20) Your boss commands a legion of invisible servitors in the etheric plane who report back to him
22) Your boss understands the significance of 3, 6 and 9
23) Confirmation bias
24) You talk in your sleep and sleep at work
25) Your colleagues peek over your shoulder and rat on you
26) Your boss is your SO

       1 and 5 seem unlikely but the rest get more and more probable deeper in the list.  I used to be able to spontaneously become invisible from my parents by closing my eyes but appear to have lost this ability as I aged.

       Do you use Verizon's messaging app? It's super easy to sync messages across devices. It would require physical access to your device. I would also suspect your computer has a keylogger installed, as well as a remote monitoring program. A new job would be your best bet. Also, look for spy cams in the bathroom.

       My company pc having a key logger is no issue. My work computer is only used for work. The most non work related thing I use it for is to check the weather. Literally nothing else. The last guy in my position was fired for talking crap about the boss, on the company pc, though the company instant messenger to another employee. I'm not making his mistake! I've been super careful. They could look at my pc all they want, there's nothing there.

       &gt;  if I posted this in ask reddit most people would be like "That's impossible!"

       &gt;  my phone has been slow at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Define slow. Most methods of interception wouldn't make your phone slow per se. The implication is slow = virus = spying. That's probably the most implausible of the possibilities. You're not the kind of person that leaves your phone lying around are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't many places on the planet where the kind of thing you're talking about isn't massively illegal - usually reserved for security services under warrant. I'd be surprised if your boss would take that sort of risk.

       All I can say is, if anyone puts any spyware apps on your phone (even if it's for parental control with a kid) and you're 18+, it's not going to hold in court as legal. Invasion of privacy is a crime. lol
      </p>

       but totally sounds to me like a snoop app, I have seen several articles about owners/bosses using them more and more if they can find a way to get them on your phone. Aside from them just looking up your facebook and reading anything they can find on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are crazy, and they'll believe anything that's right in front of them, and there is no better way to feel like something's right in front of you than to snoop.

       I'm not sure what size company your company is or any of the details of it. This might not be relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The largest SV companies are well know to have internal intelligence/counter-intelligence divisions to squash leaks. At Apple people even end up working on fake products to prove themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you're company probably isn't that size. At the same time, if you're using company resources to say something, you should expect that the company is monitoring it. Now there are power hungry creeps who are monitoring it real time and looking for juicy gossip. This may be where you work. On the other hand, I've worked at companies where they don't really give a shit about what you're doing as long as it's not coming back to haunt the company. If it does? They have 18 months worth of complete logs of all sorts of stuff available in order to research what might be going on. If they have reason to or the logs turn up something, there is additional monitoring to be turned on. A lot of this is actually a legal requirement to fulfill certain audits necessary for certain types of business (handling third-party data, money, medical documents, etc..)
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is not is this possible, but whether it's being abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you suspect it is being abused? Start looking for another job, but don't use any company resources to do so. Don't complain yet. Start keeping daily records of things that happen. The better you can timestamp and log it, the better our case later. You really don't want to have to come to that, as though you might win, that kind of battle can't last longer than you expected and drain you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, assume company resources are being monitored. If you can tell that's being abused, use not compnay resources to find a new job.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's not company resources? Either he is hacking you (doubtful), has another source of the information you don't expect (people would be surprised at how much info they leak), or you're being paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter which one of those, get out. If it ends up repeating at the next place, it might just be you and consider that with the help of the professional. I'm not trying to say that, that's sort of the last possibility, but anything is possible.

       Send your SO some texts that will get a verbal response. Something as simple as “that fat ass still has the air turned up in here”. Something he’ll really want to respond to, and carry some kind of audio recording device to record his response. Try and get a few recordings, then you’ll have evidence against him spying.

       Hopefully OP doesn't go for this advice. Incredible easy to set up a few gaslighting pranks to really mess with this asshole, also really easy to end up with police arresting OP or boss suing him because he can.

       Right but I’m saying it’s not out of the question that what he’s experiencing is not necessarily illegal and especially not if he has company phone. You kind of disregarded the entire reply so that you could have some kind of retort but it means absolutely nothing.

       Did the new iPhone come out? There's tons of reasons s why a phone slows down. Could be interference with other equipment. Could be a jammer

       This is the best advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're a powerless peon VS the unleashed apparatus of inscrutable technical total surveillance, what can you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Diddly squat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is one thing you and any victim of gang stalking can always do to strike back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jam the gears of surveillance with bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wanna watch? Fine. Put on a good show. Give them what they think they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why every morning I have long and detailed text message conversations with my ISIS cell handler. Then I text my Mexican Cartel handler about the new shippments of coke and the names of snitches to whack. Finally I text my pedo cell to coordinate the shipping and caging of lil' Pizzas in preparation of next weeks orgy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course none of it is true. But if I can force TPTB to waste a million dollars in man hours per year paying a closer look on me, only to chase their tails in the end, I have done the best I can to Bleed The Beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a pretty big unexpected consequence of watching everyone: 99% of your efforts will be wasted on false positives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If none of that works for you, you can always murder yoyr boss and hide hus body in the nearest swamp bog.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck!

       Just because they won their case doesnt mean it was actually happening. Weird things happen in court all the time. But to your other points i guess i was wrong. Sorry i was a dick about it. Ill remain skeptical until i do some more research. Again, sorry i was a jerk. Guess i need to be less steadfast in my skepticism and be more open minded.
