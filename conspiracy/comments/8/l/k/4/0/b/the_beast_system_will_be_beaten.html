<p>Because the End Times were meant to be awesome, that&#39;s why.  Of course, people are free to not want it, or participate in it, but they would be kinda silly not to.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s why the entire universe was conceived in the first place, but whadda I know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did God save Jesus on the cross?  It doesn&#39;t work that way.  </p>

<p>Did Jesus save the world from evil?  Obviously not.  Coulda done it then too. </p>

<p>So, what is the takeaway?  For humans to progress, it took an inversion of the Tower of Babel.  The languages and knowledge were dispersed, but now there IS basically a one world language, and we are beginning to see the breakdown of the pall over reality.  </p>

<p>And it IS about learning the ins and outs of morality.  That&#39;s not to say that people don&#39;t receive divine assistance or inspiration, though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No God didn&#39;t save Jesus on the cross because he had to kill himself to take away our sins. How exactly did scrambling our languages and dividing us help us progress??? We&#39;re more divided than ever. It&#39;s like God didn&#39;t want humanity to progress. What exactly is the one world language? And how exactly is a one world language a bad thing? Wouldn&#39;t a one world language help us be closer together?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t God come back now? Why does he have to wait. There is NO reason why he can&#39;t come back right now and save us from this hell. Save us from this rape, disease, torture, slavery, etc. SAVE US GOD. PLEASE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What did Jesus &quot;do all day&quot;?  What if God already returned in human form? </p>

<p>Did Jesus go around saving kids from the brutally short lifespans back then?</p>

<p>What if there is something about HUMANITY and what humans ARE that you are missing?  </p>

<p>And stop with the emotional pleas.  Part of your misunderstanding goes with your misunderstanding of death.</p>

<p>With the one world language thing...yes, it&#39;s a great thing.  But not originally when it was used to enslave people.  We get to witness the end of the inversion of that.  It&#39;s not pretty, but it will be that much better when all is done.  </p>

<p>And we are not divided.  There&#39;s just a loud minority that want people to think that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both instances take place in heaven. The ch7 reference takes place before the throne of God and is about those martyred for the having been saved by learning the word from the 144000. The ch15 is also before the throne of God and refers to those martyred for refusing the mark of the beast. Look at 20:4 where John see the souls of the beheaded and those the refused the mark of the beast. I respect your interpretation and your right to it, but I will maintain my belief in a rapture because ultimately it won&#39;t matter. It either happens or I lose my head or I live through it and all would be ok with me.</p>

<p>Aside from the above, there are so many stories that are unproven. There is zero geological evidence for a worldwide flood during Noah&#39;s time. And Noah built his boat when he was around 500 hundred years old and lived to be 950. Obviously this is insane to actually believe. Science can easily prove any of those claims if there was actually evidence for it, but there isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taken out of context the verses appear to contradict, but they actually don&#39;t. For instance, &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot; is the law as to how to treat your people, and not applicable to war.</p>

<p>From the perspective of an ancient Israelite, the flood consumed the whole world as they knew it. Again, context. </p>

<p>You&#39;re putting an awful lot of faith in science, which proves itself wrong regularly. I&#39;d call that much more insane than believing in God. How would an ancient Israelite have known the Pleiades was bound together? That Earth was round?</p>

<p>These articles are written by atheists who take things at face value, in a derogatory prose, never having taken the time to research what the verses we&#39;re actually saying. Much is lost in translation from Hebrew to English. Hebrew words often have multiple meanings depending on the context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, you think scientific authority trumps God’s authority?  Science is God’s servant.  Man understands minuscule amounts of it and regularly must redefine what it thought was right. I respect science and what we have discovered. but our knowledge does not compete with God. He invented science. </p>

<p>You are wrong about the Bible being contradictions and hits/misses.  It is a difficult, sometimes cryptic, misunderstood, or pieces of evidence may not be in your hands but those things don’t negate it’s truth, authority, and power.  When you/we see Him all these things will be obvious. </p>

<p>Official government statements from several leaders like Bush, Jr/Sr, Obama, and others speak freely of bring US (and world) into a new world order for decades now (for our ‘good’). </p>

<p>Look at recent history —globalist agenda has a predatory economic agenda (confessions of an eco hit man) to bring nations to their knees:  Venezuela most recent. Taking $ of circulation has been attempted in India. All this, plus new tech to make totalitarian control possible is here now, to where no one without the ‘mark of the beast’ will survive (cannot buy or sell).  This was prophesied thousands of years before even the telegram was invented. </p>

<p>You don’t have to believe one over the other. Both prophecy and science are showing you the same outcome. </p>
