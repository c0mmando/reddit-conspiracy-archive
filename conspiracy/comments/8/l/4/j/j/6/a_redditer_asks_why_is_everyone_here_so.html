       It doesn’t really matter if it happened or not because if it did it was 70 years ago.

       Whether or not it happened doesn’t change the fact that Jews are evil.

       You are so terribly wrong in every regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the Holocaust did happen. It was confirmed upon the liberation of the camps and end of WWII, and no real evidence has risen since then to prove that it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the "because it happened 70 years ago, it didnt matter" argument is bs. Your mother or grandmother was born 70 years ago. You cant just say that something doesn't matter because it did not occur within, or chronologically near your own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Jews are not evil. I don't know how you were raised or what social circles you are engaged in that have caused you to think this way, but Jews just want to live their lives individually. Same as everyone. There is no global Jewish web looking to keep folks like u/Aoip2337 underneath them.

       So do we. They are stopping that though. They are the ones degenerating society and making people accept all this bullshit going on. They are the ones pushing anti-white agendas and bringing in millions of “refugees” into our countries. They are the ones that are causing our extinction, while people like you are too blind to see it.

       Do I believe the Nazi's hated the Jews? Yes. They blamed them for their failed revolution and hated Socialism, which had huge Jewish influences at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe the Nazi's may have rounded up Jews? Yes
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe some of them died after being put in camps? Yes
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe some of them may have even be killed for various reasons? Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I also believe the 6 million dead number? No, because it always changing, hard to put a number on and they would have had to have been killing at an insane pace to meet that number.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This is what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did round up some Jews and put them into camps. Not only out of dislike for them, but due to the threat of Russia who no doubt would have used them to stir shit up like they did with the blacks leading to the Civil Rights Act in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wars come at a hefty price tag and losing wars make it even worse. When the Nazi's started losing the war, the conditions in the various camps got bad because they simply didn't have the food and desperately needed their production. And quite simply, Jewish camp conditions were their last concern. I don't think the cold winters of those years helped either and likely worsened already bad conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know what happens when tons of people of various levels of health are grouped together. They get sick and spread disease, creating even worse conditions.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The actions of Jewish people after that only point towards a greater conspiracy. How did the Jews, a group who wasn't even in WW2, end up winning themselves a whole nation out of it? It makes no sense. I didn't see the UK and British rushing to create a state for Armenian's after WW1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making Holocaust denial illegal always raises further questions. Why would denying that an event happened be considered a criminal action? It makes it seem like there is something to hide.

       You need unity when you are fighting a war. If you don't have it, the public opinion of the war is affected and then you have your own enemies fighting a civil war in your own country as well. The Russian's would have loved to have stirred up the Jews. They would have revolted and rioted and the Nazi's would have had to have taken action, which would look really bad for their image and public support. The media would have supported the victims and it would have created a civil war within a world war, which is not good.

        Do I believe the Nazi's hated the Jews? Yes. They revolted years prior to the war and the Nazi's hated Socialism, which had huge Jewish influences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Do I believe the Nazi's may have rounded up Jews? Yes
       </p>
       <p>
        Do I believe some of them died after being put in camps? Yes
       </p>
       <p>
        Do I believe some of them may have even be killed for various reasons? Absolutely.
       </p>
       <p>
        Do I also believe the 6 million dead number? No, because it always changing, hard to put a number on and they would have had to have been killing at an insane pace to meet that number.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        They did round up some Jews and put them into camps. Not only out of dislike for them, but due to the threat of Russia who no doubt would have used them to stir shit up like they did with the blacks leading to the Civil Rights Act in the US.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wars come at a hefty price tag and losing wars make it even worse. When the Nazi's started losing the war, the conditions in the various camps got bad because they simply didn't have the food and desperately needed their production. And quite simply, Jewish camp conditions were their last concern. I don't think the cold winters of those years helped either and likely worsened already bad conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know what happens when tons of people of various levels of health are grouped together. They get sick and spread disease, creating even worse conditions.

       SS: I have a Conspiracy Theory that the people in charge are fomenting “antisemitism” to make Truthful courageous people look like “racists”. We are know a racist person is a grotesque untouchable, right? Movies and TV programmed us like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the powers that be are deliberately trying to foment “antisemitism”, they are executing their plan to perfection. White people from Europe are hard to identify as semites, if reality matters at all.

       Make a country REALLY hypocritical. Base the justification for that country on lies.

      <p>
       Make it dangerous, to the point of putting people on the streets, to criticize them.

       Lock up some grannies for speaking their Truth.

       ​Enforce laws on the public. The law doesn’t apply whatsoever to them.

       I believe that “antisemitism” and “racism” is how the elite are masking their systemic murder and rape of children. As long as these dark occultists can gaslight and shame and frighten people into silence, they get to keep on murdering, raping and stealing. I think waspy, black, Arab, Jesuit etc. dark occultists are all hiding behind this trick they conjured up called “antisemitism”.
      </p>
      <p>
       All paid shills for dark occultists are selling their souls. The fight for good is purifying and I highly recommend it. What if dying fighting the good fight is a wonderful thing? The dark occultists have drilled a fear of death in us because they fear death. If someone is aligned with the good side - there is nothing to fear. Every day is an adventure.

       Hating black people (as a group and based off their skin color) is racist. Hating Asian people is racist. Hating Latin people is racist. Would you say any one of these, separately, is "not quite racist"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because there's more semites than Jews, doesn't mean hating Jews isn't anti-Semitic. Not sure what you're getting at.

       Racism can be against anyone. Anti semetism by definition is a hatred against semitic people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only hating Jews and being labeled anti semetic is like hating black people...but only Ugandans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti Semetism is too broad a brush if you only hate Jews.

       Dude, we're arguing semantics here. Anti semitism, as hate against any and/or all semites, clearly includes hatred against Jews, and everyone knows/uses the word this way. Whether it's "too broad" or not is really irrelevant to my original point. Also, if you only hated Ugandans, it wouldn't be racist, more like specifically xenophobic, whereas hatred of jews would, broadly, still be anti semitism.

       And therein lies the problem.  The Khazarian tribes have essentially hijacked the term "anti-semetic" to apply only to those groups who protest the Israel state-sponsored terrorism.  Conversely, Israel mowing down Palestinians is NOT viewed by much of the world as Anti-semetic, despite fitting the literal definition.  (Which happens to be by design).  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that more or less what u/grndzro4645 is getting at.

       I see what you're getting at and agree. I don't think it's exactly what the other guy was saying, and I apologize if it is and I misunderstood. What I originally was arguing with OP was his dismissal of both anti-semitism and racism as "political words" which have no use today, when I think that's not the case, as both racism and anti-Semitism are still very much present in society. Both arguments coexist and reinforce each other, imo.

       relating to or denoting a family of languages that includes Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic and certain ancient languages such as Phoenician and Akkadian, constituting the main subgroup of the Afro-Asiatic family.

       Whether the term "anti-semitic" wrongly excludes non-jewish semites is certainly an interesting and rightful debate, but claiming Jews are non-semitic is just incorrect. Most Jews are taught and speak Hebrew, on different levels, and certainly come from Hebrew traditions and history.

       Actually, true antisemitism seems rare, and when I do see it, it's always over-the-top and devoid of actual substantive commentary. I can't say if the people doing that are Jewish, but I do think much of the over-the-top antisemitic trolling is fake assholes just trying to make us look bad as a community.

       There are a lot of zionist shills on this sub. At the same time, there are a lot of anti semitic shills in this sub. This manipulayes many into adopting a polarized position of either being zionist or anti semitic thereby discrediting everyone who takes one of these polarized positions.

       In a room where
people unanimously maintain
a conspiracy of silence,
one word of truth
sounds like a pistol shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unbelieved truth can hurt a man much more than a lie. It takes great courage to back truth unacceptable to our times. There's a punishment for it, and it's usually crucifixion.

       if their was no truth in the topic to build its foundation then it would topple at the first instance of its inspection.

       lets say you have a "friend who does nothing but subversion, obfuscation, and outright lies to promote himself and his other friends.

      <p>
       would you call that a friend?
Is anyone in congress who has duel citizenship really representing our country's interests?

       You are so terribly wrong in every regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the Holocaust did happen. It was confirmed upon the liberation of the camps and end of WWII, and no real evidence has risen since then to prove that it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the "because it happened 70 years ago, it didnt matter" argument is bs. Your mother or grandmother was born 70 years ago. You cant just say that something doesn't matter because it did not occur within, or chronologically near your own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Jews are not evil. I don't know how you were raised or what social circles you are engaged in that have caused you to think this way, but Jews just want to live their lives individually. Same as everyone. There is no global Jewish web looking to keep folks like u/Aoip2337 underneath them.

       What number keeps changing? Has it changed from say.. 6 million to 10 000 to 50 million? Or has it been 6 million + 10k or 6 million +-100k. Has the

      <p>
       Whataboutism doesn't prove anything: why was Pol Pot ______, you can fill in your own theory. We can use "whatabout" to justify anything, that is not valid argument. Once again, you only need to read history to find out why Armenian Genocide is dealt the way it wasn't. but that is totally separate event in history. Had very little if anything to do with events in WWII. like you said, it was not recognized until way after world war 2. It is large stain of shame on many nations.

       Because you are horrible, horrible humanbeing that denies the suffering of millions and most likely want to repeat it. Your idea is based on that Jews still are allowed to exist.

       Did you honestly just say that Hitler is treted unfairly? After he killed millions of Jews? Oh right, you don't believr in it when we have noting but confirming research, actual eyewitness accounts counted in MILLIONS.
