&quot;The rights are derived from the people, not God or any government.&quot;
So I quoted the Declaration which states they are endowed by a Creator, and you accused me of bait and switch. Then I asked where you got that rights came from people and without a source citation to back your previous claim you tell me they are inherent ie endowed by a Creator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If thats what the majority of people want, yes. thats democracy. but thats not what im suggesting. i believe a person has the right, god-given or not, to defending themselves and their loved ones, or to hunt. but there is a difference between a shotgun or handgun (or hunting rifles) and a military grade assault rifle. </p>

<p>on top of that the 2nd amendment mentions a well-formed and organized militia. ok. so join a militia if you see fit. i dont see a problem with that.</p>

<p>on the flip side, i dont see a point in militias but im open to hear the logic behind it, that being said we can easily include such things in the rewrite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so i understand you clearly, from your stance you are saying that the agenda (from whomever) is to gain public support for &quot;taking&quot; assault rifles away from the everyday citizen, is that accurate?</p>

<p>If so, then i can empathize with that. however, taking away assault rifles to keep us controlled seems like a drop in a bucket. we&#39;re talking about the US military, which i was a member of. assault rifles....against drones, tanks, missiles, trained soldiers with body armor and tactics that would make your head spin....i dont think they are worried about any weapon that you may have outside of a high-powered sniper rifle, which from what ive read and please correct me if im wrong, is illegal for civilians to own. id wager that if true, its illegal because of the purpose of the weapon, similar to assault rifles, they are solely used to end human life....hence the argument that no civilian NEEDS an assault rifle.</p>

<p>My contention is this: you want a gun? fuckin go for it. but unless you are waging war there is no practical reason (and compensating for the snub nose you were born with is not practical) to own a weapon designed for war and only war. Get a shotgun for home protection, stow it and secure it, be responsible with it, and concede that you (or anyone that wants a gun) should go through a background check.</p>

<p>I know for most its an &quot;all or nothing&quot; deal to &quot;keep your hands off my guns&quot;, but rational minds can think, and i think it can work if we do it with clarity, honesty, and a bit of trust.</p>

<p>Absolutely. This why AR-15s are have been involved in almost every mass shooting since Sandy Hook. At Sandy Hook, the official story had to be &quot;revised&quot; multiple times over the course of a weekend to make the murder weapon a dreaded &quot;assault rifle.&quot;</p>

<p>If the US military was ever deployed for combat in the US, it would be outright civil war, which is precisely what the oligarchy wants to avoid at all costs. Besides, any protracted US civil war would be a guerilla war and Vietnam demonstrated how well superior technology works in guerilla warfare. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sniper rifles are legal in the US. The videos are all over Youtube. Regardless, your logic is flawed. Handguns have only one purpose; killing people. Yet, they are necessary. Similarly, semi-automatic rifles are necessary to keep the oligarchy in check, just like the Constitution intended. If the wealthy thought they could simply cancel the Constitution without repercussions, they would have done it 40 years ago. </p>
