       I think you're very well aware that the code words originated on 4chan, which isn't reliable. None of the code words came from law enforcement. I think you only made this thread to start a controversy.

       I can say I've heard "Cheese Pizza" being used as "Child Porn" since I was in Highschool and back when I used services like and Napster/Bearshare/Limewire, you had to be very careful of anything you downloaded, even the initials CP being on file would mean I wouldn't download that because of the potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily, it might of been an Urban Legend, but in the early 2000's it was known, at least for Cheese Pizza.

       Well "cheese pizza" makes sense as it is the initials for child porn. But that doesn't explain all these other terms and why are they sexual and relate to children.
      </p>

       I only used Napster for music back in the day.

       You won't find your answers here on the lies and slander reddit.  For example, the post above.  When they define pizza, and cheese, then say Cheese pizza, you become a redundant asshole.  They are made up.  The only people that use these as 'code words' for everyone to see , knowing everyone knows them, would be brain dead.

       Well, I'm just looking for the words. Sanchez says he heard of "cheese pizza" being used to reference "child porn" which makes sense because of the initials.
      </p>

       However the words are the most important part as the conspiracy revolves around these words.

       Pretty sure cheese pizza = child porn originated on 4chan.

       The source is some guy on 4chan:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/12/07/pizzagate/daaa6b3b2a4ae2f0d1d1a18456d77ed4436b8ca0/images/4chan-terms.png">
        https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/12/07/pizzagate/daaa6b3b2a4ae2f0d1d1a18456d77ed4436b8ca0/images/4chan-terms.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I saw someone dig up one of the code words translated from some phrase in some random country. But otherwise nothing's really out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly than the fact that 4chan is the source, however, is that none of the "code words" make sense in the context of the emails. And they could all be more easily explained by non child-raping explanations. Let's take the infamous handkerchief email:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a [semen] that seems [girl]-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you're busy, so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Code word" proponents would have us believe that girl-related semen is more likely than a pizza-related map. Despite the fact that the email chain states it was found on a kitchen island after
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433">
        touring homes
       </a>
       and the fact that the brothers like pizza enough to have an
       <a href="http://staging.dujour.com/news/washington-dc-party-trend-male-hosts/">
        outdoor pizza-oven
       </a>
       in one of their backyards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have the "walnut sauce":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hey John, We know you're a true master of cuisine and we have appreciated that for years ... But [person of color] [orgy] for the [little boy]? Mary, plz tell us the straight story, was the [orgy] actually very tasty? Love to all the Podestas from the Steyers! Cheers, Jim
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To which the reply was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's an amazing Ligurian dish made with crushed [persons of color] made into a paste. So stop being so California.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Code words are supposed to make sense when you sub them in. Here, the words make no sense and the context is clear, especially if we consider that there's evidence of
       <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a-running-conversation-with-john-podesta">
        the actual sauce
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Or let's take the gift box:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of [little boys] and wonderful [orgies], it was a lovely, tempting assortment of [little girls], Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It makes far less sense that they are receiving little boys and orgies in square boxes for a Christmas gift, than them simply receiving a
       <a href="https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/gift-baskets-tower-boxes/specialty-gift-boxes/28297">
        square-shaped cheese gift box
       </a>
       instead of
       <a href="https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/gift-baskets-tower-boxes/specialty-gift-boxes/28717">
        round shaped sauce gift box
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Try to see the forest for the trees. The "code words" make a lot less sense than the words they're supposed to replace. Nevermind the fact that they originated on 4chan.

       Nobody emails a friend about "playing dominoes on top of cheese or pasta". People don't ask their brother if they want to get "dinner or pizza". Its just not the way normal people talk.

       The source is irrelevant. They could mean nothing and it wouldn't matter. They were just something fishy that got people digging deeper -- and finding some really creepy stuff. Nothing rests on those code words. They just got the ball rolling.
