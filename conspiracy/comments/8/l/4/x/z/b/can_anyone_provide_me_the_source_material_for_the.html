    <div class="md"><p>I can say I&#39;ve heard &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; being used as &quot;Child Porn&quot; since I was in Highschool and back when I used services like and Napster/Bearshare/Limewire, you had to be very careful of anything you downloaded, even the initials CP being on file would mean I wouldn&#39;t download that because of the potential.</p>

<p>Luckily, it might of been an Urban Legend, but in the early 2000&#39;s it was known, at least for Cheese Pizza. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source is some guy on 4chan:</p>

<p><a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/12/07/pizzagate/daaa6b3b2a4ae2f0d1d1a18456d77ed4436b8ca0/images/4chan-terms.png">https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2016/12/07/pizzagate/daaa6b3b2a4ae2f0d1d1a18456d77ed4436b8ca0/images/4chan-terms.png</a></p>

<p>I think I saw someone dig up one of the code words translated from some phrase in some random country. But otherwise nothing&#39;s really out there.</p>

<p>More importantly than the fact that 4chan is the source, however, is that none of the &quot;code words&quot; make sense in the context of the emails. And they could all be more easily explained by non child-raping explanations. Let&#39;s take the infamous handkerchief email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a [semen] that seems [girl]-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Code word&quot; proponents would have us believe that girl-related semen is more likely than a pizza-related map. Despite the fact that the email chain states it was found on a kitchen island after <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55433">touring homes</a> and the fact that the brothers like pizza enough to have an <a href="http://staging.dujour.com/news/washington-dc-party-trend-male-hosts/">outdoor pizza-oven</a> in one of their backyards.</p>

<p>Then we have the &quot;walnut sauce&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey John, We know you&#39;re a true master of cuisine and we have appreciated that for years ... But [person of color] [orgy] for the [little boy]? Mary, plz tell us the straight story, was the [orgy] actually very tasty? Love to all the Podestas from the Steyers! Cheers, Jim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which the reply was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an amazing Ligurian dish made with crushed [persons of color] made into a paste. So stop being so California.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code words are supposed to make sense when you sub them in. Here, the words make no sense and the context is clear, especially if we consider that there&#39;s evidence of <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a-running-conversation-with-john-podesta">the actual sauce</a>.</p>

<p>Or let&#39;s take the gift box:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of [little boys] and wonderful [orgies], it was a lovely, tempting assortment of [little girls], Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It makes far less sense that they are receiving little boys and orgies in square boxes for a Christmas gift, than them simply receiving a <a href="https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/gift-baskets-tower-boxes/specialty-gift-boxes/28297">square-shaped cheese gift box</a> instead of <a href="https://www.harryanddavid.com/h/gift-baskets-tower-boxes/specialty-gift-boxes/28717">round shaped sauce gift box</a>.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Try to see the forest for the trees. The &quot;code words&quot; make a lot less sense than the words they&#39;re supposed to replace. Nevermind the fact that they originated on 4chan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The code words given by 4chan don&#39;t really fit.... and I don&#39;t know what the words refer to... but they still seem to be code for something.</p>

<p>Nobody emails a friend about &quot;playing dominoes on top of cheese or pasta&quot;. People don&#39;t ask their brother if they want to get &quot;dinner or pizza&quot;. Its just not the way normal people talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source is irrelevant. They could mean nothing and it wouldn&#39;t matter. They were just something fishy that got people digging deeper -- and finding some really creepy stuff. Nothing rests on those code words. They just got the ball rolling.</p>

<p>But you know all that.</p>
