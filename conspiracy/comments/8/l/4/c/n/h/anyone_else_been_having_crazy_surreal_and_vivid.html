       I want to say it's been about 3 days now. I can usually explain a change in my REM/dream pattern by a change in physiological routine; nighttime media viewing; or it'll be a case of the once in a blue moon crazy vivid dream cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it has been three days now. Anyone else experiencing an entire different surreal life time during sleep right now?

       I’d say almost every night, occasionally two separate dreams in a night or a continuation/redo dream from night to night until a few days ago. My wife, who hasn’t remembered a dream in probably a year, has been having dreams the past few nights.

       It’s weird and energizing af. The redos, I remember the prior time (same situation, people, setting) but I have more information so I can play it out differently. The continuation ones are like I got popped back right where I left off and keep going on a different night. Almost always vivid for me (crazy beyond real sometimes). Really kicks up if I have black and white pepper in my food in the evening.

       I love dreams. So far Ive had a dream where wife and I (before we were together and barely knew each other) spent years getting to know each other in a dream that directly got us together, spoken with my deceased buddy twice and a middle “man” twice, got advice from my deceased grandfather about what to do and not do, learned crazy secrets about mars were just barely learning about, and about 15 equally crazy real, informative or warning dreams.

       I always have very wide-scope, foreboding dreams. The environments are always very open, but clear that they have walls or ceilings, sometimes a hundred meters tall or more.  I have been in strange complexes that felt incredibly isolating and prone to triggering primal fears. The only truly apocalyptic dream I had was where I was standing in a barren wasteland and I saw (vividly) a vulture carrying a deerskin, A CH-56 Chinook made out of bones, and Air Force One except it was shaped more like the Normandy from the Mass Effect series and was clearly a hypersonic craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strangest dreams are those where I travel vast distances, jumping into distant corners of existence to hide from some tireless cosmic apex predator, or weirder yet, where I come to a portal as wide as the sky from the past to the future. I'm frequently floating, or flying, or exploring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most recent dreams are hauntingly lucid. I'm checking my belongings for counts and quantities and they remain similar to reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm of the opinion that we're essentially standing on the cosmic shore, right before dawn. There's a bunch of rabbit holes part of an expansive warren, but the set and setting is the beach.

       Mars has a thin, breathable atmosphere, no breathing tank is needed unless you work hard or become fatigued. There was a big civilization there in the past but a diminished one lives mostly under the surface now. We already have colonies there. Those are the big points, I wrote down the rest somewhere. Wife and I have been together over 6 years and I had that dream before we were together. Still really clear, sitting around a campfire by a two story cabin with friends of the older sister of my buddy growing up (who I never really talked to). I’ll see if I can find it written down.

       I used to have dreams about a guy I barely dated years earlier. It would literally leave my heart hurting afterwards, as in the dream I would be madly in love with him. I would brush it under the rug as I was in a relationship and hadn't seen him in years and figured I never would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then years later I ended up running into him and it was basically just like living my dream. Guess I'm still living it because it's 6 years later now and we are still together 😊
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus: I told him about that dream and he said he had had similar dreams about
Me as well.

       This is strange... I brought this up to my wife this morning after having another insane dream. I never remember my dreams. Ever. Over the past few nights I've been having crazy dreams too. My wife said she's been having crazy dreams but chalked it up to being pregnant and hormones and shit. Going to follow this post if nothing else to see if others are noticing anything out of the ordinary with their dreams.

       A possible explanation for this could be that Laurel/Yanny deal? If so, all I could hear was Yanny, even on the different frequencies where they claim you'd hear both. Idk, just spit balling.

       Me too. A strange water world. Large towers built out of the water with entire cities built on them. Creatures in the water. I woke up in a large round room with windows showing space and planets. There was a contraption attached to my head. There were 10 others like me in a circle. A woman was walking around and said to me with a smile "remember when you leave this planet it will be in the form of light energy" and then I woke up.

       Interesting, I had a dream years and years ago where I was in a large circular room with a domed ceiling.  The windows were enormous and triangular, and outside was space: brilliant stars and the surface of Jupiter.  And I could vividly see the constellation Scorpius right above Jupiter's surface.  It was beautiful and the best part is I can still recall the image.

       Recently I've been waking up from a dream, falling back asleep and carrying on with the same dream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had a lot of thoughts about what a lot of my childhood dreams meant too (I had a lot of reoccurring nightmares as a kid) and they are all making sense now. There's a part of me that believes that my future/higher resolution self dreams things to tell my present/lower resolution self something.

       It's interesting my dreams have been especially vivid recently, but ironically the images/symbols in them are now obnoxiously transparent and obvious. I sort of miss the more bizarre inexplicable unrealistic dreams I used to have.

       Maybe it just means instead of exploring aimlessly in the dream world someone(s) or something(s) is trying to communicate a more direct message.

       Nope, but I saw the posts on here before, or at least one of them.

       I posted this here because many people enjoy discussing the possibility of shared human consciousness and/or how certain outside influences may affect one's subconscious.
