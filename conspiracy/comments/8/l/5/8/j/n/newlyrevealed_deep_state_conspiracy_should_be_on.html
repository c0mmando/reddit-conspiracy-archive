<p>You are aware that everyone has denied it up to this point, so we really don&#39;t know that much about it.  It will be investigated, as it should be, and then we will have all the answers.  So no worries:)  They will just report basically exactly as you laid it out, and we can all go back to the Russian collusion thing.</p>

<p>Why would it?  People, especially trump, just obviously want to know what the hell was going on.  Pretty similar to the whole wiretap fiasco:  Wiretap? You&#39;re crazy!  Then later: ohhh, <em>that</em> wiretap!  Just busy not finding any criminal activity.</p>

<p>How can they base an investigation on rumours and 2nd hand hearsay?  You need a mueller for that:)  Now that the spying is confirmed, we need to know what was going on.  I&#39;m sure you want to know the full story as well.  The only way to get the truth is under oath.</p>

<p>No spying was confirmed that the Trump organization had not been informed about.  </p>

<p>&quot;Deep State&quot; is becoming a bit annoying, tbh. People are using it as a kind of shorthand for &quot;any ad hoc conglomerate of intelligence-connected evildoers that I can imagine but not identify.&quot;</p>

<p>the 2014 effort was part of a high-tech form of voter persuasion touted by the company, which under Bannon identified and tested the power of anti-establishment messages that later would emerge as central themes in President Trump’s campaign speeches, according to Chris Wylie, who left the company at the end of that year.</p>

<p>Among the messages tested were “<strong>drain the swamp</strong>” and “<strong>deep state</strong>,” he said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good lord why is this not more well known. I mean, I could’ve guessed that “deep state” was a political tool. Sure the sentiment has been around, but at this point it’s no longer a sentiment it’s the “wizard” in Oz....the evil man behind the curtain that’s actually a fucking joke. THIS is a fun tidbit I was unaware of. Of course there’s actors behind the scene but “deep state” is now just such a fucking right wing talking point that it’s lost any legitimacy.

    <div class="md"><p>If you replace &quot;deep state&quot; with &quot;racketeering cabal&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot; within the institutions of the federal government serving one faction of the domestic political arena over another, then it makes the most sense of all.</p>

<p>The hard truth is that all human society is like the mafia: a thousand thousand little mafias, some more brutal than others.  There&#39;s no such thing as democracy, and never has been.  Just, once, there used to be less government.</p>

<p>Whomever Trump is working for?  Who cares.  But Hillary/Obama spies broke the &quot;law&quot; trying to stop him.  Doesn&#39;t matter if Trump proves it - but would be nice for Americans to see how their government really is for a change.  Plus, who wants George Soros running the world empire?</p>

<p>By the way, one important concept here is that &quot;Progressive leftism&quot; supposes that the government is &quot;us&quot; and that it has to wield power in society in order to do good things.  This is one of the most dangerous and naive ideologies I&#39;ve ever heard of, but sadly the TRUTH is that strong government is usually the worst and most corrupt way to organize society.</p>

<p>So, frankly, a &quot;wake up&quot; moment for America about conspiracies to break the law within the government - no matter which side does it - is harmful to progressives - and they know it!  That&#39;s why Trump is painted as a foreign agent, and not as an agent of powers which are known to have wide influence domestically - like Israel and also the military.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that Halper was a CIA agent working for Carter and passing information to Reagan&#39;s team, he was not. He was a former spy who was then working as a campaign aide for Reagan and was allegedly gathering information from people who were on Carter&#39;s team.</p>

<p>Know your history:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Four decades ago, Halper was responsible for a long-forgotten spying scandal involving the 1980 election, in which the Reagan campaign – using CIA officials managed by Halper, reportedly under the direction of former CIA Director and then-Vice-Presidential candidate George H.W. Bush – got caught running a spying operation from inside the Carter administration. The plot involved CIA operatives passing classified information about Carter’s foreign policy to Reagan campaign officials in order to ensure the Reagan campaign knew of any foreign policy decisions that Carter was considering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only spying operations we know of were both perpetrated by the same cabal, George Bush and the CIA supported the same neocon foreign policy and globalist economic policy as the Clintons and Obamas, mueller is a bush lapdog who pushed fake intel leading to Iraq, comey came in to whitewash HSBC drug ties, etc.  They spied on Carter, who was not part of their club, and now trump, who obviously is not getting along with them either.</p>

<p>Now instead of criticizing the spying, you&#39;re trying to connect it to trump and carter being corrupt?  Not even deep state lackeys like clapper are doing that!  Stick to the script: ignore carter, talk about how it&#39;s about Russia.  You&#39;re not really helping the pro-spying crowd when you improvise like that.  Nobody is going to believe that Bush and the cia spied on carter because he was corrupt.  And if you bring up spying on Carter, it&#39;s harder to convince people that helper was spying again but for a good reason this time and not just dirty tricks.  </p>

<p>I think what you should do here is just ignore carter or just deny that he was ever spied on.  Just like everyone denied spying on trump.  Really, who is going to notice a few more lies. </p>

<p>It has literally been pointed out that the &#39;informant&#39; was  Halper who did an operation against Carter for the BUSH CIA!!!</p>

<p>I think you guys, and by this I mean Democrats, need to be ready that there is a good chance, that not only did Trump not commit a crime that justified this operation, but that the US surveillance state in conjunction with Obama and his appointees tried to undermine an opposition political campaign; furthermore, that they were doing this in conjunction with &#39;allied&#39; intelligence. </p>

<p>Spy: (n) a person who secretly collects information on the activities, movements, and plans of an enemy or competitor</p>

<p>Informant: (n) a person who gives information to another</p>

<p>A spy IS an informant, an informant CAN be a spy</p>

<p>You choose to call them a spy, which they can be classified as. However they can also be classified as an informant. Either IS correct, either CAN be correct</p>

<p>Just pointing out that you’re choosing to use spy because it sounds worse. And reguardless the term is not pertinent to whether or not this was done legally, which it COULD have been or COULDNT have been. We don’t have enough info yet. You’re choosing to use language that confirms your viewpoint, that’s your Perrogative, but it is neither correct nor incorrect </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He’s being called a spy because that’s exactly what he is. He was sent by the FBI to secretly collect information about Page, Papdopoulos, etc. as well as try to infiltrate the campaign. </p>

<p>Informant implies something completely different. The FBI isn’t leaking to the NYT and WaPo for shits and giggles. It’s not a coincidence that we saw an influx of pro-FBI articles and statements last week. They’re trying to set the narrative before this information is released to the public. </p>

<li>  The FBI did everything by the book. </li>

<li>  The FBI didn’t spy, they just sent someone to investigate without the Trump campaign knowing. </li>

<p>You’re more than welcome to believe this is some horrific constitutional crisis or whatever it is you’re going for</p>

<p>If it’s horrifically illegal I’m sure we’ll have quite a few indictments for treason or something of the sort in due time. Until then, it appears there actually WASNT anything abnormal about this, as this, as of this moment, is known as an fbi informant (or spy if you so choose) was there to see if Russians were acting inappropriately with trumps campaign. If it’s so horrifically illegal then justice will be served, as trump and his side have control of every branch of government so they should easily be able to prosecute. Until then, your wishing upon a shooting star that’s actually just a frozen turd ball from a jet plane (joe dirt reference)</p>

<p>this behavior by the FBI/DOJ IS normal....we live in a time when nearly every citizen is surveilled (sp?) in some sense....if you start talking to some Russians when you’re involved with high level people then that surveillance goes up....you can say it’s not right, you can say it’s not a coincidence, to say it’s not normal is laughably wrong. It’s a near guarantee you’re surveilled to some extend as am I, so nah man, it’s not abnormal</p>

<p>May not be entirely correct morally speaking (it’s not) but it’s how our country goes these days, and when you start breaking laws they start looking at you more until they bust you so I’m not sure why you’re under the impression that fbi surveillance isn’t normal???</p>

<p>They have certainly publicly said they can’t reveal the info to congress to protect a source, what exactly do you find abnormal about that?

<p>Pro-FBI articles aren’t exactly anything new either....happens every time a major politician attacks them, except that DJT attacks them incessantly so of course MSM has protected them (aside from the infamous Clinton-comey issue which they obviously tried to vilify them for)</p>

<p>I don’t see anything abnormal. Msm attacks/defends the opposite of what trump says as they always have. Why is it that you find all of this so strange would you mind going in to detail? This is all par for the course since fall 2016.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deep State has been co-opted by the Far-Right to demonize the opposition. It&#39;s become a term used by mainstream Right-Wing media, a way for some corporate lobbyist and career politicians to weaponize their victimhood.   </p>

<p>Not saying it isn&#39;t real, but pretending that we know ALL OF THEIR MOTIVES, is ridiculous and exactly what some people want us to think.  For all we know, the Deep State could just be solely about influential government and corporate figures serving their own self interest. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a extremely vague concept. We have no idea how organized they are, assuming they are organized at all, and instead just backroom deals.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, but when they are we shouldn&#39;t disregard them. Conspiracies like Pat Tilman&#39;s death, Watergate,  and the gulf of Tonkin were exposed to the public through MSM sources, and we should be grateful for that, I wish they&#39;d expose more stuff to a mainstream audience. Trump and his many crimes absolutely are a conspiracy and should be discussed here. We shouldn&#39;t ignore other stories, but people who want to bury this story aren&#39;t looking for the truth, they&#39;re only looking to reinforce their previously biases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term was initially used to describe Soviet Russia, then Turkey, now the US. Its not just some Trump supporter buzzword it&#39;s an acceptable term within the real of political science.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia</a> page detailing the usage of the term:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the United States the term &quot;deep state&quot; is used within political science to describe influential decision-making bodies believed to be within government who are relatively permanent and whose policies and long-term plans are unaffected by changing administrations. The term is often used in a critical sense, vis-à-vis, the general electorate to refer to the lack of influence popular democracy has on these institutions and the decisions they make as a shadow government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Deep_state">deep state</a> is the collection of every person working in and around government who isn&#39;t elected and who isn&#39;t accountable to any democratic institution. Especially the unelected bureaucrats who shape and execute public policy, but also others with political power over government, like party leadership or members of the corporate media. The deep state&#39;s deep continuity is why public policy does not change significantly between administrations, there is a permanent state that remains in power regardless of who is elected. </p>

<p>The phrase &quot;shadow government&quot; has been used to refer to the <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/7th_floor_group">7th Floor Group</a>, which was a small group of such bureaucrats who worked in the Harry S. Truman Building for the State Dept. &quot;Deep state&quot; refers to a lot more than just those people, but they were a subset of the deep state and it appears that the informal group has been disbanded under Trump&#39;s administration. I think some have used the terms interchangeably, which you might notice if you check out the &quot;deep state&quot; article I linked above, but that seems to only confuse the situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Department of Defense paid Halper $282,295 on September 27, 2016 — just months before the 2016 presidential election — for work titled, “INDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY,” says USASPENDING.gov, a website that tracks spending data for the U.S. government. This sum was one of two payments made to Halper for the job; the second, worth $129,280, was made on July 26, 2017. The record lists Halper’s “Period of Performance” as September 26, 2016 to March 29, 2018.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>USASPENDING.gov shows the Department of Defense paid Halper a total of $1,058,161 for work between 2012-2018. The work designated for “India-China” study comprised nearly 40 percent of that compensation.</p>

<p>Spy: (n) a person who secretly collects information on the activities, movements, and plans of an enemy or competitor</p>

<p>Informant: (n) a person who gives information to another</p>

<p>A spy IS an informant, an informant CAN be a spy</p>

<p>You choose to call them a spy, which they can be classified as. However they can also be classified as an informant. Either IS correct, either CAN be correct</p>

<p>Just pointing out that you’re choosing to use spy because it sounds worse. And reguardless the term is not pertinent to whether or not this was done legally, which it COULD have been or COULDNT have been. We don’t have enough info yet. You’re choosing to use language that confirms your viewpoint, that’s your Perrogative, but it is neither correct nor incorrect </p>

<p>this behavior by the FBI/DOJ IS normal....we live in a time when nearly every citizen is surveilled (sp?) in some sense....if you start talking to some Russians when you’re involved with high level people then that surveillance goes up....you can say it’s not right, you can say it’s not a coincidence, to say it’s not normal is laughably wrong. It’s a near guarantee you’re surveilled to some extend as am I, so nah man, it’s not abnormal</p>

<p>May not be entirely correct morally speaking (it’s not) but it’s how our country goes these days, and when you start breaking laws they start looking at you more until they bust you so I’m not sure why you’re under the impression that fbi surveillance isn’t normal???</p>
