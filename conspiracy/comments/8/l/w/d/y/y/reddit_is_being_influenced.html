       I don’t know if this is the place to post this but I will anyway. So this is just a theory, but for the past year I haven’t been able to open reddit without seeing at least one negative post about Donald Trump mostly on r/politics or r/worldnews with a disproportionate amount of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been looking at the accounts posting these and almost all of them have only been posting anti trump posts and comments all with a surprisingly large number of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have experience working on large scale influencing campaigns and what’s been going on on reddit the past year has all of the signs a very elaborate one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t want to single out any specific party that would be interested in such a large scale influencing campaign against Trump as there are many, but in my opinion it is blatantly obvious that there is one going on and that the whole Reddit community is falling for it and playing into the hands of the people who are running the campaign.

       The analysis may have a bias, but the aggregation of numbers does not. Plus, Nate Silver fully discloses his methodology so you can review that if you please.

      <p>
       Rasmussen has him at 49% and is included in the aggregate. Anyone who knows anything about polling knows that aggregates tend to be more accurate overall than any individual poll.

       For the vast majority of reddits history it's been overwhelmingly counter-establishment.

      <p>
       About 50% Chomsky/Sanders/Occupy types and  50% Ron Paul libertarians/Ancaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the 2016 election began it was still basically like this. But when Hillary was hated and Reddit was being used to mobilize Trump and Sanders subs everything basically shifted over night and has progressively been astroturphed more and more since then.

       If you check through the site that allows advertisers to see the amount of subscribers it's many many times higher than what they actually show.

       Reddit is also lib central. As many conservatives as there are here, this is liberal territory. Makes it a lot funnier when we come here and post memes and the libs go REEEEEEEEE!!! RUSSIAN BOTS!! PEPE IS A HATE SYMBOL!!!!!

       There are virtually no liberals on reddit. What you're seeing is a deliberately engineered breed of new-age fascists who are being assigned the designations
       <em>
        left
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        liberal
       </em>
       .

       In the same vein, there are virtually no real conservatives; jut a bunch of sociopathic warmongering neocon minions &amp; parrots who are being assigned the designations

       This sub is also influenced by those same people, and more than one of the comments you've already received is from them.
       <br/>
       The only thing I will add is that it's mostly bots these days, not real people, and they're mostly

       Killary was the deep state's next planned puppet. She was supposed to win via electronic voting machine manipulation, which she did - the machines gave Killary the majory of the votes -
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       the software didn't properly take the electoral college into account so Drumpf ended up winning.
       <br/>
       The deep state (CIA &amp; friends) went into panic mode and have been trying to rally the public against him for impeachment pressure.
       <br/>
       They want Drumpf either impeached or cooperative because of fear of impeachment. At this point they've pretty much got him under control but not quite. They gotta keep that public pressure on him so he'll keep dropping the bombs and progressing the police state expansion.

       Reddit is absolutely being influenced and it's worse than you think. This should be talked about day and night on this sub

       This sub was a hold out for a long time but recently it's sunk to shit as well.

       I just keep remembering that all those real people who saw what we saw in 2016 (in general and in subs like r/politics) are out there and are not going to be manipulated by incessent disagreement from Reddit.

       Congrats redditor you got it.

       Controversy here is a sign you're on the right track. Pushback occurs because those same forces want especially to stop others from pulling back the curtain.

       I think almost 50% of content on r/all with tons of upvotes is done by Reddit admins. Especially from r/space ever since this whole flat earth stuff has been getting popular.
