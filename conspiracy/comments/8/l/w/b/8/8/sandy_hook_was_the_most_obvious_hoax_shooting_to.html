       The school had no internet activity since 2008. Hundreds of students who supposedly evacuated the school were nowhere to be found in any of the photos, we only see the same 15 or so children walking in a line unperturbed except for one girl who looks like she just found out that Santa Claus isn't real. Mold growing all over the school, water damage in the halls from flooding, no wheelchair ramps so not ADA compliant. Fake crying from Gene Rosen, who had several different stories as to what he encountered that day. Robbie Parker laughing/smiling before approaching the podium, followed by hyperventilating and getting into character before he mourns the death of Emily Parker, his 6 year old daughter who died the day before. Donation pages online before the event occurred. Sandy Hook parents visiting the White House before the event occurred. Thousands of houses in Newtown, CT paid off on Christmas Day three years prior. The FBI admitting on there own website that zero deaths occurred by way of manslaughter in Newtown, CT that year. This is all just the tip of the iceberg as anyone who has really dug into this knows.

        We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook

       . Given the recent news of the lawsuit against the controlled opposition Zio-shill cointelpro agent Alex Jones regarding Sandy Hook (which I believe to be a government psyop in itself) there has been an influx of people, either paid trolls or perhaps useful idiots, shilling for the official narrative given to them by the mainstream mockingbird CIA whore media. Don't let anyone try to gaslight you into feeling bad about exposing this most obvious false flag hoax. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out if they simply watch the documentaries on it. Be warned that anyone who is challenged to do so will likely respond with something like "lol your proof is a youtube video, that doesn't count!" I'm sad to say that I have lost friendships over this event and I think we should all be pissed that the government is causing such strain in people's lives with their friends and family by conducting these sorts of fake shootings in order to chisel away at our rights. And yes, I realize no huge change happened in regards to gun laws after Sandy Hook- they are chiseling away at it though. They can't just do it all at once, but they'll point to all these events and say, "see what's happened now? First Sandy Hook, then the Boston Bombing, now this?? Enough is enough!" I personally really got into researching conspiracies when Pizzagate broke, but when I learned about Sandy Hook and saw just how obvious it was from every conceivable angle, it makes me feel as though this may be the best way we have to expose the truth about how corrupt the US government is to the sleeping masses. It is so much more cut and dry than any other conspiracy I've come across, Pizzagate and 9/11 included.

       Yeah that’s true, but for example with 9/11 some people (like me) think there were no planes, some think it was a drone or uninterruptible autopilot, some think direct energy weapons were used, some think it was explosives set up by Israeli art students... basically within the pool of people who reject the official story, there is still not as much of a unified consensus as to what actually took place as there is with Sandy Hook truthers.

       The no plane theory is bullshit. Definitely was two planes and jet fuel leaking down that can be smelled from the Path station. But were they drones? Who knows.. WTC7 is still unbelievable.

       Well ok, but there's tons of video showing planes from public sources, citizens, and independent outlets. And there are zero video demonstrating no planes at those times at the tower.

       I think that there aren’t as many videos of the planes hitting the towers as you think there are. Do you have any idea how hard it would be for anyone let alone someone who’s not a professional pilot to steer a plane off its flight path and hit a plane? Multiply the incredible/ness of that by 2. And then divide it by 3 because 3 towers fell. No sign of plane wreckage anywhere to be found so I guess when the plane hit it just disappeared into thin air. The thing is that from what I’ve read even if planes really did collide into the towers at the speed they were going, they still would not be able to penetrate the steel structure of the building. So where was any part of the planes after it had hit?

       It was some kind of small missile that hit the towers that was made to look similar to a plane. Then they control demo’ed the buildings.

       I've read that the planes hitting the buildings and the resulting aftermath (what
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have been the aftermath as in the plane being destroyed) would be the same aftermath as the buildings hitting the planes ...
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is picture holding one of the buildings like a baseball bat and swatting the plane as it flew by with the building going 600 miles an hour during the swing
      </p>
      <p>
       It would destroy the plane and have little damage to the building

       I’m open minded either way but as I remembered it, I saw video of people filming the from their apartments... after the first plane hit, people were watching the smoke from the tower, then the second plane hit.  Not filmed by news channel.  Also tons of angles of plane hitting as I remember, at least of the second plane.  How do you explain CGI from that many sources or from amateur video?

       This incident was probably the most poorly executed mass shooting hoax, hence the bringing out of the big guns via litigation.. I wouldn't worry though because it's all for show..

       As I recall, there is no proof - like death certificates - that any of the children died in the school. Likewise, there is no verifiable proof that Adam Lanza was there and shot people.

       Those kids at the superbowl were awfully suspect too. I just dont know what to think but I know that I dont have this conversation with many as I dont want to justify my feelings and there is just so much that weighs on the side of it didnt happen. Like just the Christmas trees alone. There are so many things that add up to only one thing. It didnt happen the way they mapped out to us at least...It didnt happen at all at worst.

       I was mostly just saying that I know that his sister died and I couldn’t comment on most of the stuff that people care about like kids or Lanza. I mean I don’t expect a single person to believe me and I don’t think anyone will, its literally.

       I don’t even believe all the “facts” about Newtown. Maybe she didn’t die at the school, all I was saying is that she was a teacher there and obviously isn’t alive anymore.

       I’m pretty sure this is the kind of thing where people are assigned a whole new identity and moved to a different area where they basically start a new life. As far as I and many other people (people who have researched this for hundreds of hours) can tell, that school was not even operational for several years prior to the event.

       I think it was perfectly executed as an exercise to see how much the population will take. And then dial it back from there...for fidelity.

       The ending footage of "Sandy Hook Line and Sinker" made me question
       <em>
        why are the lies global?
       </em>
       - my kneejerk understanding is to  instill fear and sadness in the viewers... but if so, why? Is it too far-fetched to believed it's to do wth keeping our vibrations low/demonic entities? I think so. More pragmatically, is it just to keep us depressed and aloof?
Could someone help me understande

       6 (maybe 7?) Newtown Police Department Patrolman sat in their patrol cars, within 5 miles of the school, throughout the entire duration of the alleged shooting...without responding to one of the most heinous crimes on 'Merican soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't make this shit up...so the patrolman were fired right??...Nope!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lieutenant in command of all Newtown PD Patrols, was one of the parties that failed to respond...despite be'n in uniform and in his patrol car within 5 miles of the school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also absent from the school shooting response...all other "leadership" from Newtown PD...no Police Chief...no Police Captain...in fact officers from neighboring CT towns &amp; CT state police responded to the school...
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was Newtown PD "leadership"? Why did 6 (maybe 7?) Newtown PD Patrolman sit in their cars (less than 5 miles away) whilst children were murdered?

       Look, I’m as much of a conspiracy nut as the rest of you guys but I live about a half hour from Sandy Hook and can confirm that the school 1000 percent exists. My best friend in high school went there, and I’ve met several of her friends that have younger siblings who attended the school at the time of the shooting. No, I obviously never met the younger siblings, but still. The school definitely exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I’ve also seen the abandoned Fairfield medical facility, as most teenagers in my area have, because it’s supposedly “haunted”. These places are two completely different things ffs

       There were at least two previous comments along the lines of “I’m not convinced Sandy Hook was ever a real school”. All I’m sayin is that it definitely was, and if people want to argue about the logistics of this conspiracy they should at least have their facts straight

       It hadn’t been operational in years. No internet activity coming from the school since 2008, mold growing all over the school, water damage from flooding in the hallways, etc. It looked like a garbage school. Also, there was no sign of hundreds of students evacuating the school, more like 15 or 20 at most.

       I know someone who attended sandy hook. I know for a fact it was not fake because they literally witnessed there classmates getting slaughtered before there eyes. This person is still suffering ptsd from the results. So you saying it’s fake is a huge insult to people who actually witnessed it. How could you possibly think it was fake?

       I will watch them because I am a believer that the Vegas shooting was staged. I also believe the parkland shooting was staged. So I’m not just a conspiracy denier without even reading into them. I have looked into this one briefly and there is some weird things going on with it however I don’t think it was fake. People were killed that day as I said earlier, someone I know suffers depression, anxiety, and severe ptsd as they witnessed it. They have told me graphic stories about the incident that you can’t just make up. Have you every thought maybe instead of this being fake, it might have been a staged shooting where the elites were all in on it? I’m not trying to argue with you nor am I butthurt or anything, I’m just trying to have a discussion. Would like to read what you have to say.
