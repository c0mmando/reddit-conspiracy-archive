<p>They part of the government.</p>

<pre><code>When companies receive National Security Letters (NSLs) from the FBI or a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) request from the NSA, they also get a gag order barring them from telling anyone. There is one way that websites can inform users that they&#39;ve been subpoena&#39;d without breaking the law, though: Using a &quot;warrant canary.&quot; Those are simply statements in transparent reports that indicate a site has not received a letter since a certain date. Reddit had one in its 2014 report (below), meaning it had never received a subpoena as of January 29th, 2015. Last year&#39;s report, released yesterday, includes no such remark, meaning that the company did indeed receive the dreaded letter sometime last year.



Concerning the report, Reddit founder and CEO Steve &quot;Spez&quot; Huffman remarks, &quot;I&#39;ve been advised not to say anything one way or the other.&quot; While that says a lot in itself, there&#39;s no way to officially confirm the request or, obviously, know what data the FBI, NSA or other agency asked for.

<p>Brock&#39;s simultaneous involvement with Correct the Record, American Bridge, and Priorities USA Action raised legal questions, given that the first two groups work closely with Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign while Priorities USA Action, the largest Democratic Party super PAC, is legally prohibited from doing so. Brock claimed to have stopped working directly with American Bridge, although its staffers continued to operate out of his office. Paul Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, considered complaining about Brock to the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department, charging that he was &quot;creating new ways to undermine campaign regulation.&quot;[3]</p>

<p>Nothing in the first amendment says the government has to support free speech. It says the government can not restrict it. If Reddit is a government entity it can still censor content it deems objectionable (for any reason).</p>

<p>What it can&#39;t do is ban another site from publishing that content.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When companies receive National Security Letters (NSLs) from the FBI or a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) request from the NSA, they also get a gag order barring them from telling anyone. There is one way that websites can inform users that they&#39;ve been subpoena&#39;d without breaking the law, though: Using a &quot;warrant canary.&quot; Those are simply statements in transparent reports that indicate a site has not received a letter since a certain date. Reddit had one in its 2014 report (below), meaning it had never received a subpoena as of January 29th, 2015. Last year&#39;s report, released yesterday, includes no such remark, meaning that the company did indeed receive the dreaded letter sometime last year.</p>

<p>Concerning the report, Reddit founder and CEO Steve &quot;Spez&quot; Huffman remarks, &quot;I&#39;ve been advised not to say anything one way or the other.&quot; While that says a lot in itself, there&#39;s no way to officially confirm the request or, obviously, know what data the FBI, NSA or other agency asked for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your premise is wrong.</p>

<p>Trump can&#39;t block people because he&#39;s using Twitter as a presidential platform. He&#39;s not using it as a person, but as the president/government. This gives his Twitter account certain restrictions. For example he isn&#39;t even allowed to delete tweets because they are presidential records. </p>

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t the government. There&#39;s nothing stopping reddit from choosing who they let participate on their platform. </p>
