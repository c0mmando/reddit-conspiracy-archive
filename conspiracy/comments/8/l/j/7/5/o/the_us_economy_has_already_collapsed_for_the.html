<p>Walk up to the nearest slave-driver corporation (e.g. Amazon) and say: &quot;Dear Mr/Mrs. Corporate Shark, i would like to have a job like you gave the boomers 50 years ago, where you earn a living wage of 3000 $ a month, just so i can pay off the rent-lord who charges me 1000$ for my 3 square feet NYC hole in the Bronx and then gladly pay my 40+ % taxes (theft) which Uncle Sam invests right away not into welfare programs or my retirement, but into giving Israel guns so they can genocide those pesky freedomium-hating Palestinkian children.</p>

<p>While i got A+ in math and English, my practical qualification includes nothing, because the schools system in this shithole country is a total failure, but i have a drivers license and practical self-taught skills in handling computers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really wanna go to college because i don&#39;t wanna end up 300+ grand down the hole due to rip-off for-profit universities.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr./Mrs. Corporate Shark: I&#39;m sorry, unless you are god himself, i can only offering you this 7.50$/h slave job and a free dumpster to sleep in...oh wait...we just gave this job to a illegal alien who only asked for 4.30$/h because they are getting subsidized by the welfare that was just cut from your parents. Don&#39;t let the door hit you on the way out.&quot;</p>

<p>*door hits you</p>

<p>You: &quot;AAAAH !&quot;</p>

<p>SS: What the fuck does &quot;full employment&quot; even mean when the politicians say it ? That all jobs-slots are taken and you won&#39;t get one. When the economy fails to provide people with decent jobs that get you through life debt-free, it has essentially collapsed into slavery.</p>

<p>Why? I have different ones for different uses (either car rental perks, higher percentages of cash back for different places, or extended warranty perks) and I&#39;ve never paid a penny of interest, and have actually paid less than I have spent. I do spend probably 10minutes/month making sure they&#39;re all legit and paid, though.

<p>We are already in it, the first sign of that was the 2008 mortgage apocalypse. It&#39;s very silently happening and the media is just propagating the same message &quot;everything is fine, everything is fine&quot; infinitely to distort the reality in peoples minds.</p>

<p>This thing could go on for another 100 years, it doesn&#39;t really matter how much time is left, because there is none. All it would need is to expose the fraudulent zombie corpse of a former industrial nation as what it is : Dead.</p>

<p>Stock bubble, housing bubble, zero interest loans etc. etc. are all just band-aid fixes for a gunshot to the head.</p>

<p>Dumping the petrodollar is just one additional bullet in the magazine that&#39;s going to be unloaded on the American public and Europe will be looking like a shell crater too if that happens.</p>

<p>The its time for dicatorship of the proletariate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with that is that it already happened in world history both with communism and national socialism, but every single time the leadership of these movements was infiltrated and the movements ultimately turned against the people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>It&#39;s only going to get worse until a final crisis sinks the ship due to the decline of the rate of profit.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter how many new scams are invented to increase profit, you are correct, on day it will reach it&#39;s mathematically unavoidable growth cap and then what ? Collapse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>National socialism is more about class colaboration. Very different. As for preventing that hijacking everyone has a different idea. I would say Mao got the closest in actual practice to actually decentralizing power. Power still got stratified in the elites even after the cultural revolution was created to destroy them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just graduated high school, planning on going into emt/paramedic field. Pay isn&#39;t the best (25k a year) but it&#39;s something, plus I will have a usable skill without too much college loan debt. On a side note, this skill will also be good in the inevitable revolt/civil war. </p>

<p>My long term plan is to start a media website eventually, like the drudge report but less biased and more interested in holding power accountable. </p>

<p>You&#39;re entirely right though, the avg. US wage hasn&#39;t gone up since the 80s, half of Americans cant afford a 1k emergency. Meanwhile wall street keeps getting richer, defense contractors get richer. 1% get richer. Ben Shapiro can go fuck himself, our economic system is broken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the mid 1970&#39;s my immigrant parents built a big nice house for $8000 &amp; it had a separate garage on .75 acres of land.</p>

<p>When they sold it towards the end of the 1990&#39;s it went for 6 x&#39;s higher.</p>

<p>Since that time it has gone 14 times higher than than the late 1990&#39;s price.</p>

<p>If you look at the cost of real estate before the mid 1990&#39;s prices went up relatively little for many decades &amp; a house was always around 3 times yearly income.</p>

<p>We are in a wild inflationary period despite what the government wants to bullshit everyone with.</p>

<p>Plus now in most cities  you cannot build your own house....you have to hire an overpriced contractor who does a shit job as well.</p>
