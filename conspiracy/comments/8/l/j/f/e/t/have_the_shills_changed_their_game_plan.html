       This may get down voted, mocked, or attacked...but I honestly don't care anymore. So the users that have been frequenting here for over 2+ years have noticed certain odd patterns on posts relating to certain subject matter. Any "conspiracy" post that re-enforces a main stream idea receives and unnatural amount of activity. Within in it anyone who disagrees is called a whole bunch of buzzwords to discredit their charactor. The big one..."anti-semite." When you click these comments that seem oddly pre-prepped, you'll notice that most of these accounts spewing them have joined within the last year, somehow featuring boatloads of useless Karma. The more it happened, the more the natural users pushed back, forcing them to rethink their game plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing long time users will have noticed, the apparent rise in anti semitism on this sub. Now 2 years ago, this sub was not like that, even as far back as a few months ago any "those jews" type post was often met with down votes and criticism. There was a point last year where a post featuring a Rabbi explaining the difference between Judaism &amp; Zionism floated around the top post section on here for a few days running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the last few weeks I have noticed some peculiar...the shilling posts seemed to have dried up, but there has been a wave of anti-semetic posting occuring, met with mass up votes, and active comment sections, than coincidentally seemed pre-prepped, and are made mostly by accounts that are under a year old. It has gotten to the point where I now have to legitimately question whether or not these are natural occuring discussions. Originally they tried to discredit us by creating a false perception of popular opinion, but they got called out, and realized it wasn't as successful as they anticipated. Is it possible that they have decided to take another approach in discrediting this sub? By attempting to create the atmosphere that they have tried to stereotype this as? Is it possible that they have switched from shilling to trolling ,to make it seem like this sub is the hateful shit posting toxic zone of the internet? When I ask myself this, I also ask...why wouldn't they. In fact, it seems like a more efficient way to control the narrative. Create the beast you claimed existed, and validate your claims by proving  the beast actually exists. It's a good way to make lurkers and new users want to stay away, and it discredits anyone who has been here for an extended amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, some of these people may be legit anti-semites, I know they exist, I am jewish...but I don't buy into this media craze that the nazis are on the rise and will return, in the form of Trump voters. After all, this whole Isreal thing ordeal has also been used as another way to discredit Trump and publicly shame his supporters. For the record, I am not a Trump supporter, I don't support the actions of Isreal, and I don't support hte left (anymore) either. I didn't vote in the last election...but I bring him up because the Left is the one with the reputation, and track record of doing this (CTR/ShareBlue/Brock Suckers).  I'm curious to know what other users think about this.

       There's tons of shady stuff going on this sub for sure. I don't even browse the subs main page anymore, it's like looking at TV where you get told what to watch or read. There's also a very glaring pro-trump, mod-sponsored agenda where any post putting Trump in a bad light is removed, but posts shilling Trump get to stay and be "debated". Bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-semitism is interesting. I hadn't really thought it the way you put it, but it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       make sense -  get people from the outside thinking you're insane, then discredit you for being insane. Classic. I don't mind discussing or engaging in Holocaust theories or Israel or whatnot, but when most of the comments lean heavily towards anti-semitism it feels kinda off...
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part is, I can't really think of a solution. How do you even stop bot accounts and mass vote manipulation? It feels more and more suspicious engaging in discussion in the sub this days... Sometimes feels like I'm talking to someone and already know what they're gonna answer me and what they aren't gonna answer me as well. Scary stuff.

       No, this sub is already a wasteland. Been coming here nearly 7 years. No need to discredit any further. The shilling and trolling over the past few years combined with "corrupt mods" has made this place a disaster. I get downvoted for bringing up Nibiru.

       I hypothesize Nibiru and Nemesis are the reason for the drastic climate shift going on. Polar Vortex split, the sun setting in a different place, moon being illuminated on the north and south due to planet bouncing, Saturn was knocked on it's side a few years back...I just have this feeling the planet of the gods is on the way back and earth is heading for a serious shift.

       Were they "oddly coordinated" or were they "compromised", in your view? Those are two different, almost opposite things. The former is an attempt to paint Wikileaks leadership as inherently and consistently biased and partisan. To say they are compromised indicates that outside forces have taken over the site and it is now being run by those who it once sought to expose.

       They exposed the party that was in power. "Speaking truth to power" is literally the only way a whistle blower can remain unbiased and uncompromised. Only a shill or a fascist could possibly see it otherwise. Now that doesn't mean that information isn't in some respects biased, because ALL INFORMATION IS BIASED; but it does mean, that any argument that asserts 
a whistle blower should never expose one corrupt and fascist organization if it can't expose all corrupt and fascist organizations is an argument made only by and for the most corrupt.

       If it was compromised, then it happened long after the election. The only thing that's been released since then is Vault 8 (CIA tech manual), so everything on the site is verifiable and legit.

       I am adamant that this sub cannot have any sensible discussion about anti-semitism, because it is so "over-worked" by both sides. And very often it is clear the posts act as honey-traps, just to tease out more information about the state of anti-semitism on the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if you were in the anti-anti-semitism patrol, you might post a virulently anti-semite post just to see who comments and what the range of opinions are here. (Note that apparently in T_D, no anti-semite posts are allowed. This is the main place to test reactions.)
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record my own opinion is in the middle - yes it's a conspiracy of interest, but no, it is not the key that unlocks all others. What I just described is exactly the best way to block a "middle of the road", and therefore more believable, position to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       So every time, if you comment you are either a "monster" as an anti-semite, or you are a "friend-of-Israel" who bravely confronts the crazies. There's no in-between ground allowed, and that's exactly what the objective seems to be.

       And why SHOULD we care about this? Easy. It's because we are trying to get an agreement with them. We want to be in this kind of position: "Hey Powers! We will stop talking about 9/11 if you will cancel Student Loan debts - which we voted to do by Sanders - because ... lives mean more than truth! And throw a bunch of pharmaceuticals under the bus while you're at it! Oh, and while you're at it, we want Hollywood to fire everyone and re-hire based on skill, merit, and true art.

       The same thing happened to Zero Hedge which has always been a place to get great information on economics and geopolitics. That is until the MSM realized that nobody was listening to them and they decided along with .Gov to name certain independent outlets as purveyors of fake news for example RT, zerohedge and a few others. This is when they began their campaign of infiltrating the comment section of anywhere that has actual information and making it a place filled with hate and ignorance. Now mind you there were always a few our ducks out there in the comment section spewing their venom but this is on a whole nother scale.
