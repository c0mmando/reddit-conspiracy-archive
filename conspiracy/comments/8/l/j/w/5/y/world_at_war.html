<p>Absolutely. Different language, food, crime, ways of living(when&#39;s the last time you saw Americans live 3 generations in one house?), more kids, accept shittier wages, etc. Just about everything.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>None of us consider Spanish people White, though some can certainly look it and some certainly don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Mexican culture is also heavily influenced by Aztec and Indian cultures.</p>

<p>Hey, I wish that wasn&#39;t the case, but take freedom of speech for instance: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2k9DlVn">https://imgur.com/a/2k9DlVn</a>. That&#39;s a big difference on what someone like me deems a foundation of America. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s check our average IQ scores, shall we: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UvQTF2t">https://imgur.com/a/UvQTF2t</a>. Quite a big difference there and differences play an even bigger role at the most extreme ends.</p>

<p>America is also a much more advantaged and richer country than Mexico is and those differences are causing problems like illegal immigration and companies hiring illegals over citizens.</p>

<p>Mexico has a much bigger gang problem than we do. Mexico also has much younger ages of consent and the average Mexican person has a lot more kids than the average US person does - <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Countriesbyfertilityrate.svg/1200px-Countriesbyfertilityrate.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Countriesbyfertilityrate.svg/1200px-Countriesbyfertilityrate.svg.png</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m white and I think it&#39;s perfectly natural to want the majority of your country to remain the same ethnicity and culture as you. My girlfriend is Mexican and isn&#39;t even a US citizen. I hold no ill will towards hispanics and actual love their culture.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I talk about these topics. I talk to her family about these topics as well. None of them would like to see Mexico have a 51% Chinese population. Nobody in China wants to see China have a 51% Mexican population. This is just natural.</p>

<p>America&#39;s changing demographics aren&#39;t the end of the world to me. I actually get bored sometimed when I&#39;m in Mexico because of a lack of any diversity whatsoever. </p>

<p>What is tragic to me is the changing face of Europe. People should not need to worry about their culture fading away and it should not be considered racist to want Europe to remain white.</p>

<p>Also, the hispanic argument of &quot;they work the jobs we don&#39;t want&quot; is true yes. The problem is many of these jobs(i.e. being a cook in the back a pizza shop) is only possible because the bosses are paying them $5 an hour (on the east coast). Undocumented people add so much to our economy but I&#39;m interested to see what would happen if these businesses were told they suddenly have to be paying $8/hour to these workers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s great, but it&#39;s not how countries work. There is no designated race or culture for a country, simply what it&#39;s people and government support and allow. America (and Europe) have never been &quot;White&quot; countries, and their policies do not show that either.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly how many countries work. A country is simply made up of imaginary boundaries and a culture designated by it&#39;s citizens/government. You saying a country doesn&#39;t designate a culture is like saying a restaurant doesn&#39;t determine the type of food it sells via it&#39;s menu. Excuse me but what&#39;s a country without it&#39;s culture or people? It&#39;d just be an uninhabited piece of land which doesn&#39;t meet the definition of a &#39;country&#39;. You&#39;d have made more sense if you didn&#39;t use the word &quot;country&quot;. As much as you hate it the majority of countries wish to remain homogeneous and many actively fight to remain that way.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/YHZRBzf-9pc">Poland</a> flat out has laws in place to keep it a homogeneous nation and it&#39;s citizens couldn&#39;t agree more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbfHr_soYrs">Japan</a> accepts .2% of it&#39;s asylum requests for a reason. Taro Aso famously declared in 2005 that Japan was a nation of one race.</p>

<p>There&#39;s too many examples to mention but you&#39;re clearly confused between &#39;a country is not limited to one culture&#39; and &#39;a piece of land SHOULD not be limited to one culture&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Europe&#39;s not a country and yes it&#39;s a white continent. This isn&#39;t up for debate because it&#39;s not based on your opinion. It&#39;s based on the fact that the vast majority of people in Europe would be listed as Caucasian/White in the US and the rest of the world. I guess America was &quot;never&quot; a white country even when it held slaves and had horrible laws for anyone who wasn&#39;t white either right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like if ww3 happens it’s going to be of biblical proportion. I’m not religious in the traditional sense but I do find the Bible interesting. For example, in revelations it says an army of 200 million is going to come so the MIC/Israel have quite a bit more recruiting to do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, we are maneuvered into position for a WW3.  Ukraine, Iran, North Korea, Israel, or Venezuela can be the spark.  BUT.....</p>

<p>We have been closer to the brink of World WAR III several times in the past: the Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis, the Failed summit of Reagan/Gorbachev etc. etc.  </p>

<p>I have been awaiting outbreak since 1979.  This does not even seem to be much of a prelude.  </p>

<p>TL/DR: it is just you.  Please try to relax.</p>
