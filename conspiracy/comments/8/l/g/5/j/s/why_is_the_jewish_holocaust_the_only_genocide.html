    <div class="md"><p>Saying no one died there is ridiculous.  They were forced labor camps, and even though the &quot;death by lots of pesticides&quot; angle is ludicrous, there were some fairly rough conditions.  And near the end of the war most of them were left to starve.  A few hundred thousand of them died from it, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the point to be made is that they were not extermination camps, per se, but rather forced labor camps.  Lots of people died under horrible conditions, but the narrative that the Jews were being deliberately exterminated is false.</p>

<p>It may be possible, however, that the Freemasons were being exterminated. That&#39;s an interesting twist I just came upon recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best why I could figure is the holocaust to a point but not the degree we were taught and it wasn’t systematic genocide. More of labor prison camps with less than terrible quality. So people died was it really six million Jews? Probably not. But did the Zionist’s seize the opportunity to inflate fact to fiction in order to obtain homebase Israel froma UN pity party? Possibly. Take into account the ferrying of certain nazi doctors and military personnel to American soil and Argentina and the whole thing gets fuzzy, plus the CIA was incontact with hitler who also managed to flee to Argentina, or Venezuela? </p>

But yes, they went to hell when first the civilian society collapsed, followed by the collapse of the State.

    <div class="md"><p>Careful. This is the real read pill. Taking this red pill is the end of naivete. After this one, you will just be left questioning everything, because if this wasn&#39;t true, then what the hell is? And my personal opinion, after years of research... I feel very confident in saying that it is a massive exaggeration, and in many points an outright fabrication. Essentially atrocity propaganda to cover up for the fact that the financial bloc of England, France, USA aggressively declared war on Central Europe, invaded, firebombed everything in sight, all to spread their market over the whole European continent. </p>

<p>The European Economic Community, the initial shell of the European Union, was founded in 1951, 6 years after the end of the war. That&#39;s no coincidence. That war was waged to found a European empire. An opponent controlled that space, and had an economy that was productive enough that it did not rely on England, France, USA. This was also the reason behind World War 1. Another war aggressively declared by England, as the first actor. Just like World War 2. As a bonus we destroyed the Japanese empire. All of this was Machiavellian, from every side. They try to frame our massive, aggressive offensive against an entire continent as a humanitarian mission. </p>

<p>When you see that most of Britain&#39;s military action against Germany in World War 2 was not directed against military targets at all... that changes things. The RAF just firebombed whole civilian cities. When you see footage of Germany at the end of World War 2, even all the civilian buildings are blown apart. We utterly razed a first world country to the ground, because their leader would not join our financial bubble. You can&#39;t justify a story of yourselves as the good guys moving into the future after an incident like that. Their PR geniuses have used the Holocaust as our saving grace, the thing that makes the fact that we went all the way across an ocean, and invaded a foreign country of first world people and utterly destroyed anyone and everything in sight, a moral action. We can still be the Red, White and Blue, even after all that, as long as we are the good guys, right? </p>

<p>You&#39;ll see all the evidence, though. The fact that 6 million is a meme dating back to the turn of the century. That even though 4 million of the 6 million deaths were supposed to be at Auschwitz, and even though the Auschwitz deaths have been revised down to 1 million, the 6 million number hasn&#39;t dropped down to 3 million. 6 million is a magical number, a meme. You&#39;ll see that even though all the way back in the 1930s, when gas chambers were already hermetically sealed chambers with ship steel doors, and a big handwheel, the German gas chambers were just rooms, with wooden doors. Two inch gaps between the door and the floor. No proper ventilation. The guards would have gassed themselves. You&#39;ll see that the original claims included Jewish fat and skin being turned into soap and lampshades, which even the official story relents on today. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll see that the camps had brothels, soccer fields, musical instruments, etc. I&#39;m not trying to portray them as a Sandals resort or anything, the point is that, in an industrial death camp, these would not be there. It was an internment camp, a forced labor camp where Jews, gypsies, Slavs, and other &quot;undesirables&quot; were interned as slave labor essentially, for the war effort. Once again, not trying to defend this, I&#39;m just trying to say what I believe is the real truth. You&#39;ll see that every single camp that is accused of being a &quot;death camp&quot;, and not just an internment camp, was on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the Iron Curtain, in Soviet territory. Beyond the eyes of the West, including the Allied powers and the Red Cross. The Allies and the Red Cross both surveyed every camp that fell within Allied territory, which was most of them, and they were cleared of any chance of them being &quot;death camps&quot;. All we know about the Holocaust is on the Soviet&#39;s word. </p>

<p>This is usually the part where people say, &quot;But the pictures, the bodies, the shaved heads, what about those?&quot;. We got firsthand access to these camps for the first time in 1945. We had utterly destroyed Germany&#39;s civilian infrastructure much earlier than that. The country lay in ruins. There were no more deliveries, no more functioning society. These people were locked in what essentially were prisons, that had run out of food supplies, run out of medicine. There was a massive typhus epidemic, spread by lice, which means that everyone had their heads shaved, and had to be deloused. Which is the source of the gassing legend.  These people starved, died of thirst, died of typhus and sickness, while locked in prison, as the country they were imprisoned by had been utterly destroyed. A tragic end, but not the one described to us by history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple, as we are talking maximum capacity we can ignore breakdowns, shift change, etc. We don&#39;t know much detail besides they were operating 24/7 most of the time.</p>

<p>The crematorium had forty-six retorts, each with the capacity for three to five persons. The burning in a retort lasted about half an hour. It took an hour a day to clean them out. Thus it was theoretically possible to cremate about 12,000 corpses in twenty four hours or 4,380,000 a year.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s the maximum capacity and it was more likely less due to exterior influences. But that&#39;s still up to 4.38 million a year cremated.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s your turn to show how it&#39;s impossible. What numbers did you derive that convinces you that. How much is possible?</p>

I don&#39;t know how you seem to <em>know</em> they were operating 24/7, but I do know that it doesn&#39;t take 30 minutes to cremate five bodies. It takes around 3 hours to cremate one body alone. Also, which crematorium are you talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is <strong>maximum</strong> capacity. You missed my premble. Witnesses did state they were operating around the clock. However there were breakdowns and Crematorium I was shut down in Auschwitz for instance.</p>

<p>This simply shows it was possible to burn that many bodies.</p>

<p>It also does not take 3 hours to cremate one body. Today&#39;s crematorium takes under an hour and a half to fully cremate and clean the furnance for the next body. Witnesses at the Auschwitz trials stated they let the bodies finish burning in the ash tray and used the bodies as additional fuel. The witnesses said 25 minutes a body, even less than I used.</p>

<p>Now your turn, where is your math?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fat can be used as a fuel. Theres actually been cases of modern day crematoriums catching on fire from obese cremations.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s compare modern crematoriums. They burn one body at a time and get cleaned every time. That&#39;s heating up, burning the body, cooling down, and cleaning. Most take 1.5 hours with some efficient ones down to an hour per process. Meanwhile you have a constant fire with nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As in Treblinka, the stoking gangs sorted out the bodies into combustibility categories: strong men, women, children, and Musselmans. The SS staff had performed earlier experiments to find ways to economize on fuel – with the help of Topf and Sons, civilian experts:
In the course of these experiments corpses were selected according to different criteria and the cremated. Thus the corpses of two Musselmans were cremated together with those of two children or the bodies of two well-nourished men together with that of an emaciated woman, each load consisting of three, or sometimes, four bodies. Members of these groups were especially interested in the amount of coke required to burn corpses of any particular category, and in the time it took to cremate them. During these macabre experiments different kinds of coke were used and the results carefully recorded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, all corpses were divided into the above-mentioned categories, the criterion being the amount of coke required to reduce them to ashes. Thus it was decreed that the most economical and fuel-saving procedure would be to burn the bodies of a well-nourished man and an emaciated woman, or vice versa, together with that of a child, because, as the experiments had established, in this combination, once they had caught fire, the dead would continue to burn without any further coke being required.[41]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Henryk Tauber, a member of a Sonderkommando who worked in several of Birkenau’s gas chambers, stated after the war: “We worked in two shifts, a day shift and a night shift. On average, we incinerated 2,500 bodies a day.”[4] Tauber also described how the muffles were filled with multiple bodies:</p>

<p>The procedure was to put the first body with the feet towards the muffle, back down and face up. Then a second body was placed on top, again face up, but head towards the muffle . . . We had to work fast, for the bodies put in first soon started to burn, and their arms and legs rose up. If we were slow, it was difficult to charge the second part of bodies . . .</p>

<p>We burned the bodies of children with those of adults. First we put in two adults, then as many children as the muffle could contain. It was sometimes as many as five or six. We used this procedure so that the bodies of children would not be placed directly on the grid bars, which were relatively far apart. In this way we prevented the children from falling through into the ash bin. Women’s bodies burned much better and more quickly than those of men. For this reason, when a charge was burning badly, we would introduce a woman’s body to accelerate the combustion.[5]</p>

<p>Generally speaking, we burned four or five bodies at a time in one muffle, but sometimes we charged a greater number of bodies. It was possible to charge up to eight ‘Muselmanns.’[6]</p>

<p>Filip Müller, also a member of a Sonderkommando that cremated bodies, confirmed the process of multiple cremations in his memoirs. The bodies were sorted according to their combustibility: for the bodies of the well-nourished were to help burn the emaciated. Under the direction of the Kapos, the bearers began sorting the dead into four stacks. The largest consisted mainly of strong men, the next in size were women, then came children, and lastly a stack of dead Mussulmans, emaciated and nothing but skin and bones. This technique was called ‘express work,’ a designation thought up by the Kommandoführers and originating from experiments carried out in crematorium 5 in the autumn of 1943. The purpose of these experiments was to find a way of saving coke [coal] . . . Thus the bodies of two Mussulmans were cremated together with those of two children or the bodies of two well-nourished men together with that of an emaciated woman, each load consisting of three, or sometimes, four bodies.[7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany reclaimed land and peoples that all of Europe generally agreed was rightfully theirs, and whose population was largely German and wished to be a part of Germany. The Saar, Austria, Sudentenland, Bohemia/Moravia as protectorates, this was all done without firing a shot. Danzig was a german city and had always belonged to Germany. Hitlers terms to Poland were extremely modest in early &#39;39. Hitler wanted an Alliance with Poland and wanted to work together to solve the issue of Danzig (and its German population striving to return to Germany). He wanted an Alliance with Poland to form a bullwork against what was always his most sworn enemy, the Bolsheviks to the east. This is all well known documented information. Hitler never wanted war with all of Europe, quite the contrary, he wanted to save it from what was happening to the East. </p>

<p>The whole &#39;we would all be speaking German right now&#39; thing is so far removed from reality it makes me question everything I&#39;ve ever learned in &#39;history&#39; class. Wars are never black and white, good and evil. If you are told the mightiest war of all time was the ONLY war of Good vs Evil, you should be questioning the shit out of that. Look up Rudolf Hess, why Germany let the Allies go at Dunkirk, What the European continent thought of Versaille a decade after signature, the effects of Comintern burning through Germanny and Europe, the tidal wave of mass murder next door to Germany during the Russian Revolution, the Havarra Transfer Agreement, on and on. Not saying &#39;Germany was actually the good guys&#39;, but I am saying 8th grade history class teaches you NOTHING about WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Czechoslovakia was a fake country created in the post WWI plundering the victors partook in.Half its inhabitants wanted out from under its rule. Half of CZ was Czech, the other half a mish mash of repressed minorities that included Germans, Hungarians, Slovaks, Ruthenians and Poles who were never given the option of &#39;self determination&#39; that was said to be the foundation of Versailles. For two decades after Versaille petitions were made by these minorities to the League of Nations to get out from under Czech rule. Czech leadership was a racist fraud that oppressed half its population. HN Brailsford (google him) said of Versailles that the &quot;worst offence was the subjection of over 3 million Germans to Czrech rule.&quot; Hungary and Poland also took bites out of &#39;Czechoslovakia&#39; around this time (ie reclaimed their people and land)</p>

<p>European statesmen at the time, generally, did not see much of an issue here. Again, Germany wanted to unite Germans. Why fight WWII over that? Real answer is deeeeeeeeeep down the rabbit hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you loose a war your people are often slaughtered. France and Britain declared war on Germany. Germany could not win a war without securing iron through Norway, or a way around the Maginot line through Belgium, and so on. Faulting a country for preemptively securing strategic means of surviving an ongoing war is ludicrous. Asking Germany to let her enemies come to them is akin to asking them to not play to their strengths, allow the enemy to play to theirs, all with tens of millions of your peoples lives on the line, is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>Honestly dude, I know I&#39;m just some guy on the internet, but many many books, even mainstream NYT bestsellers, frame WWII as &#39;unnecessary&#39;. Britain&#39;s war guarantee to Poland, a country every bit as anti-democratic and anti-semetic and thuggish as &#39;30s Germany, was the greatest blunder of the 20th century. Churchill is the greatest war hawk in modern history. He would be remembered far far differently if his side lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Poland independence was never at risk. Germany wanted Danzig back and a highway, something all statesmen at the time thought modest of Hitler. Germany also wanted an alliance with Poland to fend off the Russians. There were never plans to claim all of Poland as part of the Reich. This narrative of Germany wanting to enslave all Non-Germans is wholly false  </p>

<p>2) Britain&#39;s backing amounted to no tangible benefit for the defense of Poland. Brits were not fighting side by side with Poles against the invading Nazis and the country knew they had no means of helping Poland if Germans were to invade. Poland was used, a gambit employed by the real decision makers.</p>

<p>3) The anti semetic, anti democratic thugs who ran poland at the time were looked down on by most all of western Europe. Emboldening them and encouraging military risk-taking over diplomacy is not in the interest of peace. Applauding yourself for &#39;protecting the little guy&#39; while you risk world war is extremely idiotic. Disney movies are not realpolitik.</p>

<p>4)  Hindsight being 20/20, and knowing how history played out after, how can an argument be made that the War guarantee was the right decision? What decision could have been worse? 60 million dead. All so that Poland could swing its dick around for a few months before its four decades as a Soviet satellite. Didn&#39;t hear much from the French or British then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Poland was invaded after several episodes of border skirmishes and reports of persecution of ethnic Germans in Poland. Hitler complained of &#39;intolerable provocations&#39; to Churchill. Ofcourse the narrative the allies have written since call all of this fake and state there were no killings of Germans by Poles. A lot of smoke and mirrors now, &#39;false flags&#39;, Germans dressed as Poles dressed as Germans, etc. But the murder of ethnic Germans within Poland is a provocation and I believe there is good historical evidence that suggests that occurred. In the book &quot;Hitler&quot;, the Nazi terms to Poland, pre-invasion, were characterized as &quot;a proposal of extreme moderation. It was in fact an offer that no Allied statesman could have rejected in good faith&quot;. How do you reconcile Poland acting in bad faith? Finding reports of the butchering of ethnic Germans at the hands of a Poland clearly acting in bad faith, refusing overtures of an allience, I just don&#39;t view that as unreasonable.</p>

<p>2) Agreed. Britain had no means to support Poland. Poland was used.</p>

<p>3) Of course the characteristics of the nation you are risking world war for should matter. I&#39;ve already discussed Austria and CZ in this thread. Germans reclaiming Germans was done without firing a shot. If Germans were given the same self determination allowance everybody else was at Versaille they would not have to be reclaimed to begin with.</p>

<p>4) You are looking at this like its a childs movie - &quot;Somebody should defend Poland from the Bully! Who is noble enough?&quot;. That is not a representation of the dynamics present at this time. Im kinda done with this conversation, I don&#39;t think you have explored the gray areas of this conflict. The Polish War Guarantee cannot be viewed as a success. It cannot be viewed as sound diplomacy. </p>

It smells rotten to me. I just don&#39;t believe the Good vs Evil narrative, and &#39;unprovoked aggression toward brave little Poland&#39; is at the foundation of it. </p></li>

<li>Did you even read the first sentence of that article? &quot;The Gleiwitz incident (German: Überfall auf den Sender Gleiwitz; Polish: Prowokacja gliwicka) was a covert Nazi German attack on the German radio station Sender Gleiwitz on the night of 31 August 1939 (today Gliwice, Poland), widely regarded as a deceitful false flag operation staged along with some two dozen similar German incidents on the eve of the invasion of Poland leading up to World War II in Europe.&quot;</li>

<p>It clearly states that it was the germans who did it to themselves to spark a war.</p>

<p>And regarding Bromberg. Do you really find it surprising that there would be action taken against people belong to the nation that just invaded your country?</p>

I think the mainstream history of WWII is untruthful and product of conspiracy to accomplish certain commercial and governmental pursuits by certain groups of people.

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what I thought for a very long time. It turns out that I had just never been taught history as it actually happened. And that history has been very much suppressed for a reason.</p>

<p>In short: the invasion of Poland was due to the persecution of ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor. The Danzig Corridor was German territory full of German people, but was handed over to Poland through the unjust Treaty of Versailles. Jewish-Bolshevik terror gangs ethnically cleansed both Prussian Poland and German border towns as well. Look up &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; for an example that miraculously hasn&#39;t been erased from the Orwellian history books.</p>

<p>I am not sure if this is true, but it wouldn&#39;t at all surprise me given that Hitler made numerous sensible proposals before the invasion; which include: demilitarization of the key port areas, public referendum, accepting Gdynia as a Polish port city on the Baltic Sea, 1 km wide rail &amp; road passages to link Eastern Prussia to Germany, or to link Poland to the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>After the 3 week German-Polish War ends in victory for the Germans, Hitler declared:</p>

<p>&quot;I attempted to find a tolerable solution. I submitted this attempt to the Polish rulers. You know these proposals. They were more than moderate. I do not know what mental condition the Polish Government was in when it refused these proposals. As an answer, Poland gave the order for the first mobilization, and my request to the Polish Foreign Minister to visit me to discuss these questions was refused. Instead of going to Berlin, he went to London.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Poland knew that England had their back for sure.</p>

<p>uJst three days before the actual outbreak of what was to become World War II, Britain agrees to come to the Poland&#39;s assistance in the event of a conflict with Germany. (Anglo Polish Military Alliance) This unnecessary deal emboldened the Polish and Jewish militias who want the West to wage war upon Germany. To force Hitler&#39;s hand, terrorists begin murdering German civilians in large numbers. A British ex-Pat named William Joyce described the events:</p>

<p>&quot;On the nights of August 25 to August 31 inclusive, there occurred, besides innumerable attacks on civilians of German blood, 44 perfectly authenticated acts of armed violence against German official persons and property. These incidents took place either on the border or inside German territory.</p>

<p>On the night of August 31, a band of Polish desperadoes actually occupied the German Broadcasting Station at Gleiwitz. Now it was clear that unless German troops marched at once, not a man, woman or child of German blood within the Polish territory could reasonably expect to avoid persecution and slaughter.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t be historically honest to say that Hitler &quot;invaded&quot; these neighboring countries. The Treaty of Versailles sliced off huge parts of Germany on all sides and gave them to its neighbors. People forget this, but Hitler was democratically elected, and he essentially ran on &quot;Make Germany Great Again&quot;, and part of his platform was that he would bring back Germany&#39;s rightful borders This included bringing back all ethnic Germans and German speakers back into Germany, who had found the border crossing them, when the borders changed. </p>

<p>Most of the places that Hitler &quot;invaded&quot;, like Austria and Czechoslovakia, were done with the consent of territory being absorbed. These were places that would rather live in Germany, than as a tiny border minority in another country, when they had grown up in Germany, but the border moved past them. As for Poland, which triggered the declaration of war by England and France against Germany, that was still a defensive action.</p>

<p>The Polish Communist government was purposefully trying to goad Hitler into action. They knew that he would not ignore violence against the ethnic Germans just past the border, in Poland. They started terrorizing the Germans in Poland, and Hitler spent months trying to negotiate. But the Poles were intransigent and confident, knowing that they were backed by England, France, and the USSR. These traitorous Polish Communists betrayed Poland, and the ethnic Poles, by using their country as bait between superpowers for another group&#39;s interest. </p>

<p>So Hitler went in, saved the ethnic Germans, and redrew the border again to include all classical German territory. Was this worth England and France and the USA fighting World War 2 over? You be the judge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Pole I feel very strange about all of this. In the whole Holohoax battle I find myself sitting in between, in the no man&#39;s land. I mean over the two decades after communism fell, our gov aimed to educate kids and teens about the WWII as best and as close to truth as possible. Today every Pole knows that the Red Army &amp; NKWD exterminated almost all of our officers and elites (inteligentsia) in Katyn and other places in Russia. We know so many Poles died in German death camps alongside some (?) jews, our schools often took us to educational trips to those camps, to Auschwitz for example. This is knowledge served officially in school books. Approved by highest college historians, gov officials and WWII veterans, people who fought in the AK and various uprisings, even the Warsaw one, which was a total bloodshed.</p>

<p>And some of the holocaust deniers are trying to tell me that I&#39;ve been lied to? By all of those old people, those vets? That there were NO camps (yet I saw them!), so no Poles died in them. How can this be? So were are those people now? Their remains and so on. It&#39;s easy to say something is a lie, but then you should feel somewhat responsible to answer the big question that you leave behind, to fill that empty hole in history.</p>

<p>And now we also have Jews trying to blame Poles for the holocaust, and establish this as common knowledge. World is fucking crazy man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with you, u/cannedbrains. My family were Polish and were displaced because of WWII. I grew up listening to the accounts of my grandparents and their friends  attest to the fact this atrocity happened, and not just for Jews, but Catholics, homosexuals, all manner of Slavic people, gypsies and political prisoners, sadly many of whom have now died. One of which was separated from his family and forced onto those trains. I believe them not only because I knew them from birth and I trusted them anyway, but because they had no reason to lie. No one forced them to say these things to serve some political agenda, what they witnessed is the truth. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t believe is conspiracy loving arse contrarians on the internet trying to look as though they&#39;re far more intelligent than the rest of us because they can see through some imaginary lie.</p>

<p>The Holocaust wasn&#39;t just about gassing people, it refers to the systematic murder of Jews by any method by the Nazi&#39;s before and during the war, so any &#39;math&#39; you attempt to do to evidence to yourselves that they couldn&#39;t kill that many people in the camps is invalid. They starved ghettos full of people and shot hundreds of thousands across Europe. The reason the number keeps going up is because more accounts or bodies come to light.</p>

<p>I&#39;m usually down for most conspiracies, but this one is beyond ridiculous, and what&#39;s worse its dangerous: desensitising people from this makes it all too easy to miss the signs of it happening again.</p>

<p>One final thing, its funny that 50 years ago no one would have mentioned this as a conspiracy, but now that the generation that witnessed it have mostly died its being queried. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this is the biggest redpill ever (not believing the holocaust). Even if you talk about slave camps (as the poster two messages above you mentioned) where Jews were led to, as opposed to being gassed, that is still an atrocious predicament for any people.</p>

<p>I do definitely think that the current Zionists leadership,  especially the leadership of Israel, is using the horrible things that happened to the Jews as a reason for their own horrible warmongering policies, basically using the suffering of the Jews as a pity card to do whatever they want in the Middle East - however that doesn&#39;t mean that the Nazis didn&#39;t systematically exterminate and lock up the Jewish folk, as well as others. As a Slav mysely I can tell you that my ancestors were not spared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is saying that there were no camps, or that no Poles died in camps. Our claim is that the camps were forced slave labor internment camps, where &quot;undesirables&quot; were brought and used for the war effort.

<p>Also, it&#39;s worth noting that the camps you&#39;ve seen have been rebuilt and recreated from the ground up.

    <div class="md"><p>TIL: My grandfather put on an Oscar-worthy performance. </p>

<p>He never really spoke of his &quot;alleged&quot; experience as a Survivor to me, or even to my mom.  In his seventies, he reluctantly agreed to an interview with the foundation raising funds for the Holocaust Museum in DC (Jews needing money. Go figure.). </p>

<p>He really had his &quot;story&quot; down, and his &quot;acting&quot; was incredible.  All those dramatic pauses and nervous laughter.  For someone assigned with promoting a hoax, he was surprisingly hesitant to provide the gory details.  Almost as if, even after all those years, somethings were still too horrific to discuss. But it&#39;s all a hoax, right?</p>

<p>He eventually provided some details involving stealing potatoes to stay alive, moving dead bodies, and finding others who had committed suicide. As he told it, &quot;big, strong guys&quot; that he was certain would out live him, but just couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  Pretty weird, considering all the amenities offered, huh?   </p>

<p>As impressive as his acting was, my grandmother deserves even more respect.  She NEVER spoke a word of what &quot;allegedly&quot; happened to her.  Maybe some stories from the ghettos, prior to transfer to the &quot;alleged deaths camp,&quot; but beyond that, I never heard it mentioned in her presence.  I always figured she experienced unimaginable horrors at Auschwitz, but this &quot;red pill&quot; let&#39;s me know she was just really committed to the bit. </p>

<p>But what about my great grandparents? Some real characters.  Especially, my grandmother&#39;s father.  You see, she was only half Jewish, and could have probably found a way out of this altogether.  Instead, she chose to stick with her Jewish father.  How did he repay her? He was last seen entering Auschwitz.  He disappeared altogether! What a rascal, right?  My grandfather&#39;s father also managed that same disappearing act. A pretty tough &quot;red pill&quot; swallow. Anyway, let&#39;s get back to these fun conspiracies!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your commitment to insufferable sarcasm was... interesting. I never said these people weren&#39;t in camps. I said that they all died horribly and tragically. The conspiracy is that they weren&#39;t systematically gassed to death, but that they were slave laborers in wartime internment camps. Which your two grandparents prove, given that they were alive to have your parents. You don&#39;t randomly live through an extermination camp. The claim is that people were gassed within 15 minutes over of arrival. </p>

<p>Many &quot;Holocaust survivors&quot; spent months or even years in those camps. And they didn&#39;t get gassed.... why? They didn&#39;t get ovened or executed why? Have you ever stopped to think about the fact that it&#39;s a little weird, a little contradictory, that you have two grandparents that were both in a genocidal extermination camp, and somehow lived to look you in the eyes? They were slave laborers, and the those bigger, stronger men than your grandfather died tragically, it&#39;s awful. But remember, &quot;they just couldn&#39;t take it anymore&quot;. They succumbed to the work, to the typhus, to starvation, who knows. But by your own description, they couldn&#39;t hold out any longer. That&#39;s very different than getting the industrial gas at a genocide factory. </p>

<p>You&#39;d communicate a lot better with people, as a side note, if you tried to debate in good faith, rather than putting on an elaborate display of sarcasm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you admit that your grandfather &quot;never really spoke of his experience&quot;, and that even while interviewed, &quot;was surprisingly hesitant to provide the gory details&quot;. Then you say that your grandmother &quot;NEVER spoke a word about what &#39;allegedly&#39; happened to her&quot;, except stories about parts of the war that no one disputes. Not a very convincing personal anecdote, up against mountains of evidence that they were labor camps not genocide camps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Soviets and the Allies were complicit with each other, although they weren&#39;t technically part of the same financial bloc. But New York bankers, particularly Schiff, funded Trotsky and the Russian revolution. Patton wanted to continue East and destroy the Soviets after the war, but the Western powers had already struck a deal with them. They waited months before the final offensive, so that the Allies and the Soviets could meet in the middle of Berlin at the same time. </p>

<p>On why the Soviets would lie? They had a Blood feud with National Socialist Germany. The Soviets were Jewish controlled, and obviously the Nazis weren&#39;t so friendly to Jews. It was personal, between these two countries. </p>

Sure we all - or most of us at least - but we&#39;ll never get there because of this type of thing. Racism and exclusion are never really looked down upon as much when they come from a minority group. I mean, ask yourself, really, how would you feel about an organization called White Business Men of America? How about one called the Black Business Men of America? Your answer is obviously going to be your own, but I know if I heard the latter spoken on TV in the background, I&#39;d probably go on typing. If I heard the first I&#39;m going to look up, because I know shit&#39;s about to go down. But do I agree with the formation of either organization... Well, that&#39;s something I suppose I need to think further on; personal freedoms vs. social advancement, all that jazz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Red Cross never issued such a statistic, nor has it offered any estimate of the number of victims who perished in the camps. In its bulletin of February 1, 1978, the Red Cross declared that it had never compiled, much less published such statistics.</p>

<p>The 300,000 figure was actually taken from the Swiss paper, &quot;Die Tat,&quot; in 1955. This estimate, however, was only a figure for the number of Germans who perished in the concentration camps. No mention of any Red Cross figures, however, was ever made by the paper.</p>

<p>Despite the obvious deception, Holocaust deniers, continue to peddle it, hoping that few people will actually check the sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The document does not list &quot;the total death toll&quot; in the concentration camps. What it shows is the number of surviving identifiable death records from each camp - that is, cases where the Nazis wrote down the full details of the death, including the name of the person killed, and preserved those records so they survived to be captured by the Allies after the war. </p>

<p>About 95% of the deaths in the camps were not recorded in such detail — or if they ever were, the Nazis destroyed those records before the war ended. When you&#39;re murdering a batch of 700 women and children at a time, are you really going to go among them first asking them their names and dates of birth, and carefully typing them out in a long, detailed report? Of course not. That would be inefficient and time-consuming; and it might remind you that your victims were actually human beings. </p>

<p>With the current conspiracy theories that I&#39;ve heard, I don&#39;t believe the Holocaust was a hoax.  These theories aren&#39;t exactly secret and I&#39;ve heard a bunch and the bunch I&#39;ve heard have perfectly reasonable explanations.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the thread, I have asked respectful questions in good faith, and I&#39;ve never asked for a source, I&#39;ve never brushed off an assertion, and I&#39;m earnestly interested in these theories (that I don&#39;t believe).</p>

<p>A question I&#39;ve asked was about the human soap and the human lampshades.  Do you have an answer for that?  I recently read Slaughterhouse 5 and they mentioned candles made from humans.</p>

<p>Like, I understand how you <em>can</em> make soap from.humans and how it&#39;s... efficient to do that, but how do we know it never happened?  Was there like artifact soap in some museum that someone tested and it was cow fat or whatever?</p>

<p>Auschwitz was 15.44 square miles, according to Google.  If it was a perfect square, that&#39;s nearly 4 miles a side.  It would take an average person two hours to walk from one end of the camp to the other.</p>

Is it unreasonable to think that a concentration camp a fourth the size of Manhattan with the purpose of exterminating people on an industrial scale could kill and dispose of 600 people a day?

<p>I think that David Irving had a court case and he said that the crematorium didn&#39;t have the capacity to kill that many even if it were working 24/7. They revised it and said &quot;oh but it was the russians that got it wrong&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I googled &#39;how many concentration camps were there&#39;s it gave me 980 concentration camps that operated between 1933 and 1945.  Apparently there were 40,000 camps total, including slave camps and pow camps and the like.</p>

<p>Over the course of 13 years, ignoring leap days, 980 camps would have to kill x people per day in order to genocide 11 million people.  Solve for x.</p>

<p>11,000,000/(13x365)= 2,318.2 people per day across 980 camps is 3 per day, more or less.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t remember where he got the ~75 camps number which would get us to 30 per day.</p>

<p>Now, 2,318 people per day works out to 289 people per death camp (where&#39;d you land on 8?) which still isn&#39;t that hard to believe, if you are in the business of killing as many people as possible.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;y listened to the Freedman Speech I linked above, you should do so.     </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not sure what your link does to say Germany invaded Poland in 33...I mean, Hitler JUST got elected in January of 33, and still didnt have full control over the military.       </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get your math or time frame that makes you think the official Holo story is even remotely legit. Its like, &quot; Sure, it could have happened if X, Y and Z happened&quot;    but X, Y and Z didnt happen sooo...      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not start with an amount of year like you. 13 years is also wrong because there were not even one concentration camp in 1933, 1933 was the year Hitler took power. The earliest date we could arguably use is the Reichskristallnacht at the end of 1938, the latest is 1941 with the opening of Chelmno.</p>

<p>But as I said I did not start with a number of years but with a number of death camps or extermination camps. Those are eight camps are Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka, Belzec, Chelmno, Sobibor, Majdanek, Maly Trostinets and Sajmiste. This are the camps with planned executions the other were concentration camps not extermination camps. </p>

<p>Now before I used your number of 11 million (6 million jews, 5 million non-jews) other sources state that out of the 6 million jews about 4 million died in extermination camps, 2 million in other ways like small shootings or starvation. Wikipedia states that only  3,115,000-3,215,000 (jews and non-jews) died in extermination camps. We have no exact number.</p>

<p>3,215,000 / (8*30*365) = 36,7 (years)</p>

<p>But all this math is quite unrelevant because the number of death in each camp and each day is different. The United State Holocaust Memorial Museum also states over 3 million death in extermination camps but is speaking about jew not jews and non-jews. It also states that that the hight (however long that was) they killed up to 6,000 jews each day in Auschwitz-Birkenau alone.</p>

<p>My whole point is that 30 people per camp per day is very low.</p>

<p>&quot;The reason why Britain didn’t declare war on the Soviet Union is an intriguing one. Unknown to the general public there was a ‘secret protocol’ to the 1939 Anglo-Polish treaty that specifically limited the British obligation to protect Poland to ‘aggression’ from Germany.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clear evidence it is not.  There are serious holes in it including the fact that the designated de little using chambers (that also used zyklon b). Have more residue than the supposed gas chambers. </p>

<p>Whilst not scientific I have stood over those gas chambers and even before I looked into the holocaust question something just didn’t feel right. Having been to a mass murder site you can feel the heavyness in the air. It just wasn’t there at austwitz. A sorrowful place without a doubt, a place of suffering, starvation is what I got mostly there. </p>

<p>There are just serious holes in it. For instance just take Ann frank an emaciated 14 year old with typhoid. Evacuated to Belsen Bergen rather than gassed, her family died of typhoid not gassed. The Schindler women who were at austwitz for months all released including old women and children (not like the film it wasn’t an immediate turnaround). </p>

<p>These are facts we have that are absolute. What we only have for gassing is some witnesses that say that’s what happened. No actual evidence believe it or not. And Germans were meticulous record keepers. Still no evidence what so ever in the records. And summon b was 90% accounted for in de lousing chambers according to the records. And why use zyklon b in the first place when the Germans had much better poisons. </p>

<p>What I find disturbing is that it takes away from the real suffering of millions and turns a lot of deaths into a political chess peice which is disturbing.  The truth is the truth and people deserve to investigate the truth. </p>

<p>And yes it was because it didn’t make sense to me. Not just a feeling but the positions of the chambers. The absolute miles of factories that needed a huge workforce. The fact that Schindler women were not gassed. The fact that the Germans openly shot and hung dead bodies from tee wire yet felt the need to hide the gas chamber. </p>

<p>Why hide them ? It’s not as if the fellow inmates would g notice hundreds of people missing when they were gassed ?  Why not document the gassing along with the shootings they were both just as illegal and henios. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope ?  No there isn’t hope. When the suffering of people is used for political gain. It seems that questioning the gas chambers makes you a monster. It doesn’t. Using the deaths of millions for political gain is.  Ignoring the suffering through starvation and illness for a more political death of the gas chambers is sickening.
I can show you photo after photo after photo after photo of mounds and mass graves of emaciated dead bodies, starved and skeletal. These people died of starvation. A horrific way to go. </p>

<p>People said ? It needs more than people said to show that millions of people were gassed to death. There just would be so so much more evidence. There is not. </p>

<p>This is an attempt to obfuscate with spurious information. 6 million Jews were estimated to have died in the Holocaust in total. Not even the gas chambers. So, I don&#39;t know where you got 1 million from?</p>

<p>Rudolf Höss used his time in prison to write his memoirs. He felt he was treated so well be the Poles who captured him (despite how cruelly they Nazis treated the Poles) that he decided to come clean with his confession. He stated very clearly that they used gas chambers to gas people to death. In his own hands, he wrote this. And no, it wasn&#39;t a British or American conspiracy. He confessed this to the Polish.</p>

<p>Many years ago <strong>Oskar Groening</strong>  a former guard at Auschwitz also confessed to being there &quot;on the ramp&quot; when people were being gassed to death.  He repeated his confession again in court very recently.  At 90+ years he was already an old man who had lived his life in full and had no reason to lie. He specifically said he decided to tell the truth when he saw that the younger generation was denying it happened, and he didn&#39;t want them to make the same mistakes they made.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/auschwitz-guard-germany-holocaust-history-world-war/">https://www.politico.eu/article/auschwitz-guard-germany-holocaust-history-world-war/</a></p>

<p>If you really want to find evidence you will. But if you&#39;re already swayed by revisionist and Neo-Nazi theories then, of course, you&#39;ll look for what you can find to support that.</p>

<p>The reason why we some policing re what people say is that there is genuine evil in this world. Humans are not perfect. There are revisionists who want to rewrite history and erase wrongs done in the past for whatever political agendas. There are a lot of positives with the advent of the internet but one downside is that now that everyone can now air their views via social media we can see that there are a lot of crazy, unhinged, people in society who appear normal. The internet brings out the worst in people. They say things they would never ever say in real life in front of other people. So some policing is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there in lies the problem. 6 million Jews you don’t know where I got 11 million from ? What the fuck has Jews got to do with anything. They better than the other five million that are meant to have died ?  They a superior race ?  A more important death statistic. </p>

<p>It’s been hijacked by the Jews to make it an only Jew thing hence questioning the so called facts makes you anti semitic. It’s a human tragedy not just a Jewish one </p>

<p>As for six million or 11 million.  I take it you are aware the numbers didn’t change after the soviets had to admit the four million they suggested died at austwitz were rounded down to 1.1 million. Those figures include people that died on the death march from Budapest. </p>

<p>And since the next supposedly biggest death camp was treblinka at 500k I still struggle to see where 11 million adds up to even with the inflated figures of a million killed by the einzatzgruppen </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe what you want to believe. An epiphany I had after the ME is that life policies itself because humans cannot catch every evil that can destroy this reality if everyone does it.  If policing this reality was down to humans alone, this world would be loooong gone. For example, most evil things happen in private and the perpetrators go to meticulous lengths to hide their crime, but they still eventually come unstuck. Life must balance itself to keep this reality going if not, humans would destroy it.</p>

<p><em>Anything that threatens the integrity of this reality eventually fails.</em></p>

<p>That’s why Hitler lost! His grand plan was to exterminate the entire Russian population so that Germans can have &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. He was trying to play God and he lost. He was always gonna lose. The involvement of Britain in that war is the hand of God at play. And no, I&#39;m not religious at all. I use God as a metaphor for <em>Life</em>.</p>

<p>I’m British. I live in London. Of course, Britain, USA and Russia won the war. Regarding our empire, I’m happy we’re no longer exploiting other people in faraway lands. We helped to civilise people, but our job was already done by the 1960s.  Anything more was just exploitation that would have developed into an apartheid system like how South Africa became. That was the epitome of evil.</p>

<p>We gave others their independence just as we would have wanted if we were the ones being colonised. If you don&#39;t agree with this then your level of consciousness is very low. But that&#39;s OK because you’ll get nowhere with that and you&#39;ll eventually wake up after much suffering. Especially in this new reality where Karma is much faster. Whenever you go against life, ALL life, you pay the price one way or another. And in ways you may not even be aware of. Germany paid a huge price when they tried that nonsense. Their country was pretty much razed to the ground and till this day they can never raise an army again to do what they did in WWII. So, who really lost?</p>

Let’s not forget the atrocities committed by Uncle Stalin our Allie in defeating the Germans. Atrocities are fine when it suits us not fine when it serves a political purpose, so let’s all get off the morale high ground.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should go read up on how Stalin died. He lay there for days with a stroke and was left to die alone. The inner circle probably secretly wanted him to die. He must have suffered greatly before he died. Maybe he was paying for the evil things he did?</p>

<p>However, Stalin played a very important role in saving the Russian population from a very powerful evil force. Russia absolutely needed someone like Stalin to match up to Hitler and the onslaught from the Nazis, so I believe his presence at that time in history was an act of divine intervention. 170 million people could have perished without the uncompromising hand of Stalin as Hitler advanced and made it very clear it was a war of annihilation.  He wanted to erase the Russian people from that land. They had <em>no choice</em> but to defeat Hitler or else they were ALL doomed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that he was an evil man and didn&#39;t have to kill so many people for political reasons. He was already killing people before WWII. However, that does not negate the fact that someone like him was needed to defeat Hitler. The Russians with the little technology they had then needed a leader who could match Hitler at that same level of brutality.  Sometimes we have paradoxes in life that we just have to accept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said eradicate whole populations like Hitler set out to do. Remember the siege of Leningrad? Hitler&#39;s generals wanted to take the city but Hitler said no that they don&#39;t need the people in the city so they should seal it off let them all starve to death.</p>

<p>To know the difference between Stalin and Hitler look at what Stalin did with he defeated Hitler. After a long hard battle of untold atrocities by the Germans, he wasn&#39;t packing German women and children into barns and burning them alive (as the Germans did in Ukraine). He rebuilt Germany. He lifted the people back up again. Anyway, I&#39;ve said I have to say about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I’m really not trying to have an argument or appear to stick up for the fact that one atrocity is more excusable than another. But this is the point. We are blinded by what we are told and what we have been fed in propaganda the truth is not easy to see. It’s not right to massacre millions of civilians. We can all agree on this. Be it Jews or peasants. But I can’t see that standing by Stalin whilst admonishing hitler is anything but blatant hypocrisy on the part of the allies, and failing to find a real reason to justify the blood shed, over hyped the holocaust.   </p>

<p>today to question the holocaust must mean I’m some kind of swastika toting nazi ready to build fourth reich.  That is propaganda. When we cannot question what we are told we are not free people with a free speech. So whilst I may not agree with you.  I agree with your right to speak what ever opinions you please.

<p>So keep complaining like a little bitch until you wake up. What happened to the legacy of your hero Adolf Hitler? <em>God has reversed everything he did in Germany in trying to exterminate minorities.</em> There are more Turks in Germany now than there were Jews. Everything Hitler did and (all the Germans he killed in the process) was all for nothing. <strong>At the end of the day, God runs the show</strong>  And you can complain all you want like a little bitch.

<p>&quot;The Tribunal shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence […]. The Tribunal shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but shall take judicial notice thereof […]” (Articles 19 and 21 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal).&quot;</p>

<p>Moreover, the victors’ justice violated the usages of normal justice in ignoring the separation of powers (some of those who took part in the drafting of the Charter went on to become judges and prosecutors), instituting collective responsibility (any member of a group declared “criminal” was automatically considered a criminal himself), implementing retroactivity of laws and denying those convicted any possibility of appeal. No representatives of the neutral nations were among the judges and prosecutors.</p>

<p>And of course, there is a great deal of evidence that the testimony was coerced through threats and torture. All in all, it was a total kangaroo court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big eye-opener for me was Joseph Goebbel&#39;s diaries. Was he living on a different planet- he had no clue about the Hungarian Jews. According to the official narrative the deportation of the Hungarian Jews began on April 29, 1944 when a train load of Jews were sent to Birkenau. In ten short weeks 400,000 were alleged gassed there.</p>

<p>Apr 18, 1944 (II.12.44)
The Führer then explained to the Gauleiters the background of his campaign in Hungary, and how it was designed. He gave an amusing description of his talk with Horthy. He had to use strong-arm tactics because the old man was not comfortable with the necessary measures. The Führer left him in no doubt, that either it would be a fight to the death or that he had to submit. The Führer had so many forces to apply to this campaign that Horthy offered no serious resistance. In particular, the Führer expected contributions from Hungary of food, oil, manganese, and people. In particular, he wants the 700,000 Jews in Hungary involved in beneficial activities for our war effort.</p>

<p>Apr 27, 1944 (II.12.199)
300,000 Hungarian Jews have been detained and imprisoned in the concentration camps. They should come, in large part, to Germany as a workforce. Himmler will take care of this; above all, they are to be used for our difficult war production programs.</p>

<p>May 4, 1944 (II.12.232)
Our plenipotentiary in Hungary, Veesenmayer, gives an excellent speech on the decisive Hungarian factors. …In particular, it’s to his credit that the Hungarian potential is now in large part requisitioned for our war efforts. Also, the Jewish Question is now being handled more energetically. I insist that the measures taken against the Jews in Hungary have a factual basis. It’s not enough that one only announces in the press what happens, but one must also explain it. In Budapest the Jews are starting to be gathered into ghettos. The ghettos are built in the vicinity of the armament factories, because air attacks are likely there. It is hoped thereby to avoid British-American attacks on Budapest, if at all possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because a good deal of it is a self-serving lie that was <em>originally made to protect the Soviets</em>.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why only the <em>Soviet “liberated” camps were “death camps”</em>?  Because the Soviets did not come upon all the dirty, starving prisoners and try to <em>help</em> them like the US and European Allies did... no, the Soviets themselves were starving and undersupplied and life was <em>very cheap</em> in Soviet Russia (for a visceral example, watch “Enemy at the Gates”).  When the Soviet advance came across all the poor wretches needing food and medical care thy they couldn’t even provide to their own soldiers, they did the “convenient” thing:  they killed all the prisoners in the camps, piled up the bodies, and burned them so they could continue to press into Germany.  They took some pictures and to avoid their own blame, they created the idea of “death camps” and blamed <em>their own atrocities on the Nazis</em>.  </p>

<p>Hell, it was an easy enough scapegoat.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say the Nazis were not evil, they had <em>their own plans for the Jews</em> but it wasn’t to waste resources exterminating them!</p>

<p>Ever wonder why Hitler talked of expelling the Jews and how he (correctly) called Soviet Bolshevism a Jewish controlled system?  Ever wonder why he kept moving the camps further East?</p>

<p>Because, if the Nazis has <em>successfully</em> taken Stalingrad (they never meant to actually hold it, just sack it and end the Soviet offensive), Hitler was going to <em>dump all of the Jews right into Stalingrad as a form of weapon.  When the Soviets returned to try to rebuild, they would have been swamped with millions of starving and dead or dying souls filling the remains of the city with disease and rot and preventing *any</em> quick attempt to rebuild or resume an attack!</p>

<p>Imagine what 6 million starving refugees would do to any attempt to rebuild a burned out, sacked city when your nation is already terribly undersupplied!</p>

<p>That was the reason.  </p>

<p>only genocide where laws are in place to make it illegal to dissent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People in the comments section are really getting sidetracked by details. Nobody has stopped and thought about the answer to the question posed by the headline.</p>

<p>OP is not even asking what the details were or if history has been revised. He&#39;s asking &quot;why is there a need for laws to protect the established version of history?&quot;</p>

<p>Imo there are two possibilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a bunch of people tear the Holocaust narrative apart and say that it&#39;s fake... you pave the way towards a repeat occurrence. I&#39;m not sure if this is a valid reason for censorship because it assumes that such censorship has a protective value and that it will be effective in it&#39;s purpose. There&#39;s also the question of whether or not &quot;acceptable&quot; censorship sets a harmful precedent.</p></li>
<li><p>The second possibility is that the Holocaust narrative is hugely beneficial to some people. The idea being that keeping the narrative as it is helps to ensure some kind of long term sympathy for the victims... and by extension, anyone from the same ethnic/religious group. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s been almost 75 years since the end of WWII. So, to me, it seems like the second explanation is the more likely one. You&#39;ve got a group of people who weren&#39;t even born when the Holocaust happened. But nobody is allowed to criticize them or call them out when they do something bad because (no questions allowed!!!) there still the victims and if we don&#39;t give them whatever they want, it could lead to another Holocaust.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not calling history into question. But I am going to question why a certain part of history keeps coming up and be used for purely political effect. I question why anyone who points this out gets unfairly labelled. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes no sense. Honestly why ban one and not all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It totally makes sense. Someone likes the official narrative and they intend to keep milking it for all it&#39;s worth for as long as they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no laws saying &quot;give Jews whatever they want because of the holocaust.&quot; Given it&#39;s been 75 years, &quot;because the holocaust&quot; is not a very effective rhetorical strategy for anything. The laws in certain Western nations against denying the holocaust are there because fascist and anti-Semitic movements in those countries, which at one point were the perpetrators of the holocaust, could be expected to deny its reality. This becomes even more insidious now that there are few living witnesses to the thing. Even at the time the Generals of the Allied powers made an attempt to thoroughly document everything because they knew people would come to doubt the reality of what had happened -- in part because the scope was so unimaginably huge and cruel. </p>

<p>Western nations have their own self interested reasons for supporting Israel. There&#39;s plenty of room for conspiracy there without denying the reality of the holocaust. </p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of room for conspiracy there without denying the reality of the holocaust.</p>

<p>I said they&#39;re milking it for sympathy and for political effect. That&#39;s completely different than saying it didn&#39;t happen. But don&#39;t worry. In a few more years I probably won&#39;t be allowed to say this either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t necessarily an indictment of you or your comment. People up and down this thread are denying that the holocaust happened, that there were death camps, that the SS were executing thousands of Jews and other undesirables by machine gun or mobile gas vans. </p>

<p>Saying Israel exploits the holocaust for sympathy is one thing, and perfectly fine. Denying that it happened at all, as goes on frequently on this subreddit, is pretty abhorrent in my view. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an American and think it should be legal to question anything you want, though I understand why some Western European nations have decided otherwise. It is admittedly frustrating to have the conversation over and over with people who deny mountains of evidence (the photos and documents are all faked, the confessions were got under torture, etc.). To them I&#39;d ask where all the people who disappeared went? The numbers we&#39;ve arrived at aren&#39;t arbitrary -- they are connected to names, birth records, etc. </p>

<p>It brings up a good question though -- how do you prove beyond a doubt something that happened 75 years ago? No amount of evidence seems to be effective. </p>

For me the problem is that the legislators can ban certain topics out of the public discussion: now is the genocide but once you open the door to ban free speech they just need to find a good excuse to limit the free speech elsewhere. Living in Europe half of you can say is potentially illegal and now with the anti Fake News law they will limit also what we can read/watch.

<li>They&#39;re trying to conceal the weakness of the gas-chamber arguments because that&#39;s what makes the killing of Jews different from tens of millions of others killed in WWII and hence what makes reparations justifiable -- though paid to a country (Israel) that didn&#39;t exist at the time.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>They exist because a lot of stupid assholes think the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen. It did. Those laws are there to make sure that racist morons  can&#39;t revise history. </p>

<p>Because revising history creates problems. And fucking assholes with ties to people that committed atrocities in the past ALWAYS want to revise history. Poland, France and some other countries in Europe have legal systems in place that enable them to ban fucktwads from lying about the awful shit their grandparents and great grandparents did. Good for them. Revising the past makes it easier for twisted shithards to do bad stuff in the present. </p>

<p>America does not have a legal system that enables it to put a legal muzzle on our inbred haters.  Our backwards hicks have a God given right to lie about the hateful shit their pappies did way back when. The only thing stopping them from doing this is our media. This pisses them off to no end but it works, for the most part. </p>

<p>That said, nyway: if America politicians had the legal wherewithal to nip the lost cause myth in the bud in the late 1800s it mighta saved us a lot of headaches later on. That shit is still fucking with us. </p>

<p>Yes, the Germans kept meticulous records. Millions of documents were collated and archived by the Allies after the war, and they still exist in various archives. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>admitting to how it was done</p>

<p>Absolutely false. There is no known contemporaneous Nazi document (ie letter, note, order, invoice, map, diagram etc) attesting to the existence of &quot;death camps&quot;, or a &quot;final solution&quot; involving human gas chambers, or the mass incineration of bodies that constitute the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/holocaust">&quot;holocaust&quot;.</a>  </p>

<p>Bearing in mind the fact that the Germans did (as you say) keep meticulous records, this does not support the holocaust narrative at all - quite the opposite. The holocaust narrative is based entirely on &quot;survivor testimony&quot; and forced confessions from captured Nazi officers.</p>

<p>&#39;Holocaust&#39; literally means &quot;Burning  Sacrifice&quot;, while the &quot;sacrifice&quot; is debatable, the &quot;burning&quot; didn&#39;t take place ... apparently, there&#39;s no gas chamber in existence.</p>

<p>Furthermore,  Israel wasn&#39;t created due to &quot;Holocaust&quot; because Zionism started long before even WW1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess this is a difficult concept for you, but the persecution and killings of ethnic Germans happened before and shortly after the invasion, and the invasion put a stop to it. Far more people were killed before the invasion than they were at Bromberg, shortly after the invasion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please show me where Poland invaded Germany. I&#39;ll wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my previous comment I described how Poland invaded Lithuania and Czechoslovakia. I&#39;m not surprised that you weren&#39;t aware of that, but I literally told you about it just above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This took all of five minutes to find. From the source:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the British only cared about protecting Poland from Germany, not from Russia. Almost like they only cared about fighting Germany, and not Russia! That literally confirms what I&#39;ve been saying.</p>

<p>It claimed that after Poland, Hitler offered a truce and even drew up a map of Poland that gave most of it back, annexing only parts that originally belongs to Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure if this is true, but it wouldn&#39;t at all surprise me given that Hitler made numerous sensible proposals before the invasion; which include: demilitarization of the key port areas, public referendum, accepting Gdynia as a Polish port city on the Baltic Sea, 1 km wide rail &amp; road passages to link Eastern Prussia to Germany, or to link Poland to the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>After the 3 week German-Polish War ends in victory for the Germans, Hitler declared:</p>

<p>&quot;I attempted to find a tolerable solution. I submitted this attempt to the Polish rulers. You know these proposals. They were more than moderate. I do not know what mental condition the Polish Government was in when it refused these proposals. As an answer, Poland gave the order for the first mobilization, and my request to the Polish Foreign Minister to visit me to discuss these questions was refused. Instead of going to Berlin, he went to London.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no laws saying &quot;give Jews whatever they want because of the holocaust.&quot; Given it&#39;s been 75 years, &quot;because the holocaust&quot; is not a very effective rhetorical strategy for anything. The laws in certain Western nations against denying the holocaust are there because fascist and anti-Semitic movements in those countries, which at one point were the perpetrators of the holocaust, could be expected to deny its reality. This becomes even more insidious now that there are few living witnesses to the thing. Even at the time the Generals of the Allied powers made an attempt to thoroughly document everything because they knew people would come to doubt the reality of what had happened -- in part because the scope was so unimaginably huge and cruel. </p>

<p>Western nations have their own self interested reasons for supporting Israel. There&#39;s plenty of room for conspiracy there without denying the reality of the holocaust. </p>

But unfortunately (according to the article I linked in the edit to my first comment) it sounds more like they rounded up every German within even remote proximity to where an atrocity/massacre had occured. Then proceeded to torture the shit out of them, using any means necessary to extract a false confession, including literally crushing and permanently destroying their testicles... driving one 18 year old kid to commit suicide as he declared he could not force himself to tell their lies.</p>

<p>Just a little bit beyond a swift kick to the Nazi-nuts.. :/</p>
