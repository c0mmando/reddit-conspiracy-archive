    <div class="md"><p>No. I&#39;m not playing this bullshit fuckin&#39; game with some of you (you give me the green light - while others ban me for it). I&#39;ve been saying/pointing out (in one way or another) this shit for years now. Nothing changes, and y&#39;all don&#39;t listen. I&#39;m better off pissing into the fuckin&#39; wind, tbh. </p>

<p>People need to know, though... there is an active agenda to turn this place into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> 2.0. I&#39;ve said it, and that&#39;s it. You know it&#39;s the truth, as do a few other mods. You know exactly who I&#39;m talking about. Merely mentioning their bitch ass names, will get me banned (how many times now?). </p>

<p>This sub has cancer and it&#39;s STAT level IV. Hiding under the guise of the &quot;free flow of information&quot;. Give me a fuckin&#39; break. </p>

<p>You&#39;re so torn up? Here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEFxfVyz4Uc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEFxfVyz4Uc</a>.</p>

<p>How many posts and comments have I posted/contributed here? How much have I contributed? How much have I tried? How many times have I been banned? How much have I been attacked? How fuckin&#39; much? I&#39;m still here, though.</p>

<p>I contemplated sending this as a PM (response to yours), but, no... The Community needs to see this shit. Let&#39;s see if you and ya&#39;ll hold up to what you say... </p>

<p>I say this because I have been indirectly threatened by someone in a position of power for speaking out against Flat Earth on this sub.  That is what this has degraded into people afraid to talk because saying the wrong thing will get them banned.</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t post links to said comments because the rules don&#39;t allow it.</p>

<p>If you and the other mods want an open discussion change the rules so it is possible and remove anyone in a position of power who abuses their authority.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it is only a /conspiracy problem, but votes are being heavily tampered with, thereby controlling what people see and read. </p>

<p>You pretty much prove my point Mastigia - It shouldn&#39;t be nessesary for a moderator to give &quot;carte blanche&quot; to someone for telling the truth..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Annnnnd thank you for providing the second go-to narrative! &quot;This is a conspiracy sub, why are you all government boot-lickers that trust the establishment!?!?!&quot;</p>

<p>First of all, a large majority do not blindly &quot;follow behind the president&quot;. Just because people call the media out on their bull shit attempts to de-legitimize him, doesn&#39;t make them &quot;followers&quot;.</p>

<p>When a presidential candidate wins on a campaign of getting rid of DC corruption (which unquestionably includes the MSM), are you seriously that surprised that a conspiracy sub is willing to give him a chance?? You think just because he won, we will all of a sudden trust CNN and the Washington Post?? Get real!</p>

<p>Yet here you are, spouting the same bull shit that <em>they</em> have been trying to push here for nearly 2 years now. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get the upvotes, because that is precisely the purpose of vote brigading in the first place. Luckily more and more people are catching on to the fact that vote totals no longer matter in this sub, especially in any post that hits the FP.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a fair statement, though it&#39;s a bit of a false equivalency. It&#39;s a common pattern I&#39;ve noticed, that when you blatantly call out vote brigading on a post, the vote totals quickly balance themselves out to what you&#39;d expect them to be. After years of being a regular contributor here, it becomes very easy to see when posts are behaving abnormally, and vote totals are getting manipulated.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 2 years of him just adding to the DC corruption what has he done for me to believe he&#39;s any different than any president before him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m still not sure about him. One way he is absolutely different than any president before him, is that he is actually following through on campaign promises (despite what the media might tell you). It&#39;s still too early to tell if he&#39;s just a pied piper candidate, or if he legitimately made it past the gatekeepers and will enact some real change in DC corruption.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to stay skeptical, but to also not fall for the MSM non-stop hatred that they spew about him 24/7. The harder &quot;the establishment&quot; fight against him, the more likely I think he&#39;ll actually follow through on trying to &quot;drain the swamp&quot;. When top Democrats AND top Republicans, AND the MSM, AND all of Hollywood are fighting against him, it&#39;s time to rethink who the enemies really are.</p>

<p>I promise you, as someone who&#39;s been here for over 4 years straight, it becomes clear as day. My beliefs are more in line with this sub than the users I argue, yet the ones arguing mainstream talking points seem to always win out in threads like these. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair, but it&#39;s not just our conversation, it&#39;s almost every post of mine ITT. </p>

<p>And the way to tell which half is &quot;right&quot; is the half that has been the same for 6+ years now (I lurked for a few years before signing up). The beliefs and ideals held by <em>actual</em> conspiracy theorists in which this thread was founded on, has since become a mirror of subs like r/politics and r/news during the day. It&#39;s a consorted effot (backed by reddit admins) in order to try and control the narrative of any topic you can find on reddit. From corporate shilling, to political, to Hollywood and the movie industry... it&#39;s all completely rigged.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s most noticable here, is because a large majority of the time, the conspiracy angle on any topic almost always collides with the MSM narrative being pushed. So how do you control that? By doing exactly what they&#39;ve been doing for over 2 years now.</p>

<p>I can provide more info or examples if I&#39;m even making the tiniest bit of sense to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See right there. You just pushed a straight up propaganda narrative that I’ve been calling people out on all day. </p>

<p>You’re correct, for the last 6 years this sub hasn’t been pro-President. We’ve actually been rather anti-government. So when a presidential candidate runs (and wins) on a platform of “These people are all corrupt. I’m not a politician. I’ll drain the swamp.”, what part of that surprises you that he’s the candidate that many in the conspiracy community support??</p>

<p>A large majority of the users I see here defend Trump do so in a much more logical choice, thoughtful, and reasonable manner than the people who come here to shit on him. If anything, the “blind supporting” is far more evident when you look at the anti-Trump crowd, that does nothing but parrot unverified MSM talking points that they haven’t even fact checked themselves. </p>

<p>The only slap in the face to conspiracy theorists is when people come here from r/news or r/politics, and try to push whatever bull shit story is currently “breaking” at CNN. Or when those same people come in here and try to call ME a shill government bootlicking Russian troll bot. </p>

<p>When a presidential candidate wins on a campaign of getting rid of DC corruption (which unquestionably includes the MSM), are you seriously that surprised that a conspiracy sub is willing to give him a chance??</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a year, what actions has the administration taken that you feel have lessened corruption?</p>

<p>On the other hand it is hard for an informed person to honestly say that htey can&#39;t think of anything the current administration has done that doesn&#39;t at <em>least</em> have an appearance of corruption (taxpayer funding of maro-lago visits, cabinet nepotism, foreign payments to Trump hotels, opaque Trump finances, etc.)... </p>

<p>Following through on other campaign promises (taxes, TPP, moving the embassy, etc.) leads me to believe that his other promises (term limits, campaign finance reform, &quot;draining the swamp&quot;) are still very much a possibility. The fact that the establishment is doing absolutely anything and everything they can to try and convince the world that we need to impeach him NOW also makes me think that he&#39;s legitimately throwing a wrench into the corrupted machine known as DC politics.</p>

<p>So &quot;informed person&quot; to you means someone who watches the MSM every day and reads the Washington Post? Every single little trivial misdeed of his becomes a BREAKING NEWS OMG SCANDAL, yet they never said shit about Obama doing the same (and even worse in some cases).</p>

<p>I&#39;m still erring on the side of &quot;he probably won&#39;t drain shit&quot;, but I&#39;m also not jumping on the &quot;anti-Trump at all costs&quot; bandwagon that the MSM and establishment VERY CLEARLY are doing everything they can to get people on. The fact that this doesn&#39;t raise any red flags to you, must mean that you still &quot;trust&quot; the MSM, which means you are far from &quot;informed&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the examples. This is kind of a grey example though, as the majority of the highly public Republican investigations (Benghazi, etc) did seem politically motivated at the end. </p>

<p>She&#39;s definitely not a &#39;clean&#39; politician, she has so many ties to backroom deals, connections at the highest levels of corporations and countries, and the political motive to accomplish power hungry goals, but at the same time, it&#39;s hard to nail down such a slippery person. She testified multiple times for dozens of hours before congress and still they couldn&#39;t pin her down.</p>

<p>So the other guy interpreted it as purely political motivated investigations, I think a more apt definition would be it started in something real but turned political because she was so slippery. Pretty similar to Cheney and Gitmo related affairs. Something was horribly wrong, approved from the top, but only underlings were punished.</p>

<p>Anyway, not defending her, just saying she appears &#39;clean&#39; to some due to slipperiness. </p>

<p>What would that prove?  You would simply go into <em>flat Earth mode</em> and say the images are CGI.</p>

<p>Tell you what setup a new account and play devils advocate in the appropriate subs and see what happens.  That way you can yourself gather the evidence you need.</p>

<p>I doubt you will do this as you know what will happen and you aren&#39;t willing to admit that to yourself, much less admit it to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol so true. It is happening though, with stories of the DOJ, Clinton, and Lynch and others being under investigation yesterday by republicans. Its like, hello that&#39;s just a news story. Yes, it vindicates conspiracy theorists who said there was foul play and it needed to be investigated, and yes it relates to us but, its not a conspiracy that an investigation is in fact happening. Thats just simply, the news</p>

<p>This is massively representative of the influx of people we&#39;re getting, who aren&#39;t interested in conspiracies at all but rather mainstream news they can find anywhere else.

    <div class="md"><p>I think this speaks to the broader issue of how all news is editorial comments not actual news. See the news is just the facts what happened, the moment a reporter says something like &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I believe&quot; they are no longer simply giving you the news they are giving you the news and there personal thoughts about it. This situation sets up people to say it&#39;s bullshit or &quot;fake news&quot; because they don&#39;t share the same thoughts and ideas as the reporter. </p>

<p>This of course is all because we have like 50 24 hour news networks now and there are simply just not enough breaking stories to feed you just the facts. Then you bring in the panel so you don&#39;t have just some jackass and his opinion but 5 jackasses fighting about who has the best opinion. Like the entire broadcast news system forgot it&#39;s up to the viewer to establish there own ideas. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just stop you right there, because if this is the basis that you&#39;ve placed all your beliefs on, you&#39;re wrong. Anthony Weiner? A prominent Democrat leader and future presidential hopeful? The MSM didn&#39;t pull their punches on him, <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/pxo9ic/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-jon-stewart-press-conference">nor did Jon Stewart his former roomate.</a> (Is Hannity going to do that? I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath.) Hillary&#39;s many flaws were covered as well. She had a rough go of it because of her inability to connect with voters and it did look like she had a self-serving agenda. None of that was hidden in the MSM. </p>

<p>You literally made a gatekeeper statement based on both a false dichotomy and a projection. You can keep doing that tough guy from a movie act where you stiffen your jaw and bold your text all you want. I don&#39;t give a shit.

<p>I don&#39;t post content that supports one political party and down vote content that criticizes it, but I&#39;m also not stupid and it&#39;s just unfortunate that reality has a liberal, concrete bias and it just so happens that Republicans are circling the fucking wagons because there are a shit ton of them caught up in this. Michel Cohen is still a financial advisor for the RNC. Please go on with your <strong>bullshit, gatekeeper.</strong></p>

<p>A statement based off <em>your own words</em> and those of the person you responded to:</p>

<p>&quot;When it was regular news about anything validating their point of view, they never had a problem with it. Now there are a bunch of gatekeepers of real news here and it&#39;s a very narrow scope of biased reporting.&quot;</p>

<p>No, YOU have a liberal bias, and you are continually trying to excuse it and get away with the same things you accuse others of doing.</p>

<p>Again.... nice fucking projection and whataboutism. Hillary would be far more beholden to staying on the path by her party and the Democrat base than Trump. If she got caught up in any of this shit (and believe me, HALF the base was suspicious of her to say the least, even if she won) the wagons would not circle for her. Bernie would&#39;ve called her out. Warren would&#39;ve called her out. She would have no protection for her corruption and Tim Kane would&#39;ve been president. That&#39;s how you slice this bullshit when BOTH candidates are giant pieces of shit. You don&#39;t feed the beast by handing the party of embracing and covering up corruption the most malleable little bitch to do their bidding.</p>

His former campaign manager is in deep shit and the current Senior advisor of the POTUS and Erik Fucking Prince were trying to set up a back channel to Russia.

This is part of the Russian government&#39;s effort to help Trump.&#39; At this point the campaign already knew Russia had been reaching out to offer dirt in the form of thousands of stolen emails damaging to Clinton. </p>

<p>And then Jr. agrees to the meeting, and then the meeting happens, and then DCLeaks and Wikileaks start releasing emails. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo.</p>

<p>I have been an obsessive Conspiracy Theorist since decades ago when watching reruns of Leonard Nimoy&#39;s &quot;In Search Of&quot; blew the doors of reality off my young teenage mind, and I hsve never before seen the floodgates of Conspiracy open like it is today.</p>

<p>It used to be you&#39;d have to dial-up and sift through obscure boards like alt.conspiracy, which were the only &quot;hot sheets&quot; of the era, and even then you had to do a lot of solo research following up leads and piecing together connections, the best of which only hinted that The Official Narrative wasn&#39;t The Truth at all.</p>

<p>Now you just look at the front page of the Fake News Grey Lady or BezPo and you are assaulted with dozens of conspiracies in plain sight disguised as ordinary &quot;news.&quot;</p>

<p>We are in a target rich environment now, where nothing is true and everything is permissable, if enough people repeat the lie.</p>

<p>What does it mean that the Overton Window has shifted, smashed, busted off its hinges, and is flapping in the wind, about to fall off at any moment?</p>

<p>I personally believe its the Zeitgeist telling us The End is Nigh, TSHTF any day now, the NWO OWG is on the verge of implosion, the Great Awakening is upon us, and total systemic collapse is imminent.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m loving every day of the frothing chaos. Why would I want to go back to the boring way things used to be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This forum is dedicated to discussing conspiracies, regardless of where they surface. &quot;Regular news&quot; has documented plenty of information relevant to conspiracy theorists in the past: the Washington Post covered the Snowden revelations, NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat">documented</a> how the sugar industry paid scientists to blame fat for heart disease and obesity, and Chris Hayes recently did a segment on his MSNBC program, accurately documenting Israeli atrocities against Palestinians, which other MSM outlets either downplayed or ignored.</p>

<p>We should embrace this, so long as we apply intellectual vigor to these sources and verify what they&#39;re reporting. For many &quot;normies,&quot;  a &quot;reliable&quot; (aka mainstream) news source is still required before they believe the information they&#39;re presented with. When we see actual good journalism that documents insidious conspiracies, we absolutely should share it here, even if it&#39;s from the &quot;MSM.&quot; It presents us with good discussion material, and it also gives us terrific evidence that we can marshal in discussion with those who doubt that conspiracies can exist.</p>
