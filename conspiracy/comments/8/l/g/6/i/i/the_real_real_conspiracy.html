We have governments governed by the people they intend to serve, and though we have many improvements to make in our societies, more people have more rights right now than ever before. There is no other moment in the history of mankind as prosperous and free as this one.</p>

<p>We have the power, both collectively and as individuals, to foster whatever destiny we want. We’re bound only by our self-imposed limits. And if you think you’re bound by anyone other than yourself to pursue choices in life, then you are deluded. Learned helplessness is a condition developed over time, and though it is inherently pernicious, it is also easily disrupted by those willing to take risks and challenge the world around them.</p>

<p>Believe in yourself, believe in fellow man, and stop this self-created, unintentional conspiracy against ourselves. Take hold of your government. Take hold of your life. Take hold of the entire universe.</p>

<p>There&#39;s theories that over the 4.5 billion years of earth&#39;s life, there&#39;s been many &quot;iterations&quot; if you will, of man or man&#39;s likeness.  If you look at time on a grander scale it&#39;s not that impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, even just in the last 300,000 years of homo sapiens there&#39;s likely been multiple rises and falls of civilization. The current &quot;scientific consensus&quot; is that human civilization only developed ~10,000 years ago (and that&#39;s a recent revision of dates), but considering that humanity, and the rest of the world for that matter, were coming out of the arse-end of a global cataclysmic event 10,000 years ago (younger dryas period: 12,800-11,600 years ago) then there&#39;s plenty of reason to suggest this isn&#39;t the first time, especially considering that for 290,000 years prior humans have had the exact same cognitive capability for intelligence as we do today.<br/>
According to the current official consensus, homo sapiens were hunter gatherers for 99.6% of the time we&#39;ve been here on earth, and then only very recently decided to establish some kind of civilization and advisory advance it in any way. That&#39;s a silly assumption in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy to entertain this thought, I find it quite pleasing, but to suggest it&#39;s anything but baseless speculation is as silly as the assumption that in the timespan involved there could not have been any advanced societies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, there&#39;s a fair bit of speculation, but there is a bit of evidence for ancient civilizations having advanced technical/scientific/spiritual knowledge, both in written literature and in physical architecture/ancient artifacts. For more information look into the work of Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson, and also you can check <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">/r/AlternativeHistory</a> for more.<br/>

Learn as much as you can about the things in life you want or care about, take that information and compare it to whatever your representatives are doing or not doing. Decide if you are happy with their performance. If not happy, vote him out office. If happy, vote him into office. If he is unelected, petition your elected representatives to do something on your behalf. None of this means you’ll get exactly what you want, probably ever. That’s how democracy works.</p>

<p>You know what doesn’t work? A democracy without educated voters. It only breeds bad policy diminishing civil liberties/rights.</p>

<p>Promoting individual freedoms really just means, to me, objecting to unconstitutional government action. For example, most people agree that the Patriot Act is unconstitutional in many of its surveillance provisions.  Most people object; however, idly objecting is insufficient to cause the government to comply with its own mandate. You must demand, ardently, for the things you hold most dear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A secrecy order bars the award of a patent, orders that the invention be kept secret, restricts the filing of foreign patents, and specifies procedures to prevent disclosure of ideas contained in the application. The only way an inventor can avoid the risk of such imposed secrecy is to forgo patent protection.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so while you&#39;re all jerking each other off without any justification to your position, why not enlighten us to how exactly the impoverished hold the key to prosperity? How exactly the hungry have a key to a bakery? The war torn a key to safety? How small of a bubble do you exist in that you think everyone with a significant hurdle in their existence can just lift up their bootstraps and overcome it? Do you have any idea how many people die in needless ways while billions of dollars are squandered creating more strife? </p>

<p>What &quot;technology&quot; do you speak of anyways? What is in existence now that has altered your life in any significant way in the last ten years that wasn&#39;t around in the last 20 or even 30? Are you amazed by a fast pressure cooker? Whooaa! A coffee maker that spews waste? Holy shit! It&#39;s largely consumer driven bullshit you think is amazing but is really a piece of under performing, ultimately frivolous piece of crap.

    <div class="md"><p>I just have to reply to you, even though I couldn’t get back here any sooner.</p>

<p>My point is not that the impoverished hold the key to prosperity, whatever that means. My point is that all people are more similar than they are different, and the more each person advocates for himself, the more effective democracy becomes. </p>

<p>Lots of people in this thread point to the really oppressed and subjugated people of the world as evidence that humanity isn’t as advanced as I claim. Well, we’re not perfect. We’ve got work to do, and the only way it can happen is through democratic processes. Through what other vehicle do you envision a more advanced society?</p>

<p>I’m not sure I understand your premise about instant telephone internet access. You do not believe that it is one the most important communication innovations in the history of mankind? Would poor people be better off without internet access?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wondeful post man, I agree. Many conspiracies exist, but they should not make us feel helpless. We still have massive control over our lives and destiny. Even on things we don&#39;t, lamenting about it won&#39;t help. Do your best and rise up, embrace life, then change what you can and allow the rest to be. If you wish to change the world, start with yourself, primarily your inner state, then expand outwards gradually, slowly, as best you can. Every little action, every smile, hug, shared message of awareness on an important issue, a message of inspiration, or any action you sincerely, fron your heart and intuition,  deem would make the world that little bit better, is a good step forward.</p>

<p>This sub can be very awake on various external issues happening in our society, but that brings with it the idea and poison of helplessness.  If we swallow that poison we are trapped, but if we drop it, we are free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, and I agree with you here too. </p>

<p>Every step forward is a step forward. Pretty simple stuff. I’m not sure why you’re downvotes. I think some people are scared to think about having so much power over themselves when their whole life has been limited by rules and boundaries. Kinda like caged animals being released into the wild after being taken care of by someone else. Even if that care was somewhat negligent, the animal would probably prefer the familiarity of the cage to the uncertainty of freedom.</p>
