        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, since diving into the conspiracy theory world a few years ago, I have dove hard. I am lucky enough to have a lot of free time to read and watch as many sources as I can find and while I still sometimes cry while thinking about all the direct and indirect victims of 9-11, it was pizzagate that really sent me over the edge. So many media sources paint pizzagate as a sort of all-encompassing, you-can&#39;t-get-to-the-top-without-doing-this-shit kind of scenario, and for a long time I believed it. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t NOT believe it, now, but I really want to know where I can draw the line. Surely all mega-famous people aren&#39;t worshiping the devil? But are they all involved in secret societies? What&#39;s the deal with all the fucking symbolism? Ugh. I want a path that will help me to understand the gray areas without thinking black-and-white that all famous people are evil pedophile murderers. It just doesn&#39;t feel quite correct. Any insights you could give me about your own experiences/peaks and valleys of belief would be helpful. Much love and peace.</p>

<p>To understand yourself and the world, we can&#39;t shy away from the hard truths, we must look them in their eye and understand them. By sticking our heads in the sand, we enable evil to operate ungoverned in the dark by not accepting it exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This knowledge has always been here for anyone that seeks it. Deeper truths are still laying in the silt, fallow, undisturbed.</p>

<p>I guess the real question is, &#39;is ignorance truly bliss?&#39;. I think it is, but the true answer to that question lies within the individual. If we discover these hard truths out of boredom or curiosity, but still have to exist in our lives, what use are they? Personally, I grew up in a bad situation so I never carried any false notion that the world is a good place populated by righteous people. It may be a harder pill to swallow for people that were raised to believe that the world is fundamentally &#39;good&#39; to learn that it is, in fact, much more complicated than &#39;good&#39; and &#39;evil&#39;.</p>

<p>IDK. It&#39;s completely up to you...pick these things up, leave them where they lay...pretty much everybody has their head in the sand when it comes to stuff like this, and they&#39;re doing okay, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &#39;essential&#39; to know these things. I learn about all these difficult things, but then I walk outside and everything is okay and the world is beautiful, and that doesn&#39;t cause any cognitive dissonance for me. It doesn&#39;t bother be that horrible people exist and are doing horrible things, because my life is beautiful. Feel me? You can take this knowledge and apply it to your own understanding of people, or you can just take it as some shit that happens somewhere else. Either way, the people that love you are still going to love you. You&#39;re still going to love them. It won&#39;t effect your capacity to be an understanding, empathetic individual. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all on you, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I have been able to get a start on reading some of what is posted on the Infrakshun blog. Are you the author of this blog? Its wide scope, references, and clarity of insight are very impressive. I particularly appreciate the section where the writer focuses on 9-11, as my belief and experience lead me to believe that event is the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; marker of the modern American situation. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone in that belief here. Thanks, either way, for sending me to the blog. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess its easier if you see the devil as a sort of drug dealer. These people progressively sell out their soul piece by piece to varying degrees. Until one day they&#39;re in way too deep and they no longer have the courage or conviction to break free or give up whatever carrot is being used to control them. Jobs, money, contacts, doors opening in certain halls of power etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that everyone graduates high school and is like &quot;wow I&#39;m gonna go do outrageous evil now!&quot;. This evil is used as a control mechanism to blackmail and keep people in check. In some sense its like a gang initiation where they force everyone take part in some heinous act like a gang rape or pointless murder so that they can claim &quot;Now we&#39;re all implicated, there is no turning back now, if one of us rats we all go down&quot;, therefore you have to be loyal to the group mentality or get hung out to dry.</p>

<p>Now just scale up for the gigantic clubs, societies, groups, and think tanks that populate DC, Hollywood, Silicon Valley etc.</p>
