<p>It&#39;s true, every new post will be downvoted within the first 5 minutes of posting regardless of quality or subject. This has been the case for at least a couple of years.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this sub has become so overwhelmed with shitposts, memes, junkspam, politics, video garbage, and all kinds of other debris that quite a few real members watch the new queue trying to stop the rubbish in its tracks and promote more meaningful conversations.</p>

<p>Hence my reply to your post -</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with the other reply to this, I’m not sure if the question was addressed. You absolutely don’t have to agree to participate. My take is its best to absorb what is offered, formulate your own opinion/perspective, and just be respectful when disagreeing in the comments if you feel it’s necessary to do so. Like the other guy said, be ready for downvotes when disagreeing on just about anything, but anyone who agrees with everything in this sub and takes it all as fact is foolish.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve definitely noticed the &quot;immediate downvote&quot; bots,  or WeverTF is going on here.  </p>

<p>It is a subtle yet powerful way of burying the organic posts here, because the first 10 votes applied to a post weigh more heavily (when it comes to climbing the ladder towards front page visibility) than the next 100, and those 100 weigh more heavily than the next 1000. </p>

<p>Getting downvoted excessively in the first hour can obliterate visibility, and it is easy to do if those immediate bot downvotes combine with outside brigade action. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also speculating that when manipulative MSM material is planted here by the usual suspects and skyrockets unnaturally to the top of r/conspiracy, it was achieved initially by that post being &quot;overlooked&quot; by those immediate downvote bots to allow it some serious &quot;ladder climbing&quot; legs, its then followed up with a person/bot brigade. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair enough</p>

<p>agreed the number one goal of the russians is division, they want to see america split up like the ussr was, and then they will finally be able to have an orgasm again without reservation, or something lol. </p>

<p>The gray area is a good point, there some forces just want chaos and the psychological data on users and so they are going to spam the full spectrum, see what shakes out.   The hand will not know it&#39;s talking to the other hand sometimes even.  </p>

<p>We individuals are truly in a maze, a foggy, mirrored labrynth of information where robots and governments are building the thing out before anyone else has a chance to.  </p>

<p>humans are once again like those gaul/celt wooden statues. people inside a giant imaginary structure of a person.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i enjoy trying to parse out what accounts seem  to be dishonest manipulators</p>

<p>i think it can be done with some sort of certainty by paying attention to how often they post, how consistent their views are, and finding inconsistencies with who they claim to be and what they push</p>

<p>for example, &#39;americans&#39; who say things like putin is a saint? very weird</p>

<p>i saw what happens when you actually go into it with them, you get excluded quickly.  they control so many accounts and you are just one person.  it&#39;s like certain words are camped out and posting those tags sets certain things in motion....</p>

<p>But then comes the question of what is value.</p>

<p>Reddit seemed to have good intentions at the beginning with a simple &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; upvote to coincide with if the comment was contributing to the discussion or not. Now, it&#39;s used as an emotional reaction.</p>

<p>And this algorithm only further proves manipulation. Also, isn&#39;t Reddit now &quot;Owned&quot; by advanced publications?</p>

<p>&quot;  It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which <strong>Sam Newhouse</strong> bought a controlling interest in 1922. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit needs to be dumpstersed completely.</p>

<p>The solution is to move to a platform that requires accounts to be purchased. A small amount per account, only a few dollars so it&#39;s not a barrier to entry for individual users. Accept crypto as payment so anonymity can be preserved. Use the money to pay for hosting so the site is never beholden to advertisers and is only about the exchange of information. </p>

<p>This one change would make it prohibitive for anyone to run or aquire an army of bots. It would have a huge knock-on benefit of enabling effective moderation, as people couldn&#39;t instantly and painlessly rereg and continue their griefing. </p>

<p>And, it&#39;s not just about the barrier to entry. It&#39;s about enforceability. If accounts are free, banning does nothing. Sure a company or state entity will drop $100k on bots.

<p>It&#39;s a it&#39;s not especially difficult to ferret out bots, especially with machine learning tools. If it were made a priority, and you figure out how to avoid playing whack-a-mole(which the registration fee accomplishes)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, anonymity is largely dead on the internet. Current surveillance tools coupled with the tracking of banking transactions would already unmask all but a tiny minority with extensive financial resources. Like I said in another thread within the past hour, why not make the current internet a non-private and multi-factor authenticated network, and then make public decentralized meshnets the private and anonymous option? Connect banking and social media to the non-private authenticated network, and connect anonymous IRC, 4chan, non-voting discussion boards to the private decentralized network, and get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m talking something you could do today, with a small team. Not a massive sweeping infrastructure-style change that would be difficult to get off the ground for huge reasons.</p>

<p>Privacy being hard to come by these days is a compelling argument for why we need a discussion forum where anonymity is assured to the highest degree possible. Otherwise paying for accounts will have a chilling effect on discussion. Complete, total privacy need not be assured to give the feeling of being able to have a candid discussion, which is the goal. It is the difference between knowing that nothing stands between your words and your identity, and knowing that there are as many roadblocks as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came her to say this! I posted a yahoo article yesterday claiming a kid from Santa Fe was shot in the head and played baseball the next day and I immediately got like 20-30 comments but could never get past 5 upvotes. It’s back to zero upvotes now. I also found it funny that the title on yahoo changed about hour after my post, might be a coincidence but I believe it’s the power we have as a group here. We can beat this. When I scroll the conspiracy subreddit now I usually switch from hot articles to new articles and browse that way. It makes a big difference. We can outsmart them. I’m sure we can come up with a way to beat the bots.</p>

<p>We could come up with some form of system where either people ( or individual computers at the time of manufacturer ) are assigned a private key in such a manner that it cannot be replicated (or even read ) by its owner ( i.e. hardware which is specifically designed to simply sign data with no access to the private key. ) Any system we come up with should be embedded in such a manner that any attempt at removal or replacement results in death or permanent hardware failure.</p>

<p>and then we keep a list of public keys which match said private keys, we can use this information for all sorts of identification from taxes, to online banking, to drivers licences, etc. </p>

<p>Now this has all sorts of horrible privacy issues since now anonymity is impossible, but it does solve the problem of bots. </p>
