       Just a recent thought I've been having, I first smoked weed in my early 20s and continued to regularly do so until I was 25.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't do any other altering substances, be it beer and liquor sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weed was my go to, to relax and think.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time I was 24 I decided to mushrooms, I did so and it was great, did it a handful of times and felt great after consuming them and exploring that side of psychedelics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I delved into MDMA which again was a very nice experience, especially doing it with mushrooms, it was very freeing to the body and mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I took the plunge and did LSD, way too much of it for the first time, but that is what changed me forever, the experience woke me up, I haven't done it since I was 24 and every time I smoke weed, I need to be careful or I'll have a acid flash back and remember all I have concluded from my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just my thoughts on why all 4 of these drugs are still schedule 1 in the United States and seen as a threat to society, because they're to tools to wake you up from the system that is using us.

       They are schedule 1 because they break you out of the enormous group think.  You stop being a mindless consumer learning only to gain knowledge in order to acquire more useless shit.  That is a very big no-no.

       Tricking people to isolate themselves has been a powerful tool.  Technology has been the icing on the cake.  Now you can order your fucking groceries from your couch while diabetes continues to ravage your body and you use comparative analysis to justify your existence on facehook.  Go back to sleep!

       Not OP, but have you see The Men Who Stare At Goats?

       It's based on a true story and seems to fit reality.

       Basically, a peaceful faction existed within the US military that wanted to spread the ideas of peace love and understanding through propagating use of LSD and such.

       I don’t think it was organic at all.  Long explanation short, it justified banning it’s use through stigmatizing it, and made it easy to write off anyone anti war.  It was absolutely imperative to maintain it’s forbidden status in the long run.

       I've only had LSD once and it was a helluva thing, took too much; I feel that micro dosing is the way to go with that. The MDMA I've had has always been a good experience for me, the mix with mushrooms was always good. But money has always been mushrooms, the best way to go.

       Its like the fascination and deep thought of shrooms without the paranoia some people get... the one time i did it i went on a real history lecture to my friends for like 10 hours straight talking about how were all misled and the real story behind many events and wars... all in all its a stellar time BTW i did lose my voice after that night haha so be wary

       Weed, shrooms and LSD are non-toxic and not bad for you
      </p>
      <p>
       MDMA is a fun drug, but it is definitely harmful to your brain and not as ‘spiritual’ as the other three

       They say you can't be addicted to LSD. I proved them wrong in my twenties. I functioned just fine, I had many conversations with mannequins at work and whatnot. I miss LSD. I miss the feelings I had. I felt like I truly belonged on this planet. I could feel the world back then.

       I agree, but cocaine has a specific use cases that are immediately, mechanicaly useful. It is a vasoconstrictor that is also numbing and in a pinpoint accuracy type of way. It is still widely used today, though there are some alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis has definitely been subjected to dishonest/evil regulation that has prevented research, but that does not mean that cocaine purposefully wasn’t given schedule 1 because it was a rich man’s drug.

       ayahuasca can be legally ingested in the U.S., and a few other countries as well. Additionally, it's super duper fucking powerful and.... ah shit.... impossible to describe. If you want her, she calls to you &lt;3 after doing it, it's questionable that I'll keep doing other psychedelics.

       yeah you have to find people that are authorized. depending on the country that's either easier or harder, cheaper or .or expensive. once you find someone irl who's in the circles you'll probably get an in eventually.  also, be careful who you choose to take you on your journey, some shamans believe they can use ayahuasca to steal your life energy or something, and won't give you the experience you deserve.

       They're illegal because they're dangerous. They're dangerous because they change a persons perception of reality. It sucks if you know you can handle perceptional changes, but the laws are written to protect every kind of person from harm. Even the people who aren't capable of making a rational and considered decision. Our systems of government, health, and law enforcement are designed with the lowest common denominator in mind, not the highest.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a conspiracy. It's a natural consequence of busybody populists pandering to every vote-winning plea for generations. We have  millions of laws and rules now. Yes we should all have equal rights and all that but I think we should use a lot more discretion when applying the rules.

       You can skyrocket your chances of cancer legally, with tobacco.  You can legally go BASE jumping.  You can legally buy cars and drive them into walls all day long.  You can legally drink yourself into psychosis and liver dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can’t legally see some pretty lights with a low but real chance of psychosis.  It’s no parallax view, but there are literally quotes from Reagan-era officials stating that many mind-layering substances were criminalized to target specific vocal minorities.

       I've done acid plenty of times, and all I got from it was that it tends to blur the line between reality and your imagination. It tricks you into thinking you're having grand, profound thoughts, but you're really just going in circles, self-rationalizing whatever it is you're thinking about and then forgetting about it 5-10 minutes later. You're really certain that whatever it is you're dreaming up is absolutely true, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say you've been woken up so much as you let it trick you. You have to be careful when in an altered state of mind you don't understand, and you have to be cognizant of the fact that you were in an altered state of mind when remembering the experience. We may be looking at reality through the warped lens of our brains, but our brains on acid are just a differently-warped lens, not clarity.

       Fair enough. I've only done it once, and have reflected on it for years now, so deconstructing the trip has always made me want to try it again, since I'm in a different place in my life. I stand by that micro dosing would be key in the effects of LSD.
