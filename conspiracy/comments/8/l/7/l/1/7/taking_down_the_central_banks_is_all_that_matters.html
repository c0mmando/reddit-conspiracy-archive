       Central banks create debt-based currency. Let's print money debt free. JFK ordered Congress to do just that. Some of those United States Notes (as opposed to Federal Reserve Notes) are still in circulation. Ever seen dollar bills with the red circle on them instead of green?

       They are the reason JFK was murdered.

       Lol, you actually believe that? There are lots of reasons why he Was murdered. Debt based currency is the way to go, thats why you have shit, thats why there is growth, thats how the wheel turns. Tell me something not debt based that works, that creates stability like we have with the current System. I got through all these thoughts 30 years ago and did never see another theory that might work just as well

       ah no, the one in 1929 yes, all other no. So where is the fact that in 2008 the fed caused the crash when in fact they saved the us economy? Alan Greenspan was shit, yes i give you that, his policy led to parts of the problem.

       About the rotschilds i found a great comment on them:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Rothschild family divested themselves of regular commercial banking interests in the early 1990s and now manage investments for extremely wealthy clients under their company, Rothschild Global Advisory, providing services such as equity advice and restructuring debt. The Rothschildâs firm handled the $21 billion dollar merger of 3 Coca Cola bottlers, ABN AMROâs IPO raising $3.8 billion dollars, Al Noor Hospitals $6.8 billion dollar merger with Mediclinic and Intelâs $16.7 billion dollar acquisition of Altera.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rothschildâs are still involved in banking, but only for high net worth individuals and provide fixed deposits, current accounts, Visa cards, internet banking service and foreign currency exchange facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        While actual owners of the Federal Reserve, the people themselves, are unknown, the Federal Reserve is still essentially owned by the member banks. How the 6&amp;#37; profit the Federal Reserve takes is dispatched is also unknown.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rockefeller family wealth surpassed the Rothschilds in the mid-1930s and my personal opinion is that the Rockefeller family has had and still has far more wealth, power and influence than the Rothschilds and in fact, I believe most of the nonsense about Rothschild ruling the world was posted to the internet by employees of the Rockefeller family.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rockefellers founded the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission and these two organizations are responsible for recommending and setting American foreign policy. They also founded the United Nations, numerous medical schools and colleges and dozens of NGOs and non-profit organizations. Theyâre involved heavily in petroleum and natural gas, founded museums, universities, philanthropic foundations, and some of the country's biggest national parks. Their petroleum interests mean theyâre at the head of the table when US foreign policy is discussed, planned and implemented.

       it hasn't been entirely stable in history because we've had the same group of people causing the instability since the existence of money. There were some governments, the most recent and known one the nazi governement, who took control over the money system and you know how it turned out, these gruops of predators did all they could to regain control, and succeded. The next try at shifting the power over money are cryptocurrencies, but these groups are already working overtime at keeping their control through regulations and negative media attention.

       I think you got something wrong, in history it was not the same people, the nazis did what? (im german), this is so wrong dude. There is one thing that is called swift and Dollar, which is what gives us the stability that we live in which has never been higher or better in history. Cryprocurrencies are a pain in the ass and a hype that will die sooner than later as the "BIS" (most powerfull bank of the World, or called "BIZ " in german) announced it's fight and stance against bitcoin (not cryprocurrencies in general). The biggest baddie out there is the milton friedman founded "montpellier society", you may read up on it if you like, they are the most Powerfull think tank of the World and are the neoliberal in persona

       JFK asked Congress to end silver certificates. Congress passed the law, which also authorized the Federal Reserve print new, smaller denomination bills, and JFK signed it. The day he signed the law, he also issued
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">
        Executive Order 11110
       </a>
       , which enabled the Treasury to keep printing silver certificates as long as necessary (until the new Federal Reserve notes were ready).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what EO 11110 was actually about. It was part of JFK's plan to stop printing silver certificates. JFK's plan was the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of the conspiracy theory about it.

       OP's statement is somewhat vague, however to take the central banks down would most likely result in a worldwide financial crash, initially. Their key roles are to supervise and regulate banking firms and also to maintain financial stability. Without an institution to create and maintain financial legislation would allow commercial banks (the ones your actually want to be mad at) and others to then "do what they like." Only serious reform of banking practice legislation and maybe even the structure of Central Banks will result in the desired effect.

       The fact that we absolutely rely on banks to always exist forever otherwise the economy will burn is exactly the problem with them, we've given them that power over us. We need to create a system in which they can be killed without taking the rest of us with them.

       "Islamic Finance" is somewhat different to western banking. Their practices are considered much more ethical as interest payments are banned. They use various forms of profit sharing so that both the user and the lender share wealth and share risk. It's been a while since I studied it but I think we need to adapt this system as soon as possible.

       You have touched on the root cause of Judeo-Islamic conflict. One religion bans charging interest, while the other is based on it.

       What a fantastic point.  Iâm not sure this is the root cause as the two groups religious ideologies arenât compatible at a fundamental level.  That said, I have honestly never thought of the conflict in terms of interest charging.  That really does make an incredible amount of sense.  I think I have to go research what both religions specifically say about interest now.  Thanks for giving me something to think about.

       Islamic finance is actually way worse, because you give away equity rather than debt. And you do pay interest, it's just more like bond coupon payments that add up to a higher value than the initial investment.

       Seriously I'm sure there is evidence but I'm going to disagree with OP's stance and a stance I held for many years: you can no longer beat them conventionally. The Powers That Be has reached such a saturation point in traditional theaters of engagement that you cannot challenge them through politics or violence. The ONLY way we get the power to the people is by building a power structure for them. The Tower of Babel doesn't look so impressive standing next to the Tower of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth, which as we all know, is inherited by the meek and the poor in material but wealthy in spirit.

       If central banks are state run, then why isnât every country just printing their own money to lend to their citizens and fund government projects at 0% interest? Instead every country in the global system takes loans from private banks and racks up an ungodly amount of debt. Last year my county spent more money servicing their interest payments on debts to these banks than they did on unemployment insurance.

       Agreed and..? We are already on board with central banking. Maybe that's why there's a stale-mate of sorts and why Russia/NK/Iran never invaded us and got us off the central banking system. It works both ways...mutual assured destruction so to speak.

       That's literally what the btc vs bch feud is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's this whole long story but basically the original bitcoin developers got kicked out and now btc development is done by blocks team which is in part owned by axa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Old money has taken over bitcoin and is pushing the narrative that it can't be a currency because of the fees. There's a huge disinformation/censorship campaign about it on
       <a href="/r/bitcoin">
        /r/bitcoin
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically with bitcoin cash (which should be called bitcoin) the original movement that bitcoin was about continues.

       I am impartial to the fight but BCH hasn't won me over yet. I'm just pissed from a purchasing and trading point of view in regards to fees. Coinbase is a huge disappointment in how much they charge and as a Canadian, don't really have any other instant purchase options :(

       We just let them continue to do what theyâre doing. The inflation, super low interest rates, and artificial stimulus packages are unsustainable and is going to collapse on itself. Sooner or later when the economy tries to rebound and correct itself, thereâll be a depression that isnât gonna be âfixedâ with lower interest rates and more money being injected into the economy(interest rate is already at its lowest at near 0 percent and the dollar is losing its value every year). The sad part is when it does happen there will be a lot of people pointing fingers at Wall Street, the president, etc...anything but the  fed

       I wish I had the words to express how moving it was to read that.  Itâs not about blue/red, Marxist, capitalist, socialist.  Those are means to an end, theyâre methods of deception one way, or another.  Empty cups which you are told to pick from and drink deeply.

       Absolutely.  I came here hoping people would have abandoned the left/right paradigm.  Years and years voting for both sides and seeing nothing really change for the better has left me with zero faith in fixing anything with the same two broken tools.  Divide and conquer appears to be working very well.

       Discovering this sub was just as divided as anywhere else was pretty damn disappointing.  Youâre right though, âmovingâ probably wasnât the best verb to use.  Refreshing maybe?

       I suspect that most regular users of this sub have moved beyond the false left/right dichotomy, but this is shrouded by the suspiciously-high number of threads about 'Trump' and 'Hillary' posted here on the daily.

       There are thinkers of the past who contend that most humans are simply not ready to think for themselves. It is not in their nature. They simply go about their lives, living day to day, concerned only with the immediate (food, shelter, sex, gossip, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this sub can never be what we might like it to be in the ideal world, because this is not the ideal world. It is a world full of simple people who are easily triggered into emotional outbursts and petty point-scoring.

       I encourage you to seek out Jordan Peterson, avoid the interviews and the hype, focus on the lectures, and his views on ideology. In short, the system that is in place is almost certainly better than anything you can come up with (go clean your room instead) and even if you come up with something "better" because you're a super-genius, the people will almost certainly mis-interpret it, resulting in horrific casualties because they are set in their ways (which is most probably evolutionary).

       The world spends something like 1.5 trillion a year on its military. Meanwhile the world pays 5 trillion a year to pay of debt. Why? Because fiat money is based on debt, the gov loans it from the central Banks at interest meaning there'll always be more debt then money and your taxes don't go to building infrastructure they go to paying the debt expense.

       Wut?  Of course you can have a currency without it being owned and controlled by a privately owned entity that charges interest on every dollar created-so the debt is inherently perpetual.  The US has had 3 central banks in history-the first two lasted less than 20 years-the people gained back control of their own currency and issued it debt free until 1913 when international bankers created the Federal Reserve.

       Our currency, the value attributed to our labor, would be worth far more than it is now. Additionally, income taxes wouldn't be fully absorbed by interest on the Federal debt, because there wouldn't have to be any federal debt. This means that we would technically have the same level of government funding without even paying income tax. Basically, it would accomplish more than you could imagine.

       When's the last time you've done a btc transaction? The fees make it unusable, especially for people in 3rd world countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three functions of currency, store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Bitcoin fails on the second one, it's not usable for small purchases
      </p>
      <p>
       Ln doesn't solve anything, and segwit changes the underlying functionality of bitcoin. Btc is bitcoin segwit. Bch is bitcoin.

       That's how bitcoin works tho, nobody should be able to decide what transactions are worth being stored on the blockchain and what aren't.

       I'm well aware of it.  But it cant  keep up with the demand of blockchain space. Financial data, micro transaction, proof of existence, iot data, your grandma's coffee, your bi weekly dildo purchases oh and checking/savings for 7 billion people. Moore's law has no chance keeping up with  that kind of demand. But by all means, try on-chain scaling darling. ð Go ahead. Clearly bcashers have zero understanding on how to scale things.

       Yesterday lol. Some alts I hodl only have BTC pairings. It was just fine,  5 minute transfer
.. fee was actually cheaper than ETH.. from Coinbase to Trade Ogre. I'm not here to argue which is better. Multiple currencies have coexisted together for a very long time and will continue to, and that is something that you guys who constantly debate BTC vs BCH seem to forget.

       That's true btc is still useful because of its trade pairings.

       But that's it and yes they can coexist but in the context of the thread I believe only one version of bitcoin has a chance to change the power structures.

       Your first sentence is an excellent quote! Thanks for sharing :D

       Confirmation bias is a rough thing to overcome, but it allows for some of the deepest growth.

       No one is right 100&amp;#37; of the time about 100&amp;#37; of things, and its encouraging to see discourse is still alive and well despite some efforts to stifle it.

       Again, So Everyone "Gets" It
      </p>
      <p>
       Again-- the power structure in this country is supposed to run like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       People &gt; Republics &gt; Counties &gt; States &gt; The United States &gt; The United States of America / Federal United States dba "United States" &gt; Territorial United States dba "United States of America"  &gt; Municipal United States dba Municipality of Washington, DC
      </p>
      <p>
       You will notice that in your lifetime there is only fleeting mention of the Republics and that the Federal United States has been confused both with The United States and with incorporated businesses doing business as the "UNITED STATES" and the Territorial United States has been confused both with The United States of America and with incorporated businesses doing business as the "United States of America".
      </p>
      <p>
       All this confusion about who is who and what is what is being used to promote fraud of all kinds against the people and actual States.  Certain parties have gotten very rich from orchestrating this confusion and all these "similar names deceits" ---- and they don't want to give it up.  They have also exercised coercive and war-making powers that they have no right to exercise.  They don't want to give that up, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact remains that they are criminals for promoting, aiding, abetting, assisting, or profiting from this circumstance, and anyone who knows what is going on who doesn't take immediate action to stop it, is either an active or passive accomplice to international crime of a most heinous nature.

       It's a system already in collapse. It's a system that only lasts so many years before needing to be reset. The only reason it has hanged on this long is because every market and every indicator number is being manipulated to prop it up long enough for them to control the collapse and bring in the reset. This reset will involve a cashless fiat currency. Unless someone uses the collapse to justify a real and full audit of the FED that results in unfavorable blame for the collapse and hardship and exposes corruption.  So it is all about who controls the narrative during the collapse.

       The source code for the protocol is online for anyone to see or contribute to. The decentralized nature of the network itself is related to the many individual nodes that comprise the network itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no association in New York unilaterally pushing code. Any changes must be made by way of bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) that undergo a review process by the developers all over the world.

       Well, an audit is more or less an examination of proper maintenance of a process or institution as required by law. There is no rule of law for bitcoin, but thousands of developers contributing to an open source code base means an audit can occur whenever, wherever, by anyone with sufficient means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin itself (in case you weren't aware) is a means for transacting value in a completely trustless fashion (zero middleman and no risk of the counterparty not following through with the transaction). It is censorship resistant, has no governing body, and is deflationary (value increases over time instead of going down like the dollar).
      </p>
      <p>
       Transacting with bitcoins removes banks from the equation since you are essentially your own bank, and increases transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The caveat being there is no recourse for funds sent to a party that doesn't provide you with the product or service you requested.

       Take the country's monetary system away from them. Don't allow them to print our money and lend our money to our government so that they can demand that a portion of our taxes be handed over to them. They create nothing of value to us. The money they have is thieved from your hard work at your family's expense and used only to serve themselves. Take their power away. It can be done with the stroke of a pen.

       This sounds like the most logical and possible answer that I have received here. But, I think they would shut you out of the international banking system if you did this. The US is big enough to construct its own alternative system perhaps, but it would be a close thing.

Especially since removing this parasitic banking system off the backs of the tax payer would happen around the world as each individual country starts shedding their own banking system. It will work. What would need to be created is an international trading currency; a monetary unit used for trade between countries. The "cufit" (currency used for international trade).

       Roman Empire: 
Augustus wanted the aureus and denarius to circulate not only in the Roman Empire but to make them a world currency.

       US Empire:
Taft's dollar diplomacy not only allowed the United States to gain financially from countries but also restrained other foreign countries from reaping any sort of financial gain.

       A cancer thst keeps making people rich. A never ending money tree that feeds off all of the water and life from its surroundings because it's roots are so deep and so thirsty. How much more can it take before it implodes from its own weight. Magic doesn't exist.. how long can you keep creating money from nothing by siphoning from everything around you.

       They are supposed to be upfront and transparent about the "interest" that would need to be paid in return for the loan.

      <p>
       Instead of being clearly misleading and depending on compound interest rates, the islamic banks would just charge a flat fee for the loan and that will be the profit for the banks.

       There should be a clear "BDS" movement against Wall Street and all that shit. We should boycott their banks by joining credit unions instead.  We should invest our savings in assets. We should move our legislators to enact laws against their destructive behaviors, and in particular, we should nationalize or completely dismantle the Federal Reserve.

       Not really. People need to realise the enemy is ourselves as much as it is those few people who take advantage of division. We need a society that has a sense of unity, that has made the choice to consider every single person as their equal. Only then will we be immune to corruption, otherwise new organisations will pop up and do the same things to the same effect as the banks had.

       Does anyone know if Congress still has the power to dissolve the Federal Reserve? It's only been around since 1913.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is theoretical, and purely objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Food for thought: I read an argument somewhere that JP Morgan was so affluent and so charitable in the event of disasters that the Fed was created so an institution to bail them out, in lieu of a single individual. Of course, since this is conspiracy, I'll mention evidence implying JP Morgan was complicit in a number of these disasters,
       <a href="https://amp.businessinsider.com/titanic-sinking-conspiracy-theories-2018-4">
        including the titanic
       </a>
       . Morgan himself died very soon after the Titanic went down, and the Fed was established on the heels of the man's funeral.

       This thread is a disgrace. OP's statement has no substance other than "Central banks bad." He says nothing about why we should "take down" the central banks, what the alternative is, how we should take down the central banks, yet this post has 195 points while I type this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top comment is the utterly vacuous "Agreed". The next highest rated comment starts out "I wish I had the words to express how moving it was to read that." Huh? Meanwhile the reasonable question "Help me understand please... what would that accomplish?" Is at 7 points, marked with a "â " dagger for being controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       What. The. Fuck. Who the hell downvotes a question like "what would that accomplish"? This thread isn't a discussion, it's a lynch mob with pitchforks and torches.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread is about promoting
       <em>
        ignorance

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The few redditors in here who actually have any idea what role central banks do and express a little skepticism at the idea "kill the central banks" are voted down into negative double digits. There are more than 170 central banks around the world, created by all sorts of governments over
       <em>
        centuries.
       </em>
       Is is really the case that all these governments were wrong and this lynch mob is right? If so, maybe you should have a little discussion of "why?"
      </p>
      <p>
       More than one comment refers to Andrew Carrington Hitchcock's
       <em>
        hoax
       </em>
       about the Rothschilds controlling all central banks. At least there are a couple of people pointing out that there is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence for this hoax! People
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       discuss why they believe this weird theory, despite there being no evidence for it and tons of evidence against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       One comment says "Audit. The. FED." I wonder if this commenter knows that the Fed is audited every year. Does he know what Rand Paul wants to change about the audits and what pros and cons there are to the proposed changes? There
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be discussion about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only proposed replacements are Islamic banking, bartering, and digital currencies. Bartering? Seriously? Islamic banking? Are economies better in countries that practice it? Digital currencies? Maybe this magic pixie dust will work as a currency, maybe it won't, but in what way do you think it will be better than all the currencies that exist today?

       Those are not the only proposed replacements at all.  You dont need a currency to be owned and controlled by a private entity that charges interest to have one.  Look up US history with central banks-the first two were rotted out in less than 20 years.  The Federal Reserve was literally conspired by international bankers (read the Creature from Jeckyl Island) and pushed through Congress via Puppet Aldrich during Christmas recess in 1913.

       By far most central banks have no private ownership at all. The only countries where there is any form of private shareholders at all are Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.S. All the other 170+ central banks have no private shareholders. And in those 8 countries, there are a lot of restrictions on ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve does not charge interest on currency.

       Nope. The Aldrich bill was introduced in Congress in 1910, but never brought to a vote. Part of Woodrow Wilson's platform in 1912 was reform of the banking and monetary system. After the 1912 elections, the Democrats controlled the House, Senate, and White House for the first time in more than a decade. They wrote a Democratic alternative to Aldrich's plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The House Banking Committee held extensive hearings about proposed reforms starting in January, even before Wilson was sworn in as President in March. They held hearings on January 7-9, 14-16, 21-22, 28-29 and February 5, 17, and 28. That testimony is collected in

       </a>
       of more than 700 pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       In June, President Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress, urging passage of a money reform bill:

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Senate Banking Committee held hearings on September 2-6, 8, 16-20, 22-26, 29-30 and October 4, 6-7, 8-11, 13-17, 20-25, 27. The testimony is collected in three volumes (

       The House of Representatives initially passed the bill on

        September 18.
       </a>
       by a vote of 286 to 85, with 23 Republicans and 10 Progressives voting for it. The Senate passed a different version of the bill on

        December 19
       </a>
       , by a vote of 54 to 34. A conference committee met to work out a compromise bill. The House passed the conference bill by an overwhelming vote of 298 to 60 on December 22. The Senate passed it the next day by a

       We know for a fact that the outcome would be the same if the full Senate voted.

      <p>
       The idea that the Federal Reserve Act was some secret passed by just a few Congressman is just another myth.

       We literally don't need a central bank. We don't need an institution to create currency and then charge interest on that currency. That only harms the American people at the expense of the very rich. This Central Banking cartel has its tentacles all over the world, which is why any country that resists them suffers.

       Wait, you're talking about the
       <em>
        money supply
       </em>
       ? That's different from
       <em>
        currency.
       </em>
       You should get your facts straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people talk about the Fed raising or lowering interest rates, they're talking about the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate">
        target Federal funds rate
       </a>
       . That is the rate that banks charge each other, not money that goes to the Fed. The Fed does do some lending of its own to banks, but that's usually minor, except during the financial crisis that started in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had some other monetary system based on, say, bitcoin, would banks stop lending money or would they just stop charging interest on loans? I venture to say that neither would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest is charged on
       <em>
        borrowing
       </em>
       . Yes, when people borrow, that increases the money supply. That's how bank accounts work. It doesn't have anything to do with the
       <em>
        currency
       </em>
       . There is no interest charged on currency, only on borrowing.

       I tend to agree, although its not a popular opinion here due to all the Shareblue shilling. But there's a reason Trump hung a picture of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office.

       It worked just fucking fine when we were under Bretton Woods. Prevented the US from printing money at will to stave off a recession. Then Richard Nixon was paranoid about winning a second term because a recession was a-brewin and he couldn't spend he way out of it, so he ended it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been piling on the debt and printing money like crazy since. Bretton Woods fixed both problems.

       Nothing can change because we are all enslaved by municipal bonds. We can't save the earth from ecological destruction because our bond holders won't allow it. Our  political leaders are black sheep leading us into bonded debt. National debt is converted into private bonds. That what everything is all about.

       Oh Iâm sure the Rothschilds/banking elite do. 
Also Iâve been in crypto for a few years now and the thing is I feel like it would have been implemented somehow by now if it was going to be. Block chain will do some cool things in the future but Iâm just so sure about the current state of crypto but yes itâs been a hell of a ride.

       I ain't scerd.  I have no doubt in my mind humanity is going through a transitional period where our old systems come to an abrupt end, and new systems are implemented.  Whether bitcoin remains king is not clear, but decentralized everything will be the future.  We will be sovereigns.

       You can't take down the central banks because governments love them. The first damned thing evil snake Hamilton wanted to do was set up a central bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as you have governments you will have central banks. Central banks are the most efficient way to transfer wealth from the producers to the ruling class. Taxes are obvious and they are forced to give some of the money they steal in taxes to dependent voters so they will always vote to keep the taxes. But the central bank has no such restrictions.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       theft goes straight to the ruling class. That's the pure shit. That is how the majority of wealth diversity perpetuates.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could try a written Constitution that explicitly forbade a central bank, but the 9th and 10th Amendments to the US Constitution already explicitly denied all non specific powers, and it was entirely ignored. So you could say "AND WE ESPECIALLY MEAN NO CENTRAL BANKS" but then a Supreme Court would arrogate the power to
       <em>
        interpret
       </em>
       the Constitution (as happened in Marbury vs Madison) and they would
       <em>
        interpret
       </em>
       "NO CENTRAL BANKS" to mean "Yes central banks are allowed".
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is no way to end them, and I don't even see a way they could be prevented. The US Constitution attempted to deny them, and it did not work.

       Cryptocurriens will be looked back upon as the largest redistribution in wealth in centuries. Do your part to obtain that redistribution and crush the central banks, by learning to use cryptocurrencies. While you are at it, learn to crush the centralized censorship ridden platforms, by using decentralized alternatives. Decentralize all the things!

       When's the last time you've done a btc transaction? The fees make it unusable, especially for people in 3rd world countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three functions of currency, store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Bitcoin fails on the second one, it's not usable for small purchases
      </p>
      <p>
       Ln doesn't solve anything, and segwit changes the underlying functionality of bitcoin. Btc is bitcoin segwit. Bch is bitcoin.

       They are supposed to be upfront and transparent about the "interest" that would need to be paid in return for the loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of being clearly misleading and depending on compound interest rates, the islamic banks would just charge a flat fee for the loan and that will be the profit for the banks.

       If central banks are state run, then why isnât every country just printing their own money to lend to their citizens and fund government projects at 0% interest? Instead every country in the global system takes loans from private banks and racks up an ungodly amount of debt. Last year my county spent more money servicing their interest payments on debts to these banks than they did on unemployment insurance.
