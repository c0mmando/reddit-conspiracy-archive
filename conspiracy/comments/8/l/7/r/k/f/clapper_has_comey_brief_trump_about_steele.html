<p><a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018%2005%2021%20RHJ%20to%20FBI%20Director%20Wray%20re%20Steele%20Dossier.pdf">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018&amp;#37;2005&amp;#37;2021&amp;#37;20RHJ&amp;#37;20to&amp;#37;20FBI&amp;#37;20Director&amp;#37;20Wray&amp;#37;20re&amp;#37;20Steele&amp;#37;20Dossier.pdf</a></p>

<p>&gt;CNN has the pee pee dossier </p>

<p>&gt;CNN can&#39;t publish because they have no proof whatsoever that its legit</p>

<p>&gt;James Clapper comes up with a scheme to give veracity to the dossier</p>

<p>&gt;Clapper has Comey tell Trump the pee pee dossier exists and that CNN is looking for a way to publish it</p>

<p>&gt;Comey then leaks to CNN that he briefed Trump on the dossier</p>

<p>&gt;CNN uses the presidential briefing as proof of legitimacy for the dossier</p>

<p>&gt;CNN has buzzfeed publish the pee pee dossier.</p>

<p>&gt;According to Sen. Johnson’s letter, Comey chief of staff Rybicki emailed unidentified recipients on the morning of Jan. 6, 2017 stating, “[Director Comey] is coming to HQ briefly now for an update on the sensitive matter team.”</p>

<p>&gt;Later in the day, Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a few of the salacious, unverified allegations in the Steele dossier. The next day, Comey reported on his briefing in an email to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI General Counsel James Baker and Chief of Staff Rybicki. (All four men have since resigned or been fired from the FBI.)</p>

<p>&gt;“I said there was something [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper wanted me to speak to [President Elect Trump] about alone or in a very small group,” Comey wrote in the email. “I then executed the session exactly as I had planned…I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook.” (Clapper now works as a CNN contributor.)</p>

<p>&gt;A day later, Jan. 8, FBI Deputy Director McCabe emailed Comey and Rybicki with the subject title: “Flood is coming.”</p>

<p>&gt;“CNN is close to going forward with the sensitive story,” McCabe wrote. “The trigger for them is they know the material was discussed in the [presidential] brief and presented in an attachment.”</p>

<p>&gt;Also included on that email were FBI associate deputy director David Bowdich and FBI assistant director for public affairs Michael Kortan. (Bowdich was recently appointed FBI Deputy Director. Kortan retired in February and had also served as an aide to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who’s investigating alleged Trump-Russia collusion.)</p>

<p>&gt;Within an hour of the “Flood is coming” email, McCabe emailed then-Deputy General Sally Yates and her top aide, Principal Deputy Attorney General Matthew Axelrod, with the subject title “News.” (Yates has since been fired and Axelrod resigned.)</p>

<p>Does this mean people are going to go to jail?I sure hope so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s so sad, the media is actively burying one of the most twisted abuses of power and weaponization of the intelligence community like never before. People need to wake up and realize that our “independent” MSM is as bad or worse than state run media. If they continue to refuse to shine a light on government corruption when it’s going to expose one side (the side they’re on in this bogus 2 party system) we’re all fucked.</p>

<p>Literally treason. A sitting administration tried (and failed) to rig the seat of President of The United States. They failed and then continued to try to undermine and fabricate evidence against a elected President. Given the amount of bridgaging by leftist on this sub - you would think the real conspiracy is &#39;MUH RUSSIA. About how Donald Trump is a Putin puppet all because of a fake piss dossier. </p>

<p>This (along with other new developments within the past weeks) shows without a doubt, there&#39;s a real coordinated conspiracy between media outlets, the Obama admin, the FBI and CIA (Deep State) to undermine and overthrow Donald Trump. </p>

<p>TopMinds/Politics communist die hard leftist people on this sub are now trying to flip the script. Literally &quot;WTF We love the CIA now. WTF we love sedition, treason and using our law enforcement agencies as political weapons now.&quot; while upvoting CIA Washington Post Propaganda while they downvote anything even suggesting there&#39;s a conspiracy against Donald Trump and his administration. </p>

<p>Its laughable. Its also False Flag material, You can bet theres going to be a HUGE distraction once Trump and Sessions decides its time to drop the hammer on all these traitors. Its all about timing. Trump let these idiots dig their own graves. All of this is going to hit hard come mid-terms. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no back tracking at this point. No one but leftist are buying the &quot;We spied on Trump to protect him&quot; bullshit. Polls are turning in favor or Trump. Media distrust is at a all time low. The economy is great. ISIS is defeated, Pedophiles being exposed, African Americans are running off the Democrats plantations by the hundreds. Red Pill Black is a huge trend right now. Globalist are on the defensive. </p>

<p><strong>TWO TERMS</strong></p>

<p>When you heard that the coup-plotters discussed an &quot;insurance plan&quot; did you think <em>assassination attempt</em>, as well? Will that be the final nail? Seems like it would enable POTUS to bring about military tribunals without having the public at large question the motives behind it. This is going to be a fun, albeit dangerous, ride. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People over obsessive about Trump. Like after 9/11, when the news reports fear news 24/7 and people become obsessed and can&#39;t stop watching the news to go to work or think clearly anymore. The news has trapped many people in the same way with their constant Gish Gallop of yellow journalism about Trump. They are hooked on the Trump Derangement Syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how people always throw out the dossier as fake because it hasn&#39;t been &quot;verified&quot;. It can&#39;t be &quot;verified&quot; by the media &quot;standards&quot; for a couple of reasons. 1. People who are part of it are dead, missing or in Russian jails. 2. The people who are a part of it would never go on record with the media about it. 3. The amount of time it takes to &quot;verify&quot; an intelligence document by the media would have taken too long to get it out prior to the election. Now that there has been time for people to investigate these claims, parts of it have been verified.  </p>

<p>Not sure exactly how your timeline shows some massive conspiracy though.  Do you not think that there would be a &quot;Flood Coming&quot; if you knew something like this was about hit the media?</p>
