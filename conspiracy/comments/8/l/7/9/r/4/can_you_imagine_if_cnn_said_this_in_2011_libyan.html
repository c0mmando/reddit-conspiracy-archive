       Yep, every war we've fought in modern history has against a manufactured enemy that the US supported right before they were re-branded as an enemy. We were literally supporting al Qaeda in Syria less than a decade after blaming them for 9/11 and invading Afghanistan to fight them.

       Her laughs when talking about the
       <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/11/01/hillary-clinton-learned-manipulate-law-defending-child-rapist/">
        infamous rape case
       </a>
       are similarly sickening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, she could have refused to take the case or recused herself, but she knowingly got a child rapist a slap on the wrist by way of a technicality, AND THEN LAUGHS ABOUT THAT FACT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another piece of insanity...she got the rapist a bail amount of $2500.  For perspective, I know someone with no legal history that was arrested for a non-violent crime that got them two years' probation, and their bail was set at $100,000.

       And you didn't articulate how we're "fallin' like Rome", really.  The UK is the empire, not the U.S.  Also Germany stole Rome's gold
       <em>
        TWICE

       Falling like Rome isn't lighthearted.  Well, to me at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't have specific reading recommendations.  Just read up on the "final" fall of Rome in 432 I think.  And search on the Nazis invading the Vatican.  I'm sure you know about the city of London and all.  Just for laughs,

       History be crazy.

       I have a feeling that the movement of gold is one of the key parts of history.  If the whole harvesting gold for aliens/gods/whatever turns out to be true, it's not something a lot of people would be able to reconcile.

       George Bush beginning the Iraq war in 1991 based on lies was not significant at all. Nor was his son stealing the 2000 election with his cabal of Supreme Court injustice, 9-11 itself, and the massive expansion of the Middle East wars based on more lies.

       It’s almost impossible to untangle what happened in Libya from the rest of the Middle East skulldrudgery (to put it lightly), particularly in the 90’s and 00’s.

       Pick one: 9/11 and the destruction of civil rights in the west, or the refugee crisis and ongoing destruction of western society.

       They’re all parts of the same plan, I think you’re right. But the potential for Africa to have been self-sufficient, have a stable, gold-backed currency, have state-of-the-art irrigation, and basically enter the modern age, is the one i picked. Those slashed chances as stability set back the world who knows how many decades. Maybe I was too optimistic about Gadafi’s motivations and Africa’s potential, but it seemed like a good thing could have happened, and it wa stamped out with such malice that I can’t help but think it the more egregious event.

       Gaddafi was in there since the 1960s. He wasn't going to do any of those wonderful things. He was just another power hungry dictator. I opposed the action against him totally however, as the world is full of power hungry dictators and similar types.

       I'll go with George W. Bush stole the election. That's how we got 9-11 which led to the destruction of civil rights in the west, and the expanded wars caused the refugee crisis.

       It is naive to think that Gore would not have been similarly complicit in the events that transpired on and after 9/11. I think you are vastly underestimating how deep-seated all of this business is.

       Excuse me for looking at the facts but PNAC wrote their "new Pearl Harbor" document entitled "Rebuilding America's Defenses" in the summer of 2000 right before the election. PNAC was full of Republicans and funded by the Bradley Foundation.

       You can't push all of that off on Al Gore. The Clinton/Gore administration expressly warned the incoming illegitimate administration about terrorism. 9-11 would not have happened under Al Gore. That's for certain.

        It's time to stop blaming those who did not commit crimes for crimes others committed.

       Thanks.

      <p>
       And just to make sure I drive this home ... Do you remember what happened on February 26, 1993? That was during the Clinton administration. He DID NOT use it as an excuse for massive Mideast wars. He could have. That event was the last gasp of the Reagan/Bush years. It was supposed to happen early in the second Bush term, but things didn't go their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, on Iran, the two parties are worlds apart. The main reason that GWB did not finish his PNAC agenda and go into Iran was because Zbigniew Brzezinski warned in no uncertain terms that GWB and his false flag operations could be exposed. That was in early 2007. After that, and through years of negotiation, Barack Obama and five other nations made the Iran deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump has consistently insisted on breaking the Iran deal -- which is the same as bringing back the PNAC agenda. The appointment of John Bolton was described by Jimmy Carter as the worst thing Donald Trump did. But it should have been expected.

       Ya. Its hilarious. These idiots just plastered all over their propaganda boxes that Obama and Clintons foreign policy was a absolute failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leftist are in panic mode. Trumps cornered these idiots into admitting their own lies. Its glorious.

       How does this have anything to do with Leftists? OR Trump supposedly cornering them? This was known way before 2016.

       This had nothing to do with Foreign policy, it had to do with him trying to have Africa united under one currency, backed by gold, which would have sent global economy into a tail spin. He is the type of person who would have accomplished it so certain interests had him taken out.

       Lol I'm not. But I can tell you're going to defend or stick up for Trump just by the fact you made an argument out of thin air and started putting words no one said in my mouth.

       It's an extremely common tactic you all seem to have and employ waaaaaay too often.

       What do you mean? It was never hidden the West backed the rebels. We actively bombed Libyan government areas and placed a no fly zone over the country

       I’m blaming the Bushes and the Clintons and Obama. I don’t see a difference amongst them, and I don’t think Gore would have made a lick of difference.
