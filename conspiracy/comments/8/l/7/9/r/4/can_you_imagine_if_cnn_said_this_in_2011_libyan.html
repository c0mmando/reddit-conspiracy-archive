<p>Basically, she could have refused to take the case or recused herself, but she knowingly got a child rapist a slap on the wrist by way of a technicality, AND THEN LAUGHS ABOUT THAT FACT.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another piece of insanity...she got the rapist a bail amount of $2500.  For perspective, I know someone with no legal history that was arrested for a non-violent crime that got them two years&#39; probation, and their bail was set at $100,000.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s almost impossible to untangle what happened in Libya from the rest of the Middle East skulldrudgery (to put it lightly), particularly in the 90’s and 00’s. </p>

<p>Pick one: 9/11 and the destruction of civil rights in the west, or the refugee crisis and ongoing destruction of western society. </p>

<p>They’re all parts of the same plan, I think you’re right. But the potential for Africa to have been self-sufficient, have a stable, gold-backed currency, have state-of-the-art irrigation, and basically enter the modern age, is the one i picked. Those slashed chances as stability set back the world who knows how many decades. Maybe I was too optimistic about Gadafi’s motivations and Africa’s potential, but it seemed like a good thing could have happened, and it wa stamped out with such malice that I can’t help but think it the more egregious event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me for looking at the facts but PNAC wrote their &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; document entitled &quot;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses&quot; in the summer of 2000 right before the election. PNAC was full of Republicans and funded by the Bradley Foundation.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t push all of that off on Al Gore. The Clinton/Gore administration expressly warned the incoming illegitimate administration about terrorism. 9-11 would not have happened under Al Gore. That&#39;s for certain. <strong>It&#39;s time to stop blaming those who did not commit crimes for crimes others committed.</strong> Thanks.</p>

<p>And just to make sure I drive this home ... Do you remember what happened on February 26, 1993? That was during the Clinton administration. He DID NOT use it as an excuse for massive Mideast wars. He could have. That event was the last gasp of the Reagan/Bush years. It was supposed to happen early in the second Bush term, but things didn&#39;t go their way.</p>

<p>Finally, on Iran, the two parties are worlds apart. The main reason that GWB did not finish his PNAC agenda and go into Iran was because Zbigniew Brzezinski warned in no uncertain terms that GWB and his false flag operations could be exposed. That was in early 2007. After that, and through years of negotiation, Barack Obama and five other nations made the Iran deal.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has consistently insisted on breaking the Iran deal -- which is the same as bringing back the PNAC agenda. The appointment of John Bolton was described by Jimmy Carter as the worst thing Donald Trump did. But it should have been expected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is naive</p>

<p>You know what&#39;s naive? Believing that you can change people constantly and always wind up with the same results. People are different. Didn&#39;t Barney teach you this?</p>
