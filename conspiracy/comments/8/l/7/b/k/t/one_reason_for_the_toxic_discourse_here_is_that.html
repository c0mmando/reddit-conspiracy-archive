       Progressive leftism is an ideology that demands that the government have more power, and more influence in our lives.  The real problem with conspiracy theories is that no matter which "side of the aisle" is guilty in one, they general serve to make us skeptical of the prudence of progressive ideology.  Should we really trust the government?  Progressivism requires us to.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, reddit is mostly progressive, save for "that one subreddit".  In today's current event, the conspiracy discussion is poisoned a bit because of this.  Look, it's not just about defending Hillary, or proving what Trump did wrong.  Progressives lose if we prove that government is corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, the narrative here is that Trump - outside of government, before entering it - colluded with a foreign power also outside of government.  And the "good institutions" are "doing the right thing" despite their boss being Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it turns out that Obama used the NSA, CIA, and FBI like many of us imagine (to spy on Trump, then take Clinton campaign opposition research and frame it as official intelligence where bureaucrats are still working for the scam even under Trump, and where Hillary's crimes were covered up), then it's devastating for Progressives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just about "well, forget about Hillary then".  Obama, the "scandal free most progressive" President totally abused the system.  Imagine if he would have been an evil conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government itself is in question here, hence the unusually toxic screaming.

       Progressives don’t lose if we “prove” the government is corruptible because guess what, any government is corruptible. Was it man-made? Is it run by humans like you and I? Then it is corruptible. Progressives want the unnecessary strife of the people, of all the people, to end. Conservative or liberal, we all suffer unnecessarily.

       Using the government to replace private institutions, or rather, to be strong enough to crowd out the "narrow selfishness" of private institutions.  If that's not progressivism, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, what is progressivism, if it's not "the government can save us"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how people with that ideology can seriously talk about conspiracy theories.

       Again, it's not about what policies or politics you favor.  It's about an ideology that "government will save us".

       Well said - I lost perspective on this as I haven't been on that side of the isle for many years. But realizing that the government is corrupt is eventually what lead me to the middle where now I realize both sides are garbage.

       I generally don't like left wing thinking (we're just a collective) or left wing policies (wealth redistribution), however, I'm not completely utterly opposed to either.  I am against this idea that "the government can save us and make us better".  It's nuts as far as I'm concerned.  Don't know why that type would be here talking about conspiracy theories.  Maybe to mock or distract us.

       and if it turns out is doesn't you'll all stop complaining about Obama? They're doing a real investigation now, real facts, real judgments, are you going to accept what every they find, even if its found Obama didn't do anything illegal or out of bounds?

       You're already wrong. The right are the ones who want to ban abortion, make you prove your genitalia before you piss and shit, and want to force the country to be christian and hate the pope.

       Since you were wrong in the beginning, nothing else in your post makes sense. Comrade Trump does shady shit like fuck porn stars and get big money from Russian friends. This is the stuff that gets legal scrutiny.

       If all that stuff happened... then it's on the judge and not the president who approved of it.

       The left would ban abortion if it became politically expedient.  Ever heard of Ceaucescu?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the left right now wants to decriminalize cannabis.  Not because drug prohibition is inherently wrong from the standpoint of political theory and ethics, but because "it's not a good idea".
      </p>
      <p>
       So ultimately progressivism is "the government will save us", but "we can trust the government" because "we" will make sure they only implement "good ideas" chosen by "us".

       That’s not entirely true, I primarily identify with the right side for the sole reason of get the government the fuck out of our shit. If you ask right sided millennials they will not be against weed, abortion or whatever. It’s only people who hold on to those ideals and they are becoming more irrelevant everyday.

       Government is always good if "the right people" are in charge, but always bad if the wrong people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally yes.  As Mark Twain famously said, "Love your country always, love your Government when it deserves it."  I think there are exceptions, such as when a bad law is passed by "the right people" that could easily be used for nefarious purposes by "the wrong people."  If Democrats are "the right people" according to progressives in your mind, there are numerous examples of progressives disagreeing with Democrat policies and bills.  Even then though, Conservatives do the same shit.  I didn't see much protest on the right when the Patriot Act was being passed, for example.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But they don't usually win.  In 2016, progressives rallied around a cranky, old, self-described socialist from a small state, with zero name recognition against the most well funded, well connected political operation in modern politics.  They routinely take on underdogs and longshots.

      <p>
       I guess it depends on the conspiracy theory.  I personally got my start in progressive political activism protesting against Bill Clinton's free trade policies in the late 90's.  The WTO/GATT, that sort of thing.  It's not that I think the Government doesn't have enough power.  I think it has plenty of power, and too much in some areas.  It's that I don't think the Government uses the power they have for the benefit of the people much of the time.  Take single-payer, which many Conservatives think is Government trying to take more power.  Is it a new power though?  Government already manages a healthcare system.  It's called Medicare.  It's just Government using a power they already have in a different manner.

       That's a whole long conversation on it's own, but yeah, like most progressives, I reject the idea that money=speech, especially where corporations are concerned.  The founders did too.

        Look up the regulations they had on corporations.

       conspiracy theories.  We aren't all flat-earthers after all, I hope.  I'd argue that progressives among the first to complain against Government overreach, at least when it comes to social issues, or civil rights issues.  Perhaps less so on economic issues, unless it's Government assisting the plutocrats.
