       Legalize Prostitution. Seems so simple. Oldest profession. Allows for regulation. More tax revenue. What's the problem. Any theories as to why Prostitution is really illegal, rather than just because USA was founded by prudes or to protect people from sex trafficking (lot of good that has done)?

       Not a reason, but the prostitution and sex markets are considered very high risk for both the clients and the business owners. There would need to be a specialized insurance marketplace, and people would have to be okay with essentially consenting to a national background check before each encounter.

       Expectation is the root of all disappointment. If you sign a waiver, you would be waiving your right to litigation should some safety or liability issue arise.

       I don't think you realize all the health and safety issues that come with this type of business. Also, have you been to a domestic violence shelter recently and seen those statistics? Just because someone prostitutes themselves, doesn't mean they feel like they are given much choice in the situation.

       Plenty of industries have health and safety issues. Insurance exists. Lawyers exists. Put them to work. Legality would provide a safety net. They could leave whatever violent situation they were in, go to any other city, and find work easy. Obviously this is hypothetical, but I don't see you coming up with any solutions.

       Are you daft? The majority of danger from prostitution stems from it's illegality. In most places in america prostitution is illegal.  Many of these prostitutes are groomed and then enslaved by pimps who take enough of their money to keep them under their thumb. They don't care about their girl's well being. They just care about the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. If you were to legalize it and make it a legal profession? It could be regulated. Mandatory condom use. Mandatory STD testing. It would take place in a safe place with security to protect the girls if anyone got unruly. No one would have to worry about reporting an offense just because they were doing something illegal. Fair wages to the girls.

       Are you even paying attention? That was my point. If I had to sign a waiver to do something as innocent as driving a go kart, why would similar systems not be out in place as CYA (Cover Your Ass) forms in a market such as legalized prostitution?

       I think its a female conspiracy. I think with prostitution legal you will see a lot less marriage. And a lot less women in power with social status just because they are a female.

       Sure. But in todays times. Less marriage can be seen as fitting the needs of the country. So legalization of prostitution could be a good thing.

       a sex cult runs the world and does so, in part, by trying to control access to sex.  in canada, that's why soliciting prostitution is illegal (ie. the act of asking for it),  but not prostitution itself.  and that's why so many false accusations against males are rubberstamped with little to no protection for men.  that's why claims of spousal abuse in divorce cases don't make any statistical sense - because they're false.  the entire idea of consent is verboten by this crowd.  and they maintain their power and the ability to use these levers because women allow it.  when you use divide and conquer and maintain your control over half the population thru what amounts to bribery, you have the numbers to do whatever you want policywise.  address the systemic gender bias we live under and you'll see an end to many of these shenanigans.

       I do and I personally think it should be legalized (after considering all the points I brought up previously) because it should be a womans or mans right to do what she/he wants with their body. I do not think it would take care of the "Incel problem". I think that problem lies in our public education and media.

       I suspect the incels would just end up griping about how the only sex they get is when they pay for it and how that’s not fair and how women are just giving it away for free to this fictitious chad. They also often talk very disparagingly about prostitutes and women who have had any sex at all. Their issue is not with lack of sex, but fear of the ‘females’.

       I strongly disagree. Once you get it everything changes. It becomes less mystical and more real. When something is real to you, understanding should follow, which in turn dissolves most the fear.

       Are you even paying attention? That was my point. If I had to sign a waiver to do something as innocent as driving a go kart, why would similar systems not be out in place as CYA (Cover Your Ass) forms in a market such as legalized prostitution?
