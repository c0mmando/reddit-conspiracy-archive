    <div class="md"><p>Are you daft? The majority of danger from prostitution stems from it&#39;s illegality. In most places in america prostitution is illegal.  Many of these prostitutes are groomed and then enslaved by pimps who take enough of their money to keep them under their thumb. They don&#39;t care about their girl&#39;s well being. They just care about the money.</p>

<p>Now. If you were to legalize it and make it a legal profession? It could be regulated. Mandatory condom use. Mandatory STD testing. It would take place in a safe place with security to protect the girls if anyone got unruly. No one would have to worry about reporting an offense just because they were doing something illegal. Fair wages to the girls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a sex cult runs the world and does so, in part, by trying to control access to sex.  in canada, that&#39;s why soliciting prostitution is illegal (ie. the act of asking for it),  but not prostitution itself.  and that&#39;s why so many false accusations against males are rubberstamped with little to no protection for men.  that&#39;s why claims of spousal abuse in divorce cases don&#39;t make any statistical sense - because they&#39;re false.  the entire idea of consent is verboten by this crowd.  and they maintain their power and the ability to use these levers because women allow it.  when you use divide and conquer and maintain your control over half the population thru what amounts to bribery, you have the numbers to do whatever you want policywise.  address the systemic gender bias we live under and you&#39;ll see an end to many of these shenanigans.  </p>
