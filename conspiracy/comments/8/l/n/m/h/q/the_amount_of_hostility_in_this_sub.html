<p>Sometimes it’s so bad that it almost feels as though there were some kind of coordinated effort to attack any real theories with constant ridicule and hostility... Almost.</p>

<p>When mocking doesn’t work, there is the tendency to reject any possible theory unless there is absolute irrefutable evidence for whatever claims made. It’s ridiculous to demand evidence for every conspiracy theory because if such evidence were readily available then maybe they wouldn’t be conspiracies in the first place. Most conspiracies are born out of suspicion and theorizing anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway, I suggest just ignoring these people. They’re not gonna go away and while it may be fun to troll them, they ultimately add nothing of value to this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The layers thing has been debunked repeatedly:</p>

<p>*But that’s not so, says Jean-Claude Tremblay, a leading software trainer and Adobe-certified expert, who has years of experience working with and teaching Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>He said the layers cited by doubters are evidence of the use of common, off-the-shelf scanning software — not evidence of a forgery. “I have seen a lot of illustrator documents that come from photos and contain those kind of clippings — and it looks exactly like this,” he said.</p>

<p>Tremblay explained that the scanner optical character recognition (OCR) software attempts to translate characters or words in a photograph into text. He said the layers cited by the doubters shows that software at work — and nothing more.</p>

<p>“When you open it in Illustrator it looks like layers, but it doesn’t look like someone built it from scratch. If someone made a fake it wouldn’t look like this,” he said. “Some scanning software is trying to separate the background and the text and splitting element into layers and parts of layers.”</p>

<p>Tremblay also said that during the scanning process, instances where the software was unable to separate text fully from background led to the creation of a separate layer within the document. This could be places where a signature runs over the line of background, or typed characters touch the internal border of the document.*</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t have &quot;layers&quot; until the document is scanned and processed. The program that they used to scan it automatically tries to separate the foreground and backgrounds. That&#39;s why &quot;layers&quot; show up. </p>

<p>The document was legitimate and your concern has been addressed. What other issue do you have with the certificate besides layering?</p>

<p>No, they have not, stop spreading disinfo. Jean-Claude Tremblay was deliberately misquoted by Fox News and he has gone on the record to say so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.proficiografik.com/2011/05/02/rectifications-regarding-obama-birth-certificate-pdf-validity-foxnews.html">http://www.proficiografik.com/2011/05/02/rectifications-regarding-obama-birth-certificate-pdf-validity-foxnews.html</a></p>

<p>You will also note that in the article (which you probably won&#39;t bother to read because it will contradict your fragile worldview), Tremblay admits that although he saw no evidence of tampering <strong>&quot;I am not an expert on OCR&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;I’m not a detective specialized in the forgery of electronic documents.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The truth is that the overwhelming weight of expert opinion is that the document posted on the White House website was created on a computer, and is not a scan of a real document. </p>

<p>Here are ten experts who are convinced the document is an electronic forgery:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a fair comparison because the view that My Little Pony is a lame show is very clearly just a subjective opinion. It&#39;s not a true or false statement; it&#39;s just a perspective. </p>

<p>On <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, though, there are a lot of people who post not opinions, but factually incorrect statements in the hopes of getting others to believe them. This is completely different and ethically dangerous. If you see someone lying to others, you have a moral obligation to try to correct the record (heh). </p>

<p>If someone were to just post a conspiracy <em>opinion</em> like &quot;Isn&#39;t this aliens conspiracy cool?!&quot;, then obviously there&#39;s no reason to do a fact check. </p>

<p>Which is exactly the problem, too many people think their opinions aren&#39;t subjective because there is some consensus or sources familiar with the situation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hardly moral.  It&#39;s a party imperative on Reddit.  800 plus anti-trump subs resisting but everyone is freaking out about the_donald.

<p>The consensus defense warriors are no more backed by truth than anyone else here.  Hell I even had one dude start mocking me because I said we are in an ice age.  Turns out he doesn&#39;t know shit about the climate yet here is comes defending the consensus, backed with arrogant confidence that he is being objective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Clinton was not the guy behind media deregulation. The 1996 Act was sponsored by Republicans, passed by a Republican Congress, supported by a large number of Democrats to the point of being veto-proof and signed by Bill Clinton who could not have stopped it.</p>

<p>I am not saying this is right and I am not saying the 1996 Act did not do <em>additional damage</em>. I am saying that Ronald Reagan and Republicans invented media deregulation as government policy and did the most of it.</p>

<p>By the time Bill Clinton came along, things had already become so bad that eight giant companies controlled 90 percent of the information stream.</p>

<p>I posted more details about Ronald Reagan&#39;s deregulation <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8k7596/trust_and_distrust_in_conspiracy_theorist_circles/dz6x9wy/">here</a></p>

<p>Question: Why is it that everyone knows about the 1996 Act and pretty much no one knows what Ronald Reagan did? Probably because the information stream is largely skewed toward oligarchs and Republicans that we are not even getting the most basic information out. It&#39;s just blame Bill Clinton all the time. </p>

<p>As if there wouldn’t be a list of names in a fake shooting. </p>

<p>Think if I show up on r/nfl spouting strong opinions about pro football and deriding the normal users that no one is going to notice I’m an interloper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the worst places on the internet to discuss real conspiracy stuff, anyone that&#39;s really into it - isn&#39;t it doing it much here, trust me. So that argument falls apart pretty quickly. </p>

<p>r/nfl? Yeah if you were being really disingenuous someone might check your post history and call you out but, having no post history in r/nfl doesn&#39;t prove you&#39;re not a real NFL fan, just means you haven&#39;t posted in that subreddit. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t post here much at all because it&#39;s a shitshow. Ive been into conspiracy stuff since the 80&#39;s when it was all magazines and talk radio shows. By your reasoning you&#39;d say I&#39;m a shill because my reddit history doesn&#39;t show you any of that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate that being skeptical and asking for more evidence means I’m a shill. It’s lazy, boring and does nothing to improve a theory.</p>

<p>I had a great debate over a World War Two theory I disagreed with because of overarching evidence on the grand scale of the war at large, but it’s my favorite post on here to date. </p>

<p>Two people openly discussing a situation, civilly while disagreeing the whole time.</p>

<p>There was no hostility, no name calling, no dismissal and more importantly, the theory still has small scale merit and because of it I’m looking for similar scenarios that could back up the original claim.</p>

<p>Compare that to a recent exchange where I’m being personally attacked for daring to ask for actual evidence, logistical supply companies etc that could enable the claim. Nope, I’m a shill because I read and ask questions.</p>

<p>This subreddit could be amazing, more than the sum of its parts, but because very few people want to flesh out ideas, build evidence or even entertain the possibility that they are wrong? It’s far less than the sum of its parts, waiting for people to evolve beyond their own petty nature.</p>

<p>The layers thing has been debunked repeatedly:</p>

<p>No, they have not, stop spreading disinfo. Jean-Claude Tremblay was deliberately misquoted by Fox News and he has gone on the record to say so.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.proficiografik.com/2011/05/02/rectifications-regarding-obama-birth-certificate-pdf-validity-foxnews.html">http://www.proficiografik.com/2011/05/02/rectifications-regarding-obama-birth-certificate-pdf-validity-foxnews.html</a></p>

<p>You will also note that in the article (which you probably won&#39;t bother to read because it will contradict your fragile worldview), Tremblay admits that although he saw no evidence of tampering <strong>&quot;I am not an expert on OCR&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;I’m not a detective specialized in the forgery of electronic documents.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The truth is that the overwhelming weight of expert opinion is that the document posted on the White House website was created on a computer, and is not a scan of a real document. </p>

<p>Here are ten experts who are convinced the document is an electronic forgery:</p>

<p>And here is a very good talk-through of why the Obama LFBC is a blatant fraud.</p>
