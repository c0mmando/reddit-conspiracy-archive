       I am adding to this comment chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love porn, I am a fucking freak of nature apparently for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I have noticed recently TONS of incest, simulated rape, simulated death, violent porn in the last few months, especially simulated death porn, I have absolutely why and it kills my boner, I wanna watch a girl cream like Niagara falls with a dildo, not watch some random dude pretend to kill a girl? Like legit, I watched a quick one the one day, just to see what the fuck its actually about, and there was no sex, it was just about getting off simulating killing/choking someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not seem natural, but its becoming truly excessive. The funny thing is, I use a website to download from that lets you see popular/recent downloads per site, and I can see that NONE of the violent porn is being downloaded, EXCEPT the rape videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly disgusting and I wish they just added more female ejaculation videos instead of this shit to the internet.

       I feel like incest porn was created not out of demand for it, but for some other reason. Most ppl who watch incest porn are probably just doing it because the girl is super hot

       I agree completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The divorce rate has been shit for decades and porn has been free on sites like this for a long time. I remember there was always the incest stuff floating around, like on a page of videos/links there might be one or two mentions of it depending on where you were, but in the last few years thereâs been a tremendous uptick, to where itâs like every third video at least. I would say a lot of people donât really read the descriptions but Iâm not sure. I tend to read the descriptions now because I had a bad experience with one of those cuckold/shaming videos - kind of like you said - Whatâs the big deal? Hot chick, probably not even her real husband, whatâs the harm? Well, randomly skipping forward I catch a glimpse of her forcing the husband to suck off the other dude. Iâm not homophobic. I didnât eat Chickfila for a year because of where they were sending their money. But put simply, it wasnât what I signed up for and a âheads upâ would have been nice.
      </p>

       You know those nutty-ass bible beaters who have all kinds of outlandish beliefs about certain things really being a secret effort to make everyone gay? Like I said, outlandish. But this is the one area that gives me pause in respect to all that. Could this method be used as some form of social engineering? Iâm at a loss to say specifically how a rise in incest is going to help anyone but therapists and abortion clinics, but maybe this is just a test run for something like pedos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like maybe the pedo rings running everything decided to try to desensitize everyone to things with an ick factor of 10, so itâs not so shocking when they roll out their own. (Which they might
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to do given the huge increase in rings getting busted lately.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would have told me ten years ago that the biggest porn sites in the world in 2018 heavily feature incest porn, I would have laughed you all the way back into your time machine.

       Yeah dude. Porn directed at males is getting more and more fucked up. And being addicted to porn is terrible , it has ruined some of my relationships. I can only hope that myself and others struggling to quit porn can one day live a life free of it.

       A better question is to ask why so much porn is free?
      </p>
      <p>
       This question has been brought up before and I've never really seen a convincing answer. The conventional explanation is that free pics/videos gets ad revenue or it's worth it because the free stuff gets people to pay for more access.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy either or those, because if they were true... you'd see free mainstream content done the same way. E.g. there's be a TV website where they offered episodes that you stream for free and every network and movie studio would do the same thing. But they don't, do they?
      </p>
      <p>
       So then the question still stands. Why free porn?
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer is that it fits in with an overall agenda of social engineering. If you look at what has changed since 50 years ago, the change has been away from reproductive forms of sexual behavior (heterosexual) and towards non-reproductive forms (gay, lesbian, anal, oral, masturbation etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Porn fits right in with that. An digital harem of infinite variety that's never more than a mouse-click away. What better way to divert interest away from the real thing?

       Not saying there isn't an agenda going on with porn, but most TV channels where I live also offer most of their own TV shows on their website, for free + ads.

       I think the porn industry was ahead of the game in regards to the online take over of a lot of industries. Things like the music biz, movies, etc... lost billions of dollars by not going with the flow of things online. They finally caught up but by that time, it was too late. Other companies had already taken advantage of it. The porn industry is no different but they are much more willing to see the future and embrace it, other than just keep with the same old same old.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer your question, it would make some sort of sense. People's live's have been ruined by porn, same as drugs or any type vice. And we all know the CIA's involvement in drugs. Then them using that money for black ops and funding their shadow govt.

       They do actually. Gomovies does the same thing pornhub does, they buy servers to constantly stream any movie you want, and all you have to do is click out of some cancerous data mining ad in another window and you can watch it for free. Everything on the site is littered with ads as well but it works, and Iâm sure thereâs sites out there for TV shows that does the same thing potlucker/gomovies/pornhub is doing.

       It's free because people don't want monthly subscriptions to show up on their credit card bill.  You used to be able to just pay cash for a video or magazine, but now that it's online everything's trackable.  Most married people don't want to put a credit card up, so the porn industry found other ways to monetize.

       It was stolen from actual porn companies who paid for all the production and got nothing in return. The big porn websites hosting this made so much money off advertisements they bought out the original producers when they tried to enforce their copyrights and here we are.

       Its an interesting point, but what about the simpler reason that the porn industry has actual competition that controls prices. Othe entertainment industries are literal monopolies or effective cartels.

       Not part of an agenda of social change. But what I've heard is that the free movies get you to click on shitty ads loaded with viruses that slave your computer into data mining or processing bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another difference? These sites have to constantly keep rotating/changing up their urls because they get taken down. Free porn sites stay the same for years.

       "via torrent sites and the like". You compare a cumbersome pirating method to just typing a website's url, clicking/tapping on a video and diddling yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have music or regular movie sites where all you need to do is type the website (WITHOUT an account!), watch/listen to anything you want and then do a physical sexual activity where you end up dumping your baby-making goo into your own hand?

       Blackmail comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Honeypot is when a group is able to seduce a person into a compromised situation.
This can be tricky.  Not everyone will fall for the lady in the red dress.
      </p>
      <p>
       By mining porn history they can build a dossier on someone that includes their sexual interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, when they send in the controlled escort they can be sure that they are aiming correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, if your goal was to blackmail a prominent married business man.  A look at his porn history might tell you that a male escort is the way to do that.  Or a blue dress.  Or grey stockings.  Blonde.  Redhead.  Whatever.  Just look at the search terms and the last video seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge is power.

       Well, the very nature of this is secretive.  The agency involved and the blackmailed individual would both have strong reason to keep it quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get hints of the old way sometimes, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Craig Spence White House call boy scandal, for instance, could be a possible one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's tricky.  An agency would just be using what the subject already likes and does.  The only difference is the leverage of proof with pictures or video.

       Wikipedia and CIA.gov's own archives on Project MK Ultra say they filmed politicians in hotel rooms having sex or even murdering young boys to blackmail them for either black funding (off the record) to keep the projects going (brainwashing/hypnotism related) or to keep them from talking.

       no idea what link would even exist for something like that but I certainly wouldn't be surprised. The algorithm seems to point people to more and more depraved shit as they watch, more and more incest, violent hentai, and the like seem to have flooded the front pages of those who don't even watch that absurd stuff. I wish people to watch as they please but it's just not something I'm subscribed to.
