    <div class="md"><p>Well, depends on the perspective. If you feel already defeated and have nihilistic views (I&#39;ve seen your hate towards the Bible and God on this sub a few times before) because of personal shortcomings, you might think that way. I used to be the same way for pretty much my first 20-something years, so I&#39;m not judging and only mean well. 
At some point I met the right woman, there&#39;s a full commitment, full love and traditional, Christian worldviews. Children are a natural consequence then, especially if you&#39;re white and live in a country that&#39;s turning darker every day. I&#39;d like to preserve my gene pool, our ancestry and all that, so in that sense I&#39;d love to have as many children as my wife can carry. Of course it&#39;s probably not going to be this way, but I don&#39;t believe that life in this world is going to end, so I&#39;m gonna keep having a few more children. It is extremely difficult when you&#39;re aware of the state of the world and don&#39;t participate in everything that harms you, it&#39;s even more difficult being responsible for more people, but it&#39;s more than worth it (if the material plane is less important to you than the emotional, spiritual and more &#39;real feeling&#39; one). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in that and has nothing to do with racism or any of that. Immigrants are as much victims as the caretaking population and is a whole multi-facetted topic by itself. I&#39;m sympathetic, but also see what it does to everyone involved, cultures, traditions and the whole marxist warfare against common sense and truth. I want everyone to flourish and live as naturally intended. That involves people living where they&#39;re coming from, for their own wellbeing, health, traditions and customs. There&#39;s a reason why it didn&#39;t work out in Babylon or anywhere else in the world for that matter. </p>

<p>I wish people that comment in the economic inequality threads would see this. &quot;Oh just slave away for 40+ years and then when you go to finally enjoy life, you die of a heart attack 6 months into retirement.&quot; Not to say you should plunge yourself into tons of debt to &quot;live in the moment&quot; either though. Balance is important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This cannot be said enough. Be present with your loved ones and be present to where you are and don&#39;t get lost in all this speculation. Once you wake up you need to stop trying to wake up again and again or else you&#39;ll go crazy.</p>

<p>I have a friend whose &quot;woke&quot; and he can&#39;t stop reading about politics and conspiracy...so much that he has alienated all his friends around him and made himself mentally unbalanced. The &quot;conspiracy&quot; got to him and now he is a useless member of society because his head is lost in clouds of &quot;righteousness and despair&quot; from all his &quot;research&quot;.</p>

<p>Know thyself.</p>

<p>The enormity of what we are speculating on, high octane or not, is soul crushing so you have to pace yourself. You can&#39;t read about, for example, &quot;elite pedophilia&quot;, in depth, without having some sort of soul wrenching blow to your world view and how you view humanity...so you have to take a break. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This past weekend while having a few beers, I &quot;red-pilled&quot; (I dont really like that term) a buddy about various conspiracy theories I have researched. Primarily 9/11, MK Ultra and false flags that got the US into war. </p>

<p>He was really receptive, but I could see it take a an emotional toll on him. Comprehending that the US is actually quite nefarious, questioning the legitimacy of wars his grandfather fought in, truly put him in a bad state that I was responsible for.  </p>

<p>We changed subjects but towards the end of the night he asked me, &quot;Why do you want to know that stuff? What can you even do about it?&quot;</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t really know the answer but I&#39;m not going to stop trying to find truth. But I also don&#39;t want to cause pain to my friends and family. </p>
