<p>Not only is the top comment in the above thread one which contains no evidence, the entire thread itself is devoid of evidence. </p>

<p>As conspiracy theorists, we presumably question the claims of mainstream media outlets, right?</p>

<p>So do you think I could go to r/baking and ask for a scone recipe and the top comment wouldn&#39;t be a recipe?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t people just post evidence of a shooting? Post it here now. Compile it all so that it soundly refutes the idea of a fake shooting by its vividness and overwhelming quantity.</p>

<p>Why so scared of posting evidence guys? Personally I don&#39;t assert or believe anything I can&#39;t even halfway-demonstrate to be true.</p>

<p>And before anyone asks me to prove a shooting was fake, that&#39;s not how the burden of proof works, nor have I claimed this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you claim to be doing one thing (seeking evidence) but are actually only casting your own doubts on the backs of grieving communities and parents you are not actually doing anything.  </p>

<p>The reporters have presented significant amounts of evidence,  a picture of the shooter and victims narratives about a common event and motive. If you want more evidence go and seek it don&#39;t just thumb your nose at the people who probably aren&#39;t the least concerned about whether it not you believe them.  They are most likely the only ones who could provide the evidence you would deem sufficient. And you asking them doesn&#39;t make you a savvy skeptic it makes you insensitive at best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a conspiracy subreddit right? Not a let&#39;s see who gets hurt if we talk about this or that topic, the fact that there could be families who lost people is obviously sad even for those who question the narrative, but it is our job to question it no matter what panties bunch up, obviously have tact. Most people here don&#39;t give a fuck about peoples sensitivity and they shouldn&#39;t asking questions shouldn&#39;t be a crime, being afraid of answers and people looking for truth is more of an issue for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a crime to ask questions and if it were you would be in jail.  At the same time people can and will react to you with down votes when they think that your questions are ill timed lacking tact or sensitivity. If you think being A skeptic means only questioning the official narrative then you need to review skepticism and standards of evidence and be realistic about the difference between looking for actual conspiracies and looking to believe what you want to believe. If you first reaction to need of a shooting is to call bs then I don&#39;t think you are applying skepticism correctly in a country with more guns And gun violence than any other in the first world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well proof SHOULD be easily acquired, america also has cameras everywhere, but somehow concrete proof that can shut theorists up barely ever comes out. I understand your sentiment. A skeptic is just someone who is harder to convince, life is a gray area there is no correct or incorrect in how you look at questioning things.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, again, merely a list of victims. That really proves anyone got shot to you? Because you know if there were going to be a fake shooting you would probably still need to have a list of victims don’t you think?</p>

<p>I just don’t see how that proves that a bullet hit anything or anyone. Maybe you can explicitly demonstrate how it is conclusive evidence of a shooting. Or try again with more proof, since there should be a growing pile by now — if the shooting were real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude from a standpoint we can&#39;t prove that anything is real, for that matter how would I go about even proving that I am real to you? But again we know that people seem to exist as do guns and where they intersect people often die. </p>

<p>You draw a weird line ethically between a group ostensibly willing to fake a bunch of child  murders so that they could take away you guns to control and enslave the populace but willing to risk faking it with all the million ways such a plot could be found out.  I submit to you that Governments kill people all the time without batting an eye. </p>

<p>Project Northwoods was a plan to do just that kill American citizens to push public opinion towards willingness to accept c am unpopular policy goal.  Knowing this I would say that the idea of crisis actors and fake shootings just pushes well past the wall of an extraordinary claim,</p>

<p>Therefore my Initial reaction when seeing photos of grieving parents and shattered lives is sympathy.  Is it more likely that hundreds of people can keep a mammoth secret including entire towns, or more likely that someone would really kill little Kids to get what they want? They would take the risk of faking it all to save a few lives?  what evil plan could they have that requires disarming us that doesn&#39;t involve the likelihood of killing some of us who resist?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need concrete proof of anything to apply occham&#39;s razor to this and use logic to determine the most likely narrative here.</p>

<p>I submit to you that you can’t prove that statement without resorting to an appeal to authority, to emotion, or similar fallacy.</p>

<p>Your <em>programmed response</em>?</p>

<p>Mine too, by the way. I just reserve it for actual grieving parents and not conceptual ones, especially not the kind who grandstand within days (or hours!) of a “tragedy” instead of mourning privately, all while being unable to shed a real tear on camera.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes. Do you know all the trade secrets of your favourite tech company? What about the family spaghetti sauce recipe? Keeping secrets isn’t hard. Especially not when NDAs, financial incentives and possibly threats/blackmail/coercion are involved too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you equivocating due process executions (and their many layers and years of appeals) with “shootings”?</p>

<p>Is voluntarily signing up for “war” even remotely similar to a government spontaneously gunning down its own citizens?</p>

<p>Do you honestly believe either of these examples even tangentially supports your position?</p>

<p>Good luck to you too... you’ll need it more than I will :)</p>

The other post was made almost immediately after the shooting, where it wasn&#39;t really possible to confirm or deny anything as almost nothing was even known at the time, yet the post was worded as if OP didn&#39;t even consider it being a real shooting at all.      </p>

<p>I also asked him what proof would he like, that we could have reasonable access to (no one is going to post photos of dead children online...). Also don&#39;t think I got an answer to that one.       </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally believe these were hoaxed, but it&#39;s a valid point in a conspiracy related forum, and on top of that, if people responded with even minuscule pieces of evidence, it would make a handy one-stop reference point for future false flag claims.
