    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. It makes perfect sense. The people my age and some a bit older seem to speak in references often. They binge watch stuff. They consume internet culture as dogma. They&#39;d rather watch then converse. Conversations about shows/movies are the most common. Most aren&#39;t good. Some shows are good. The ones young people like are comic dramas that deal with the frailty of the human condition like Bojack Horseman, are directly satirical, like South Park, or show the dark side of tech like Black Mirror. As far as the fictional realm goes. Those are pretty much the only good ones. Since they ruined Louis CK. The documentary movies out there if brought up will turn people off immediately. People partially know that in order to fit in, at least in a large city, they must make concessions of their personality, privacy, outlook, discussion subjects opinions, to the point where the folks who appear to have &quot;made it&quot; here are also indistinguishable from one another. To the point where when I see them I have no memory of them. &quot;Telling it like it is--or at least as I see it&quot; is probably why they remember me, but they may still fault me for it. Since I graduated college in the past couple years I&#39;ve grown dejected because I live in one of the poorest cities in the country. There is rampant homelessness. People scream at nothing more than I&#39;ve seen. There have been riots, yet so many seem to wish everything okay. They also flaunt their wealth. I liked the south better. They didn&#39;t pull that shit there.</p>

You read them stories about fictional characters who can fly, about the prince and the princess, about animals that can talk, etc... you don&#39;t start with exposing children to the Truth : &quot;look, boy, I am going to tell you what really happened during ww2, and next I&#39;m going to explain you how the reserve bank system is the biggest scam ever, and finally how your life is gonna suck no matter what you do&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything in your post man. As far as religion whatever works for you. I’m an atheist but I don’t judge anyone based on their view. Our reality is really weird in the sense that I find myself on a different wavelength than the people around me. Not in a weird spiritual or metaphysical way but I sense that everyone is so asleep, or distracted to notice the masquerade that is constantly going on. What has become so clear to me seems to elude everyone around me. Maybe it takes certain experiences to notice these things but I’m glad I was brought up questioning everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that a lot of the things that you have mentioned here are correct. This has been my experience also, except for the Christianity part. Christianity represents one more con to me. But, the main part of your post about how we live in a fictional world is correct. But, I am slightly different from you again in that I think that these fictions are bad for us in general and therefore should be avoided. Especially for children, who cannot tell the difference between reality and fiction. </p>

<p>All the lies led me to the truth of Christ. I felt so empty all of the time, and I explored everything there was to explore in regards to happiness: Money, success, beauty, every single type of religion and spirituality, relationships, etc. There was always a sense of emptiness until I found Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you say this, because this is precisely how I&#39;ve been feeling recently. The red pilling, and realizing the amount of lies that surrounds us led made me feel empty at some point, and then led me to the same conclusion, that the truth is with Jesus. I say that as someone who was not raised with faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unable to bring awareness to my loved ones about environmental collapse, short term human extinction, and all sorts of human trafficking going on behind the scenes, advanced technology, I don&#39;t know what the fuck to do and find myself redpilled by all this shit, but stuck in the bluepill world, so it&#39;s like living uncomfortably purple hammered between extreme materialism and consumption and excess on one end, and the bullshit spirituality, whether it&#39;s the usual mainstream religious garbage or New Age woo, and so I find myself sucked back into believing in a higher power to fix this shit, I have no fucking clue what to do, other than live with some belief things will be restored as they were meant to be eventually, no matter how much it takes.</p>

<p>That said, I think even within the corruption of Hollywood, there&#39;s still good people working within to bring down the cabal. I watched Deadpool 2 and I like to think of Ryan Reynolds bring one of the actors within Hollywood working within to bring evil to justice, maybe even secret agents who are part of an ongoing civil war against the evil of the world.</p>

<p>I believe in God through Christ still, I was baptised Anglican after all. If my loved ones are burning in Hell though, that Christ can spit me the fuck out and let me burn with the Eskimos and Amazon jungle tribes that never knew him either. And even if I believe, I&#39;ve got my debts to pay, as a Christian I would rather see virtuous heathens in Heaven than faithful scumbags like me.</p>

<p>After all, what the rulers of the world would want is for people to use their faiths to exclude all others and non-practitioners. &quot;Oh atheists are so cold and empty, yada yada...&quot; &quot;Oh believers are so fucking stupid and zealous, bla bla blah...&quot;</p>

<p>Ah shut up, I don&#39;t think Christ&#39;s a cunt that&#39;s gonna turn away good men of no faith before the second death. Not Yeshua&#39;s fault the Bible got hijacked by the powers that be, if a book&#39;s divine in this world it&#39;s gonna get edited is how I believe it&#39;s still the Book of God, or at least the original Bible, whatever it may have said before the Roman Catholic church and other denominations had their way with the poor book.</p>

<p>A good God I suspect is humbly fucking sorry for the way His followers abused my best friend who&#39;s transgender, and her boyfriend&#39;s an atheist like my mother is. If they&#39;re going to Hell for that alone and throw away the rest of their goodness, the God I&#39;ve been praying to&#39;s responsible for the suffering that goes on in the world, I&#39;ll rot with them and in their place if it means an ability for them to escape the traps and snares.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some prayers I find myself making a lot, feels like a placebo but it feels good anyways.</p>

<p>My best friends are gonna go somewhere in the entertainment industry, and I hope they find the right balance of fame and power they need to redpill people with all the horrible shit that goes on, uncover it, be wise enough to do the balancing acts required with the chaos of the world, make a better one with better knowledge of evil to prevent it from rising back up.</p>

<p>My mother and brother, I hope they become less materialistic and use money better, less bullshit yoga retreats, and more genuine introspection, appreciation for the world, for my mother to help reform public education towards models that encourage critical thinking instead of the current standard factory approach.</p>

<p>Antarctica deserves to be preserved as a wilderness. There&#39;s gotta be secret technology and shit the government&#39;s hiding that&#39;ll clean up the plastic and acid and radiation in the oceans, do something to re-oxygenize dead areas, more efficient agriculture, more planets to colonize, that sort of stuff.</p>

<p>This life is Hell enough and most people aren&#39;t even aware of it. By God, I hope to see someone like either Tulsi Gabbard or Cynthia McKinney or Bernie Sanders in the white house, and the psychopathic corporate, political and occult masters ruling over America and the world brought down and make way for a better world, however much time and effort that may take.</p>

<p>Utopia feels like a delusion, but maybe one day, with or without me, my loved ones and their descendants will be hiking the Valles Marineris on Mars, flooded into a new channel, with forests and what biomes it may support, a new Earth added to the Solar System and the planet known as Venus as well, whatever ways may happen to make the Solar System humanity&#39;s home among the stars, freed from its ages-old alien oppressors as of yet ambiguous and unknown to the public, reptilian or greys or whatever forms they may be, leaving this Solar System open only to aliens who seek co-existence and creation instead of exploitation and harm.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the truth, Bible and science and everything, I probably don&#39;t have the patience for it, but may the people who matter have that time and patience and wisdom and effort I could have made but wasted.</p>

<p>Thank you for writing, and God be with you and save you from the soul trap, freedom from the Matrix and illusions of the Antichrist, and bring you more like-minded people to help you in your efforts. I&#39;ve done mine, up to God if he&#39;s got any more uses for me, and willpower for me to make those efforts.</p>
