       Elon Musk has been shitting on Corporate Media today, says he's going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …](

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Pravda was a Russian broadsheet that used to be the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The word is Russian for "Truth"
      </p>
      <p>
       (James O'keefe also published a book called American Pravda this year, but idk if Musk is a Project Veritas fan or it's just a coincidence
      </p>
      <p>
       First this tweet:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999355619390865408">
        The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Leading to
       <a href="https://electrek.co/2018/05/23/tesla-tsla-rally-media-negativity-increasingly-immaterial-baird/">
        this article on negative coverage of Tesla in the news
       </a>
       , quoting a Baird auto analyst who says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Negative headlines have increased substantially in the past month and, in our opinion, increasingly immaterial reports have dominated news cycles. We think we have hit a peak in negative coverage/sentiment, and believe shares could appreciate significantly with execution, which should coincide with an improvement in sentiment.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A Verge reporter replies "Musk continues his slow transformation into a media-baiting Trump figure screaming irrationally about fake news. Hope it works out for you dude!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Musk responds, [Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.]("
       <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999357298861486080">

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464">
        Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999369623484039168">
        Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.

        If you’re in media &amp; don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wall Street Journal has already written
       <a href="http://archive.is/66HZ7">
        an article on it
       </a>
       (not for or against though) noting that Musk says things like this often without following through, but adding that :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One journalist retweeted Mr. Musk’s comments with a link to a California filing for a business incorporated last October called Pravda Corp., involving a person connected with other Musk ventures.
        <a href="https://archive.is/o/66HZ7/https://twitter.com/meharris/status/999372255237832704%20%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD?mod=article_inline">
         “Er, he’s not kidding,” wrote the journalist, Mark Harris.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The article also notes "Mr. Musk’s proposal triggered criticism and praise, with some comparing his dislike of the media to that of President Donald Trump." Guess that means elon musk is literally Hitler now ¯_(ツ)_/¯

       Looks can be decieving. For instance take the Obama deep state. You'd figure it would have democrats, however once you go down the list (McCabe, Rossenstein, Comey, Mueller, and so on) you find out thevonky Democrats in power are Obama and Hillary.

       Are you serious? Your last sentence is so mind-boggling and fallacious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between you, myself, and Elon Musk
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the billion dollars. Besides just the money comes influence and power - the two things required to make any change in this country anymore. Elon Musk without a billion dollars is like Tony Stark without his fortune. Elon Musk seems to be taking an active approach to improving some aspects of this life while he’s living. More so than any other billionaire I’ve heard of. To assume Elon Musk can’t help the world as a billionaire is literally the opposite of the truth. Elon Musk is able to help the world almost entirely because he is a billionaire. Many of the ideas and plans Elon Musk is working on are not possible without his massive amount of wealth. He would be just another guy on the internet posting ideas and hopes for a better society with no avenue to actually make those things happen. Just like you and I, buddy.

       You take everything you hear literally, tell me what he has done? I'm not talking about donating to charities as we all know most of the money donated to charities goes to administration costs. He can't even provide a safe work place for his workers. But he's this rich super space man so everyone will turn a blind eye. Where he got his money is questionable in itself. He's got all these super duper cool ideas like the free hyper train thing for Americans but until I see that happening I take everything with a grain of salt. And I'll refer to home for me when Tasmania put in the huge hydro power plant. The selling pitch was once taxes had payed it off Tasmanian's would get free power not to mention the thing can provide for the whole state. But that never happened, instead they started selling power to the state of Victoria.
I'm not denying that Musk is making good technology but he's not changing the world, He's a capitalist and that's how he got so rich, and you dont get that rich without stepping on heads.

       This was true but has since changed drastically:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The company did release more recent data, which indicates its record of safety incidents went from slightly above the industry average in late 2016, to a performance in the first few months of 2017 that was 32% better than average. The company said that its decision to add a third shift, introduce a dedicated team of ergonomics experts, and improvements to the factory’s “safety teams” account for the significant reduction in incidents since last year.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why aren't you complaining about other auto-manufacturers? It seems clear that, as of now, Tesla is far from the most unsafe conditions to work in. To add to this, Elon Musk commented on this himself saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We’re a money-losing company,” Musk added. “This is not some situation where, for example, we are just greedy capitalists who decided to skimp on safety in order to have more profits and dividends and that kind of thing. It’s just a question of how much money we lose. And how do we survive? How do we not die and have everyone lose their jobs?”

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you know anything about the history of Tesla, then you understand there have been a few situations that risked the entire company as they were essentially burning through money with no profits. Had Elon not pushed his workers, Tesla might not be in the position it is today. I don't see any evidence that an employee was ever forced to continue working either.

       Well for starters, you have to be wealthy to own a Tesla and hence I am an automotive spraypainter and earn less than what the car is worth a year I can't exactly afford it so how can I give it a bad review?
Secondly I'll refer to a latter comment of mine: Here is another post from his twitter:
No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class “lords &amp; commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get
       <em>
        rid
       </em>
       of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.

       No he's bitching about Unions. UAW being the united automobile workers union. So guess what? This is quite close to home for me.
The fact that he's saying unions want a two class system is a load of crap. Unions want workers to have more rights and say in a workplace over the ultra rich scum bags like Musk.

       Fighting racism is the dumbest concept. Moving forward, realize that the only thing "fighting racism" is meant to do is displace white people from their homelands. Only white people need to let all others overwhelm their population to the point of no longer having their own culture and civilization. Import the 3rd world, become the 3rd world.

       That couldn’t even be further from the truth. Seriously? If you don’t believe the ideology of liberals that means you’re a racist? Just because someone disagrees with your political views doesn’t mean they can’t be good people. Stop being close-minded and wake up.

       Yeah. We call them democrats. Or liberals. Especially since they also call themselves that usually. I remember when being an SJW was touted as a good thing like 6 years ago. Its just that their movement has shot itself in the foot a lot.

       I like how neither of you paid attention to the part where I said obvious good and obvious evil are illusions. I'm not a religious person. In the real world you make complex decisions based on real world criteria. I know you both are more concerned with feeling righteous than real life, so ignore this too.

       Right, and liberals would agree we should fix those problems before other countries' problems. Sending 4 billion here and there is about using soft power to maintain influence over the world. It's a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions of dollars a revamp of our infrastructure would cost.
      </p>

       As a liberal I would say tax the rich more to pay for it. That's usually where conservatives would disagree.

       People in this sub shit on other people and suggest they have mental health issues when they get cornered in an argument based on facts and actual events. Excuse me if I'm a little cynical about the motives behind all the crying based on this. Yes, reality and perception are often widely different but that argument is based entirely on the presumption that there are no knowable facts upon which to make decisions. It seems that's the common thread in this thread.

       This is correct, but being in a sub about

       you might want to remember that not all conspriacies are true. There are well documented research that shows the problems with conspiratioral thinking that really hampers the conspiracy community. For every MK-Ultra exposing muckraker there are 10 people of the type who don't believe the Earth is round or that every scientist in the world is lying about verifiable data.

       So when one goes against the popular opinion, they need to make sure they aren't going against verfiable data in the belief that it's "opinions" or conspriacies.

       Disgraceful. I'm sure if you are on the left this seems great. It is like when you have that player on your team that plays a bit dirty and everyone else hates them. I think we are fucked either way, right or left. I think people are just tired of being fed bullshit and anyone who calls them on it is going to do well.

       Bullshit that supposedly supports my views does nothing but push away the people that can actually see through it, and that's the last thing i want. 
Jordan Peterson mostly opposes the radical left, it's god damn stupid to think that that makes him an alt-righter. This news just pushes away people, nothing else.

       He has stated that if he ran for political office he would do so with the LPC. It would be a healthy change for the LPC or CPC to have somebody focused of individual freedoms over group identity. One day we will stop the left right debate and focus on the authoritarian and libertarian divide.

       This type of news happens on all sides. It is all of news. Even sports which should be very cut and dry. This is why ESPN has turned to crap. They have added all of this bullshit to sports that is biased or skewed for clicks and views. It is great for major market teams, but gut wrenching for the rest.

       Why does Peterson act as though classical liberalism isn't itself an ideology? The very fact he speaks of fellow classic liberals as something other than ideologues is evidence he himself is an ideologue.

       That logic is absolutely wrong... acknowledging an ideologue or an ideologies existence doesn’t make you one. Any reasonable person should reject your premise and thus your conclusion. He would say he doesn’t like the concept of any party or any kind of identity politics. Where he lies on a spectrum is likely reason and value based. He acknowledges where people are on a spectrum but he doesn’t like people being just left or right. I’m all over the spectrum depending on evidence and my own values. I don’t blindly want to support something because the blanket ideological group may cover most of what I think or more than the other side. Sides are stupid and distract from discussing real solutions. And I imagine he feels the same. You should look into what an ideologue is.

       Not at all. It tells me you, like Peterson, are misusing the term. You apply your own definitions to terms without context and expect everyone else to accept your misuse. You're muddying language, as is Peterson. Which, ironically, is something Peterson claims to stand against.

       And yeah, dude. Totally. I've never engaged in a conversation where either party utilized the term 'ideology' or 'ideologue' until now. I searched the term to prove that you're the ignoramus misusing terms, not me. Nice attempt trying to turn that around on me to deflect from your own ignorance, though. Really shows you're willing to engage in discourse in good faith and integrity.

       I don't think that's profound for most people. For some, absolutely, but in nations of 350,000,000+ even
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       can mean millions. I think he's doing G-d's work, but classic liberalism is itself an ideology and Peterson is himself an ideologue.

       Enh, that's playing a bit fast and loose with the meaning of ideologue. Simply adhering to most of a particular philosophical paradigm is not equivalent to being an ideologue. Being an ideologue entails doing the former along with hubristic certitude, irrational dogmatism.

       1) Agree. But I really doubt he's actually going to do this, he's pissed about the media fucking with him and being dishonest - but for a billionaire genius like Musk, this is the equivalent of a normal person saying "I oughtta key that asshole's car." He probably won't do it, but he certainly could.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) True, but he addresses that his theoretical site would have to be botproof and actively seek out and unmask any disinfo campaigns. It's right there in the post.

       Ya but even if it does somehow become botproof websites are a reflection of the community at large.  The big things the bots have showed us is they just need to start the social proof ball rolling downhill and real people happily pick it up and push it farther.  I wouldn’t doubt the that T_D was started by bot action but was taken over by real people. CTR took over
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       but I think that community is set towards that thinking now without needing much manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don’t see how to can develop a community and prevent even just normal people from trying to spoof certain ideologies ahead of others.  The messages we do hear tend to be driven by the most vocal people in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I like the idea I just don’t know how even with botproofing it could possibly avoid bias. Never mind most people prefer bias news commentary over unbiased news. Hence why most shows are that way. Even the local news doesn’t seem completely unbiased.

       This is why it can't be based on a community. It has to speak for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to do this would be to show multiple media outlets key points of coverage on a subject on the same page and outline the differences and similarities from each on a given subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example - The Russia investigation. On the page you can see every major media outlets various coverage, from FOX to CNN as well as some international media outlets. Once you get them side by side, you can then see which points all of these outlets share as well as where they differ. What's CNN saying that FOX isn't? And vice versa. What is being said overseas versus what is being said in the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       That also gives you the opportunity for promoting real journalism through investigating what is being excluded from a news cycle altogether. Sure, FOX and CNN might both be covering different talking points on any given subject, but what is it that they are both neglecting that may help inform the public?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been working on this idea for over a year now.

       That is what I’d lean towards as the most interesting but I had some issues with it. First how the hell do you make it consumable especially for mobile users?  If you’re summarizing that needs a ton of man power and also leaves an opening for a 3rd party bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big one is how do you get outside of the box ideas without letting in crazies?  The Iraq war for example. The mainstream media was all for it as a whole. Shit the Syrian stuff now mainstream is totally for but it doesn’t have popular support still. Places like infowars will be against both but then you have to deal with gay frog horseshit which questions who cares if they are anti war even with the best possible argument. The really specialized stuff might not fit into daily stuff. I just can see many puzzle pieces missing when trying to balance a topic out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you figure it out as a libertarian I’m more interested in what’s left off the news rather than what they cover.  I don’t care about stormy Daniels. I’m worried about the insanity in Yemen and the possible collapse of the bond market.

       Does Reddit even try to stop bots though? I'm not saying it's easy, I don't even know if it's possible but if you could hypothetically prevent bots and just have real people talking, it would be much different than Reddit.

       Reddit absolutely stops bots. I bet they ban tens of thousands a day, or prevent them from creating an account in the first place. If they didn't, the site would be completely filled with obvious spam, rather than reposts and clever attempts at making things go viral.
      </p>

       The hundreds of posts from places like r/esist and r/MarchAgainstTrump that were vote-botted onto the front page day after day during 2017 seem to go against that theory.

       Why are you so sure of that? Is there actual reports from reddit about  accounts being banned for these reasons? I haven't seen it. As far as I know they absolutely haven't stopped any bots at all. I have seen no evidence of it. It also seems to go against their interests, they have an incentive to not do it. I would love to know more about how reddit does or doesn't deal with automated accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you so sure that reddit is killing bots rather than it just being the moderators of various subs that stop spam bots? Could it just be that the more subtle kinds of bots are more effective? I've read the articles about how bot accounts will repost older content and then have various accounts repost to that new post popular comments from the previous reposts in order to harvest karma. They subtly build karma on accounts and then use those accounts later to promote other messages, usually for money. If they were overt spam bots they'd just get banned by moderators and that would be that, the subtle kind is more effective than the noisy kind.

       You could definitely make the argument that removing bots and auto-posters would go a long fucking way to at least narrowing it down to actual popular opinion which IMHO is STILL better than what we have now where you can't tell the difference between hired bullshit and honest discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Popular opinion when the public is properly educated is STILL the best and only option. You have to overcome popular opinion or support totalitarian control. There is no in between. You're appealing to some authority with any argument you make, one way or the other. My vote is for the most informed, redundantly researched opinion, verified by multiple sources. These seem like things that could be turned into a process for vetting news and historical accounting of events.

       I just don't believe that everyone's vote and opinion have equal worth. Like you said, they must be properly educated. It irks me that uneducated and emotionally unstable people can cast a vote of equal worth to mine. It's simply not right.

       Oh lots of people think beating children is fine.  Studies say otherwise though.  See?

       Reddit is manipulated by bots.  If Musk were able to make his service botproof (which seems like a big if), it would not be as easy to manipulate.  You could still pay a room full of people in Bangladesh to manually manipulate the results, but that would be nowhere near as efficient and easier to trace.

       Yeah, this is a terrible idea. I'm sure Musk is imagining a billion people just like him signing up to verify stories according to his standards. Take a look at any social media and you'll see how little popularity correlates with quality.

       Yes, an individual's opinion is important. But via point #2, one single person with enough technical know-how can make their singular opinion be counted hundreds, or thousands, or millions of times, depending on the forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Reddit, it only takes a few well placed votes at a critical time, to boost or hide stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the FCC and net neutrality comments, the manipulation was blatant, with no attempt to hide. But there was no need to hide, because the FCC had the political cover to be able to brush it off without repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, how do you make a website that is resistant to these sorts of things?
      </p>
      <p>
       The first step is to probably make all accounts 100% public. The only way to get an account is to have someone verify your identity through SSN, driver's license, birth certificate, etc, and then to publish the Name, City, and State of every account for everyone who participates in that website. Account sign up must be done in person, and the subject's photo should be taken, along with fingerprints. The verification code for accessing the online account should be sent through the mail.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even then, that would still not stop organized groups of people from banding together to try to manipulate the system. Or even people who are willing to sell their voice for money, and say what people want them to say. Or even people who will sign up for their account and then sell it completely. Plenty of homeless people, especially, would gladly trade their identities for some extra dollars.

       This is just another 'money' move.  It'll be every bit as bad as snopes.  He is relying on corporate investment for all of his ventures, don't kid yourselves into thinking he's in any way, shape or form on your side.

       Controlled opposition!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how it works - Left screams "It's black, it's black" - The right screams "It's white, it's white".  Everyone (because our brains are set up that way) chooses a side and gets angry every time the opposing viewpoint is bought up.  Meanwhile the actual plan is grey and is pushed through unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all so cleverly done that nobody even realises they are now slaves.  Take a look at yourself in the morning.  A lot of you will put on at least a keycard or nametag and walk around proudly displaying your 'owners' name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day I see people who are owned by KFC, McDonalds, BurgerKing.  The people who are owned by banks walk around with their ID cards and cryptokeys wrapped around their neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you spend more than 3 hours doing something you don't want to do per day, where the main aim is to make other people wealthier (shareholders or owners) then you are owned.  What part of "Please sir, is it okay if I go on holiday for two weeks next June?"  You aren't fucking free.

       Keep your fucking face down and work boy!

       People need to learn how to figure things out for themselves. People can't just sit around expecting some sort of magical truth machine to appear and always give them 100&amp;#37; unfiltered truth. That mentality just allows propaganda to be even more effective than it already has been. This ridiculous demand for fact checkers just shows how lazy the average person is. They won't spend 5 minutes learning their own local politics, let alone geopolitics. Unless he somehow manages to make it "bot-proof" (good luck with that, pal), it's not a real solution.

       This could be very good, at least in concept. I for one am sick of the media telling the world what to think...or maybe I’m just sick of people listening it the media on what the think. In any case, it’s would be nice to have a system in place to weigh in when a news source is actually just speaking for investors and advertisers. Maybe he should extend the scope of the site to include politicians too. Sort of like a rotten tomato score of how trustworthy a politician is...it’d probably fail once it turned out they’re all rotten.

       But there will still be a sense of fairness assuming each user gets a single vote per article and there is limited cases of paid participation and secondary accounts. The market forces of everyone voting on everything they read (both upvotes and downvotes) will reveal the more moderate of writers with higher ratings of truth. All depending on how Elon arranges the voting process and how much data we get to see.

       Thought experiment time. Let's forget botnets and brigading: we'll work instead with a hypothetical userbase of sufficient number and ideological diversity to be useful. So:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Highly partisan content will tend towards a roughly 50/50 ratio if it gets a lot of eyeballs, regardless of the quality or factual nature of the content (remember, we're assuming a balanced set of users). Less voted items will have more highly imbalanced ratios as they will tend to attract only sympathetic voters. We see this pattern on reddit.
       </li>
       <li>
        Non partisan content that doesn't otherwise rustle any jimmies will be the most upvoted content, especially if it's 'feel-good'. Think youtube or anywhere else that already uses this system. Best article ratio of the week preview: Dude who rescues kittens from shelters and/or spunky cancer kid.
       </li>

        Really downvoted stuff is an interesting question. Some stuff will just be legitimate garbage. But! Consider an article that might cover some sort of controversial topic in a challenging way, provoking a strong, broad based negative reaction. This could be a quality piece of journalism but, because it ruffles almost everyone's feathers, it would end up in the garbage bin.

       Basically, there is nothing new about this model as it's being presented - lots of websites use a similar one, and without any other layer of sorting or curation (think communities in reddit) it's just gonna lead to a bunch of mindless, inoffensive pablum sitting at the top of the queue.

       Yes, this. The stupid shit I did when suffering ideological possession. The mental gymnastics we perform to defend our beliefs that we gained through emotional appeal in the first place. I mean, I think Trump is a horrible SOB, but I also think he's still not as bad as all the media paints him.

       What has he accomplished? Name one thing that was good for the country. I'll wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I've seen is handouts to the very rich, condemning the poor (and not so poor) to die and giving those who hate a platform on the national stage. I've also seen him try to kill net neutrality, environmental regulations, renewable energy. Luckily, there are some good people fighting. Support for turmp makes you a bad person, you are racist and a misogynist, no two ways about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media gives him a pass on most everything. He isn't criticized enough and people that support him haven't been made to feel bad about that stance. Hopefully he doesn't wreck the country too much and we can put things back together better than ever but that's going to take a lot of work and there's no place for nationalism, racism, anti-intellectualism or misogyny in any future USA that is a world power.

       It won't work. Modern news media produces the content it does precisely because news media consumers prefer to read schlock over good reporting. They're  not reading investigative/analytical 1,000+ word feature stories, they are reading a 2-300 word lololol piece of some celebrity caught not wearing underwear.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you create a ratings system like this, most users are going to rate shit based on what they read, and they aren't reading god journalism. The end result will be places like Buzzfeed getting mileage from system, but good/actual journalists will continue to be ignored.

       OK, TD is what it is, and what it is is an alternative to the equally one sided views of r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics and redacted.  Here's how forming a well rounded view of issues works - you go to all the different one sided forums and then make up your own mind.  I'd put more of the views expressed on TD against those of r/news any day of the week, in terms of moron level, as r/news is hysterically ill informed and very willfully so - most of the subs on reddit that purport to discuss any important issues are insistent that opposing views are to be shut down or the user banned.  What you claim are 'obvious falsehoods' are merely views you do not agree with and can not refute on any intellectually honest basis, so you mock and deride instead.  That's not productive to anything other than you reassuring yourself that you're smart despite refusing to consider anything that you disagree with.

       Nonsense.  People in that sub argue all the time.  Now go to r/news and try disagreeing with the DNC party line.  You'll get banned and brigaded immediately.

       No, 'stupid' on r/news is anything that does not comply with the hive mind / DNC talking points.  It is retarded and childish to presume that anyone who disagrees with your perspective must be stupid - but, that seems to be all the libs these days know how to do - silence any opposing views with shrieking and name calling.  I can rattle off at least half a dozen reddit subs that will ban or shadow ban any comment at odds with the DNC party line, so spare me that nonsense that it's only TD that does that.

       There are genuine bots and shills on reddit. That's indisputable. Reddit admins allow them or look the other way. When admins have censored, it has never been reasoned as a way to combat bots and shills, but always as a way to prevent hate speech or content they deem unacceptable.

       Yes news media have a lot of problems, and clicks based news are a big problem, but in reality Tesla target is the same reason why a minor problem with an apple broduct makes the news while the same on a Lenovo wouldn't see the light of day.

       I think if the credibility score is
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       attached to the journalist, this could become much less partisan. The vast majority of journalists lean to the left, sure, but that doesn't mean the vast majority of them first and foremost seek the truth. The vast majority of journalists actually do have integrity and pride themselves on reliably reporting facts in an honest matter, even though they are biased (as all of us are).

       Agreed. Coming from a minor journalist myself, I could actually see something like this working if the score pertains only towards the journalist. Especially in the cases of journalists reporting something and the editors and so forth manipulating it, as I have dealt with in the past. Some editors don't give a shit that some of us risk being arrested to get the truth out to the rest of the world.

       post stories that are 100% fact checked under random names and gradually reduce the quality of peoples votes if they are consistently wrong. this is ofc assuming the system isnt corrupt to begin with and who the fuck even knows anymore. people in power are exploiting technology so excessively that they can get away with absurd amounts of selfishness which lead to this global fiasco of corruption. ugh

        In September 2016 Soros Fund Management advised a private investment fund tied to Quantum Strategic Partners, which injected the bulk of $305 million into SolarCity, producer of solar panels. The flow of cash allowed Elon Musk, chairman of Tesla Motors and SolarCity, to purchase SolarCity and merge it with Tesla.

       People need to learn how to figure things out for themselves. People can't just sit around expecting some sort of magical truth machine to appear and always give them 100&amp;#37; unfiltered truth. That mentality just allows propaganda to be even more effective than it already has been. This ridiculous demand for fact checkers just shows how lazy the average person is. They won't spend 5 minutes learning their own local politics, let alone geopolitics. Unless he somehow manages to make it "bot-proof" (good luck with that, pal), it's not a real solution.

       For the most part, those on the right are for this - they yearn for a platform not manipulated by left leaning mods or obvious conservative whack jobs like fox or infowars. The left fears this because they think their opinion is the only right opinion and everything else is Nazi.

       It would just be votebotted by pro-corporate interests in order to create the illusion that their agenda (their hit pieces, their smear campaigns against people who oppose their policies, etc.) are "true" while data points that contradict that agenda would be labeled as "false."

       This would do more harm than good.

       Theres 2 ways on how this ends up... that Elon Musk brings awareness to otherwise swept-under-the-rug /inconvenient facts, therefore providing a beacon of info as someone like Wikileaks or Free Thought Project does...
Orrr we have the new generational cousin of Facebook Brigtbart and Infowars, meaner than his elders... with Peter Theil having some lose connection to it all!!

       Yes, but people will upvote and support it because it has "Elon Musk" in the title.

       Problem with this is that truth is not by committee.

       Something isn't not biased or truth based by how people perceives it, but if it's based in facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that reason it can't be decided by the majority of people but has to be vetted by informed and professionals.

       Sure, even only if he is able to actually write a technology that is actually bot proof and he is willing to open that and give it to facebook/twitter/etc...  that would be awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem right now is that the attack on the Media in general is way too exaggerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure news media has a ton of problems but we should stop blaming the mainstream media for everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake news started as fake facebook news, ad there should have stopped. Trump moved the post to the media and after two years everyone start to actually believe him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream media has problems, there is not denying it. And sure they need solution because the current model is not sustainable, but this attack doesn't help anyone other than people that actually fabricate fake news (real actual fake news not embellished, clickbait or poorly sourced).
      </p>
      <p>
       We still need a free open and indipendent media, and Musk crying because they are talking everytime Tesla has a little problem doesn't help. Sure it's not fair, but it's a consequence of Tesla own success, doesn't have anything to do with his conspiracy theory about the lack of advertisement.

       "Fake news" actually started as a talking point in a meeting on the weekend after Hillary lost the election. And then Trump turned that around to attack the mainstream news. Like most disingenuous attacks from the Hillary camp, it didn't work out the way they intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Elon's attack does show the hypocrisy of the media. If he was advertising they wouldn't be attacking as they wouldn't want to lose a big advertiser. So at the end of the day, the media serves, not the people they provide news to, but the people who pay them to advertise. Viewers and readers aren't the buyers, and they know that.

       That's just not true, Apple is a big advertiser and they do the same thing they do to Tesla.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every little problem with an apple product become big news while the same o similar problem with a smaller company isn't as hyped up. Sure, I don't deny that it's wrong and it does hurt his company, but it's a product of his own success not a conspiracy because he doesn't advertise.

       It goes both ways. What you have as proof that the coverage of Tesla accidents is because of his lack of advertisement ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apple stopped disclosing
       <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/apple-stopped-disclosing-ad-spend-2016-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">
        it's advertising expenses after a record 1.8 billions in 2015
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And still there were things like Bendgate and that Antennagate, all relatively small problems overblown for news because people were interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Samsung with it's
       <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-lg-marketing-budget-2016-761744/">
        10 billions $ in advertisement
       </a>
       wasn't immune to the Galaxy Note 7 that was painted in the media as "a bomb" so much that it was forbidden on planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like with Tesla, they are not making stuff up, but they are overblowing smaller problems to make clicks. It's a problem sure, it's fake not really but it's not true either and it should stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's keep to the facts, that advertisement budgets don't seem to stop the sensationalism

       You could definitely check where someone spend money and check their average reports "favorability" against other media were they don't directly advertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it might be very interesting to check for bias in advertisement based media one thing doesn't make the other one true. Removing actual disclosed promoted content.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, even if this report finds that yes they have a bias with more favorable coverage to companies that advertise. This doesn't mean they intentionally write unfavorable coverage to companies that don't.

       I just thought that there might be some papers about it already. Did a quick search, open a couple of them randomly and quickly scanned to the conclusion. Two of them had the conclusion that "some bias might be present but not enough to be considered significant" and one said "we didn't found any bias".

       Tesla and mostly Musk almost always have negative articles at any given time except during some kind of product launch or big event like SpaceX stuff. Yeah sure Tesla has been kinda doing shit lately with all the delays but everytime Musk breathes you'll get an article about how Tesla is about to fall apart.

       Was thinking about this the other day in relation to wiki... General consensus vs. objective reality.  Just because we agree on something doesn't necessarily make it fact.

       The problem is that in the current political system the government (and countless coalitions of special interest) posses the power to influence other peoples lives, and they strive to implement one single policy which applies to all citizens - conflicts and lies are inevitable in this environment.

       Ideally you shouldn't have to give a fuck if your neighbor is a democrat, a republican or a primitivist, because their choices would apply to their lives only. That's possible if the society is organized around voluntary institutions and respecting of property rights only - you can have your single-payer healthcare as long as it applies only to those who voluntarily join the program.

       Man I had this same idea except I wanted to start with politicians from federal to the local level, since no one really cares about the local guys, and circle back to journalists. Wanted to start a 501(c)3 to pay students in community service hours, targeting political science students, and other related majors.

       Lol asking the public to guage the truth of an article is a horrible disaster waiting to happen. Most people don’t care about the truth, they care about seeing their beliefs validated, whether they are factual or not. THAT’S why Trump was elected. That’s why he can screen fake news whenever caught in a lie, and get a pass from his base.

       How the fuck are the regular people supposed to know the truth of a news article? Isn’t that the whole reason they are reading news in the first place? This seems like it could make fake news worse.

       There is no method to keep fake votes out of it.

       Worse, someone in the company will end up putting Ads into the mix and then those will be monetarily tied to higher approval ratings which means that those companies will require their employees or paid voters to vote yes.

       The problem I see with this is this: We are in a world where people dont read news to be informed about the world around them. They read the news to confirm their opinions of the world around them. No ome checks facts, no one cross-references multiple articles on the same subject....
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be nothing but a news based social media site, where news people agree with will get upvoted, and news people disagree with get downvoted. Assuming there will be ways to sort the news by category, we will see interesting trends based on what stories gain popularity, but thats it. It would be a popularity contest and nothing more. A massive tug of war between the two seperate halves of america

       Hi, Elon. We're Reddit. I don't think we've met, because this site already does exactly what you are saying. Let's tell you how this plays out:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Create site - no one comes
       </li>
       <li>
        Site needs money - so to get people to come the founders pose as different people arguing
       </li>
       <li>
        What is truth? They ask themselves? Their own SJW liberal politics, so that is what they push for.
       </li>
       <li>
        People show up
       </li>
       <li>
        Ads show up
       </li>
       <li>
        Government shows up
       </li>
       <li>
        PR firms show up and start campaigning for politicians, movies, and hollywood actors to improve their reputations
       </li>
       <li>
        People upvote scary skelly and corgi dogs, and they downvote anything they don't want to hear about how there is no wage gap between men and women.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       BTW, they also upvote anything with your name in it, Elon Musk. Did I write Elon Musk yet? I think I may have forgotten to write Elon Musk.

       I wonder if these innovators with groundbreaking tech think before they go public about changing the world by changing the current system unwillingly against those who control it at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason we are still on the hydro-carbon model, and there's also a reason why central banks run everything still. I don't think they will just let Elon take away their society manipulating machines from them. This is risky to openly attempt imo.

        Problem  is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn  advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t  advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are  among world’s biggest advertisers.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the fossil fuel companies have deep pockets and contribute to many political campaigns in order to push whatever agenda they want. If politicians take money from campanies... they should be forced to wear the companies logo somewhere on their clothes for everyday they show up to work. Like Nascar meets the scarlet letter but at least give the public a chance to see where they get their $$$ from to get re/elected

       Doesn't matter. People think what they see on Fox, MSNBC, and CNN or read on Breitbart and HuffPost is true. On the whole society thinks the truth is anything that reinforces their belief.

       His part about how they sugarcoat the lie, just enough, is so spot on. The amount of things that are left out of reporting makes me sick. They all do it to whichever side the channel wants it to go. This is why the country is so divided right now. Neither side of the MSM tells the entire truth. It drives me crazy

       Mr. Musk is catching up to what I was saying ca. 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is room on the internet for anonymity and whistleblowing, but there also needs to be a central place where credibility can exist and where things you say cannot be taken back or censored by a government or corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it should be an independent non-profit organization operated by the most credible people in all of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone should be able to challenge everyone to a debate and there should be many forms of debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was originally presented via the ship board comm system in the novel Songs of Distant Earth by Arthur C. Clark.

      <p>
       Elon is stating the obvious here and getting max amplified, my life proves however then what happens to poor people with good ideas, they are completely ignored for 20 years then a rich person says the same thing and everyone loses their shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Aaron Schwartz was saying the same things ten years ago as well.

       I hate plutacracy, what a stupid form of government, it may be the end of the human race.  And many other races on many planets.

       Public voting to decide what is true? Sounds like a really bloody bad idea to me!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a lot of people believe something doesn't make it true, large groups can ,and have, been wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more, once enough people vote for the "truth" it is all that will show, so everyone else must go along as they will never see the other news.

       He truly believes that the media is targeting Tesla because they don't advertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes news media have a lot of problems, and clicks based news are a big problem, but in reality Tesla target is the same reason why a minor problem with an apple broduct makes the news while the same on a Lenovo wouldn't see the light of day.

       Reddit absolutely stops bots. I bet they ban tens of thousands a day, or prevent them from creating an account in the first place. If they didn't, the site would be completely filled with obvious spam, rather than reposts and clever attempts at making things go viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of bots that make it through the filters, but this place would be literally unusable if they weren't stopping the majority.
