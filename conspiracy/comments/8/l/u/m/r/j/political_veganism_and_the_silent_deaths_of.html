        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On an animal to animal basis, vegan-friendly food production kills more animals than the meat industry. Yet we never hear this from the well funded vegan groups out there. Why?</p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re a ground hog just minding your own business teaching your ground hog babies to forage. It&#39;s a sunny day, the dew drops are just drying from the foliage surrounding you, and life is great. You think you hear some thunder in the distance, is it going to rain? That would be nice. More rain means more delicious plants for you and your peaceful ground hog family to munch on. You happily turn around to munch on some leaves, and in a split second a vegan-friendly combine harvester comes barreling through your ground hog utopia and rips your furry little family to shreds. You still hear their screams from the churning blades as the harvest continues without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>Next to you is a new family of butterflies who are on the verge of being endangered due to the all the insecticides used to protect the vegan food supply, drying their wings in the sun so they can fly off and save their species. But that cold heartless heavy machinery supporting the vegan way of life does not care for butterflies, and with one rotation of its spinning blades those beautiful creatures are wiped out of existence. What must it be like for a ground hog to witness the vegan way of life as it actually appears in nature?</p>

<p>While the meat industry has adopted a standard of providing livestock a merciful end, there is no such accepted standard in vegan food production where the majority of animals killed by human food production actually die. Wild animals who have known freedom their whole life are drawn to vegan foods by their very nature and are killed on an industrial scale, and for what? Nobody is eating them. Their life isn&#39;t respected in the same way a hunter respects the animals he hunts and feeds his family. Their deaths don&#39;t provide a main source of funding to protect the ecosystem as hunting does. They aren&#39;t given the chance to feel no pain like the beef industry provides cattle. Nobody is talking about these victims of veganism. Vegans aren&#39;t pointing out that if more people ate hamburgers and less people ate grains, less animals would die unnecessary deaths. Why?</p>

<p>As a ground hog, if you could petition anyone in humanity, you might call on the vegans to save you. But what do you do when the vegans are the very ones promoting the industrial slaughter of your species, and countless other species as well? You might wonder why none of the vegan literature mentions this. You might question why out of all the protests vegans engage in, they never criticize the biggest source of human-caused animal deaths... the one thing they directly benefit from with each and every meal they eat. <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/3di2.jpg">You might even call it a conspiracy.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument here seems to be that since vegan food comes from crops, and animals are harmed when growing and harvesting crops, than the typical vegan is responsible for more deaths than the typical non-vegan.</p>

<p>What you seem to be ignoring however, is that the animals that the typical non-vegan is eating, were fed crops, so when someone eats animals, they are contributing not only to the death of that animal, but also all of the animals killed to produce the feed for that animal.</p>

<p>To make things worse, livestock animals only convert a tiny portion of the crops they eat into edible meat, so the typical meat-eater is actually responsible for many times more animals deaths from crop producing/harvesting than the typical vegan.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: we are currently using livestock animals as extremely inefficient machines where we input a lot of crops and they output a relatively small amount of meat. It uses far more crops to produce the meat for a typical meat-eater&#39;s meal than it does to produce a typical vegan&#39;s meal.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>animals that the typical non-vegan is eating, were fed crops</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When accounting for this, human grain eating still causes far more animal deaths than human meat eating. It also dictates what the livestock are fed since they&#39;re pretty much just fed whatever the vegan grain industry produces, often as a byproduct or even a waste product of that industry. As everyone knows, a cow can eat numerous other highly efficient plants which require less land or even graze on its own and doesn&#39;t involve heavy machinery slaughtering animals. A vegan, however, cannot. A vegan today requires high quality grains from an industry built on the wholesale slaughter of mother nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think that livestock animals are fed byproducts of the vegan food industry? </p>

<p>Does that mean that if there are no vegans, then we don&#39;t have any food to feed cows?</p>

<p>It would seem then, based on your logic, that we <em>need</em> vegans, or else everyone will have to eat crops, since there wouldn&#39;t be any food to feed livestock animals. But if that&#39;s the case, everyone would be vegan by default, since there would be no livestock animals, so then we <em>would</em> have vegan byproducts to feed the animals. hmm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are trying to say that animals are killed in the process of harvesting crops, and since vegans eat crops, they are responsible for killing <em>more</em> animals than typical meat-eaters.</p>

<p>However, that doesn&#39;t make sense, since animals are also killed in the process of harvesting the crops used for livestock feed -- and animals only turn a small portion of that into meat -- so it actually uses <em>more</em> crops to make a typical meal for a meat-eater than it does to make a typical vegan meal.</p>

<p>Luckily we don&#39;t have to speculate about this. Someone actually already did the calculations: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/E19aXLV.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/E19aXLV.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition, two things often go unmentioned, both unrepresented in that graph. First, some livestock like cows and sheep need protection, and there&#39;s one government agency in particular that kills thousands of predators every year, probably as a solid to the livestock industry special interests (our tax dollars at work). Here&#39;s some popular articles with links to studies and further info:</p>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-05-coyotes-doesnt-livestock-safer.html">https://phys.org/news/2017-05-coyotes-doesnt-livestock-safer.html</a>
<a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/wildlife-lethal-nonlethal-predator-control-hunting-evidence/">https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/wildlife-lethal-nonlethal-predator-control-hunting-evidence/</a>
<a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/sa_reports/sa_pdrs">https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/sa_reports/sa_pdrs</a></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t figured out if these numbers would significantly change the findings of that link you provided, but, still, this is a non-zero amount of killing. </p>

<p>Second, the livestock killed by predators is of morally relevant interest as well. It makes no sense to blame coyotes for the killing they do, of course, since they aren&#39;t moral agents, but humans are, and ranchers (etc) are bringing these animals into existence and situating them in such a way that they may be killed painfully from disease, inclement weather and predation, all to make profits on a product we don&#39;t even need. </p>
