        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have always been skeptical of authority and questioned the true nature of our reality and the more awake I have become, the more detached I have become from the system. I have trouble in conversations with &#39;normies&#39; because I&#39;m contantly reminded of how much control the system has over their mind. I have pretty much given up on trying to wake up friends and family because they can&#39;t escape their mental prison. I feel like I have unplugged from the matrix and can&#39;t go back. I have tried and sometimes wish I could but I can&#39;t. I know it&#39;s wrong and something in me will not let me submit to it. I know there are more of us now than ever but it&#39;s still hard being awake in this fucked up world. Anyways, keep up the good fight. Keep shredding light on these evil cowards and I will do the same.</p>

<p>&#39;Normies&#39; is a pretty accurate term for the phenomenon. If you ascribe negative connotations to it, that&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>To me it&#39;s a decidedly neutral term. I could be much nastier and arrogant if I wanted to.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t here to bash people who are so caught up in their own lives they don&#39;t see the bigger picture. That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s them.</p>

<p>However, it IS frustrating being around people like that when there is so much more going on, and a lot of it is pretty sinister.</p>

<p>It is basic etiquette.  Once you start name calling, your position weakens. In any discussion if your argument is strong you will not name call or use derogatory terms against your opponent. </p>

<p>If you are Woke, they are either asleep or Normals.  Normies is derogatory. And therefore make you look like an immature person lashing out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wake up the people around you...slowly, carefully and without an agenda. Be honest and sincere with them. Stop viewing them as substandard human beings. Some just don&#39;t know, others don&#39;t care. Focus on the ones that have been walking near the path their lives. Ignore the apathetic, as they, whether their awake or not, will want to be controlled. That&#39;s really what it boils down to anyway. The good see the suffering inflicted by government and media and want it to stop. The apathetic say, &quot;As long as it&#39;s not me who suffers. I&#39;m not convinced you&#39;re as awoke as you claim to be. You obviously view yourself as superior to others, but you are superior to no one. You have far to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue I have with this post is that you’re literally describing how you are so absorbed into an ideology you are struggling to have a simple connection to people. Just because people have a different perspective on the world doesn’t make them “asleep”.  I have gone down so many conspiracy rabbit holes I couldn’t possibly tell you. Some I have believe to be true and some have made me laugh out loud. I read these subs sometimes just for entertainment but even with all the books I’ve read and articles and videos watched, I still have a very grounded and restrained view on the world. I’ve had a taste of what you’re describing and what I experienced, in retrospect, was the ill effects of obsession. And honestly you’re probably driving your family crazy. You’re not smarter or more “right” and it’s so egotistical to believe that. You can believe you’re 100% right but to decide you have the answers and everyone else is naive is being “that guy”. </p>

<p>But at the end of the day, no matter <em>what</em> we all have a choice to either put energy into things that we can’t possibly control or taking life by the balls. </p>

<p>BYW - The detachment you feel is a normal feeling, it’s usually from obsession or addiction. It’s quite like when you walk into daylight after a long movie. </p>
