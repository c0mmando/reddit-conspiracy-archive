       I have always been skeptical of authority and questioned the true nature of our reality and the more awake I have become, the more detached I have become from the system. I have trouble in conversations with 'normies' because I'm contantly reminded of how much control the system has over their mind. I have pretty much given up on trying to wake up friends and family because they can't escape their mental prison. I feel like I have unplugged from the matrix and can't go back. I have tried and sometimes wish I could but I can't. I know it's wrong and something in me will not let me submit to it. I know there are more of us now than ever but it's still hard being awake in this fucked up world. Anyways, keep up the good fight. Keep shredding light on these evil cowards and I will do the same.

       I swear.. 4chan comes up with more of its own lingual than e40. I try to be open minded but if I were being honest with myself people who use this terminology lose credibility. I'm still willing to listen though but in my mind I'm rolling my eyes. I really do try to not let language derail the intended context of the message though. Just being honest.

       This is all by design. Quit using terms like "normies", you sound like an arrogant prick. If you believe that you are "awake", you perceive nothing. This world may seem black and white, but it is red all over.

       So I'm not sure why everyone is so triggered over the nerm 'normie' here, but you should know some people here don't shut down their faculties the moment they come across a word they don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Normies' is a pretty accurate term for the phenomenon. If you ascribe negative connotations to it, that's on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it's a decidedly neutral term. I could be much nastier and arrogant if I wanted to.

       Quite frankly, I think you miss the entire point of this post.

       We aren't here to bash people who are so caught up in their own lives they don't see the bigger picture. That's fine. That's them.

       However, it IS frustrating being around people like that when there is so much more going on, and a lot of it is pretty sinister.

       The words meaning has changed a few times but if you've been following 4chan for more than 5 years you would know that originally it meant someone who wasn't autistic or socially awkward.

       That's fine and all, but the fact that the OP originally used the term in quotes indicates to me that it was more of a "for lack of a better term" thing than a "let's bash the soccer moms" thing.

       Anyone making this post about the word usage is doing themselves and the discussion a disservice.

       I just made the comment that I don't like 4chan terminology spreading. Thst being said. My response to OP was a lot more than that. If fact I even asked OP a question to further talk about this subject thst he failed to answer. If you believe my denouncing of the word normie is trying to derail OPs thread than you obviously didn't read what I said to him originally.

       My latest is to remind them that all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men and women to do nothing.  They haven’t argued with that, but I leave it there. We have God and we can work with Him through prayer, hope and joy to endure until He does His thing.

       It is basic etiquette.  Once you start name calling, your position weakens. In any discussion if your argument is strong you will not name call or use derogatory terms against your opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are Woke, they are either asleep or Normals.  Normies is derogatory. And therefore make you look like an immature person lashing out.

       Wake up the people around you...slowly, carefully and without an agenda. Be honest and sincere with them. Stop viewing them as substandard human beings. Some just don't know, others don't care. Focus on the ones that have been walking near the path their lives. Ignore the apathetic, as they, whether their awake or not, will want to be controlled. That's really what it boils down to anyway. The good see the suffering inflicted by government and media and want it to stop. The apathetic say, "As long as it's not me who suffers. I'm not convinced you're as awoke as you claim to be. You obviously view yourself as superior to others, but you are superior to no one. You have far to go.

       The issue I have with this post is that you’re literally describing how you are so absorbed into an ideology you are struggling to have a simple connection to people. Just because people have a different perspective on the world doesn’t make them “asleep”.  I have gone down so many conspiracy rabbit holes I couldn’t possibly tell you. Some I have believe to be true and some have made me laugh out loud. I read these subs sometimes just for entertainment but even with all the books I’ve read and articles and videos watched, I still have a very grounded and restrained view on the world. I’ve had a taste of what you’re describing and what I experienced, in retrospect, was the ill effects of obsession. And honestly you’re probably driving your family crazy. You’re not smarter or more “right” and it’s so egotistical to believe that. You can believe you’re 100% right but to decide you have the answers and everyone else is naive is being “that guy”.
