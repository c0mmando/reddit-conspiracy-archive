        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This subject is brand new to me so here me out.</p>

<p>The word Beauchene can mean exploded. There is a scientific term called the Beauchene <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Beauchene-Skull/">Skull</a>.</p>

<p>Here is where is gets interesting. There is an island among the Falkland Islands, Beauchene  Island.</p>

<p>This island is said to have megaliths/pyramids located on the East <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T13aDF0WZuw&amp;amp;t=201s">Side</a>. The island is now about 90% blacked out on google <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@-52.90639415,-59.17822168,-2.10159541a,8564.65178354d,35y,11.18760079h,29.25566172t,0r/data=ClUaUxJLCiUweGJjMjk1NDMwMDEyYzY2NmY6MHg2Mjk1YzIxY2Y2MGQ0Mjg0GYfqnFVVdUrAIZmZmZmZmU3AKhBCZWF1Y2hlbmUgSXNsYW5kGAIgASgC">earth</a>. Wikipedia says the only abandoned settlements can be found on the West <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauchene_Island">Coast</a>. Also that the island is the southernmost of the Falklands, closest to Antarctica.</p>

<p>The same YouTuber made a second video where a photo was taken from the islands profile, East Coast, where you can see humanoid figures along the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zngGf3NwVFE">coastline</a>. I wonder if there is some correlation between the faces and the name. Could this be an island where human bodies were taken over by an alien body/black goo and thus they exploded once gestation was completed?</p>

<p>The icing on the cake is the Falklands War (1982) fought between the UK and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War">Argentina</a>. The islands are said to be purely nature reservations with no resources. Further research shows the was a Falklands <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_Crisis_(1770">Crisis</a>) (1770), between the UK and Spain.</p>

<p>So ask yourself this. Why would the UK go to war over territory with no natural resources to exploit in a completely different hemisphere?</p>

<p>The one theory is that acquiring the islands was good politics for a failing government of the time as a distraction. But I&#39;m not buying it. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The island is named after the French explorer. The island was known for seal trappers. Seal trappers would whack the baby seals in the head with a bat/club. This would explode their skull. The &quot;Beauchene Skull&quot; is a reference to this island &quot;of exploded skulls&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does everyone refer to the seal hunt as killing “baby” seals? Baby seals provide very little meat and very little blubber, the only benefit is their white fur which is still not very large. Adult seals are killed by the trappers and hunters, not baby seals. That is a myth that was perpetuated by Paul McCartney and his then wife about the seal hunt in Newfoundland&amp;Labrador and they are both terribly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I researched it and that&#39;s what the evidence suggests. I read somewhere the pups were the most prized, best quality to weight ratio. Makes sense. If you were in a land of seals and you wanted to maximize your profits, why start with the adults first? Trappers could care less about animal age or extinction unless their ass is on the line, they will pillage the land of everything they can (else a competitor will) baby seals and all. Probably why the island ran out of seals until the government could figure out how to regulate it by capturing their ships.</p>

<p>If you want to show me how this is a myth, go ahead I&#39;m waiting.</p>

<p>&quot;The British also sent commandos to raid secret German bases in the Falklands abd established their own Naval and ground presence in Antarctica to spy on German activity there. It may be no coincidence then that it was Britain that captured the bulk of the SS E-IV documentation not destroyed before evacuation.&quot;</p>

<p>My question is. All of this information comes from the WWII era. The Falkland Crisis was way before this time. How long has the UK known of whatever is going on around these islands?</p>
